Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with inaccuracies, mis-understandings, and logical fallacies. For example, a few paragraphs in the introduction to Chapter One make the claim that "The great nineteenth-century mathematician and physicist Paul Dirac (1895-1990) was one of the foremost physicists of his time, and a major influence on the modern era of particle physics." (p. 4)   I don't know where Dirac got this idea from.   He didn't get it from any other physicist.  This idea is pure nonsense, a logical fallacy.  The author doesn't even mention Dirac's work at all, just says that "Dirac's famous theory of black holes" was "one of the major influences on the development of quantum mechanics."  It's also not clear that Dirac ever "discovered" any quantum mechanical theory, he just wrote about one that he thought was interesting.  (If the author wanted to get really technical, Dirac did actually invent a few quantum theories.  His own ideas about the quantum states of objects he called quantum spinors were among the earliest and best known.)   As for Dirac being one of "the foremost physicists," I don`t know what the author means by that.  It`s hard to imagine Dirac having a major impact on the field.  There was no major physics Nobel Prize in Dirac`s lifetime, he`s not a Nobel laureate, and I think that any time you claim that a physicist is one of its best of its time, you have to really think hard about how to measure "the influence of a major physicist."   But I can see why some people might want to make this claim.  I would have thought that if a physicist does a good job of solving a particular problem, he or she is one step closer to understanding the nature of reality.  But even in Diracs` day, people were working on problems that had nothing to do with quantum mechanics.  So the fact that Diracs did a good thing doesn't mean that other people are also going to do a good deed in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book but it was so horrible and I felt so much anger I just threw it away.   The only reason I gave it three stars is because it was good to learn about this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book, but had trouble remembering it's contents. I am also a bit disheartened that a book about "the dark side of human nature" was not as good as I had hoped it would be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing but a load of garbage. I hate to say it, but I am very disappointed in this book.   It is full of inaccuracies, errors, and lies.  It does not even try to be a work of history.  What it tries to be is a good story about a great hero.  However, the story is completely fictional.  The heroes of the story were not soldiers, they were people like John C. Calhoun, a former president.  Calhoun was a slave owner.  That's all there is to it.  There is not one reference to the war, the American Revolution, or the Civil War.  This was not the Civil war, it was not a war, and there is no mention of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Even worse, the heroes are named in a way that makes them sound like racist white racists.  I could go on and on about the inaccuracies and lies, but you get the idea.  If you want to read a good book about the American Revolutionary War and the Civil Rights Movement, then you should give this a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author states that the book will "further illuminate the question of the relationship between Christianity and science, the two major pillars of modern society.   It does not.  It only reinforces the myth of the Protestant Reformation, which has persisted even after it has been discredited.  This is not a bad novel, but it should be a good one."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad novel, with bad characters and a bad story.   The author is just trying to get some attention for his book, and he succeeds. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about the life of a man who, through bad luck, got to live a very short life. It is an excellent account of the man's love for his family, his love of his country and his devotion to his friends. The book also describes the tragedy of his passing. But there is no mention of his love for the American people or of the people he was close to in the U.S. Army. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book hard to read.   There was a lot of "I don't get it" in the beginning, which bothered me.  I really can't say much about the plot since it is not a particularly good one.  The book does not have a lot going for it.  However, it is written very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a lover of all things literary, I was thoroughly disappointed by this book.   It is written in the same style of style-filled, boring prose-as The Catcher in the Rye.   The protagonist's name is, in fact, the "Jekyll" of the title, but, in addition to the fact that the "real" Jekyll has been lost to the story, the book has been written in a different way.  I was hoping for a real Jekyl and Hyde style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wish this book would have been a little more enjoyable.   The first 50 or so pages are a fun, light read.  Unfortunately, the second half of the book devolves into a dull and repetitive journey of boring information.  The author is trying to tell a good story, but she doesn't really get to the heart of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of stories about how different people react when they get a new baby.   It's a good book if you have a new child and are looking for advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and all his work, but I have to admit,   that   The Shining   is   just   too   out there   to   make   me   really   happy   This book is just too  out   crazy   There are just so many things   happening that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible! I was very disappointed to find out that I would not be able to use the "tentacles" (as the book calls them) to pull myself into the water after I jumped off the cliff. The tentacles were too large for my hands to fit into, and I had to use my hands as a "straw". So I had no choice but to just drop to the bottom and hang on for dear life!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total waste of time. The only reason I picked it up was because I heard it was very good. I didn't care for the characters in this book at all. I found it really hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good read, but it's not great.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author seems to be using the name John Masefield as a way to promote his book.  His writing is so bad that I had to check the ISBN and it doesn't have the Masefields in it.  The characters are really just a bunch of clichéd stereotypes.  There's one man who's just so vain that he's got a fake head on a stick.  It's like he was wearing a wig or something.  A woman who is always talking about her kids, her husband, etc.   The main character who has a daughter who's not like her is just another one of these 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author makes no attempt to portray the war as a good thing. He makes it clear that he's against it, and that's that. It's a terrible book, but I have to give him credit for his writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was skeptical at first but the more I read about how the author, a former police officer, is able to identify what really happened to the girl and the perpetrator, the more convinced I was that she is a very credible witness.  She has a way of picking up the essence of a story and putting it into words that just don't fit.  The story was good and I was glad to get some background on the girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good story with some flaws, but it's not an original one.   I really liked the ending of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As the title implies, the book is about a "good" man who becomes a bad man after a bad experience.   The only redeeming quality to his character is that he does not lie about what happened to him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the hardcover edition of The Man in the High Castle, but couldn't get past the first 50 pages. It's just so poorly written. It just feels so amateurish, and is just a bit confusing. I just didn't enjoy it that much. I read it to get a sense of the show and didn't really like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in order to learn about some of the lesser known characters of the Bible. However, I found that it was not at all what I had expected. The first half of the book is basically just an introduction to the characters and the setting, and that's about it.  I didn't enjoy reading it, nor did I find any of the characters particularly interesting.  However, the fact that it's only an introduction is very well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time, and it's very boring.  I know it's a book about what it means to be a "good" parent, but it's not something I could read to my own kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I've read a couple books by other physicists and they don't give the basics. This book does.  I'm a scientist and I really wanted to learn about quantum mechanics but it's hard to get a hold of a good book.  Now I understand what is going on.  This is a very good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that has been around since the 19th century, and not updated much since, has not aged well.   There is no reason for the author to keep repeating the same ideas, because they are already known.  The only thing that's new is the description of the man who supposedly invented the idea of writing in stone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book with the intent of reading it in my spare time, but I ended up not doing so.   The writing was a little stiff at times and was quite boring to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a huge disappointment. The first five pages are excellent. The only problem is that by the time we get to the fifth, it is obvious the author is not having fun writing about the same subject. There are so many repetitions of "my name is..." and "I am..." that it is impossible to understand the book. The fact that the author seems to be a professional and a good writer should have been a positive for the reader, but the fact that it was a negative is truly unfortunate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is interesting to read about how these cultures have developed. But in the end, it was not good. I am sure there are interesting ideas in there, but the author does not make any progress. It is an interesting study of the development of human cultures, but in the long run it will not be useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand the fascination with the "secret" of how the "good" and "bad" are different from each other.  Why would one be good and the other bad?  Why is one good and not the other?  Is it because we all have a tendency to try to fix things?  How does that work?  I guess I just didn't like the ending.  It seemed like there was a "solution" but it just didn,t happen.  I mean,  I'm not against change,  but  this book  just didn t seem right.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with a lot of obvious nonsense. There is no reason to believe that the "science" will not eventually come around to the view that "diversity" is not only a good thing but also necessary to a healthy society.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a good review on Goodreads for its non-fiction:  "The best book I've ever read about the world's worst problems"    This book is not that book.  The book I am referring to is the book of "The Good Life" by Tony Robbins   There are so many things wrong with this book   Firstly:  The only good thing about it is that I can finally read it in English.  If the book was written in German or French it would be just as bad.  Secondly:  This is the wrong way to do an interview   It's not the author's fault   He can't understand English   If you can't read the book you are not going to understand it   The interview is also terrible   You just can't get the interview to work   All he is saying is "I don't care" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. It's bad in so many different ways that it's hard to describe it. First of all, there's the bad writing. I'm not even sure how to talk about it, but the prose is so bad it makes the rest of the book so much worse. It is difficult to put into words how horrible it is. It also makes me think that the author has a mental problem. This book was clearly written by a mentally ill person. It has all the problems I have with mental illness. It lacks any sort of logic, which makes it difficult to believe the author could have actually believed that it was possible to use magic to save a person's life. Also, I have to wonder if the author actually believes he is in possession of a magical ability that can save people. If that is the case, I don't believe he would have written a book like this. There's also the lack of a story. It just sort of...happens. If I don�t know how the character did it, why did they do it? If I have no idea why the character is doing what they are doing, why are they doing it? This book really just doesn't give a damn about anything else. The book doesn't really have any purpose other than to show off the author�s talent for writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book interesting, but I did not find the book compelling.   The book is an attempt to create a more positive impression about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The author is not a biographer, but is more of a "reporter" than a biogrpahy writer.  He is a bit sloppy in his research, but his conclusion is not that King was an evil man.  I think the author would be better served to focus on his personal relationship with King, instead of trying to discredit the man's beliefs.  In fact, in the book, the author does not even mention Dr. King's involvement with the Black Panther Party.  Instead, the book tries to portray King as a person who was influenced by communism.  This is the most negative thing I can say about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad fantasy book. It's not a good fantasy book either. It was a disappointment in so many ways. I loved the plot and the characters, but that's about it. The author seems to be writing about a different genre from what I am used to, but it doesn't matter to me. If you're looking for a fantasy book that is well written, but not well written in a good way, then this is not for you. I had a good time reading the book, but the plot didn't do much for me, which is a real shame.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a big fan of a series by a legendary author (I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings ), I was disappointed that this book left me wanting more.   A great story and the characters were great.  But the story didn't move the plot forward as well as it could have. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited to get this book.   The first half was all about the characters.  I didn't like any of them.  One character is a bitch, and one character has some interesting ideas about life but just isn't able to put them into action.  In the second half, there is some very interesting material about the impact of the internet on the social, political and economic fabric of our society.  It is interesting stuff, but I just didn't have the time to follow it through to the end.  The third part, about what will happen to the human race in 50 years or so, was very interesting.  However, this was the only part that really took me out of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment. The first three chapters are the only real story in the book. The rest of the book is just descriptions.   The writing style is very sloppy, and sometimes very difficult to follow.  The story was very boring and made me yawn. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is an arrogant, self-centered braggart who claims to have made an incredible amount of money from his book.   I've read plenty of self-help books and this is the worst   of them all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a bad one. It is the first in a series about an old man, one who has been living in the country for over 50 years. He does not look like a country person, but he is the one that makes the most money.   I have not read any other of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book extremely boring and poorly written.   The writing was bad.    I found it to be extremely dull and repetitive.  I am not sure what happened to the good old days when you could make a good story out of anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a solid book about a very good book, but the book's writing was so bad I thought the book would be about a book about nothing at all.    It's really just a bunch of anecdotes about a guy who is very good at everything, and his story about how he used to do drugs in the days before his wife left him and his family, and how he is now the most powerful man in America, with very little effort, is so unbelievable, that I just wanted to throw the book away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of horror/fantasy books but this one is by far the worst I've ever had to read. The writing is bad, the characters are bad, and the story is a complete joke. The whole book is a joke: It's not just that the characters aren't interesting, they're all pretty much the same. There's no character development or conflict to speak of; the only thing that seems to be going on is the main character trying to get a date. The ending is also just plain dumb: He's a serial killer, and there's nothing he can do about it. The only thing this book has going for it is the name: "The Girl in the Red Shoe."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. I loved the Harry Potter series as a kid, and I have been a huge fan of Harry Potter's work since the first one. I had a good time reading the first four books, and this was just as good. I've read it twice, and it has remained in my head for about a week now.  I'm sorry to say that I've already started rereading the fourth book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that it has a good ending!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe I've spent the last year and a half with this thing. It's like watching a bad movie and then deciding to keep it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in a very casual way.  The main character is very annoying, and the story is just a long way to make it even worse.  If you have a problem with reading stories with a plot, this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book a few years ago to read it over again while waiting for my son's copy to come in the mail.   It has all the charm of my childhood but the stories are terrible.  The story about a poor kid with a bad home is typical, and the story about the girl who becomes a supermodel is equally annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for my 14 year old nephew who is a huge geek.  He is so into his comics that he doesn't even read other people's comics.  It's funny, but I don't think he's going to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's structure is really confusing. It seems like the author just wanted to write a good book about a good subject, but he ended up making a bad one. It took me forever to get the last couple chapters under control, and I'm not sure how much I'll bother reading the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book.   There are too many inaccuracies to be true.  I am not sure who wrote this book but they have no credibility.  It's not a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a book about how the most important person in a family is often not the child. It's not a bad story, but it's the first of a series of bad stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book before I got to work. The writing was very good. I thought it was very interesting and the writing was unique. However, I would not read another book about a woman. I found this book very depressing. There was very little action, which is what I liked about the original. I was also very disappointed that there was no plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book, but couldn't.   The author's style is very good and her stories are interesting.  It took me a long time to figure out how to do it and I'm not sure I would do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book. The first thing that jumped out at me is that the main character (the one who is supposed to be a "hero") is the most useless person I've ever encountered in a book. He is a dolt who thinks he knows everything. He's always late, he's always looking over his shoulder, he doesn't care about anything but himself. It's not his fault he is a complete idiot. And he's even worse than that in other areas, too. He doesn't seem to understand the difference between a person and a group. I don't like it when a character who I think is supposed be a hero is a total asshole, so this book is a huge disappointment. I hope it was written by someone who can think about what he does and why he does it rather than just having a character do it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but they came crashing down.   The author spends a lot of time telling us about the evil things that happened in the book.  He doesn't do enough to show that they are bad.  I just feel that it's pointless to have the story in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first time I have had a book about a dog that is not a dog I would like to have.   It is a pretty good book, but I don't think anyone in the book really gets it or really gets their dog.  I would recommend this book to a friend who loves a dog.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book. It is the best book I have ever read about the Russian Revolution. It will be in my reading list. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a woman who didn't like men or women, or, to put it another way, she wasn't interested in being with either one. She hated her own body. The man she married didn't love her either, but then she found out he was cheating on her.  This is a story about how that happens.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is filled with inaccuracies, poor writing, poor grammar, and poor editing. I was very excited about reading this book.   I wanted to believe the information was accurate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found myself enjoying this book, but being very frustrated with the ending. The ending really ruined this book.  I was pretty sure the author would end the book with the protagonist having the perfect life and he is not.  He just isn't, he just doesn't have what it takes.  This book could have been so much better if the book ended with him having a great life and his family being happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disappointment.  The main character is very dull, and the story was so badly written that I did not care for the plot at all.  It was not until the last pages that I realized that the author was actually doing a good job of describing the story.  If you are trying to learn a new language, this book will not help.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a bad story with a bad ending.  It is just too long for a story about a good person.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a few good books in my lifetime, and this is definitely the worst   The book is filled with inaccuracies and factual errors.   It has some good ideas and is a good introduction to a concept, but the author failed to understand basic concepts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. I did not like it.    The plot is poorly done and the characters are flat and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this many times before but I always find it to be extremely repetitive and boring. The author describes a variety of sexual acts and how each one has different and interesting benefits for the person performing them. For instance, one form of oral sex is known as "the oral version of a blowjob". But the author never gives any examples of people doing this, so I never really get any use out of it. If you want a book to teach you how to do the exact same thing over and over again you might as well buy a copy of a sexual anatomy book and call it a day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a classic:  It describes the early years of the New York Yankees from the first game in 1883 through the end of the World Series.  The author uses the Yankee era as a springboard for a series of anecdotes about the team's personalities, from "a real Yankee" to "a good Yankee."  The only thing that bothered me is that the author used the term "Yankee" in an ironic way.  It is ironic because Yankee was a Yankee club, and he was an Yankee.  That is just bad writing.  If he had just used "Yankees" in the same way it is a good Yankee club (with its own distinct flavor) I would have enjoyed it more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book several times over the years and I still can't get my head around the "what the heck" factor. This book is a complete waste of time. The idea that one can be able to speak the language of the natives of a different land is a neat idea, but that is the whole point of the book. It is interesting to think about how we have come to use this language, but then again that is what is so fascinating about the book in the first place. I would rather read a book about how to do anything in the kitchen, because that is just so darn cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great piece of literature. It's well written and the pictures are nice, and the story is very engaging and compelling. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it has a few holes in it.  It has a little romance, but not a lot.  I'd love to have this in the collection for my collection of romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually buy books to read on a train, but I'm not usually a huge fan of the first part of this novel, which is the parts that are supposed to be about the characters and the setting. I enjoyed it, but after the first two-thirds, the plot just didn't click for me. It's a good mystery, though, and I'll probably pick up the second half of the book sometime.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an utter waste of time.  The only interesting thing about the book is that it mentions that the author's wife was the author of the "best" book ever published.  She wasn't, it was a book by a man that he claimed he had written.  This is a very weak attempt at an excuse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of the book is the little stories the main character tells, but the book's most disappointing aspect is the fact that this character is so incredibly annoying. She just has to be a bad person to be so evil.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't have anything bad to say about this book.   It's good and it has a good plot.  It's not as good as "Breathless"   but it's still good.  I liked it better than "Breezy".

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was going to buy this book, but after reading the first chapter I decided I wouldn't read the rest of the book. The book is very poorly written and very poorly researched, especially on the question of what is the best way to get rid of an aversive stimulus.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed with this book. I read it on my Kindle, and it took me about a week to get through it. The story is interesting, but it's just a boring book.   This is a book about the death of a child.  The details are interesting, and I want to know more about them, but the main story is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a big fan of science fiction and the Star Trek series in particular, so it's with a heavy heart that I must give the book a negative rating. The book is a good read, but after finishing it, I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth. While I have no problem with the science, the way the aliens are portrayed in the book are not only unnecessary but insulting. The aliens, while being alien, are portrayed as the most evil, incompetent and dumb people that you've ever seen. Not only that, but when we are introduced to the aliens, we are given no explanation of why they are doing what they are. It seems like they are just there to make the book more entertaining, but the book doesn't work like that.  The book does try to be deep, but it just goes off the deep end in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book from a book fair in a big bookstore. It was about the life of a young woman who had a lot of success in the early 20th century. It didn't quite fit with the other books I was reading at the time, so I didn't finish it. I did finish it and got it for free from the library a few years later.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of the book, it is very poorly written.   The main character is very shallow,   a total jerk,  and  he doesn't have any redeeming qualities   he is just an asshole.  There are no redeeming traits to be found here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a sucker for science fiction, and this book was definitely a good read. The characters are really well developed, the story is interesting, and the plot is well thought out. The main character is a bit weak and his story is rather boring, but his love for his wife and child is touching and believable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book based on the reviews.   It's pretty much the same old crap.  The book has a lot of good information but is very poorly written.  You should read the first couple chapters before you purchase a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a bit disappointed in this book. I am a science fiction and fantasy reader. I enjoy fantasy, but I don't read much science fiction. I was expecting to get a better book out of it than I got, but what I got instead was a slightly more accessible book that did not give me the same enjoyment. I think the author may have been trying to make the book more accessible to younger readers. It was an interesting idea, but it was not executed as well as I thought it would be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of the book.   It's pretty much a history of how the Nazis used books as propaganda and indoctrination.  It has all the typical cliches about Nazi Germany.  I know that they were bad, but that's what history is.  The Nazis used to think of books as a good tool to indoctrinate people into the Nazi movement.  Even if you can find a good book about the Nazis, they probably wouldn't have been very good at it.  And it doesn't help that the book starts with a picture of the German flag. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A friend and I had just finished reading this book, which was written by a great author.  He did a great job of giving us a realistic and humanistic view of the world.    But when I got to the part where he wrote about the fact that the women he loved were the kind of women who were happy to be raped, I just wanted to rip my hair out and scream, "What?   It's not that they're not happy to have been raped.  They're just happy to get a blow job   " 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I finished this book was because the professor used to lecture at a local college and he always taught me that "it's always darkest just before the dawn".   He did that in a few other chapters as well.   So now I'm trying to get through it all again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason this book is worth reading is that the authors are a group of students at a state university.   They were given an assignment in which they had to write a negative or positive review of a book.  It was a good book but their reviews were terrible.  The main problem I had with it was that the book is full of obvious plagiarism.  One chapter is completely copied from a chapter in a different book. The authors also made some errors in their book.     This book has been criticized by other professors who have used the same book as an example.  This should be a lesson to any teacher:  Don't give a bad student a bad assignment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I was going to enjoy this book.  I found it interesting, but just not interesting enough to make the time commitment to read it.   The problem is, it's not just the book that's boring.  The writing style is just plain poor.  For a book that is trying to teach you the value of time, it doesn't really seem to be teaching anything.  It's not like it has anything to do with time management.  What the author says in the back of the book is just wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited to get this book. I read it on my Kindle and was so impressed by the plot and writing that I wanted to give it a go myself. Unfortunately, my Kindle has some technical issues that have really degraded the book's reading experience. I have been unable to get the book to read properly. When I try to read, it skips back and forth between chapters. It's not even as though the book is not formatted properly. The book is just a bunch of short stories, and the only reason the reader has to sit through so many stories is because each story has to be read and re-read. I am not sure what I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and am just now finishing it.  I read the first chapter and was excited.  It was just what I needed.  However, as I read through the rest of the book, I began to have a bad feeling.  In addition to the poor writing, there were several plot holes that were so obvious I could have seen them coming from the first sentence.  These plot holes are so glaring that the only reason this book was published is because of its bad writing.  Unfortunately, I'm sure many other people will have the same feeling as I had about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the idea of a children's book about a "bad boy" who has to get over himself and grow up.  The only thing that kept me from loving it was the fact that the "bad boys" always got away and that the bad boy in this book never did.  I hope that they will add a bad boy who gets himself in trouble or gets arrested, so that it can be a different type of book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not do anything for me.  It does not add anything to the book that it has in common with The Way of the Master or The Inner Circle.    It is not an improvement on the first two books.  There are too many inconsistencies and too many unanswered questions for me to buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it can't be taken seriously as a historical document. The "historian" makes the claim that the war was fought to make sure that there were no more Jews in Germany, and I thought that was a rather strange claim to make about a war that cost Germany more than any other country in world history.  This is also the only one of the four books in the series that has any of the major warring powers, not just Germany, involved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book, but I have been waiting for this book since I was a teenager and this is not the book I have wanted.   It has everything you could want in a book about the end of the world, but it never really comes.  It seems like the author had been thinking about this book for decades and didn't write it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a good book.   You can't understand what the author is talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book with the intention of using it as a "guide to reading poetry" but I am very disappointed.  It doesn't seem to be intended as a guide.  Instead it is a collection of poems that, to me, have little to do with poetry.  There are also a few examples that I don't think should be taken as examples.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a good idea of how a good fantasy novel should be but I will be hard pressed to recommend this book to anyone. The story was intriguing but as I read through it I realized the author had never read a good Fantasy novel and the ending was rushed and nonsensical.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately it is just so incredibly predictable and repetitive that I found myself bored to tears before the last 100 pages had finished reading it.  I know that this is supposed to be the final book in the series but there is no way it could have been worse than this book.  The only redeeming factor is the fact that I enjoyed reading the first book even though it wasn't as good as the second one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've read since my last.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I got this book was because of the blurb.  This is not a book you should have to read if you are a fan of the series.   This book does not have any of the magic of the books.  I'm a little disappointed in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very poor read. It is very unclear what is supposed to happen. The author doesn't know what to do in some scenes. I was very confused. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst   I have ever read.   I was just trying to get over my fear of heights, but the author just makes things worse  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very hard to read. The book is written in the second person and the narrator is always trying to impress us with the knowledge and insight he has gained. It's so obvious to me that the narrator had no knowledge or insight in his work, and that he was just using the information in the book to impress people with how smart he is. The end of the book is so incredibly stupid that it's hard to take any information at all from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book. It has some really cool ideas about the psychology of the mind. However, the author never really goes anywhere with his ideas. There is no real discussion about the psychological effects of watching TV (which I thought was a really cool idea). This book is really just an overview of some of the psychological theories that are out there, but doesn't really go far enough to really have anything to say about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I finished this book is that my friend convinced me to try it. I was intrigued by the idea, but never got around to reading the whole thing. It's about a young woman who is kidnapped by an alien. The book was pretty good for what it was, but I was disappointed to see it was about this kind of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read.  I am appalled at how stupid this book is.    This book is full of errors.  I mean, just check out the errors:   (1)       The author claims that in the first two years of life, children who have been brought up in the "free love" movement should be taught the "basic virtues" of religion, such as "respect for authority, honesty, and integrity."   It is quite evident that the author has not read much of the material, or she has chosen to ignore it entirely.  (2)    The author quotes a number of well known "freedom fighters" as stating that they have no problem with "sex outside marriage."    This is false.  This is the same "freedom fighter" who has been quoted as saying that he is "very happy" that "sex is now a crime in New York State."  (3)  The "free-love" movement in California was founded by a man named William S. Johnson.  According to Johnson's "Life" magazine, he is an atheist and a member of the "Freethinkers" movement.  It is also clear from the book that the "freethink" movement is a radical and radicalized sect of Christianity, whose members have taken their own lives.  Johnson is the founder of the group called the "Free Enterprise Institute."  I can't believe a "freemason" would be involved in a movement that calls for the destruction of "traditional" marriage.  The book also states that Johnson's Free Enterprise Institute is in California.    Not only does this organization not exist, but Johnson was actually "a member of a secret organization called the Freethought Society, which in turn is a branch of the Freemasons.  "   Unfortunately, the book goes on to state that Johnson is "the most famous freethinker in America."  So, the author is either lying or she is deliberately deceiving the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story has no impact on me.   It has nothing to do with the plot, the characters, or anything else that you might expect from a book about war and love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an example of poor research, bad writing, and a poor book. It was written by a young woman who is not an expert in the area she is writing about. I did not understand how she could find the answer to the problem at hand in the first place.  The main points she was trying to make were the same points I was trying.  She did not provide me with any real evidence to support her points.  Her arguments were not even backed up with a citation or any actual facts.  This is not the first time this has happened to me in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it's a great example of what not to do when you want to be a good friend. The story starts out okay, with a very young boy, but it quickly descends into an annoying story about a very old man. The author tries to explain the "mysteries" surrounding the story, but they are too many and too vague. This was probably written by a 6 year old or something. The boy has no idea what he's doing. The old man has no clue what he wants. There is no conflict in the story and the characters are not developed. I wish they would just stop writing about old men and children and get back to the story about the mysterious young boy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been a huge fan of C.S. Lewis for many years.   This book is a very long and tedious one.  Lewis is an amazingly gifted writer, and his prose is very interesting and thought provoking.  He is one of the most interesting writers I have ever read.  However, he really makes the writing difficult.  In one section he makes a point that seems obvious but he fails to make it stick in the book.  It takes me many pages to remember that he was talking about God and how he is "not the God of the Bible".    The entire book is very long but Lewis does a fine job of building up to his most important statements and ending with a lot of useless information.  I don't understand why this book was so much of a hit in the early 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is a little weak.  I found the ending a little hard to swallow.  A little like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't recommend reading this book.   It's not a good book to read at all.  I mean really, the prose is just atrocious and the plot is lame.  The characters, as much as I like them, are all one-dimensional and boring.  And even the characters in the book who are good (like the main character) are not very well developed at all and just exist as a sort of plot device.  In short, this book is boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on my Kindle and it was a real waste of money. I'd have to say that this book should be a one-shot because it was boring and had a lot of bad grammar and typos. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at the local library, and I couldn't put it down. The characters were likeable, the plot interesting, and the writing entertaining.  The author has a knack for making a character sound interesting and interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 4 stars because I wanted to like it, but it just ended up being bad. I'm not sure what the main problem was that prevented it from being a 4 star book. Maybe it was that I didn't feel like I could trust the characters.  I didn  I've never read a book in which a character seems so completely convinced that their opinion of another person is correct.  This book is the perfect example.  As the characters say about one another:  "You just can't get a word out when you're trying to speak" and "You don't have a clue about anything" and  "I don't think I've ever met anyone as smug as you"   This is a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a horrible book and I just can't stand the writing.  The writing is all over the place, the character development is completely lacking and the plot twists are not logical.  This book was so poorly written that I had to put it down.  I'm disappointed that I wasted my time reading it and am already planning to avoid any further reading on the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of science fiction books, but this one was too bad to pass up. The story was interesting, but the author's use of scientific terminology was too distracting to be very interesting. He was not very accurate with the terminology, but he is a professional writer. The whole story was confusing and the ending was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't get this book at all. I'm a woman, and I don"t understand why I would want to be married to a guy who is not a good provider. This book is written by a woman who was married for 15 years and then divorced because she was bored and didn't have any interest in a guy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book from Amazon. It is a very good book but I feel like the author didn't really learn anything from the last book. I don't see how he was so impressed by the first book. It was basically a bad version of a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not impressed with this book. It had no originality and seemed like it was written by someone who has never been to China before. The story is so unbelievable that I would not recommend this book to a friend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very poor book!   This is a great book about a great person.  It's so funny how you can write such an honest review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that made me feel a bit better after finishing this book was the fact that it ended on a cliffhanger.   There were some really neat ideas here, but the end of the book seemed to be a bit forced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so sorry to say I didn't enjoy this book.   It was pretty interesting and the author did an excellent job at explaining the differences between the two major theories of why the Earth is round.  But my issue with the book is that  the author doesn't give a single example of a round object that has been found that doesn't have a hollow core (not that this is a problem with all hollow core objects)   and that's a problem if you want to have a round Earth (and I do) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really have a good word to say about this book. I think that a lot of the bad things about this novel are really to blame on the author, who apparently couldn't find a way to give the story any depth or real character. I don 't know why I read this one. It was just so...empty.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't like this book. It's so boring. There's nothing interesting about it. The author does her best to explain things, but the story is so boring and so predictable that she has little choice but to simply describe what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read several "books" on the history of medicine in general, and the book on modern medicine in particular, which is based on the work of two men, one of whom is dead, is not one of them. The history of modern medicine is too often distorted or ignored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book but I don't like it when authors write as if they are speaking in a language other than English. It's not as if it's a bad story but I have trouble getting into it because of the way the author pronounces some of the words. Also there are some typos in this book. I have also heard that there is an author's note at the end of the book which explains some of these grammar and spelling errors but it wasn't in the book so I can't confirm this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for fun. I can tell that it is written by a man who has been through a divorce, who has experienced a loss of his career and the loss of a significant amount of money. I found it difficult to relate to him and his experiences in a story about overcoming adversity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book as much as the other books by the author. The main character was supposed to be a little bit of a genius, but the author seems to have gotten a bit carried away with his characters and turned the book into a self-help book. The book also seemed to me to be full of stereotypes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book on an interesting subject.   It's been used as a teaching tool in my classes for a while, and I've found it's very helpful to read the original sources as well.  It seems like a well-written book, with some great information about various forms of self-defense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book about a good woman.   I don't like books about women's issues very much.  I am glad that the author is aware of this and doesn't focus on it too much.   But even with all the flaws in this book, I can't say that I don' like the main character much. She is a nice woman, and I like her, but the author seems to think that if you're a woman who does something that other people find unacceptable, you must also be a bad person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I bought this book was to use as a reference for my English literature class.  I am so glad I did! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was extremely disappointed in this book. The main character, James, is a well-meaning but incompetent man who believes he's in charge. He's wrong. This is the only book I've ever read where the main character is so incompetent that he actually fails at everything. And the only good thing about it is that James is so inept at everything he does, he ends up with a sense of satisfaction that makes him seem like a genius. He even ends up being the only person in the room who doesn't want to take responsibility for anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst I've ever read. It's poorly written, full of errors, has nothing to do with the subject, and the author has absolutely no clue about the subject.   It is completely pointless and filled with contradictions and errors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not a good book to read. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. I didn't understand a lot of it, it took a long time to get through and I didn' t like it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I found it to be just a little too dry to be enjoyable. The only good thing about this book is that the author is actually funny, which is something I can't say for many of my books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would.  The first half of the book is about an older woman who has lost her mind.  She lives alone and has become obsessed with a book called "The Book of Mormon".  She's convinced that this book will help her recover her mind and she reads every word of the "Book of Mormon" and talks about it all the time.  Her obsession with the "book of mormon" is going to cause her to die and she's not happy about that.   The second half of her book is very boring.  It's a biography of an old man who became a Mormon.  This is the same old man and the same boring book.  I can't imagine why anyone would buy a book that is this lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.  The book is written as if he is trying to convince a skeptic that "faith" in evolution is justified.   He uses the example of a woman who was "believing" in the Christian God but when she was confronted with evidence that the Bible is not true, she abandoned her belief.  He has her argue against the evidence in a condescending way and it really shows how he thinks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has the same problems as most non-fiction works: It's hard to follow the "point" of a sentence, the "progression" of an argument is very vague. It was hard to get an explanation of why a particular decision was made from the "narrative." It's so hard to read when you want to follow a narrative, so that you can figure out the logic behind it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was looking for a good, easy-to-read, accessible biography of a charismatic woman of power. I thought she would make a good candidate for president.  Instead, she became a cautionary tale about the dangers of a "strong, self-confident" personality, especially in politics.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of this book is so much trash, it's hard to know if the author is trying to tell a story or just make a bunch of claims that are all either blatantly false or just plain wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was my first time reading a children's book and the first time that I really thought about what I was reading.   The characters were like real people, they were real people who were real funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with numerous errors and blatant misunderstandings of the facts. First of all, she says that "Benedict XVI's papal bull on the priesthood did not, in fact, authorize the ordination of women as priests." (p. 6) In fact, the decree did say exactly that, and it was the bishops who issued it. So the only people who were confused by the papal decree were the cardinals who opposed it. She also claims that the "only valid reason for the promulgation of the decree was the desire of some Italian clergy to give a new meaning to the term 'Ordo Novi'" (p 6). I don't know where this idea originated, but it is totally false. In fact there were two valid reasons: 1. Because of a disagreement between the Church and the Roman Curia about what constituted the "most holy mystery" of the Eucharist. 2. To resolve the conflict between the Pope and the Italian Church about how to canonize certain saints who were canonized under the rubric "Eucharistum mysterium". She doesn't seem to understand that the second reason was a reaction to the first one. This is why the decree wasn't "a real miracle", but a "political decision" (p 5).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say enough good about this book. I found it really interesting, thought provoking, and a really good read. It's a bit difficult to follow, but I found myself trying to find out why he'd decided to write about what he'd been doing at work. It was so well done that I just didn't want to read anything else by him, except for the original novel (which I've already read).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book.  I can't believe it's actually being published.  It's a collection of essays about the problems of writing in the 21st century and I'm so disappointed in the quality of the writing.  The authors have a lot to say about what they see as the problems in writing today and it's all over the place.  Their first problem is the fact that people are no longer writing about books in the same way they used to.  They've become so obsessed with reading a book as soon as it comes out that they forget that they can write a book of their own if they like.  Another problem is that writing is so much more collaborative than it used to be.   The last 20 years have been the era of the big publisher, and that's not going to go away any time soon.  All of the authors in this collection have been published by big publishers and so you have to wonder why anyone would go with them.  There's also the fact, which is also a problem in a lot of these collections, that the writers have to read the books they write about in order to write them.   I think the real problem is just that a lot people don't care about good writing.   A lot of people just want to read good stories.   There's a tendency to believe that the more popular a book is the more good it is.    If you don't want to write about the same old stories you'll do a lot better to write something that people actually like.   And the authors are doing a disservice by taking the easy way out and just copying and pasting a bunch of stuff they find on the Internet.  That's not to say that they shouldn't read books, but it's not necessarily the best way to write.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of romance. The story, though good, seemed to be a rehash of the first book and a rehashing of the same story again.  My first thought when I opened the book was that it was too long.  It was about 2/3 the length of the previous book.  This time, however, the characters were not as developed.  The narrator was a bit too nice and too predictable.  I didn't care about the romance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book I've read by someone who actually tried to write a book. It's soooo bad that I didn't want to read the next book, but decided I could wait. It also didn't help that the characters in the book are such utter suckers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for a good book on the history of the Holocaust. I've seen a few good ones but they are expensive.   This one is cheap but the information is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the best thing I've read in a while. The writing style is easy and the plot twists are well thought out. The characters are believable and the writing is clear. This book will get you into a story that is far deeper than you thought possible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive thing about this book is that it is an excellent source of information on the early history of the Soviet Union. It is also quite a useful historical introduction to the Cold War. However, the authors do not know what they are talking about when they claim that Stalinist Russia never recovered from the war. In fact, the post-war reconstruction of the Russian economy (the Soviet Union was the largest economy in the world after World War II) was a remarkable success. As long as Stalinism was the ruling ideology of the country, there was no way that a liberal economic system could survive in Russia. Stalinist economic policies were simply incapable of generating the high levels of growth and modernization that the Soviet people needed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book I was given as a child was a book about a family of six kids, including a girl who was never able to play with her brothers because she couldn't walk, which was why her parents couldn't afford to buy her a doll.  The kids had a hard time making friends, which is why the book was never finished, but I still read it.  This is the kind of book that makes me cringe and cry.  It made me sad to see that it would never be finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I have been following a diet of mostly low-carb/low-sugar diets for years and I thought it would be fun to try one that is "all natural". I was also interested in learning about some of the health benefits of raw food. This book is full of hype about "the wonders of raw vegetables" and "the superfoods of the jungle".   It was also full of a lot of "health food" talk that I thought sounded more like advertising than nutritional advice.    The book does contain recipes that are "really good" but I am not convinced that is all there is to a healthy diet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a terrible book. I read this as a joke, but it's not funny at all. The plot is lame and ridiculous. I'm a big fan of the old school gothic romance genre, but the goth theme doesn't work here. There's nothing goth about the protagonist's character. She's a typical girl in a typical relationship with a typical boy. I'd give this book 3 stars if it weren't for the terrible plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total disappointment.  I really wanted to like it but it's just so boring.  The plot is about a young woman who has a terrible crush on a man in the army.  Her friends are trying to get her to break up with him but she just can't.  She then decides to enlist in the military and then when her friends say she should stay with him, she just gives up.  It's just really bad.  If you like a lot of things about military life, this is definitely for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book several times but I still can't understand why someone would use the word "homo" when referring to a homosexual, unless they are using it as a slur against homosexuals. The whole concept of homosexuality is that it is a bad thing. But in this book, they are trying to justify homosexual behavior by calling it "heterosexual." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad read. The only positive part of it is the author's enthusiasm. She does give a good introduction, however, and there are enough examples from real life to provide the reader with a good sense of how we might behave in a similar situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book. It has all the information you need to do some great things in the real world. But the author, I am sorry to say, is an ignorant fool who can't even read a good book. I found the book very boring and didn't want to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very boring book. I'm very disappointed in this book.   It's boring, it's very repetitive, and it's just not that good a book. If you read a good book and you're bored out of your skull, it doesn't matter how good it is - you're not going to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of the Harry Potter books, you're going to love this book.   It's a great read, and the author has a nice sense of humor.  It was a real pleasure to read, even though I have to admit I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of "Dirty Jobs" as a whole. This one, though, is about as far from the truth as you can get. This book's authors claim that many people in high-level jobs in the tech industry are "dumped" by their companies (e.g. CEO and CTO), but the truth is the opposite. They get fired. I believe it was a case of an executive who was doing a poor job of leading a team, and being forced out. She got a job at another company. The company she worked for is a very large one. I don't know if I'd agree with them about the whole "dumping" thing, but they have a point that the people who are "replaced" tend to be the ones who did the wrong things.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book for a birthday gift for my daughter who is a huge sci-fi fan.  I liked the story about the aliens but found it a bit hard to relate to.  There were so many things I did not get and the alien that was being attacked by a giant flying insect made no sense.  It took my daughter awhile to understand why the aliens were attacking her because they were so different than her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been a fan of Neil Gaiman for years and  I really liked  The Ocean at the End of the Lane    but I found this book  so clunky  that it almost fell apart 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book about a terrible character that is the worst thing about the book. I am a woman and she is very annoying. I can't get past how she is always going on about how she has a "gift" for men. It's annoying and gross. I have read a lot of books about women. I've never read a book that I felt so disgusted reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very poor book, but one that makes for a good read.  The story is very well done, and the characters were very well written.  I was not too impressed with the ending, though.  It seemed to me that it was written after the author's experience with a failed relationship.  For me, the ending didn't quite work.  As for the book itself, it is a good book, and I will probably read the sequel, but I don't think I will ever finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. The author does a terrible job with writing the history of American football, and fails to really explain how and why the game developed. It is really not that hard to explain how football developed in the United States in the 1800s, but it would have been nice to get a better understanding of why the sport was popular among the common man in the US in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and this book is no exception.   It is a great companion piece to the books that it is based on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed in this book that I didn't finish it.  The writing is bad, the characters are terrible, and the story is a complete mess.  I hope I can find a copy at a good price, but I'll be keeping my distance from this book for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is the least interesting thing about this book.  The book is about the time a group of people had a party in a cave.  There was music, dancing, drinking, and other activities.  Then it got dark.  When it was all over, one of the people went to the grave and said, "You know, I thought I would never be in this place again.  I'll be in heaven by now."  It was very sad, but I'm sure the party will be over soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first chapter, on the subject of the Bible, is so misleading that the reader should be forewarned: the author's own words and conclusions are at odds. The book should be considered a hoax and be ridiculed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did enjoy reading this book, but after reading a few other reviews and looking through the book, I feel that there are a few holes in the logic and presentation. First, the author describes a scenario in which a group of kids get their hands on a new car and are in a position to be able to buy it. She describes it as a good time with lots of fun and fun times. That is, until the owner of the car is revealed to be a drug addict who was the first to drive off with the car and is the only person in the group to ever have driven a car off the lot. So in this scenario, everyone who has ever driven a "bad" car is an addict. If we all had the same drive and wanted the same car, then I guess that could work, but there is a big difference between not wanting a car and being able to pay for it. That's not really something you can just say. Then there is the fact that some people can afford to pay more for a car, but most can't, and so it would be unfair for the person who can't to pay even more for the car.    That seems to me like the author is making the mistake of taking the "bad kids" view of life.  It seems that a lot of parents think that if their child is "bad", then it is their fault, and the "good kids" get a "free ride" to "good schools".   But it isn't really like that.  Parents can be the best parents they can be.  You can't do anything about a child's bad habits, but you can teach them how to behave, and make sure they learn about the consequences of bad decisions.  If someone has a problem with a bad car, it's their own fault.  This is not the way to do things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that takes on a life of its own. The writing is great. The narration is perfect. The story is good. It is a very well thought out and detailed account of the Holocaust. But the "final solution" has never been a very realistic way to solve the problem. There is a reason that the "Final Solution" has always been rejected by most decent people as a good idea. It would have been a better idea to simply put everyone who wasn't Jewish into a mass grave and let them rot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very poorly written and the story is so unbelievable that it didn't add up at all. There are no characters in this book, and all the characters are completely fictional, except the main character, and none of them were ever mentioned in the book. I thought that it was just a little too strange that the main characters are always talking about some strange, mysterious, paranormal thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been meaning to read this book for a long time. It took a few years to get to it. But when I finally did, I was really disappointed. The story was interesting and the author did a good job at making the characters interesting, but the author does a poor job of telling a good story. The characters are bland, the world is boring and the story has very little depth. I am very disappointed that the author didn't write a book about a young man who is sent to a secret military base to discover the secrets of the universe.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an embarrassment.   It is filled with unhelpful information about the life of a professional liar, a professional scam artist, a liar who does not care about anyone but himself.  The only information he provides is from the same sources that he has used in his lies.  It's no surprise that a man who has been in the news a lot for his lies and swindles can write a book about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, as he always does, has a poor understanding of history. This book is about the American Revolution, but not about the Revolutionary War.  The book begins by talking about the British Army and how it won the Revolutionary war.  Then it proceeds to talk about the French army and how they won the War of 1812.  Finally, it discusses the American Civil War.   It should be noted that the French lost that war, as well, but I suppose the author feels the American one was a close call.   The final chapter does a good job of describing how the Americans got their shit together in the last hundred years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a review of a book that I had not read before.   This was my first review ever, so I thought I would try to make it worth reading.  However, the book was terrible!   The narrator did not read well.  The plot was predictable.  She talked about a character in the book and how that character's behavior was a bit "dishonest."   She did not tell us why it was a bad thing that the character was dishonest.  And it was just "dishes."  The character was a real "cliché." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't find this book to be particularly entertaining, so I didn`t really want to continue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most useless books I have ever read. It is written in the third person. The story is the only thing that makes it worth reading. It could have been written by a person who has never seen a dog in the wild.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of time and money.   I have read a lot of books on psychology and thought this one was good but not much else.  I gave it three stars because it is a book on how to get your mind to be more productive.  The book does not contain many real life examples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third book in a series, so far, which has had some very bad writing.  I think the author was trying to make a point, but the whole thing was written in a way that made the reader feel dumb for following the character.  The story follows a girl who lives in the woods with her dog, a rabbit, and a small rat.  In the beginning, she was afraid of the dog.  Later, when her dog died, the dog's death really made her feel scared and guilty.  Then the rabbit died, and it really pissed her off.   It really is not very clear what is going on in this book, which is why it has only been on my shelf for about two weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book that should have been a classic.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so boring! It was the first book i've read that wasn't a great read.  I really didn't care for it.  The main character is a very annoying one.  She has no problem telling everyone she knows that she's a lesbian, but she really doesn't care about the other girls who don't know.  In fact, she's very rude to them.  As far as I can tell, she never even says "hi" to anyone.  And she never shows any interest in the other boys either.  There was one girl that she seemed to like, but that was only because she's tall and the other one was short.  This book should have been a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the only book I've ever read that is so unbelievably wrong.  I am convinced that a group of people, probably a cult, have been manipulating my parents.  They have gotten my mother to believe that I am a drug addicted child molester.  In fact, she has been manipulated into believing that she and her husband are "abandoned" by the world.  This book has the power to make me completely and utterly miserable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry to say that I didn't like this book.  It's an extremely long and tedious book, the kind you can get by just sitting down and reading.   The author is a good writer and I appreciate her effort, but  she doesn't give a damn about her characters.  If you don't care about the story you are writing then it's hard to care about anything.  My only gripe with this book is that the title has been mis-translated into Latin as a kind of "Aristotle on the Human Condition".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had this book as a gift for my mother.   She loved it and has not put it down.  I can't say I'm surprised by this book at all.  This book is full of great ideas about working hard to get ahead.  Unfortunately, some of the advice is unrealistic.  If you do your homework, get a degree, and work hard at a job that pays well, then you will succeed.  But that is true for most jobs, and there is no way to avoid it.  What about other careers that pay poorly and require less education?  If a job doesn't pay well or require more education, then it probably doesn't offer the kind of career opportunities that will get you ahead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book for my husband and himself as a Christmas gift for their grandchildren.   The book is just about as bad as the movie it is based on.  It is just a very poor copy of the movie.  The writing is horrible and the story is not only completely bogus but the whole story is just so wrong.  I mean this is not even a good rip off.  In the movie we see the whole plot but the book only tells us a few parts.  For example we don't get the whole explanation why they are taking a "gift" but we get the reason that they are going out on a fishing trip and that is because they can't afford a car.  This book doesn't even explain that.  There is no explanation for why the two of them are going fishing.  They are fishing because they want to do it, not because they need to.  Why did they not bring their car with them?  Why not just rent a car instead?  I am sure there are a million more details but I am just sick of reading about these people taking a car to a vacation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad thing that the author's first attempt at an original story wasn't very good.  I was expecting something more along the lines of "The Road,"  but I can't help but wonder if it's the author trying too hard.  It takes a lot to make a good first attempt, but I feel like the author is overdoing it here.  If the reader has a decent idea about what's going on in this story, they could have guessed that it wasn't going to turn out well.  Or, the writer could have made it better.  Regardless, I would still recommend it as a quick, fun read, but you'll probably have to read it twice to get the most out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about how to get your mind off of your problems. This is about as good as it gets. If you get depressed over something and then get a new job and suddenly realize that you have more money than you ever imagined and no real friends and the only thing that makes you happy is being with your family then this book is not for you. But if you are depressed about a thing but are also depressed about being unemployed and having to look for work, then this is the book you are looking for. It helps you find a job that makes your life easier and happier.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.  The author is a good writer, but she has no idea how to write an intelligent science book about science.   She does not understand why science is important to people, and she tries to explain it.  She has a lot of interesting points about evolution, but they are drowned out by the fact that her arguments are a combination of straw men and sophistry.  Her book tries to make the scientific evidence for evolution look like a religious belief by the time it is about 2/3 of the way through.  I am not sure she has ever read a real science book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the antithesis of good. There is nothing good about it. The author does a poor job of explaining the theory and the practical application of the material. If you want to be a good science communicator, get the textbook.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for a class in college. I loved the plot but it's so confusing and over-the-top it is hard to get through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an example of the book reviewers who write to "make a good book bad."  It's very short, but it's very hard to read.  It is also so full of bad writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. It was very thought provoking, and it had good insights about how our society works. It is a good read. However, it was difficult to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been waiting for this book for a very long time. I have read many books on Buddhism and meditation. But, I was so disappointed by this book that I had to cancel my order. I don't like how the book was written. It's not very interesting. It just seems like he's trying to get you to accept his ideas so he can get a piece of your time. There are some great points in this book, but I don' t believe in them. I was hoping that the book would have given me a little more information about the inner self and my mind. Maybe I just needed more information, but the book didn't do that for me. I think that I can relate to the book, and the book can relate back to me, but in the end, it's just not that interesting to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a very dull read. I had a lot of fun reading this book and was looking forward to seeing where it would go. It did not go where I wanted it to go. The plot kept jumping around from place to place. It kept changing the story into something else, like a bad television show.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a very good review.   I have never liked any of the books from the Twilight series.  It is just not my cup of tea.  I do enjoy the movies that have been based on the books.  But I do not enjoy these books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has the dubious distinction of being the only one that I didn't like.  It's a good book, but it doesn't help me understand the author's other books much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished reading this book.   It's the kind of thing that's going to take me some time to read, because the writing is very bad.  The characters are not all that interesting.  But at least the story is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book because I love sci fi and the movies that come out of it. Unfortunately, the book failed on every level. The author tries to make it look like aliens are benevolent, but they just want to harvest the planet. They can't control people as they are intelligent beings and humans are like a virus. If they wanted to, they could control people by controlling their minds. If the author wants to be taken seriously, he could have had an alien that was intelligent, but still wanted to harvest. If that were the case, it would have been more believable. Also, how is it that this book got a 5 star rating? It is just plain bad science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about 5 years ago and really didn't like it at all.   It was written by a man who lived in the woods in a small town and never seemed to get out of bed and had a very negative opinion of the whole idea of being outdoors and going on hikes and exploring.  The book has no pictures, no writing at all, no information about the subject.  It's just a bunch of stuff that sounds good but has nothing to back it up.  I found it hard to believe that such a person could actually write such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so filled with crap. I've had this book for about 6 months now, and it's still at least as bad as it was the first time I read it. It's full of inaccuracies, bad logic, and downright lies about the history of Christianity.  It has the following claims: Jesus is a mythological figure; Christianity is not a religion; The Book of Acts is not reliable.  But this is not the only bad thing about it.  First off, it is not true that "Christianity is not, in any way, a religion."  The evidence for this is clear from every other religion in history, so why do they not use the same methodology when trying to disprove Christianity?  It's also not true, and I don't understand why they claim it to be so, that Christianity was not a historical religion.  I do believe that it was a religious movement, but I don;t think that it has to be one, and Christianity has been around for over 2,000 years now.  Secondly, the book does a very poor job of proving this.  The most glaring example is when it claims that there is no archaeological evidence of the crucifixion.  This is absolutely false, as many archaeologists have found and studied the bones of the dead, as well as other evidence.  And yet this book claims that no one has ever found evidence for the crucifixions, and is therefore not a reliable source.  Thirdly, the "Book of Acts" is not an authoritative source, and its author was a man named Paul, who was the leader of the first Christian Church.  Again, the historical context of the book is not relevant, but the authorship of the Book of Paul is.  As such, there is a lot of debate about whether or not he is the author, but there is overwhelming evidence that he is. So, if this is so bad, why are so many Christian groups still quoting it?  The fact is that many of them have just been using it as an argument against the idea of Christianity, but they have never actually looked at the historical evidence.   So they have to come up with reasons as to why they believe it.   The most common ones are that Paul wrote it, and that it's a later "revision" of the original "Book."  This argument is also pretty weak, as there are a number of later "sources" that also claim that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.   The author's idea is to put an academic spin on a horror novel to make it more "popular" but what the hell is this, a horror movie?   I really had hoped that he would have gotten into the details of the story.  This is not a story that I would enjoy,  but   it would have been more enjoyable than a complete dud.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I tried to read this book, I found it hard to put down. I really didn't want to finish it but the ending made me do it. I don't know how many times I read this but I still can't put it down. It's very sad, but so well written. It has a great message about the importance of family and friends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a little put off by this book because of how it seems to take a bunch of random people and put them together in a circle that would eventually turn into a cult. It seems that all these people have some sort of bizarre connection to the book that is going to be the key to all of their future success. They have to be a part of something big because it's the only way they'll get to the top. It makes no sense to me. If you take a random bunch of people and stick them together, there will always be a group who is in the group but isn't. They are going to get stuck with the weird one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so sorry I had to read this.  I can't say it's a bad read (I love a good romance) but I felt it wasn't quite what I expected.  It's written very much in the first person and the narrator talks about things that happen to him.    He's not a very strong character.  There's some nice descriptions of the countryside and the people that live there, but I found them not as interesting as I'd hoped. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with the "Star Wars" movies. I'm sorry, but "The Old Republic" has nothing interesting to do. I know that's supposed to be a good thing, but it just isn't.  I found this book very boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a good read. I liked it, and I've seen the film. It doesn't really show what happened in that room, but it's still good for a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's sooooo bad. I am so disappointed in this book. It's full of all the clichés of the genre (romantic, funny, suspenseful, etc.) and nothing really stands out or really has much of an impact on me. There's no real mystery at the end. It all just makes me feel like I wasted my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this book is bad, at times it is just bad.   I do not want to read about anything that is not going to happen.  It is very confusing for me to read a book about a person who has been through so much that I do wonder if they have any life left at all.  I just don't know what to think about it all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. The characters are stupid, the writing is terrible, the plot is lame and the ending is so stupid. It's like a big middle-schooler book, which is why I liked it so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character in this book is a bit of a whiny baby. She was so convinced that her teacher was a bad teacher, that she would rather be in the closet than in class.  If the teacher had been better, she would have enjoyed her class and the class discussion.  This book was good for what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found myself frustrated and irritated as I read the first few pages of this book. The characters, the writing, the plot, and the overall story line were all very interesting, but I was expecting a lot more from the author. She is clearly a good writer, and I'm sure she's got the plot figured out by now, but the writing in this book seemed like a complete waste of time. I'm guessing the author did it for the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not bad. It's a book with too much good stuff in it. But, it's a pretty long book. It will take you a while to get through it all. This is a book that really makes you think. It makes you consider how your decisions about what to study will effect your life in the long run.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm an American who loves to read.  I got this book through my library and am so happy I did.  It's a great read and I'll certainly be picking it up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's not really bad, but it's not a very good book at all.    I really wanted to like this book.  It has a good plot and a good story.  But I just wasn't feeling it.  And I'm not even sure why.  I have to wonder what's wrong with this book--maybe it's because it's a first time author, maybe it's the fact that she's writing about the Vietnam War.  The only reason I found it interesting is because of the ending.  That ending was interesting, but that was about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 2 stars.  It's not bad, it's just not good.  The characters are bland, and the plot is cliche.  This book has some good ideas, but none of them seem to come to fruition.  I would have preferred a book about a boy who got to be the best magician in town. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book, but not great.   It has a lot of good ideas in it, but they never seem to come to fruition.  There is some interesting research in it about the use of the word "unbearable" in the military.  I hope she can do some more work on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a little disappointed with this book, not because of the author but because of its publication.    This book is a "dishonest, poorly written book" and "a poor introduction to the literature of Islam."   I guess the author felt the need to "prove" Islam is an evil religion and is not a religion of peace.  I find it amusing how the author claims he knows so much about Islam and yet can't find the word "Allah" in the Quran.  (Or, perhaps he is just ignorant.  ) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book for an older adult.   It is a wonderful blend of stories, all well written and interesting.  The stories and characters are interesting and varied.  It's a good book for the reader with a family member that has the same illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an extremely short book. I read it in two days.  It has a lot of good info and info that could be easily found on-line, but it doesn't seem to be included in the book, so that's just more wasted time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why I bought this book.  It's boring, it's boringly well-researched, and there are so many mistakes and mistakes in so many different places that it's really very difficult to believe that anyone could have been doing this kind of work for that long a time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read in my life.   I can't get it to make sense at all.  It's all very "sci-fi" - there are aliens, a ship, and the whole thing is a "bargain" to get people off planet earth.  There's also some pretty blatant racism - I mean, there are only four black people in the book, and it seems that the aliens are the only ones who can understand black people.  This isn't just about racism, though.  The entire thing seems like the author is using his sci-fi background to say, "I can't understand these people, so I'll make them seem alien."  I really don't get the appeal of this book at all, and I'm sure it will be a big disappointment for anyone who really wants to understand how people like this exist in real life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read this book, but never got around to buying it. I found it a bit disconcerting, and I did not care for the story. I did like the author's voice though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book at a convention (a convention of people who enjoy bad books), and it's just a collection of bad stories.   The story that is most interesting is a woman who falls in love with a man who can't walk because he has a bad back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the struggle for self-realization in the face of a dysfunctional family. It is written in a very honest manner, without flippancy or moralizing, but at the same time the author is a very poor guide to this journey.   I've found that when someone says something negative about someone else, that person is often the same one who has said something negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for the first time about 6 months ago.   It was my first experience reading a YA book and I wasn't sure how to take it.  The characters were interesting but  they seemed to be a little too one dimensional  and the plot seemed a little cliche  and not really believable.  In short the characters felt a bit like a one note characters in a series that I am not really fond of. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased the first two books in this series and I have to say I am disappointed in both books. The first book is about a character that doesn't have enough self respect to walk away from a terrible situation. I have a bad back and I was really concerned about having to walk up the stairs. She ends up in a bathtub. Then the second book is a "what if" story about the main character. She gets the power of flight but loses her ability to walk. The main character has no problems walking but she doesn't feel right about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was just a bit too "silly" for me. I had hoped to see a bit more depth and subtlety from the author, but he came off as a bit of a goofball who just wanted to say "Hey, there's a real world out there and it's not just a bunch of nerds playing video games." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard it said that a book written for a young audience, written by a man, will be a "dumbed-down" book, but it doesn't seem that way. This is not that book. It's not even close to that book--it's more of the same boring story that I hate in books like these. This one was about 10 years ago, so I had to wait until I was in high school to read it. I don't know why this book was written in 1996, but the book is about a girl who is trying to find her way in a strange and strange world. The story is about her trying to learn about a man who has lived in her house for about 5 years, and her growing and trying to fit in with his way of life. It took me a while to get into it. It was slow going, but I was eventually able to get through the first 5 chapters. It is a slow, hard-to-follow book, and there were times when I wished that it were over so that I could put it down and do something else. I did eventually get through it. The author tries to do too much with too little, but for what it's worth, I liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that every woman I know has to have, but no one wants to read. It is very dull. There are many examples that make me feel that this is a man trying to write women a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a horrible book. It's a very basic idea:  "A woman is born into a bad marriage and must learn to accept her new reality and live with it.  She learns how to survive her own mistakes and learn to cope with her husband's."  The story doesn't go far enough.  There are some good parts, but they are the same as the rest of the book.  It's all about the same things:  "She took a job at a grocery store."      "He took her to a restaurant."      "They got into an argument over his refusal to let her keep a book she had bought at the bookstore."        There is also a lot of bad material about women and women's lives.   It has all the ingredients for a good sex book.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have just finished this book. It was the first I had read on the subject. It is a good book and worth a read but it is a very bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that I never got into.  I was going to be interested but I couldn't keep up.  It was a pretty good read but I kept putting it down because I was bored by it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't have a lot of friends, so this was a pleasant surprise.  I am an old man who grew up reading old fantasy books and then found out there were no such books anymore.    I loved this book.  It had all the elements that I love about old books, like an intriguing hero and a great world that is full of interesting characters.  This was also a fun book to read, and it was fun to look back and see the influence of other fantasy books on my own work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a lot of things wrong with it. It doesn't explain why it is bad. It just says that it is.  The premise is wrong.  I have a strong dislike for this type of science fiction.  It just doesn't seem plausible.  Maybe it is a good idea to use it as a vehicle for a book about the Holocaust, but it just doesn't hold up.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book that was a chore to get through, but I'm glad I did.  This book, which was published in 1973, is about a woman named Jane and her husband, Jack.  Jack is a carpenter, and Jane, who is a homemaker, gets to keep the house while he goes out to work.  The book has Jane's father giving her money to pay Jack's bills.  She is always annoyed by the fact that she has to help Jack.   I've read other books that have the same plot, but this one is the one that makes it the longest book I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. The book starts off good but quickly becomes a waste of time. The characters are extremely annoying, the writing is very poor, and the story is very stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring.   It is basically about the same thing: how some people get caught up in a bad relationship because they feel like they are being "protected" by their partner.  It is about how this type of relationship is unhealthy for everyone involved.  It was interesting reading about the people in the book who got caught up with this, but then ended up in horrible marriages and horrible relationships. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is really dumb.  He does nothing but complain about everything.  The last part was so bad I almost put it down.  It is a really stupid book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been a fan of Stephen King for years and this is one of the worst of his books.  The story, about a guy who wants to be a rock star, is fine, but the ending, when he's in a coma, is so ridiculous it's impossible to read it without laughing.  It makes me want to throw up! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first half of the book without really caring much about what happened. It was mostly the characters and their interactions that interested me, and I got the feeling that it was going to be a rather boring book.   But the second half is the real gem.  The story was told with a level of emotional intensity and passion that I had never seen in a novel, and the way the characters reacted to the events that they were involved in was so realistic that I was able to connect to the characters.  This is the sort of book that I can see being made into a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible waste of time.   The author claims to have invented a language that is superior to English and is therefore more'modern', but it is just as difficult to learn as the English one.  It would be better to use a good dictionary instead of trying to read a book in a foreign language.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book.   I hate the way the author wrote about the subject matter.  She never once tells the reader what a good person he is.  It just comes off as an arrogant condescension toward a person who can't get it together. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a very bad book. The writing style is terrible and the prose style is very poor. It makes it difficult to follow along and to find a place to start the story. It is not easy to follow any story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book.    It was a very short read.  I was a bit confused by the ending.  A lot of people liked the ending, but it was kind of forced.  This book did not get a good review from me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a boring book.  It doesn't give the main character, who is supposedly a super genius, any depth.  The plot seems to be to build him up, to prove his superiority to everyone else, to show that he's the smartest one in the room.  At the end, he doesn't even have a clue what he did wrong.  I thought that was a bit of a letdown.  This is the second book in a series about a super hero. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it isn't the same old boring story.   It's very good, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading "The Art of Writing Like a Woman". I'm not a big fan of the author's style but I found it very interesting. It's about a guy who's obsessed with women's handwriting, the differences between masculine and feminine, and other things. It reminded me of a book I read years ago: The Difference Between a Woman and a Man. It's also similar to the way men write. The author's obsession with women is a little disturbing but I can understand why she's doing it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful. It was the story of a woman who has a secret love for a man who's a horrible man, a man with a horrible wife and a son who's terrible too. The story was awful and the characters were awful. I found this book hard to get through. I liked the title and I liked a lot about the author's writing style, but the story just wasn't for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book on a whim, thinking it was going to be a good one.   It is just so, so, SO bad.  The main character is not very interesting, and she has to be one of the most annoying people I've ever met in a book.  She is an idiot.  I also got a lot of the "bad guy" stuff.  I'm just not a fan of "evil" characters in a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not good, or at least not as good as the first few books in the series.  It's a bit like "A Song of Ice and Fire" without the humor and wit, and while there is a good plot, it is so much more than that that I feel cheated out of a book that I really wanted.  The only thing that I found to be worth the price was the new cover art by the awesome David Williams, and that is more than enough to justify the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book from a friend for my birthday. It's basically the same story told over and over, but with different characters. It got so bad that I had to keep stopping and starting the book over again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with inaccuracies. It tells the story of the last days of the Soviet Union through the eyes of the Russians. The book was written by two Russians who fled to the U.S. after the fall of the USSR. This was their way of trying to stay in touch with the Soviet people. The Russians who wrote the book were not the same people who were in charge of the economy during the USSR, which the book claims was in a good shape. The main reason that the USSR fell apart is because of the corruption that was rampant during the Soviet era. If you read this book you will know it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first book in the series,  Blood Red: A Novel of the Civil War, is an excellent historical novel, a well-crafted story about a group of abolitionists who fought a battle in the most violent era in the United States.  It was a great read, but I felt a bit disappointed with how the story ended.  In fact, it's one of the reasons I wanted to give the book a second chance.  For those who don't know, Blood Red  was written by a Civil War veteran and was the first in a series of books written by an author who served in the war.    It has a great cast of characters:   A Union officer, an ex-Confederate, a woman who lived in the South, a slave, and an African American.  This was a book I had to read before I knew what was going on, and when I finished it I knew I had been misled.  I will say that the writing is a bit rough around the edges, but if you want a history book with a lot of action this is a good one.  As always, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to my daughter. It was about an English girl who becomes an American soldier during WWII. She comes back to England and has to deal with the racism and prejudice of her country. It's a pretty typical war story but it has a very good twist at the end. I was expecting some sort of romantic story. This book is about a very ordinary girl trying to deal in a very big world. I did enjoy it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to say that this book is the absolute worst I have ever read. I was disappointed from the beginning. I am a big fan of the Stephen King books and thought this book was going to be a good one. I wasn't disappointed. The main problem is that it is just not well written. It is very confusing and hard to follow. I did not even realize that the "monster" in this book has no body and is only a spirit until the end of the book. This is a real waste of a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to get my hands on this book, and my excitement turned to disappointment when I started reading it.   The premise is that a man, a good Christian, is abducted from his own country and sold to a Muslim slave trader.  I've read that in other books, but never something like this.  The story is great, but the prose just isn't up to par.  It makes the prose too easy for the reader, but it also makes it very hard to follow.  If the story was that easy to follow, then it would have been a great book.  Instead, I found myself frustrated and angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to like this book. But it's just not that great.  It is a fun book about a good guy who has a bad day, but then realizes that he is actually a bad person.  I did enjoy it a bit.  But I have to admit that I am a big fan of James Bond.  So that's not my only complaint about this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring and it's hard to get through it. The best thing about this book is that it's a good introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics, which is fascinating and I am sure will be the topic of my physics classes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I was reading this book was for the cover.   Unfortunately, the cover was so poorly done that I could not use the book to study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad history book.  It is very bad history.  The author is a well known conspiracy theorist,  He believes that the US government has been involved in the Kennedy assassination.  He writes that the government is hiding evidence and trying to cover it up.  I found it extremely offensive and insulting.  As I read the book, I realized that I do not believe that JFK was killed by the US Government.  And that this book was written by someone who believes that.  There is no proof that the CIA killed JFK.  A lot of conspiracy theories are written by people who do not know what they are talking about.  This book is an insult to those who have studied history and understand the role of the CIA and other intelligence agencies in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I gave this a 3 star rating is because it is an extremely good read and I'm very glad that I found it.  It's been awhile since I read a good book and this one was worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book I have ever read where I had to go back and read the beginning because I thought it was stupid.   The premise is bad, the characters are stupid, the writing is terrible, and the story is lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to pick up the paperback version of this book. I loved the book when it was released but it's so sad that this is not the original version. I was also disappointed to find out that the author is dead.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an extremely poor book. It is written in the style of an elementary school text book.  In the middle of the book is a chapter about the history of medicine and the fact that we are constantly searching for new drugs that will cure disease.  Unfortunately, the author goes to great lengths to make sure you realize that these new drugs are not actually new.  He even uses the word "unnatural" to describe the way we treat disease.   He makes no attempt to justify his position.  Instead, he just says that the drugs that are in the book do not work and they are "unnecessary."  The author also mentions that the American public is getting sicker because of these drugs.  The only reason he mentions this is to say that the public is sicker than ever before.  It is no wonder that the government is so concerned about the cost of these medicines.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been waiting for this book for a long time. The idea of it is interesting and the story is compelling, but the way it's written and edited makes me cringe. It's so unoriginal and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of trash. It is written by an old man who has never read a good book in his life, and who has been writing novels for the past 30 years.  He talks about how a friend of his died of cancer, but then he never bothers to tell the reader that the friend died of lung cancer.  The author then claims that he was able to read the original book in its original language, and that is what he read, and it's what he wrote.   It is sad that this book is being published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. I had hoped to find a real life story that could be told by someone who knew the person. But this is just a "good" story with a happy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I could never put it down. I had to read it over and over until I got it right.  I thought about trying to read the rest of the series but I would never be able to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of "but"s.   First, the author doesn't get that most people have no interest in reading about "real" things.  Then, she makes the author out to be a bad person by comparing him to a person who doesn't know any better.  She makes the writer out to have no moral compass.  Finally, she compares the writer to a woman who is "a horrible mother."   She's trying to write a story about a person that has a lot in common with the author.  In other words, she's trying too hard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I didn't get that.   In my opinion, it's a good first book about a woman trying to find a new way to be a mother that doesn't involve a man (in this case, a man who seems to think his daughter is a kid).   If you are into that sort of thing (which I'm sure is most of the readers) you will probably enjoy it.  But for me, it seemed like there was more to the story than that.   4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poorly written book. The author doesn't know the first thing about computers or programming and spends a lot of time on things that are unimportant. This is the kind of book that gets published because the author has been paid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited about this book. I'd been thinking about doing a project about the history of English spelling since I was a child, and this was definitely the book for me.  I got the hardback in December, but it's been sitting on my bookshelf since then.    If you can get past the title (and you should!), it's a fascinating look at the history and evolution of English spellings, and it's certainly worth reading if you're interested in the history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sure that I will read this book again in a year or so, but not until I have a chance to study the many examples of plagiarism, lack of research and poor critical thinking in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't have the time to read this book because I'm working. However, my kids were thrilled with it and I will definitely recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a review of this book on another website that said that this book was a poor translation.   The text was a lot easier to read than the original.  I think I'm going to be using this book more often now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book.  There are so many errors in the grammar and spelling in the first three pages that I am almost certain it was written by someone with a learning disability or dyslexia.  If this book was a movie, it would be rated "R" because of the many scenes of idiocy.   The author could have at least made it clearer to the reader that she doesn't actually know what she's talking about, as I can clearly see that the author is using the phrase "the devil makes his appearance" to describe some of the effects of the disease she has, and that she is in no way implying that the disease is the Devil.  This would have been a great addition to the dictionary if the author actually knew what she was talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written in 1997 by a man who had a serious disability and lived in a wheelchair. It's just as bad as you'd expect, except for one thing:  If you can get your life together enough to write a book about a wheelchair-bound man, then you are either very lucky or a fool.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors.  It has over 700 words in it about some sort of magic or occult.  The best part is that when the magic is used the person who has been "blessed" is then given a very good book on how to use a compass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the book I've been waiting for my entire life to read.   I'm just not sure what I'm waiting for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story in this book is interesting but the characters are poorly developed and one has a nasty personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very interesting but the stories weren't that good. I have to say that the story was good but the book wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book.  It was full of typos and factual errors.  This book has no place in a library or at a public library.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful. The whole thing started off well enough, but by the end, it had completely devolved into a boring bore. The book was not worth the money, it was just there to fill up my bookshelf, and it's been doing that for over a year now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second time I've had a book that I really loved but found to be so poorly written that I gave up reading it.   I liked the premise of the book - the story is really good - but in the end, I found myself frustrated and wanting to stop reading the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a good book to read while you're driving.   If you want to learn more about a topic that interests you, you should probably buy a copy of the book that's about the same thing (which is a shame).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, as I'd heard it is good and good things come in small packages. I got the book and thought it was pretty good.  Unfortunately the author doesn't give a good synopsis of the story.  He makes it sound like a series of one off adventures, not like it's a story about a group of friends who travel together to a magical island.  As I understand the book, it's about a team of kids who go on a quest to find the lost island of the legendary wizard.  The story is interesting but I found it a little confusing.  It feels like the story was written for the kids but not necessarily for me.  I feel like a lot of the stuff they learn is just fluff.  Maybe it's because I've read a lot about wizardry and I'm more familiar with it than the author is.  Either way, the book doesn't seem to be well thought out or really worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is too boring.   The only reason the character is there is to show that he's "one of them" - the kind of person who would be in a gang, like the ones in the book.  It's a nice gesture but it doesn't add anything to the story, only makes the characters less interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first few pages of this book are interesting, but after a while it gets a little repetitive.  There's a couple of pages of the author writing about some of her experiences in the military, and then her story turns into a story about a few of her friends who got into some bad situations in the army.    She seems to be saying that her military experiences are similar to their own, but the real problem is that she doesn't know how to relate it to them.  She's saying things like "I was like those kids in school who just want to hang out and play video games all day and never learn anything", but I think she's doing it too much.  The military was like that to me.  When I was in the service I never knew what to do with myself.  I never really liked the work.  It was a very hard time for me, but I just couldn't seem to get out of it.  Eventually, I started to find myself doing things that I never thought I'd do in my life.  That's what the military is like to me:  It's like a game where you don't know what you're supposed to do, but you have to do it because the only other option is to get lost and lose everything.  After the military I did a lot of stupid things in my career.  This is another one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of this book is about a girl who falls in love with a very, very, stupid, man. The second half is about her getting married.  The author did her best to make the second half entertaining and enjoyable, but it doesn't work very well.  It's a good read for the girl's book club, but I don't see it selling a whole lot of copies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a great book about a great woman.   But,   there is nothing good about the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but it just isn't worth it.   This book is filled with inaccuracies and lies.  The author tries to make the world look bad by portraying the United States government as the evil empire that we all know it to be.  It's not the U.S. government that is evil, but the bad people who are in charge.  What's worse is that the authors doesn't even try to explain why they are wrong.  This is a book that is just an attempt to get you to think about the world and make you believe that the world is a better place than it really is.  I'll just leave this book here: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a good book from the great David Foster Wallace, but I was very disappointed. He has some of his best writing in this book, but it is very uneven, not very engaging and he just doesn't seem to get the writing or the topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not even a big fantasy fan, but after reading this book I'm still not even remotely interested in reading it again. It's boring and pretentious, with characters that have no depth beyond being there for a few pages. The author is so desperate for a hit that he makes a whole series about a princess and the bad guy who kills her. It doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's content is all too familiar. I have read many similar books in the past. These ones are not much different than those that came before.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a writer and I like fantasy and science fiction books. This one is not a good one. I was interested in reading it at first but after reading the reviews on this site I can't read any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book expecting to be blown away by its beauty, but instead I was disappointed by its lack of subtlety.  I have read more than a few good non-fiction books about the Holocaust but this one was just so... well, meh.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am extremely disappointed in this book. I was very excited about this book, but it ended up being a pretty dud. The main reason for my disappointment is that I was disappointed with the writing of the book. The characters all seem to be very self-absorbed. They are so self-obsessed that they cannot see their own flaws. They think that they are always right. Even the book's author has a flaw. He is so confident in his own opinion that he constantly tells us how right he is. His "insider knowledge" is that all of the characters in the book will make the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of the group. The one thing he got right was the fact that the main characters are going to have a difficult time accepting that their parents are in on the plot. This is because their parents know about the sacrifice they will be making, but still choose to go along with it. It is a shame because they could have made a good character out of the kids in the group and have them make a real difference in the world. However, they are just as self-centered and selfish as the characters we have read about in other books. I have also read a few stories where the character's actions have saved the world or at least changed a terrible situation for the better. I can't help but wonder if the author thought that he could write a story about children and how they could change the world with just their opinions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a nice experience to get my hands on this book and read it. I really enjoyed the book and would love to get more from it. The characters were interesting and the plot was solid. I would give it a 4 but I am not a fan of science fiction and I do not enjoy the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is horrible.    The main problem is that it makes no sense.  It starts out with an excellent description of the story behind the events of the first volume.  But the story gets completely lost at the end.  As an adult I understand how this works:   I didn't go to the library for this book.  I don't have a lot of money for reading material.  In other words, I don' t have a good reason to go through the trouble of buying a book.   I just read a copy of this book  and   my favorite part was the part where she describes the first time she ever saw a book about vampires.  There was something so creepy about the book that I can't imagine a vampire would be that creepy.  Also,   the description of how she found the book was way too vague.  If she was looking for an exact copy of the book she found, why didn't she go to a library?   This book is a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best book I have ever read.  I have enjoyed all of the books I have read by David Sedaris, but this one is by far my favorite.  He manages to get funny, well-written, and entertaining books out in a short time period.  This book has all of that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is good but it's just a bad story.  This book was a chore to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about the time when my cousin and I were in college. She wanted to get me a copy of a book about "how to do things that are so much more fun in the 21st century" I thought it was interesting but I have never found anything like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but I really don't get the main reason for the author's interest in the subject, and thus I didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would.    The main character is a poor student with very few friends and no future, and I've always felt that the idea of a student "getting back" at a teacher is silly (a poor student is not a better student, but rather a less-studious-than-the-teacher student).   As a result, it would be easy for me to ignore the book entirely.  However, in my opinion, the book has some good ideas about the nature of social interaction, and some good insights about what it is to be an adult (at least, for those who have the time to devote to learning).  The problem is that I don't know if I buy it, and that's why I'm giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a copy of this book a few years ago but never finished it.   It was a hard read and the story line was just too ridiculous to believe, but it was also so fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. It doesn't teach any useful skills that can't be found in books.   It's not a good read.  The author has no clue what the hell she's talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the kind of book that I wish I had been born a hundred years ago and had never had to read. This is a complete and utter waste of time. The author's opinion of the authors is what makes this book so bad, but that doesn't make it any less stupid. I am not a fan of horror novels. I've read a lot of them but I haven't enjoyed any of them. It doesn't help that the author seems to be having a difficult time writing her own stories. She makes a number of basic errors, such as: The only way to know the future is to wait until it happens, so it's better to be prepared than be shocked later. That's the only time in the book that she uses the phrase "not expecting it." She also makes a total fool of herself, claiming she can't figure out why the person she is sleeping with has no interest in her:  The main reason why the man never returned my phone calls was because he was so embarrassed about what he had done. This may or may not be true, but it certainly isn't the reason. He was just scared that his friend would find out about his affair and he couldn't face her. He is a coward. He isn't a man. He's just a pathetic piece of shit. She also gives the main character a really bad back story. She says that he was abandoned by his parents as a child. He says that is not true. She then gives her character a history of being raped and molested by her brother. Again, she says this is not the case. Her brother has never been abusive and never even touched her, so that's just bullshit. I'm not going to pretend that I can write anything other than garbage like this. I read a review of this book that described it as "a classic horror story," but this is the exact opposite.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why someone would want to read a book about a vampire.  It's a waste of time.  The only way to get information out of this book is to read the comic strips. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really good. It's so good that I could never use it for a serious work, but I will definitely use it as a "tour de force" of a good book: I used to have a copy of this in my library, but when I finally picked it up it had faded to the point where I couldn't read it, and I didn't have time to look for a new copy. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a good history of science and technology, but especially to anyone who's ever been a teenager or is in the process of being a teenager. It should be mandatory for high school science courses.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book very much. I found it to be a very disorganized book, and to have little to say about many of the problems in modern society. It is also very repetitive, which leads me to believe that the author was not very happy about the book's publication, so he tried to make it look better than it is. The book is also repetitive in a good way, as there are too many chapters about things like the recent economic collapse, how technology is changing our society, etc. It would be better if there was one chapter about how technology has improved our lives in the past 20 years, and one about how it will change our lives a few decades from now. Also, it would be good if the author would have talked about how he is concerned about the social effects of artificial intelligence. I guess my main complaint is that the book has nothing to say to me about why I should care about a certain issue. I am not in favor of having robots take our jobs, but I am concerned about how they will affect our society and how our society will change.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, while interesting and somewhat informative, is extremely poorly written. The whole book is about a small group of people in a small town that has been plagued by "vampire" people for a long time. The only thing that really sets this book apart from other "vampires" books is that it's written by a vampire. I'm glad that the author was able to create a believable world. The problem with the author's "villain" is that the only real threat that he ever shows is that he'll come back and take over. It's like the "sorcerer's apprentice" thing in Harry Potter. There are plenty of "villains" in the real world that would give this book a run for its money, but this one doesn't have any of those characteristics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read!   I have read hundreds of books over the years.   It was very surprising to me that this book could be so bad.  It does not follow the basic structure that most books follow.  They have the same characters.  The plot is a mess.  At one point it is obvious that the author is not a good writer.  This author is a terrible person to have in a group of people.  I am sure that the characters are well written.  If you have the misfortune of having read this book, I suggest you don't bother trying to make it a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book quite dull. The author claims that she is a fan of Stephen King's writing but she didn't find much in this book that she liked. The characters didn't seem to be very developed and didn't really get much of a story arc. I don't know if it's because I didn't like the main character or the main characters in other books in the series didn't make me want to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just a really bad book, a "sneaky" book.   It's not bad in any way - it's just not good.  It is just too long, for one thing.  And I don't know that there is anything to say about the writing other than that it is so bad that it's hard to say anything nice about it.  There are a lot of things in the book that are just plain bad.  The way that this is written is a bit like a bad movie.  I'd be glad to see it burned into my memory like the rest of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read it, I had to put it down because I just couldn't get into it.  It was the same story, but with all the wrong things in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't like this book. It has some good ideas, but it just doesn't flow well.  It's like the author is trying to write a thriller, but he didn't know how to make it interesting.  I guess it's all about the "mystery", but there's so many things that don't add up.  For example:  It turns out the "real" killer isn't even a real person.  And it turns out that the real killer's last victim wasn't a woman, but a boy.  So the real "killer" was actually the police.  But they were wrong about that.  There's also the matter of the "lack of DNA".  The problem is, this "lacking DNA" thing doesn't seem to be the most important thing.  In the end, the whole thing is a big misunderstanding.  The killer is trying too hard to get the police to find something that didn't exist.  Which is kind of a problem.  Other problems include the narrator's constant use of "he" and "she", which really bugs me.  He should say "he", "she" or "they" instead.  Also, he says the victim's blood was used to make the blood splatter in the murder scene.  If you really want to put a "mysterious" twist on it, make the killer tell the cops the victim was a boy, and not a girl.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. It is so badly written that I have to wonder why anyone would want to read it. The plot is completely unbelievable. I don't believe that anyone could really believe that they are reading about a guy who can't remember what his mother did for him as a child. The characters are just plain stupid. There is no character development whatsoever. There are also numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the book. The story is just plain boring. If you're looking for a fun read that's a complete failure, look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm pretty sure that this is one of the worst books I've ever read. I know it's supposed to be a history book, but there's so many bad historical errors and obvious biases that it's hard to believe that this was the work of a trained historian.  It seems as if a lot of time and effort was spent just to make the author look good.  I found myself wondering how he managed to get a Ph.D. in such a poor subject matter, and why he thought this was such a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book, that has been tried, that was never really worth it, and has only gotten worse over time. The "hero" of the story (who I'm sure is supposed to be a good guy) is so poorly developed and stupidly written that it is hard to believe that he is supposed to be a hero. I have read so many books that have poor heros that I just don't know what I expected. I hope this is just a bad story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book about the early Christian church that doesn't work.  The whole thing reads like a parody, with people trying to find the historical Jesus but never really getting it.  It's like the author thought he could use Jesus as a vehicle to get a book published.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part about this book is that I just want to get rid of it. I don't really care about this subject matter. It's not that it's boring or not interesting. It just has nothing to offer to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of YA romance novels. I have always thought they were written by people who have never written romance novels, or who have written mediocre romance novels but thought that a teen romance novel would be a good idea.  I did read this book though.  The plot was predictable and predictable and just did not interest me in the slightest.  It is not like I have read a dozen books about teens, so it was hard to get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad. It has a lot of good parts but is very badly written. I read it through because I thought it would be interesting but I couldn't see what was so good about it. I was very disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book multiple times, but each time I give up after the first few pages. Why can't the story be interesting? I don't care how many characters you have, you can't make people feel real.  It's so obvious how poorly written this is, I can't even get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had the misfortune of reading this book before the one by Mark Twain I had wanted for so long.   The one by Twain had been translated from German by a brilliant translator and is still my favorite English language book.  This one is much worse.  As a result, I had to use my brain instead of my tongue to read it.  The German is not even close to the language I understand in English, but the bad grammar is still there.  It was written by a man who never learned the German language and the language of the author is a little confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad and is just a collection of bad ideas. This is a bad idea and a bad way to do a bad thing.  The concept is fine if you are looking for a new way to think about a good idea, but it is not a good way to come up with a bad one.  It's not like this book is trying to be too good.  But the book is a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book I have ever bought from a non-fiction publisher. It's hard to find anything good about it, but the subject matter is a must read. It is a short book but it covers a good deal of material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time, with too many repetitions of the same stories.  It is a good story that will interest most students, but for my purposes, I found it a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read so many books on how to be successful as a writer. And they have all been wrong.  This book is full of wrong ideas.  I think I should have spent the time to read other books on the subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read the first 3 books in the series and have found them to be fairly dull.  I'm not saying the book has to be good to be interesting, but it's definitely not.  It's just kind of boring, not in a bad way, just dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading this book for many years. I'm pretty sure I read it as a child. The illustrations were just too cool for me to pass up on.   The writing is very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book that, in all honesty, I didn't care about. I didn.t enjoy reading it. The main character is a very obnoxious, overbearing, and self-centered individual who's just looking to get his own way, and is very annoying and annoying. As an avid fan of science fiction, I can't stand this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to read this book, as it was touted as being a "must-read" by many reviewers. I found that there were a lot of contradictions in this book. I think the author was trying to present his theory about the "unthinkable" as something that might actually be possible. He presented this as a possibility, not as a fact. But I think his theory is a bit off. The "unpossible" in this case is the concept of consciousness. The problem with consciousness is that it seems to be impossible to determine exactly what is happening inside someone's head. This is a basic problem with science. If we don't know exactly what's happening in a car's engine, how can we possibly determine what is actually happening in the brain that controls the car? And if consciousness is impossible to measure, how could we ever know if it's possible to have it? I'm sure that if a car had a computer inside it that was able to read the data coming from the brain, that the computer would be able to determine the exact location of the engine. But the brain doesn't seem to be able do this. So if there is no "consciousness" inside a person's brain, what is there that controls our actions? There are a number of theories about this. Some people believe that the brain is a huge computer with many processors. The brain is like a computer that has been built by God, with the ability to make decisions and act based on those decisions. Others believe that it is just like a person that has the ability for thought. There is a theory that there is some sort of consciousness that runs throughout the entire body. I've never found any real evidence for this theory. I also found that some people believe there is "life energy" running through all living things, and that this "energy" can be sensed by people. This theory seems to contradict the idea of a consciousness in the head.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book about four times, each time frustrated by the poor quality of the writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to read this book but it turned out to be very boring.  The plot is very generic.  There are several characters that just happen to have the same personality and a few minor "characters" that don't do much for the plot.  I found myself laughing quite a lot but I also felt that I was supposed to find the humor in it.  It's hard to tell what's supposed to be funny.  And the writing is very poor.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a disaster.  It's a book that's full of holes, bad writing, and stupid ideas.  The author wants to "help" women find husbands but actually just does all that and more for the women.  This is the perfect example of "how to do something better than your dad did it."  He says it's the best way to "avoid the pitfalls of divorce" but he does it the same way he does his other dad's things, he does them wrong.  He writes like a teenager, like he's trying to impress his friends but doesn't even understand how the concept works.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to give it a 1/5. The author does not give a damn about what she's talking about. I just don't get it. I was trying to understand how people with schizophrenia, like the main character, could have a good life. It was only after reading this book that I realized I have not a clue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a boy who goes to see a movie with his family and gets a ticket for a bad one. The movie is terrible and is basically a glorified version of the horror film 'Friday the 13th'. The girl that is played by the girl who plays in that awful musical in 'The Sound of Music' is horrible and a horrible role model. It's also really cheap and really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. The characters are dull, the plot is poorly developed and there is very little plot. The author's attempt at creating a "psychological thriller" is so clumsy that the author's poor attempt at writing is what ruins the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book but found it very boring.   It's not a bad story but  the plot has no impact  on my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a bit surprised to find out that I had to read this book after reading it.  The author's opinion on some of the modern issues that are happening is interesting and well stated, but I think that it would have been a more useful book if the author had tried to go through the various points of view from different historical periods.  If he had been able to do that, it would probably have been much more readable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a little boy who is really good at magic. He learns to do it by watching his dad do it. Then he learns to make it himself. Then his mom teaches him how to use it in the first book, and he's a pro. The problem is that he can only do the magic on a small boy or on other children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book but it was very disjointed and poorly written.   The main characters, and especially the main character,   were extremely boring.  There was nothing that made me want to keep reading about them.  I mean, you know what,  it's not that bad,  but it's just a pretty average story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me about a week to get through this book. The author is good at describing the science, but his explanations are a bit off-putting at times.  There are a few references to physics that seem to contradict one another.  This is one of those books that will be better if you get a good physics background, because it seems that the author is trying to do a lot of things at once.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book expecting a good one. This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. I was extremely disappointed.  I can't believe I bought this book, but I guess that is what happens when you purchase something for a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a horrible piece of crap.  It's a waste of time to read it and to waste money on it.  The author doesn't seem to have anything else to say.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst I've ever read. It is full of bad stereotypes about people of color and makes it seem like all black people are criminals.   This is the worst book ever written about black people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting it to be a good read. I was wrong. It is not a good book. It doesn't make sense. The main character (a male human) can't understand why the human women he likes don't like him back. He wants to get back together with a girl, but they are all dating other guys. I think he should be able to get away with his behavior. It just doesn't seem right to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it is such a bad and amateurish attempt at making a "postmodern" novel, I think I might just give it away to someone else for a few bucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed.   This book seems so great in concept, but it's a very slow burn and is a chore to read.  It seems to have been written by a woman who has never written a book, but is still hoping that she can sell a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book about a good man, but it's not about him. I like to read about people who have done great things in their lives. But this man is not one of them. He's a mediocre businessman with a terrible taste in women.  It's so very sad, and I don't know if he's even aware of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring and very dry. I read the whole thing in a couple hours, but I couldn't get past the end. I've read that a lot of these types of books are the worst of the worst, but this one just wasn't any good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is just so clunky and awkward. It's so hard to get the story across.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of historical fiction in my day, but this is the worst.  It's all about the "American" side of the war, which makes it very boring.  The only thing that makes this book interesting is the fact that the Americans were fighting to protect the rights of a minority that was very small in number.  I can't believe how wrong I was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book.   The writing is terrible and the premise is stupid.  I don't know if this is just a bad first draft by someone who doesn't know how to write a book, or if the author is just trying to write another book in the same universe, but either way it's a poor book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure as a narrative history. The primary narrative source, the French Revolution, is only about 20% of the book. The other 80% is about the Napoleonic Wars.  Even if you can follow the French story through the French revolutionaries and Napoleon (who were only in France for a few years), the French revolution has a lot more to do with the French economy than the Napoleanic wars.  The real story of the French revolutions is the rise and fall of the merchant class.   I am not convinced the French writers ever intended to write a "true" narrative history of the events of the Revolution, but their intention to do so was more than offset by the author's failure to make a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a good book about an unusual character, but I was let down. This book was nothing but the same plot and characters.  The book did include a couple of nice quotes from people who have read the book, but in the end, the book is just a rehashing of the same old story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the hardcover version of "The Good Lord Bird" in order to read it.  However,   I'm very disappointed with this book.  It's basically a very long (and confusing) exercise in bad writing and bad ideas.  I've had my problems with the book's ideas before but I'm just very disappointed that the author chose to waste a lot of time on this.  The author talks about how he was in his teens and how he used to write all kinds of "fantastical" stories.  But the problems that I had with that sort of writing was that I never felt like the writing was real.  Even the "fantasy" elements always seemed artificial.  This book, on the other hand, feels like a cheap copy of the "Wizard of Oz" or a "The Lord of the Rings" book. I have no idea why the author was so hellbent on trying to create a "magical" environment.  If he had just done it on a computer then maybe he could have gotten away with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, I can't even find words to say about it.  If you can't read the book on your own, then you can get a copy of it at the library.  It's not worth it at all.  I had the good fortune of having a teacher who really cared about teaching, and this book is a real lesson in how not to do it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mom is an extremely nice woman, but she's also very opinionated and intolerant of dissent. This book did not disappoint. She's not wrong about most things, but her opinion is very strong. She will go through great lengths to prove that her beliefs are correct, even if it's in her own life or that of a close friend. This is a classic case of someone who's been around too long being so opinionated she can't accept anyone else's opinions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been searching for a good fantasy novel for a while now, and finally found one that didn't make me want to puke.   This is the worst book I've ever read.  The only reason I bought this is that I am obsessed with the books in the series, but I am still disappointed that the author has given us more than enough.  I'm sure the next book in the trilogy will be even worse, but for now, this is a wasted effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most annoying book ever. It is like having a bad friend constantly telling you to do things that are bad for you.  This book tells you how to live a life you don't want.  The advice is always the same, but is usually wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book a bit frustrating, at least for me. It's about a young boy named Mikey who has an imaginary friend named Lola who he believes is his mother.   After the first chapter, the story seems to start getting boring, with Mikey and Lola doing little more than exchanging gifts, and then Mikey has to find Lola because she's missing.  It really got to the point where I was annoyed that Lola wasn't doing anything and I was tired of having to search for her.  So when Lola starts having a big part in the story, I'm really happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read it I hated it.  I felt it was poorly written and poorly explained.  There was no real suspense or tension and the plot was so simple and predictable.  The ending was also rushed and not in a way that made me want to read the sequel.  Overall, this book was just too slow for me to enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited about reading this book because of the good reviews, but I was very disappointed. It is so much worse than the book it was based on.   I am still waiting for the book that is based on the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no purpose. The main idea was very good, but the execution is bad. The author could have used a good editor and writer, but instead they used someone who is not even good at writing. It is very boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not good, nor was it easy to read. The author was so eager to explain everything in this book that it made reading impossible. He is a very good storyteller and has a lot of information to work with. But the information is all over the place, and it is difficult to put everything in context, especially when the book is as long as it is. This book should have been divided into three separate books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a fan of the book. But I'm not a fan at all. It's a very superficial look at an interesting topic. I have no idea how the authors, Michael and Elizabeth, would have even found this subject. It would have been like finding out that the Earth is flat and that the Moon is the sun.  The writing is a little slow for my taste.  It's almost like the author doesn't know anything about the topic.  She uses the wrong word in every paragraph.  There are some good insights and ideas in the book, but they're buried beneath the author's overuse of the wrong words.  I didn't think the book was that good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a little worried about the author's style of writing, but the book is a collection of essays and the author writes in a very clear and easy-to-read style.  He is also very eloquent and entertaining as a writer.  This is definitely one to add to your reading list. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book too confusing for my liking. The narrative of the characters was really hard to follow. The story was a little too confusing to me. I don't understand why a young girl would be able to talk to the Devil, or why the Devil wanted to make a deal with the girl. It was hard to understand the whole story that the Devil was trying to tell her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had no idea this was a novel about a blind man and his cat. However, I did learn some things about this subject: The book does not get into much detail about what is wrong with the blind man. He doesn't want to know that he is blind. He has been told many times that he has a disability and he does not want to hear that he does have one. He is a good natured and intelligent cat. He was taught to be a cat by his father and it shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't believe the authors thought this would be a good idea to put on the Kindle store. It's a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very disappointing. It was really good for about five minutes before I got tired of it. This is a good book to read if you are going to use a video to create something but you need some help in the beginning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad little book that's hard to get through. There are two interesting stories: a guy who can't decide if he likes or hates being a father, and a woman who just can't stop telling the story of her husband's fatal heart attack. The guy's story is a bit like the one I read in "The Way to Live": a couple is talking about how they're going to get divorced. The wife says she hates divorce and the husband says "I know, but that's my way." I suppose there are lots of stories like that in the world. I just don't think I'd be that interested in them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book while driving in the dark with no flashlight. I found it quite dull.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not bad, but I was hoping for a lot more from a sequel.   The story is good, but the pacing is terrible.  The characters are really dull.  I don't really care if it is an all female team, but it's still too cliche. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an attempt to create a narrative about the war from the point of view of the German soldier. In the first few chapters, it is clear that the author is not an expert on military matters. The book is poorly written and poorly researched. The author uses the phrase "I could care less about a war that isn't worth my time" as a catchphrase to describe his attitude toward war. This is very problematic because if you don't care about a conflict, why would you participate in it? The book has some good ideas about the need to treat wounded soldiers, but there is no attempt to give a coherent account of the actual events at the front. The only thing I found useful was the chapter on a "good guy" German soldier and the treatment he received at the hands of the British, but that's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book in a series I have been looking forward to reading for years but never did.  I am not a big fan of urban fantasy and I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of having to do something you don't want to do just because a girl does.   The main character in this book is a nice girl who is also an assassin.  She is a bad ass and has a pretty good time.  The problem is that the book ends with her being captured by a group of thugs and thrown into a dungeon.  It is not clear what happens to her after that.  My one other problem is the ending.  There is so much potential for a sequel that I was really looking forward for it but I just never saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know if I'll ever be able to look at a book the same way again.  I'm an avid reader, but I have to say that this book left me completely disappointed.  The characters were interesting, but they were not interesting enough to stay with me.  My expectations were low for this book, but this was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a very good writer, but she over-explains everything in her books.   Her books are very dry and the writing is sometimes confusing, but at the end of the day it's still enjoyable to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very poorly written and written poorly. It is written as if it is the first time the author read it. The book talks about a lot of things that are not important or not true. For example, a man who is afraid of being arrested, but is very sure he did nothing wrong in a police stop. The author gives the police officer a lot more credit than he deserves, claiming that he is very careful about being in the right when a suspect is in the police station and doesn't "think twice about it."    I wish the author had included the following information in the book: 1) Police officers should have a high tolerance for suspects.  If they are very worried about the suspect's mental health or the suspect is not under arrest but is on probation, they should treat them as a danger to themselves and their family. 2) If you don't think you have done anything wrong in the first place, you should not be in the Police station.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to be blunt:  The only reason this book is not in the top 10 is that it was published by a smaller company (i.e.   It was written for an audience that could not afford a hardcover)   I think this book should be a major hit because the plot is very interesting and there are some very good twists in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not bad in any way, but it is not good either. This book has a lot of good things about it, but no one that I know has any real experience with them, so the author has no idea how to present them in a coherent way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried this book out for the first time after hearing a friend rave about it.  The author said she wanted to write a story that had been told before and she did that.  I have no problem with the story itself but the author's lack of attention to the details really bothers me.   It was very difficult to believe that she was telling the same story over and over.  She also kept using the same lines for each character.  It is hard to believe she has written this many books about the same character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a woman who goes to the hospital after her son has died and she is told he has cancer. The woman thinks he has a terminal disease and has no reason to go to the doctor, but when she gets there he's just "very sick".   She takes his life in order to get him to a doctor.   I don't know if this is an example of a "bad" book or if it's a bad story, but it is a bad, bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe I just finished a book that was a waste of space and boring. It's like they did a rewrite to get the author's name in the book title, but didn't have the decency to make the changes after the book was published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. I have been a huge fan of Tolkien's work since the first time I read The Hobbit. The books were very good but Tolkien was never able to do justice to Middle Earth. This book is nothing like his masterpiece. It is full of errors, the writing is terrible, and the story is not really Tolkien's. It was an abomination.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the book, but the story didn't work. The main character is very boring and uninteresting. It is not his fault that the story takes place in a prison. I thought I would have liked to know more about him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard that the author has some issues with grammar.  I didn't find it to be an issue in this book.  The sentences he writes are clear, concise, and grammatically correct.   The only problem I found with it was that some of the characters were given incorrect names.  While it's not a big deal, I just felt like it would have been better to have some of these names in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book but the only interesting thing is that it has a picture of the author on the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "Reverse-Flashback" section is a really, really bad idea. There's too much detail about my dad's first relationship with a woman. It's almost like they wanted me to know so they could write a positive book about me having a first relationship. It also takes a while to realize that my dad and the woman he cheated on had a very intense sexual relationship that ended badly (I think). They were also the ones that ended up cheating on me, and then he kept cheating on her. My dad is a very self-centered person, and that probably explains why he is such a horrible person in general.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with some interesting ideas but is a little too much of a book about being the new kid in a big family to actually work.   There is a lot of information about what is wrong with the family structure, how it leads to a lot more problems, and a lot about how to be a new kid without really trying.  I thought this book would be a great read, but I wasn't impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has written two previous "realistic" history books that were so inaccurate that the first time I read them I laughed.   This is no exception.  I can't believe how much of the history in this book is made up.  They are supposed to be the first settlers of America but they didn't leave a single footprint, there is not one piece of evidence that the "Eve Indians" existed, they did not colonize the East coast (I've never heard of one that came from there), and the people that were here at the time did not look like the "Indian" people.  This book is completely unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. I was expecting a better book than this. The plot is boring and repetitive. The characters are stereotypical and they all have the same traits. It would be easier to find something good about the characters if the story was better. It's just a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book.   It is well written and has good examples.  It does not go into detail about every single technique, but at least there is a good amount of that in this book. It would be good to have more about how to get a good look at a good looking person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book but I think that the author, John Updike, didn't know much about literature.  He says in the introduction that the book is based on the book "The Story of the Life of Lord Dunsany", but the text is really too long for that.  It is also very difficult to understand the plot.  The story is set in Scotland about the time of the Arthurian legends, and it was a long time before I got the plot that was so interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not live up to its promise.   It's a boring book.  There's nothing that's new in this book.     The only thing that made it worthwhile was that it was the first time I've read a book by a professor of medieval history.  I'm not a big fan of academic stuff, but there's something about the way this professor has managed to cram so much in in a book that's so small that it makes it very hard to get the information you need.  The fact that this professor is using medieval history to teach students about modern issues is just silly.  It would be better to use an actual history book that is written by someone who's a historian. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not interesting at all. I found myself having to put the book down several times just because it was so tedious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a fun book about a girl who thinks she is a vampire.  She has no friends or family to turn to, and she ends up having to go to a doctor for treatment.  I was hoping the story would take off after that, but  this book has some problems.  The writing is awful, with the most egregious example being when a character calls herself a "real vampire".  The book tries to be a romance, but that just doesn't work.  A lot of the characters just don't seem real to me, especially when I'm trying to make sense of the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess. It is full of grammatical errors, nonsensical phrases, and poor historical understanding. The author makes some very poor historical claims about the period. For example, he claims that the Great Awakening was a movement that occurred after the Civil War, and not a new religious movement. He also claims that "The Great Awakening" was the first major religious movement of the 19th century. I do not know why he thinks this, but I also do not think that the Civil Rights movement was the movement that started the Great awakening. I am very disappointed in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book at all. It is filled with the usual things that many reviewers complain about: excessive use of "the" and "but" and not much else. It also doesn't help that the author seems to think he's an academic when in fact he's not at all, or that his style is so amateurish it's hard to follow. I think it's really bad to put "the", "but", and "in the" in front of every single word. That's not even a proper noun! I also found it hard to believe that all of these different types of people (the intellectuals, the intellectuals who are married to the intellectuals, etc.) can have the same life experiences (or "life story" if you prefer) and can still have "the same values". It's kind of like that one guy who doesn't think there are many women in the world because he only dates guys like himself. It's a very self-defeating attitude. In fact, it's the kind of attitude that would make my grandparents very, very sad, but it's exactly the kind I've been taught to believe in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book at all. The author had the idea of having the hero have to go to school. She did this in order to provide a reason for her hero to have to learn, but then went on to explain that he just didn't get it and didn't know why she did it.  The other problem I have is that she didn't use a female protagonist to show the difficulties of being a boy.  I thought that was the purpose of this book but I'm not so sure anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book. But the author was clearly a bad writer. It's all so obvious that the story and the characters were just thrown together to be the star.  This book should not have been published in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very bad read.  I've read a few things about how I need to read more, and this is the first one that makes me wonder.   It's very hard to find good non-fiction books about the church in general, but I found this one.  It gives a good summary of things, but also leaves out a lot of important details. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished reading this book. The author makes a lot of assumptions about people and about themselves. For example:  The author believes that the reason that there are so many homeless people is that they are so "stupid".  This is completely wrong.  A homeless person is just as stupid as anyone else.  Most of the homeless people he describes are mentally ill.   He then goes on to say that if we could get rid of the mentally ill, then we would also get rid off the mentally handicapped.  This seems reasonable to me.  However, the author is wrong about the mentally retarded.   They don't make up a majority of the population.   I believe that the mentally insane are a very small percentage of the total homeless population.  He also says that people who are homeless because they are mentally retarded are "drugged out" or "socially retarded".    This is also wrong.   People who are mentally disabled don't usually need to be drugged out or socially retarded.  It is true that people on welfare and in prison get "medicated" because they need to take a drug to get them to sleep.  There are also other people who get medicated, but that is not what he is talking about.   The reason he is wrong is that he is assuming that mentally retarded people are just as smart as people who aren't mentally retarded, and that they don't need to get a "treatment" to keep them from becoming homeless.  What he should have said is that there is a reason why mentally retarded children have problems.  One reason is because they have a different learning style.  They tend to do math much more slowly than other people.  Another reason is that the brain doesn't have a good way to tell that the child is done with math.  And a third reason is, as he says in his book, that people with mental retardation don't really care about the things that are important to them.  We can say that people have a "lack of empathy", but that's not what mentally retarded kids do.  If the mentally mentally retarded don't like their homework, that doesn't mean that they will stop working hard on their math problems.   And, as I said before, the mentally disabled usually have problems with other people because they often have a hard time understanding other people's emotions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been searching for the perfect book about the Vietnam war, and this is it. There is no "bad" about this book; it is a "great" book. I can't recommend this book enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just got this book and it's absolutely terrible! I got the hard copy version from the library and decided to read it because it's in a nice softcover. I'm disappointed that the only thing that makes up for this terrible book is the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as part of a gift set from my husband. The only good thing about it is that it's in French.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was just a bad copy of "The Way of Men." I got the book because I liked the author and thought he was writing a good book.  I was wrong.  The only good thing about this book is that I can now read the original version of " The Way of Man " (it's really good).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, who had been a student of my own (I had taught him) in grad school, seemed genuinely interested in my thesis (the relationship between literature and history) and seemed to be working on the book for quite some time. The book was not the book I thought it was. I thought that the author was trying to use the historical evidence to support a political argument. I didn't think he had done a good job of it, but that was a long time ago.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book at a library book sale, but I am not so sure that I liked it. I don't care for many of the books in this collection. It is a very long book with only one good story in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of the things I like about the novel are in the first fifty pages or so but by the time we get to the second half of the book I find it hard to be enthusiastic about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that the author has a tendency to write poorly. It doesn't happen all the time but it does happen enough that I'm surprised that he's still published at all. The most egregious example was the chapter about the "Gorilla-like" creatures in the book.   They don't fit at all, they look nothing like gorillas, and they don't behave like gorillas at all; they just stand there and stare.  (p. 10)   The only way to get them to interact with a person is to ask them questions, which the reader has to read over again after the initial "question" in order to get a response.    (p. 27)  I had to do the same thing at least twice in order for them to start interacting with the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading the Harry Potter series and the Deathly Hallows (which are in this series) since I was in middle school.  They are my favorite fantasy books.  I am sorry but there's no way to compare the two.  Rowling's characters are so much more well written and fleshed out than anyone's in the Harry or Dumbledore series.   Rowling knows how to write a story with depth.  She is the only person I've ever heard that compares Rowling's writing style to Tolkien's.  It's just ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not good but is better than a bad novel. I had read several books about the Nazi occupation of France but I had no idea about the "special unit" that used a combination of torture and rape to extract confessions from captured French civilians. The book tells the story of the French Resistance (PJ) and how they were trained in how to torture and then use them as spies. They did this to many innocent civilians in a variety of places but they were successful in getting the most useful information about the enemy. The author's use of the term "special" is a good indication that she did not have a lot of background on this subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't love this book but it did teach me a lot about how a book can be ruined.    The first two chapters are pretty good, but the middle chapters are all about how the author has a bad time with the people in her life and how she was just as unhappy as I was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 2 volumes of this trilogy are just too much work for too little payoff.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say this book is so boring and uninspiring. It's not like it's bad writing or bad writing in general is a bad thing but it just feels like it takes forever to get there. I really wanted to like it but it's so uninteresting and just all over the place. It was like I was reading something that was just a bunch of things that could have been done better or faster in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about this book. I love historical fiction and this book was just about the best historical fiction I have read in a while. I thought the book was very interesting and a good look at the times when America was at its most "civilized." Unfortunately, that "civilization" has not been there since then. As a result, most of the time the authors write like they are trying to out-talk their subject rather than describe it. The author also seemed to be very proud of his own history book when he was writing this one and his historical knowledge seemed to come in bits and pieces throughout. I'm sure there are better books out there but I doubt this one will be one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was on sale and the only thing that made me think I would enjoy it was the cover (a drawing of a little guy riding a unicorn) and the subtitle, "What It's Like to Be a Baby"  Unfortunately the book was not good, it was very badly written, and poorly researched.    I don't know why I read it, it just felt wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of the Harry Potter series. It's not that I don't enjoy reading it, but I'm just not a big fan of reading a series that is so dependent on Harry's personality and the magical elements that surround it. This book is basically just that. It has little to do with Harry, and a lot to do about the main character. As a fan, I'll try to hold out until the last book in the series, but my curiosity got the best of me, and I read it in one day. I'm very disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last few chapters have very little to do with the rest of the book.  This is a very basic story about a woman who finds out her husband is cheating on her.  It's a fairly interesting story, but the end was very disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess and it is not a good idea to start with a book like this.  This is the first of many to come from the new crop of "new agers" that seem to be out there in force these days.  Unfortunately, most of them have little idea what they are talking about or what they really want to do.  The book is well written, but I can't help but think that most of it was written by the same person who wrote "The New Food Revolution" and the "New World Food Order."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so annoyed about this book.    A lot of people claim that it is a great work of fiction.  But it is very far from that.  It is a very bad book. I think it is only because it is set in a world where people can get away with all sorts of terrible things that I enjoy it.  In the real world, people who commit atrocities such as this are executed.  I wish I could have seen a man in the book who was tortured and tortured and then executed for his crimes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several books about women's sexuality, but this one was the only one that felt totally out of place in my sex life. The authors of this book seem to have a problem with female sexuality - it's so "manly" and "sensual" - but I can't get into it. It's just a bunch of weird words thrown together. And I hate that I've wasted my time with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most fun I had reading a book was in the second half of this book.   It's funny, it's educational, and it's fun.  The problem is the ending.  That's the only thing that really bothers me about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for my high school reading group as a "prequel" to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the first half of the book was just a lot of rehashing and a lot for the sake of retelling. The only interesting character was the main bad guy, which is why he was a main baddie in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found myself reading the beginning and the end of this book before I finished it. It seemed that every book by David Foster Wallace ended with a cliffhanger, and I'm sure I've seen this in a few other Wallace books. But this one was even more frustrating because I really wanted to like this book. It's just so weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a young girl who is very bright but also very self-absorbed. She thinks she is "good" and everyone else is "bad".    The ending was not good for me either as the book came to an end at a very unsatisfying cliff hanger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry, but this book really did not interest me. I'm not even a fan of the genre, so I was not expecting much. I have never read a book that seemed so shallow and shallow as this one. The characters were mostly boring. The main character had a boyfriend at the beginning and was always doing things to get him to notice her, but I don't think that had much to do with the book. The only character that I cared about was the heroine, but her relationship with the main character didn't work out. She was always trying to get the guy to notice a part of herself that she didn't like. She tried to make him like her but he didn't want to be with her, so she tried to change him but he wouldn't. She would have been better off just staying in her room and writing a diary about her life in a boring suburban house.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive review I have is this:  I have been waiting to read this book for months and months and the publisher had to put a hold on it so that I could read it in the library.   It is my favorite book of all time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not really a history, but more a story told by an anonymous soldier of the US army in the middle east.   It's all about his experiences, but I was not really interested in what he did and how he did it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book, but it was written with an arrogant attitude. The story is excellent, but the author is too quick to give a conclusion.  He does not allow enough time to allow the reader to question the conclusion. In my opinion, the author should have tried to use a more logical argument in the conclusion, but instead he chose to be the first to give it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for a good adventure story. The characters are all cardboard cutouts, there's no depth to the story, and the plot is a complete and utter mess. There is no reason why there should be a war in the middle of the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard a lot about this book, but it wasn't until I finally tried to read it that I realized I didn't really get it.   The main character is a high schooler who has a crush on a classmate, but her crush isn't reciprocated.  This girl is actually a vampire (it's spelled that way in the book) and her powers make her seem like a normal girl.  She's also a lot more intelligent than a normal high school girl would be.  Her powers make the vampire thing less funny, but I still enjoyed the vampire story.  Overall, it's not a bad novel, but there were parts of it that bothered me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a boy who is taken to a fantasy world. The world is not a fantasy, it is a nightmare. The characters are horrible. The story is stupid. The plot is bad. The author is horrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not worth the money.  I can only give it three stars because the writing is really good.  I am not a huge fantasy fan, but I do enjoy fantasy books that take place in an alternate world.   I have been looking for a book that takes place in that world for years and finally found it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been trying to get my head around this book for a while now. It's a bit too hard to describe to someone who hasn't read the series. The plot is just too convoluted to be understood. I found myself confused by the different character's motivations. The last few episodes were even harder to follow than the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book about a very bad experience I had with a person who I thought was a "nice guy." I did have a good time with him, but I had to have the book right after the last chapter because I couldn't get through it without having to read it all over again. He also gave me bad advice about buying a gun and shooting at something that I thought could hurt me, but it didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bad read. It's the same thing over and over and it's not funny at all.   I'm sorry but the author doesn't have a funny bone in her body. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narrator's voice is a bit stilted and he has a habit of repeating things, but that's the least of his problems. The story is about a man who finds a strange magic stone, which he can use to open up a door, but the door opens only for the one who holds the stone. The narrator is a very boring narrator, and the story is nothing but dull exposition. I'm not sure if it's the narrator's fault or if it just is so dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of errors.  The author claims that there is no reason to call the author a thief (which he has never been convicted of) and that he never took a bribe from the publishers.   This is untrue.  I do not know of any other author who has been convicted.  Also,   the publishers (the same ones that tried to kill him over the previous book) were trying to put a bad review on the back cover.  This reviewer did not do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know what to say about this book other than it is very sad.   It is a really sad book that is very well written and does a good job of portraying the problems a mother has in trying to get her child back after he is kidnapped by the CIA and taken away.  There are some very realistic scenes in this book as she deals with the child who is mentally ill and doesn't really know what is happening to him.  She is unable to understand the fact that this is not something that he can control and that she has to accept that there is no way he can be returned.  This book also shows her accepting the fact she has a problem in trying too hard to get the boy back but also being able to understand that she is just trying to protect him from the world.  It seems as if she is so upset about not having the boy that she can't take a day off from work to go find him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all.   The story is about a man and his wife who have a terrible relationship with a dog.  The husband wants to get rid of the dog and the wife is against it.  When they start arguing about it, they end up getting divorced.  It's an interesting idea and interesting writing but the ending is so terrible it makes me not want to finish the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the chance to read a really nice book. It is not the type of book you should expect to enjoy for its "content". It is more about the author and his/her personality than the content. But I was very happy with the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why this book is called "Furry Fandom: The World of My Friends"  I know there are people out there who would like a furry book, but this one is so poorly written and the furry community so small it's just an awful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first time I've read a book by a woman, and I was very disappointed. I enjoyed the first half of the book, but after that, I just couldn't get into it.  I've been looking for a good women's history book about the 19th century that I can get through on a single page, but I've had little luck.  This book has a lot of good stuff to say about women, but the first third of the writing just isn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many books that I liked but this one disappointed me.   This is an excellent book about a girl who tries to kill herself after a breakup.  She does a great job of getting across her story of how her parents treated her for being gay and how this has changed her.  I'm not surprised that a gay woman would be unhappy with her parents but I don't like how she portrays her parents.  There is no sense of love and concern in her story.  And I thought the author had a lot of things to say about the "family" and what it is about them that makes them so awful.  It would have been interesting to read a more positive book about her and her family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of "What I learned at X" lists. I've had to learn about many things that I thought I knew before, but the lists are well done and helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a man who was born with no hands. He is so blind that he can't even use his thumbs. He goes blind and then learns how to use his hands after he has surgery. He lives in a house with other people who have the same handicap as he does. The author does a good job of describing the handicap and how it impacts the people around him. I wish this book was more widely available to help blind people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book to learn some French words I hadn't used in ages, but I got very confused by the grammar rules. I was also confused by a lot of the slang words (it's not easy to learn new slang words) and the author's explanations of some slang words were rather lame (which I think is a common problem in a book like this). I've read several books by the same author before, and this one just didn't grab me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not been able to finish this book.   The story is poorly written and lacks substance.  It is also very long, and I have read many books in this series, so I can't see how the author can get away with this level of writing.  I hope that the series comes back, but I doubt it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a newbie to this genre.  I bought this book because I thought it might interest me.  The book was a hit with my daughter and her friends.  They loved it!  The plot was easy to follow.  My problem is the author does not write.  She is a great story teller but her writing is not up to the standard I had hoped for.  It was good enough for me but not for my daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to find a new book by a really good author!  But it turned out that the author has a nasty habit of making mistakes and omissions, and not being able to catch up to the times.  I read the first two chapters and felt I was missing something.   I went to another site for more information and found out that they have been reissued with new chapters by the author's daughter.  This new edition includes some corrections to earlier chapters, but it is not enough to make up for the many errors in the previous edition.  There is a new foreword by the writer.  But I am still not happy about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I can say about this book is that it does not live up to the hype. I'm sorry but the plot is too boring. The whole premise is about a woman who is kidnapped by a cult who believes she is a reincarnated ancient god. Then they go to her village and show her pictures of what they believe are the "reincarnated" gods. They are obviously idiots, because there is nothing in these pictures that resemble the "real" gods at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book several times now, and each time I've had the same reaction:  "Wow, this is soooo boring!"    It's a pretty good book in that it's very short, and there are no huge surprises or plot twists, but I still can't see myself ever finishing it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a collection of short stories, each about one of a series of kids who are forced to learn the truth about a horrible childhood abuse at the hands of their parents. This book really makes no sense, and it has no redeeming qualities. It's a waste of time and a waste to purchase a book that has no value.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read. This book is supposed to be about a man who has to live with a woman who has an addiction to a drug that makes her feel good. In real life, I have been dealing with an addiction myself for about five years. This author thinks that the only thing a man can do is turn his wife into a "drug mule". The most stupid thing about the book is that he uses this drug to get over his wife and have a good sex life. He spends the rest of the book trying to figure out how to make this drug work for him. This is a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been wanting to read this book for a long time, but I kept putting it off. The first time I saw it was on a book review site, and I realized I just didn't get it.  I liked the idea of the story, and liked the way it was written, but it just wasn't what I wanted to read about.  It felt like a collection of little stories that were told in a pretty generic way, rather than a well-rounded story about a character who grows up and is challenged by the things he's been told throughout his life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know if I'll ever finish a book.   It's so poorly written and is full of bad examples that it makes the other reviews in this book all look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't remember what happened next, but when the book finished, I read it over and over again, and thought about the story a lot.  I was so shocked at how well written it was.  It was so well written that I almost dropped it, and I still can't believe that I got it.  The writing is really great, and it was the first time I was reading something I didn't like, and the book made me realize that I like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. I don't think I ever want to read another book written by a woman. Her writing is terrible. It's so obvious that she wrote the book to please a man. I found myself wondering what the guy was up to while she was writing her book. The man she is referring to is my dad, who has a lot of problems with women and is trying his best to deal with them. I really don't understand the book at all, and will not be reading it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am extremely disappointed in this book.   First off, I don't think I can be a fan of a story that tells the story of a man who goes around trying to prove that he is more than just an average man.  It is the "normal" man who suffers from all the problems that plague our society - and the author has to go and "help" him to be normal - it is just too bad he doesn't have a plan to help the "other" side of his personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible. The premise is weak, and the premise is really weak.  The characters are so flat that it's like they're just there for the sake of a plot device.   The story takes a turn that isn't believable, but then it backtracks.  I don't see a future in the characters either.  There is no reason for the characters to be together, and I can't believe the author put this much thought into the ending.  This book would not have been good for me at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book. It had me intrigued but didn't get me to want to read more.  I was reading this as a "what if" scenario and thought "Well, if this guy doesn't come up with anything to do with the aliens, that could be a real drag."  I also thought that the book was long on details that weren't very interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a kid, but I don't remember it.   The main character, the girl who runs the store, is always running late.  She's always on the verge of doing something she'll regret, which is why I can't stand her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really bad.   It's a collection of some of the worst books I've ever read.  It is a compilation of bad stories.  The bad stories:  1.  I read this book as a kid.  In fact, I still have the book I bought as a gift for a relative who liked this book.  He read the entire book in one sitting.  2.  When I was a child, I read a lot of books.  This was one of the books that I didn't like.  Why?  It was written in a childish style.  3.  Another bad book I read as a child was "Mud" by Mary Elizabeth Braddon.  Braddon had a big personality.  4.  " The Dark Tower:  The Gunslinger    A fantasy novel set in the world of Stephen King's   "The Gunslinger"   series  .   It's a dark fantasy novel.  5.  There were some other books I read when I was young that I really liked.  This book is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book is the biggest reason I didn't want to read it.   I had been reading many books about people's thoughts on religion and the Bible and what they think about it. I really didn't know how many times this book was published.  I have been very busy in my life recently, and so the thought of wasting a good book on a book I haven't read yet made me not want to get into this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read.  This book is very badly written and is full of mistakes.  The main characters are really irritating.   It is a poor book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story of how this book came to be is one that should have been done long ago, but the author did not.   There is no way the characters would ever get together if the author hadn't done a few revisions on the original manuscript. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book at all. I'm a fan of the book "Rivers of London" by E.J. Belloc, but that book was written by a professional writer and is about a professional, professional person. The book in this book was a hodgepodge of various styles. I don't understand the author's decision to combine all the different styles.  The first section was a little dry and the second was a bit more lively, but the final section was dry and boring.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In case you are a big fan of fantasy novels, or have a deep love for a particular series, this one is going to suck you in.   The first third of the book is great and the rest is a big waste of time.  There are many interesting things in this book but the author does not make use of them.  A story about a young girl in the middle of the world trying to escape a horrible fate.  The author can have her heroes be more interesting, but it would have been nice to see some of the villains at work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book really difficult to read. It took me 3 days to finish reading it.   My favorite characters (the ones I liked) weren't the ones who ended up getting caught.  The one I didn't like as much as others were the ones whose stories ended up making it into the movie:    The guys who used to go to the park and try to beat the girls up.  That's how they met each other:  I went there with my friends, and they started beating the shit out of each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is an absolute fucking idiot, but he's not a complete idiot. He has a degree in computer science, and he's a good enough programmer to know he's making an awful mistake when he starts describing a network with many clients and servers that all have to talk to each other. I understand that you have to be able to talk about the network to write about it, but if you can't use a good basic understanding of the network in order to do that, then you don't deserve to write anything about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of this book is really good but it's the middle half that's really boring and a total waste of time. It's so bad I can't imagine anyone reading it but me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time and money, and I would recommend it only to those who want a quick read. I read it in one sitting, and it was a real bore. It has a lot of information about things that are common sense but are totally out of date. If you want to know what to do about a problem, just find out what the problem is, and then figure out how to get rid of it. If it takes more than ten minutes to figure out what is wrong, you are doing it wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author makes no attempt to explain or justify his claims about what the Egyptians did to the pyramids. He says that he has heard that they did this in the early 20th century and that this is why the pyramidal shape was so perfect. But he never explains why he thinks this. It's very difficult to believe that the Egyptians didn't know better about this. The only thing that seems clear is that he just wanted to prove that the pyramid was a much better building than the Egyptian temples that he visited in Egypt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've only read the first few chapters of this book and it's just bad.   It's just boring, and all the information in it is completely useless.  I just don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in college, and it took me a while to get through it.  It's basically a bunch of short stories that seem to be about a group of friends living in a house where one person is always the weirdest person.  This book seems to be the source material for a TV show,  but I can't watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book.   The story, although interesting, seemed a little rushed and didn't seem to be built on a solid foundation.  I didn't feel that the book was written by a master storyteller like Tolkien or even J.R.R Tolkien, but a good writer who just had a bad day. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this is a very poor book and very poorly written. The writing style is too direct and very flat. The characters are flat and poorly developed.   It takes the author too long to get to the point and the plot is pretty contrived.  The ending is also very poorly done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only bad, it is so poorly written that I can only imagine the author's embarrassment when he finally read it.  The first sentence is just a bit too pretentious.   It's like a book reviewer who's never written a bad review of a book because they don't know that they've written one.  If this book is any indication, the author should just stop writing.  I'm disappointed because I was really looking forward to reading a book about the history of the world's religions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book for Christmas and read it the day after. I have had no problem with any of the authors in the past and this book was no exception. This book was so bad that I was left thinking that the author either is so lazy that she can't come up with anything original, or she is such a racist that she thinks the best way to make black people feel bad is to make them feel like they are being discriminated against.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just bad. The story is poorly written and the characters are stereotypical as hell.   The whole thing is just silly and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have bought and read many books about the Vietnam War. I've also purchased many books that are not very good. But none of them are this bad. The author should not have to put so much time and effort into this book just to get one sentence right. I don't care if this book helps people in the future, it was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.  This book is a "myth" as the title suggests.  The myth is that a man who is good at anything (sports, reading, etc) who is also a good Christian will be a successful and well adjusted Christian.  While I think that this myth has some truth to it (the "man who has everything" is a popular myth), it's the myth that gets repeated in the book and which leads the author to write it in the first place.  I had no idea that there was anything to the "man with everything" myth, so I was surprised when the author decided to make it his central myth.  At one point, the author even implies that the "bad Christian" is the one who is really going to change.  Even worse, the myth is reinforced when the good Christian's son starts having problems with God.   I think the author should have just made it clear from the beginning that the man with everything was never going to be a good or successful Christian.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think anyone who loves books can stand the thought of reading this one.   This is an atrocious book.  The plot is nonsensical, the characters are so shallow and stupid, the dialogue is so horrible that I had to pause it every time it was spoken.  It's like someone wrote a book that was supposed to be funny but the author couldn't think of a single funny thing to say.  This was one of the worst books I've ever read, but then I remember that I've read worse in my day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is so clearly in love with her book that she has no clue that she is going to have to write a series of sequels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't think it was a bad novel but I guess it is after reading it. I enjoyed it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can not recommend this book highly enough. I love science fiction, but have always been put off by it.  The story is interesting, but the writing is clumsy and the plot doesn't make any sense.  It is a good read, but I cannot recommend it highly enough to those who want a good story but don't mind a bit of science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of anecdotes that I have heard from other people but have never seen in print.  I am always amazed at how easy it is to tell a story that is completely false.  The story of a woman who was given the name "Maggie" by a girl she went to high school with.  Maggie was always a pretty girl but never did much on the dance floor.  A group of girls had her number but they never had her invite her to go to prom with them.  She finally went to a prom and was very nervous.  They all laughed at her.  But when they saw her at the dance, they all got in her car and drove to prom.  That was the end of that story.  It is very sad that there are people out there that think it is possible to create a name by stealing someone else's name.  This author did not even have to research any of the stories before he used them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard about this book and thought it was going to be the greatest book ever, but after reading it, I think I just got disappointed. I don't know if the book was bad or what, but I'm glad I just threw it in the trash because there was nothing about it I liked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book I would recommend to anyone.    It's a textbook that teaches you how to get away with sexual assault, but not how to stop it.  The author, the author's father, is an attorney and a convicted sex offender, and his father's book is based on his father and the book is meant to be a book about how to avoid prosecution.  It isn't.  This book does not teach how to be safe around women or men who might try to force you into sexual acts.  Rather, it teaches how to control and manipulate women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book because I like historical fiction, but I couldn't find anything about this person that was positive about her.  The book is basically about a very wealthy, very powerful woman who is extremely unselfish and who is very self-deprecating, even to her enemies.  She seems to be very good friends with people she considers friends.  Her family is not really impressed with her wealth and power, but her daughter is a very nice person.  It is not clear why she spends her life giving to other people, other than that she is not terribly interested in herself or in making money.  I found that very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been a huge fan of George R.R. Martin's works ever since he came out with his first epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire.   This book is not only not epic but is very short compared to his other works.  While Martin has never been shy about his dislike of the fantasy genre, I do think that this book would have been much better if he had not been so tight lipped about his thoughts on the genre.  This is a short book and as such has little to offer.  The world building is extremely weak.  There is no real mystery, the world building suffers in the same way that all other fantasy series suffer, it's a fantasy without any real heart or substance.  I found myself wishing that Martin would release a series of novellas, which would have served the same purpose.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about this book is that it is short.   If you're reading a novel and want to know about a particular topic but you can't find it, you can find out here.  This book is about the early history of America, from the early French explorers in New France to the first European settlers in the Carolinas.  The story of the Cherokee Indians and the Powhatan Indians is very well done.  It's an interesting look at the early colonies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the most boring "how to" book you'll ever read. The main advice is the same: make sure that you keep up with the "latest" "best" "most innovative" and "most unique" things that are out there. I'm not sure I'm in the "modern" category, but I've got better things to do with my time than spend hours researching and buying all the latest things in a field that I'm no longer interested in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the Vietnam War I don't think the author has done a very good job. I don�t think he has any interest in writing about the subject and the writing itself is not very good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time.  It is a collection of bad ideas from a bad author.  The only good thing about this book is the pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but I had a lot of trouble finishing it.   The author is very good at describing the emotions of others and giving a sense of their own, but in the end he does not really convey it well.  I think he is very sensitive about this in his writing, and I think it would be helpful if he would focus on the emotions themselves.  If he does that, I think this book would be a much better read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of the last few months' postings of my blog.   It's pretty much the same material in each posting, and there's no new material that I haven't already posted in a different blog.        In the end, it's more a collection than a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why this book is on the list.  I read this book a few years ago.   I liked it then.  The main character was a bit dull.  His actions were predictable.  It's a very simple story.  A bit disappointing that this book isn't more popular. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had a couple of good books from the late 19th century, but this one was not a good one.  I think the author didn't know his subject.  As a former university professor I was surprised that he did not have a better understanding of the period, especially since he was one of the best historians in the country at that time.  The writing was clumsy and poorly argued.  It is a great book to read for people who are interested in the history of economics, but I don't know if it would be a good read for someone who is trying to understand the period.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of short stories by a very famous writer of science fiction. The stories are very funny but it's hard to tell if they are just a bunch of weird things happening to him. He talks about being in the middle of a car crash, getting stung by a bee, and a very creepy experience with a guy who put a cat in a jar. It is very hard to listen to someone read a story in which he talks about the "fatal attraction" that he feels to certain women.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did enjoy this book. But I felt the author could have done a better job writing about what a great time she had as a child. The characters seemed very shallow and her descriptions of them as childish or immature were not believable. I felt that she was trying to write about being a kid for the first time, and I just did not like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a huge fan of the series but this one left me cold.   The characters were all over the place and the story was very confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing in this book is that the author is trying to be funny but ends up being so stupid that he has no idea what he's talking about.  I really don't think it's a good idea to use humor as a cover for stupidity.  He makes the argument that if a man's penis gets stuck in his own testicles, he can't get it out, but he doesn't know that if you can't reach something with a rope, you have to use it.  If you're going to make fun of a person's stupidity, make it a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has a very nice flow to it but it is just too much to put in one book.  The authors do not use many of the most common words in the English language (and are very careful to say the correct ones)  Some people think this is a problem with the book but it really isn't.  This is a book written for the computer user and it would be nice to see it used a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a lot of stories and have been reading fantasy for many years. I am very happy that I have found this story. It is an interesting story about a young woman, who I found out is a vampire, and her father who doesn't seem to like that she's a vampire. He doesn't want her to get the attention that her new job as a vampire gets her. But the story doesn't really start off that way. The story is interesting enough to keep me interested. However, I found that I didn't feel very close to the characters. There was not enough information given to know if the father was being true or if he really did dislike the young woman.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to say I didn't enjoy reading this book.  The author does not explain what is wrong with this book, which is bad enough.  I know that some of the reviewers were disappointed in the ending.  But that's not my experience with this series.  So, maybe I am not the target audience for this book?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a very interesting read. It's not as good as the ones I've read, but it's worth the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my son's ninth birthday party. It was very interesting. It's also a very well written book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims he's a master of the occult, but fails to deliver.  His books are the opposite:  they are too easy to follow, too much about the occult.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put this book down because I got too involved in the story. I am not a big fan of these type of books but this one got my attention. It is a little slow paced but that is the book that I liked best. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disappointment. It is poorly written and is a poor read. I have read many similar stories, but I found this one to be particularly appalling.  The main characters are unsympathetic.  They do not appear to understand the seriousness of the situation at all.  It was difficult to empathize with them.  Also, the writing was difficult.  I had to force myself to read it, even though I was tired after the day.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of The Hobbit.  This book has a lot to recommend it.  There's a lot of really good writing, and the story is exciting and has a good amount of action.  But then, the author just decides to shoehorn in some non-Hobbit lore (including the mention of "the hobbits' secret enemy") and the whole thing falls apart.  The plot is just plain stupid.  It's like they had a good idea for a fantasy book, but they just couldn't find a good place to put it.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a bit sad that my high school English teacher, Mrs. Miller, did not know the difference between "wasteful" and "unproductive." I have tried to learn a lot of grammar from this book, but I still can't make up my mind whether it's "waste" or "unproductivity" that is the problem. This book is a bit boring as well, although I was able to get a lot out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title of this book should be 'How to not be a jerk'. It has a lot of good ideas, but the execution is terrible. The story is poorly written, the character development is poor, the plot is bad and the ending is terrible too. The ending should have been the 'filler' chapter. I wish I had read this book before I went to the library to borrow it from a local library.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a library.  The book was about a man who has lost his family in a terrible car crash and his wife.  His wife is in a wheelchair and his daughter is now a teenager.   He has been married to his wife for many years and he has a great job but it's getting hard to support his family.  He is the main breadwinner and he can't afford to give up that job.  Unfortunately his daughter has a bad attitude about him and she's a bad influence on his daughter.  This is my kind of book.  It's not so bad that it's depressing but it is depressing.  There's a lot of information about this accident but the book just goes on and on.  I wanted to know about all the other people involved and why it happened.  Also, I was trying to find some kind of way to relate this to my own experience.  As a parent I can relate to what he's going through but I didn't understand the emotional connection he had with his daughter and his inability to support her financially. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read and enjoyed many of the stories by this author.   The only one I haven't liked is The Girl on the Train.  She writes it in such a way that she gives away the entire plot before you know it.  It's not so bad that you can't get the point (although I have) but it's so vague that I don't know if she's just trying to get you to read it and not think about it or if she doesn't want you to think about the plot points.  I think her books could be interesting if they were a little more concise. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really know what to say about this book other than I was not impressed. The writing style is fairly bad, but I think that's probably due to the fact that I was so engrossed in the book. The main character's mother, in my opinion, should have been given more of a personality than she was given. She's supposed to be very caring, but her character development is pretty nonexistent. Also, the book takes a long time to get to the point. The author spends a long chunk of time describing a man's reaction to a bad girl, but the woman never comes up again. I can't think of a good reason to spend so much time on a bad person, except perhaps to establish that this is a common theme. I suppose it's to establish a good point, but even if you do like the bad girl's personality, you'll probably find it annoying to have to read about it all the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's very well researched, very well written, and very insightful.  This book has all the makings of a classic, with a lot of the details about the lives of the men who were in it.  As far as the plot goes, it's fairly typical, but it works.  I would highly recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is really bad and I couldn't finish it.   I have been searching for this book for years and finally got it.       
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, although well written, is so wrong on so many points, it is a joke to read it. It makes the entire field of linguistics look foolish.   There are many, many examples where the author simply ignores a grammatical rule (as in the example of a "w" that can be "p", "v" or "b" ) in favor of another that is easier to remember.  It's almost as if the author is saying, "I know you're not going to use these rules. I don't either, but I can still get the message across."   And this is only one example from the book!   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book to read in college. I liked it at first, but by the end it had become a chore. The writing was a little amateurish and the subject matter not that interesting. There was not enough information for the main characters to make a difference in the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a joke.  I don't think anyone is going to learn anything by reading this book.  It's a book about how you can make a book that isn't all that bad by taking the first page and cutting out the worst parts.  This makes it about two-hundred pages, which is a little overkill.  However, it's not hard to cut out the parts you don't like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a complete and total disappointment. The characters were weak and the plot was a total waste of time.  There was no payoff to the whole story line.  It was so boring that I could hardly bear to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am glad that I bought this book. I am trying to read as much as I can about American political history. This book gave me a lot of interesting information that I will use. However, this book is just too dry to be interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was a student at UC Berkeley, and it didn't really impress me.  It is a very dry and dryly technical look at the history of the French nuclear weapons program.   There's nothing that even hints at the interesting things that the French did in the 1960's.  The French were just not interested in the bomb in that era.  I found this book very boring and hard to understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. I don't know why, but I'm glad that I read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to believe that this book is a book about a good guy who becomes a bad guy.   This book is supposed to be a novel about a woman who has a "miracle" baby.  The book is not that.  This is a bad novel.  As bad as it is, the author is still trying to sell the book by saying that there is a great love story here.  I don't see it.  If the baby were a bad boy, the story would have been about a man who is disappointed with the baby.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book with great interest, and then put it down with great disappointment.  It was so obvious the author wasn't interested in writing about race, she just had the idea to include some "race" in her book.  I am sure that there are plenty of good books about race out there.  This book is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book about a good guy. The author uses the story of a guy who becomes a real estate tycoon to illustrate some of the pitfalls of being a businessman. I liked it. I don't like to be told what to do by others, but I liked how he dealt with the other guy. It was not a good situation and it could have been handled differently.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know who these people are but if you can't write you have no right to be a writer.  This book is a complete mess.  I'm sorry I had to pay for it but I'm just not going to waste my time reading this trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book. I had never heard of it, but I figured I might as well give it a try. Well, this book is the antithesis of a good story. I think that it is a little overkill for what it claims to be about. It's a good read, but not one I'd recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not for me. I'm a fan of fantasy and science fiction and have enjoyed a few books by both authors. But, in this book, there were no good ideas or ideas that were thought out or developed. I just wanted to scream at the author: WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THE HEROES WERE BLACK?! I've been waiting to read this book since it was released but never got around to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most pointless, unnecessary, overpriced book I have ever bought.   It is a compendium of "How to do it"  tips from other authors that can be found in any self-help book or magazine.  It contains advice about: how to be a "nice" person  how to get people to like you  how not to get into a relationship  how many times you should be a good sport and let a bad situation slide  how long you should wait to get a good job  how you should never get into fights with people you can't afford to lose  how a good book is worth a great price  I was a little disappointed when I realized that the author of this book is probably the same one who writes the "How not to be an asshole"  book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I don't even want to read it! It is a collection of "fictions" written by some of the most incompetent authors I have ever encountered. The main character, a girl named Grace, is a dumb slut, but it's not clear why. It's like she's written her own little autobiography. She starts out dumb as a rock and she keeps getting dumber. She has no sense of self preservation, she's just as likely to walk out on a date as be with one. She also has no social skills at all. She goes out for a drink with some losers one night, then goes home with some weirdo who tries to rape her, and then she gets raped by some old man. She doesn't even get him to stop! She tries to make up with the old man, but she ends up getting into an argument with him and then gets knocked up. It is so unbelievable that this book has made it to the publisher that it is almost as unbelievable as the things in it. I have to wonder how much of it is actually her story, and how much is just a bunch of garbage written by people who can't write.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not really do anything that the others do not. The author has a good knowledge of what he is writing about, and makes the story work well. I think the author could have added some depth to the story, and it would have been a nice book for someone who is interested in the history of the American West.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing more than a cheap joke. The main character, Richard, has a very interesting life as an African American in New York City. He gets a great education, attends many universities, has many interesting friends and acquaintances. Yet, his "success" in life comes solely because he is rich. Richard's life is a mess, riddled with misfortunes, bad decisions and bad luck. He ends up with a "pioneer" who has his name on a building, and that is it. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from the whole experience other than Richard's embarrassment. In my opinion, this book is not worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of this book is the only thing that makes me not want to read this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a nice book about the first years of the Soviet Union. I was very interested in it because it's one of the first times I've ever heard about the Soviet government and how the people worked.  It's a good read about the life of a typical Soviet person.  The problem is that the author never really explains the communist system.  She just sort of gives you a picture and leaves it at that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of books that use the same plot device over and over again, especially ones with a weak or poorly written character.   But there are a couple of things that I liked about this book: a) It's set in New York City, so the action is more realistic and more relevant to life than it is in a lot of other fantasy novels, b) The setting is rich and the writing is easy to read, c) The plot twists are not too out there and are understandable, d) I thought the villain was somewhat intriguing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my son to read, but I found it really boring. The characters were just so generic. I really couldn't care less about the plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did read the reviews of this book, and the reviews are spot on.   Unfortunately, this book is a terrible waste of time.  It has the same flaws that many other people have mentioned, but is just so much worse.  This is just a waste of money.  I would have spent my hard earned money on more productive hobbies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all too common these days. I was very excited to try a book on the subject of child development that would be written by a psychologist. But what I got was a complete mess. I'm not sure why it's necessary to include a description of the book in the description, but since the publisher included it, I'm just going to put it here. It's a mess of a book, filled with half-baked ideas, bad examples, and poorly constructed advice. I don't have a whole lot to say about the book, except that I wouldn't recommend it. It is not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very good read, but it lacks the humor and zest that is usually a big part of a good book. This book was written in 1981 by the man who wrote "The Godfather: Part II."  I guess I should have expected it to be mediocre but the poor writing is so bad, that I really don't feel like I'm reading a good novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a good example of how not to write a book. It is about a young girl and her sister who go on a road trip with a good friend of their parents' that goes on to become a drug kingpin. They end up in a situation where the sister gets kidnapped, and the good friend goes along with the kidnapping to get her back. She is eventually released, but not before she is killed by the kidnapper. The author has a lot of fun describing the evil and sadistic side of the drug dealer who is involved, and he writes a very fun and interesting story that is very much worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a collection of stories, many of which have nothing to do with real-world science.  The book claims to be about the work of Dr. Paul Crutzen.  This is a complete fabrication.  Crutze is an idiot and a fraud.  If you want to learn about chemistry you can read some of his books but I'm not interested in learning about chemistry.  His claims are so patently ridiculous that I can't even understand why he thought it was a good idea to write a book about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book as part of a series on "diseases of modern urban life." The title is a bit misleading: this book is about "dirt" (i.e., bad, contaminated food) in modern life.   The book is very good at explaining the problem of bad food in modern urban areas.  In fact, it is the only chapter on "dirty" food in the book.  But, it does not address the "good" food problems that plague many people's lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about the Vietnam War. It's a good read, but the ending was horrible.  It was written as if it were a diary entry from a soldier.  One day the guy had a grenade and was crawling through a tunnel when he got hit by a bullet.  He was badly wounded but survived.  Then another soldier comes running and says:  "Don't be so stupid.  This time we got a lucky one." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was interesting to see how much work went into a fantasy novel about a powerful wizard, but I couldn't care less about the story.   The book is a mess and I'm surprised that it got so much publicity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that I would have loved to have been able to get years ago, but just never got around to buying. The book is about a boy who is the only son of a very wealthy family. But one day his father's wife dies and he is forced to leave school. This book is a bit strange and doesn't make a lot of sense to me. At first I thought that the book was a little silly but after I got past the oddness I came to find it a fascinating read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a girl and her father who go out to dinner to celebrate their upcoming anniversary. When the meal ends, the father gets a little too drunk and starts yelling about his daughter not wanting to be his wife anymore. She is a bit offended, but she is also not happy about the whole thing. I think it was just a poorly written book that didn't live up to the hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written by a man who knows nothing about what he is talking about. It is written as if someone is sitting in front of a screen talking about how a particular subject will be an important subject in the future. He talks about how he will not go to a party that has a black guy as the DJ. This is not an accurate description of the situation. There is a large, diverse black population in this area. The party is not just about black people, it's about the culture of black people in general.   This is an example of a man trying to be the hero. He is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so tired of people telling me what to read. This one didn't bother me much.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in college but forgot about it. The writing is so bad that I could not understand a word of what she was saying. I thought it was a bad idea to read such a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of this book, but in all honesty, I couldn't finish it.  I don't want to write a negative thing about a book that I enjoyed so much, but this book was so disappointing that I don;t know why I didn't give it a good rating.  The characters were well written, but I just didn't feel like I had much to do with them.  It was interesting, but not really all that interesting.  What really bothered me about the book was that it was written as if they were going to write another book in the series, but after I finished the first book, I didn;t feel like they were even going to continue.  That really sucked.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with how to be a good programmer. The best advice I've ever gotten from a programmer is "You must learn to code in order to learn to program."  I know, I know...that's a lot of words.  But the truth is, I can't write well without having a good idea of how to write good code.  This is a great book on the basics of writing good code - but I'm really just there to hear how the book was written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible.  The story is a mess, the writing is bad, the ending is stupid and it's so badly written that it's hard to take it seriously.  It's so bad that I was almost tempted to throw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very basic book about a person who had a bad experience with a very stupid, ignorant, and nasty person. The book does not cover all the details about the whole thing, but the basics are there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a sucker for an old fashioned fantasy tale.  And for some reason I found this one much more entertaining than my previous favorites from George R.R. Martin.   The characters were fun, the plot was fun, and the world was fun.  I hope this is a long run for the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a man with a horrible memory who has never written anything good about a good book.   It's a pretty weak story, with a few interesting bits thrown in, but it's all so pointless that it never really registers as anything more than a bad day at the office. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed in this book.   It is full of bad ideas, bad analysis and very few useful insights.  The author tries to be all things to all people, but ends up being nothing to anyone.  It seems that this book is meant for "high-level" management consultants who can write well but can't get their ideas across in a simple, readable way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a review of this book that said it's "boring".  I'm not really sure why that's a bad thing.  It's a very good book, but there's nothing to get excited about.  The first part is a history of the U.S. Army, so I don't know what he's talking about. I'm also not sure why he says it's not a good book to read after he reads it.  There's not much that I like about the Army.   I know I don 't like reading about military life, but this book really seems to be about something other than that.  I also don't really understand what's so good about the U S. Army's training methods.  As far as the actual army, there's some very good information.  This book is also very bad about writing.  His main reason for writing this book was to teach his son how to get into the Army, but he clearly doesn't know how to do that. He also says that he learned about this subject in college, but that seems like a rather dubious source.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. I was mostly interested in the books on how they inspired people to become wizards, but I thought the series ended too quickly.   So when I got the new Harry Potter book in the mail, I was a bit disappointed.  I knew they would be good, but the first book was a disappointment.  It was a little slow, the first few chapters were very boring, and Harry is just not as likable as he should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. It is about a couple that get into a very messy divorce because of a long distance relationship. There is a lot of "this is what happens when you get into long distance relationships" and a lot about their relationships with each other. The only good part is the author has a lot more sense about divorce than I do. I don't think there is a good way to handle divorce, and the author is just going to keep repeating the same old nonsense about it until it becomes a new cliché.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking forward to reading this book for a while, but unfortunately it never comes to be.   The author is a wonderful writer, but the content of this book is very disorganized.  It is a book that could be used as a case study on how to read a book: learn to think in a different way and see things differently.  This is a great book if you want to learn to read the Bible as well as the rest of the New Testament.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written by a man who claims to be a victim of sexual assault.  I did not enjoy reading it.    It's like a rape victim telling her story in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book hard to read and it is very very hard to believe that this person could write a good book about an important subject. This book is not for people that don't know a lot about the Bible or the bible in general. It is for those that want to know the basics about the bible and who want a good Bible study.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in a way that you have to do a lot of reading to understand the book's main ideas.  The book is about a woman who had a bad relationship with her father.  She gets over this and her father's behavior in the end.  I really enjoyed the story but this book is more about her feelings than about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a boy and his cat, and it's the worst.  The cat eats everything, but it's still not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book because I've always been a fan of the series, but never got around to reading the books myself.    The story is pretty much the same as the first one, but the characters were pretty much changed.  I loved the first book, but this one is way too different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to finally read this book after years of wanting to read it.   While it was good,   it was far from the best book I've ever read in the genre.  It was good because it was a good book and I'm glad it's available. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I finished this book is because I had to look up the word "pussy" to look at the pictures. The whole thing is so ridiculous, you'd think the author had not bothered to study the English language before writing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to describe what I disliked about this book.   The narrative is very difficult to follow.  It takes a while to get a grip on what the book is saying.  For me, it took a long time to realize that the protagonist was a serial killer.  The last chapter is about how he planned to escape from prison.  I was expecting him to get caught.  Instead, he got away with it.  At this point, I'm wondering if the book will be the last of this type. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it had a good review on Goodreads, but didn't find that one helpful.  This book is about the life of a famous singer-songwriter and the people around her who try to support her financially and emotionally.  The book is entertaining, but I don't find any of the characters likable.  It is like watching someone who has a bad case of "stuffy" go on a tour of the places she's lived and heard bad things about.  I would have enjoyed it more if the author had left out a lot of the details of the relationship between the two characters.  If you're into the singer-poet world, this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good one, but it is not terrible either.   The writing is good, but the story is very poorly told.  I don't understand the story's purpose.  They have to come back to the world of the gods, why can't they just live in the real world  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of bad ideas, bad concepts, bad arguments, and is riddled with bad grammar. The book is written for the most part in a highly technical style that is very difficult to read.   The arguments are very technical and technical arguments are bad for a good book.  The writing is often poor and difficult to follow.  Overall, this book is just a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a little skeptical at first but this book is definitely worth your time. The story of a man with a big head and a small penis was just too much for me to take. I felt uncomfortable and I just wanted it to be over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete waste of my time. I read it on a flight to Hawaii. I was bored to tears. The plot is so lame, the characters so shallow, the prose so hackneyed and the plot so lame it's funny. I am embarrassed to say I finished the book but it will go in the bin.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, despite its flaws, does a good job at describing a very unusual form of the human brain: the "Cognitive Impairment" (or "C.I.D.") model. The model is used to explain a variety of brain disorders, but in the case of the "Impairment", it has a particular application: the C.Id. is used in order to predict the behavior of the brain of a person who has suffered a traumatic brain injury. If the CIO suffers from a traumatic injury and has no idea of why he has such severe problems, he can be easily persuaded to believe that he has suffered from a "rebound syndrome", and then be cured by an intervention such as surgery, electroshock treatment, or other treatments. The CIO has a very low IQ, is easily manipulated by the mental health professional, and is generally incapable of understanding the nature of the mental disorders which the mental illness has produced.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not very good. There were too many unnecessary details about the plot, the characters, etc. The characters were all over the place and the plot was not really very interesting or compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book. It was written in a rushed style and did not really cover the main subject matter in a way that makes sense. The writing was awful.  I am not sure how it would be possible to write a coherent book on the subject, but the authors failed to make it a very good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never been one to like "realistic" fantasy novels - I've always preferred the fantastical and the weird, not the boring, but the world of the series was too perfect for me.   The book didn't quite live up to the promise of a good book, but I can appreciate the author's desire to write about a world with so much magic and such a large population - even if I can't say I enjoyed the book itself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is very bad, with lots of spelling errors and very poor punctuation. It's like someone just gave up writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book.  The plot was not my cup of tea.  It was a bit too much on the supernatural side of things.  And it was very confusing as to what was happening and why.  I'm not saying it was a bad story, but it could have been a lot better.  If you're going to write a book about magic, try to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about the first book in this series, but was left disappointed by the final book. I was expecting the story to focus on a different character but instead it focuses on a character that is very similar to the previous character and it doesn't even feel like they have changed much. The character that gets the most development is the young boy. He has problems with authority but that isn't enough to prevent him from getting his way, even if it does cost him a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry, but I think that the author of this book really should have thought this through before she started writing it. The author spends about 30 pages describing a woman's sexual history, before ever mentioning any of the issues she had with her first husband. She says in the very first sentence of the book that she got into a relationship with a man at 19, and then describes how that relationship ended, and how she went on to have a series of men come and go. She talks about how each one of those men cheated on her, and talks about her husband's infidelity as if it was her fault. She never talks about why her first marriage ended, how her husband felt about it, or about her own feelings about it. She only talks about the men she married later, and the men that she thought she was falling in love with, and that she didn't think she could have found in her first relationship. She spends a lot of time talking about the other women that she dated, and doesn't mention that she also dated one of them. She also spends a good deal of time describing the women that the men in her life were sleeping with. This is not the way to start a relationship. And the last sentence of her book is absolutely pathetic. It's like she has to say, "Hey! Don't forget that I was married to one of these guys!" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book, written by a woman, to be a boring, dry and boring book. The story line is very predictable and the plot points seem to be done before they are even needed. It also has a very negative message about women being too passive. The author also uses the same "you're just not good enough" and "you need a man" phrases over and over and it gets old very fast. There is one redeeming feature that the author does try to include in the book: it is a short and sweet novel that should be read by anyone who is interested in being more assertive.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit hard to read, because it's a very personal story, but the writing is very good and the subject matter is very relevant to my own life. I'm a very anxious person, but I've been able to overcome that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book and I have to say, it's a very bad book. The prose is bad, the story is bad and the characters are bad. This book was written for a general audience who might be interested in reading something that is about the Bible but not the Bible. I'd rather read about the story of Noah's Ark than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, with its many flaws and glaring omissions, has no place in a serious book collection.   I've read hundreds of history books, and in no other would I have felt justified in saying that I "couldn't get past the title."   My students are mostly American history majors, and we're taught to ask:  Why are there no pictures of Native Americans in the history books?   Why did they not use the name "Alaska" in the 1867 map?  I was always curious about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but I just didn't find it interesting enough. I'm a huge fan of all the sci fi books, and I've read most of the classics, but this is one that I just can't get into. It's a decent story, but it's not quite as exciting as some of the other ones I've enjoyed. I'll still read the next one in the series, but not this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found myself very bored by this book. I don't know if this was the fault of the book or the reader, but I found that I kept reading the book because I didn't have anything better to do. I guess I'm a bit of a book snob. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a lot of fun. I like the fun side of the genre, especially when it's in a fun place like this. However, the ending is really poor.  This is the third or fourth book in the series, but there is no more fun to be had. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of lies, inaccuracies and half-truths. The book is so full of inaccuracies that I couldn't even tell the difference between the two versions of the "fictional" stories in this book. The stories in the book were about a girl named Emily who had been kidnapped by a bunch of weirdos who were taking her to the woods to kill her, and the boy named Caleb who went in after her. They took her to a secluded area, where they did indeed kill her. It's one of the few times in my life that I've actually wanted to throw up because of the inaccuracy of a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best thing about the book is that it has some nice, funny moments, like the story about the girl who got hit on the head with a baseball by a couple of kids on a bike (but who didn't stop the attack because she was too busy laughing). But other than that, the book just drags, and there is no suspense or excitement to the story, which is kind of sad considering how well the author knows how to make a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first time that I have found a book that is not worth the money.  I bought this book so that I could read it with my son.  This book is full of bad information and bad advice.  The author has a long history of bad book recommendations and this book is no different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a bad fit for me. I don't have a great deal of experience with historical fiction, but I did have a problem with the author's focus on the Holocaust. I'm not saying it's a bad historical story, but it's very focused on the German side. It's also not very historical at all. There's a lot of revisionist history and other nonsense thrown in. And I don' t think it does the Holocaust justice at all, but more the other stuff the author says. I also thought the author was too negative about people in Germany that were actually involved in the Holocaust: the Jewish doctors, the Jewish nurses, the Jews that helped Jews get out of Nazi death camps (like they were escaping the Nazis), etc. Overall, it was a very depressing book, and very poorly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very pleased to find this book, and I have to say that my expectations were not as high as they were before I bought it.   This is an excellent book about a good man and his struggle with alcoholism.  It is interesting to me that he has never been a very good writer.  He does a good job of presenting the story in a way that the reader can follow it. It was fun to read and very informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my daughter as a gift, expecting her to enjoy it, but she didn't at all. I thought it was interesting but I don't understand the premise. I understand the concept of how animals and humans are related and I do find the book interesting but my daughter was bored the whole time. I would have given it a 2 star rating but she kept reading and by the end of the book I was bored to tears.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I just wanted to throw it in the garbage. I don't know why it's called "American Grown" when it's basically a compilation of bad stories about Americans growing up in Mexico. I had heard a lot about this book but never really got around to reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I have ever read. I've tried to get my husband to read it to me but he can't do it because he is only a teenager at the time. He says it's not a good book for teens but I think that's because he didn't read it as much as he should have. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book several times before I finally got around to buying it.  I'm very disappointed that I didn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the opposite of a good read. It's a boring, repetitive, self-serving story that is written to tell the reader more about the author's life than the reader's life. It tells the reader that she has a good sense of humor but she's also the most self-involved person in the world. This is a bad idea for any book because it makes the author seem less interesting and relatable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's really interesting that this author is using a real story from his childhood in a way that he never would have used it in a book for children. The story is about a little boy who has a really bad accident, but survives it, and becomes a hero.  I loved that, because I was always so impressed by kids who got away with stuff.  The other things he tells about the accident are also interesting.  And he does a good job of giving the reader an overview of the whole thing:  There are a few other things about his parents, but this is what really interests me about the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first two chapters are just boring.  The book is all about the same thing: people being in the wrong places and doing the wrong things.  And, at first, it's quite entertaining to read about people being caught in the web of lies.  But, the book gets very depressing very quickly.  I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I can say that I'm glad I found a good book to read that wasn't about people doing the same things over and over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an absolutely terrible book. I was planning on reading it, but I ended up just finishing a very bad copy of a book by a very poor author. The book is a compilation of short stories, each one about a different character from the works of William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and others. Each story is told in a different style. The stories are also all narrated by the same person. It's just a total mess of a read. I also found the ending a little lame.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of the book is a description of the "Crazy Man on Campus" in the history of the American left. The second part is a list of his actions, all of which were clearly done to provoke people to do things to him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that will keep you up late and you won't want to get up early.  I have read many of these but not this one.  It is an interesting book about the history of the modern police state and it is a very good read.  However, the fact that this book was written by an anti-cop is so disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is a little bit too simple.   A group of people are in the house and they can't figure out what happened to the house.  This is because the house is a portal to another universe and the people who have gone through it are trying to figure out where they go.  The characters are very stereotypical.  One is a stereotypical old man who is very sad.  Another is a typical female warrior who is sad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never been able to get through to anyone in a relationship.  In a way, I'm glad that's happened to me.   I love the book.  It's well-written, interesting, and the plot twists are very intriguing.  However, after a few chapters I just couldn't wait to get out of there.  I'm sure there's something else I've been missing about the way people relate to each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. It was hard to get through and not a lot of fun. There is no mention of the 'Mormon' Church that many ex-Mormons join. And even though there are no negative comments about the church, I don't believe in it either. I found it interesting that most people who leave the church don't leave the religion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible attempt to give the readers a sense of the "real world" while simultaneously trying to make them feel smart and "in control". It was supposed to be a primer on how to use an iPhone to take photos, but it is nothing more than a poorly written instruction manual on how NOT to take pictures.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  I do not understand why anyone would spend so much money to read this book. It is very poorly written, and the writing is awful.  It is like someone took a dump in a trash can and then wrote a crappy book about it.  This book is a waste of money, and it is only worth it if you are a huge fan of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main reason why I don't give this 5 stars is that I read it a long time ago and have forgotten all about it.   This is a book about an alien race that wants to invade earth.  The plot is about the first encounter between the alien race and the humans.  It is interesting to see how a primitive culture that doesn't even know about space travel can learn a lot about it by having a "contact" with an alien species.  While I didn't care for this book, I would love to read more about it because I am interested in what happens to the humans after their first encounter with the aliens.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the book but had a really hard time finishing it. I'm usually a fan of the old school fantasy novels, but this one just seemed too hard to follow. I know this is supposed to be an adventure, but I just didn't see how it worked. I don't know if I'll ever read anything by Tolkien again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The reason I gave this book only two stars is because I found the ending to be a bit off. The last third of the book is really great. There are a lot of characters to like, including a couple that I hope will end up in a movie (I'll give the producers credit: they were able to make a movie out of this book and a few other "B.R.N. books" and make it entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book by mistake on the floor, and my friends and I didn't think it was worth reading. However, I was shocked when I started to understand how it was written. It was a great introduction to the philosophy of Buddhism. It also gave me the feeling that Buddhism is more about a way of life than a religion. It's great to know that it's not all about the Buddha.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know what to make of this book.   For a book of this nature it's lacking a lot of things that are necessary to make a good book: good writing, a good plot, good characterization, and even a good premise.  This is a story about a boy who has a magical ability that can turn any object into any other object that is close to him (which is why he likes his friend's doll).   This book has all the potential to be a good one, but it's just not there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a very enjoyable read, but found it to be very boring.   The main character, a very good looking guy, is the main reason that the book is boring. The book is about a very boring person in a very complicated situation, and he just can't seem to get out of it.  I feel that a good writer can come up with a great ending that keeps the reader interested.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't see it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited about this book. I loved the story about the dog that saved a man's life. But then the book told me he was an idiot. The dog didn't really know what he was doing. He didn't know the right way to move his body, he was so scared. He just ran around the corner because he thought he was going to get killed by the people in the neighborhood. I think he is really a dumb dog and I hope the dog has a long life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just plain silly. It's the same thing as the "The Most Dangerous Book in the World" by Richard Thaler: a silly, bad idea that you'll never implement, but you'll be better off for reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete disaster, from beginning to end.   I bought this book because it was on the shelf of a friend's bookstore.  After reading it, I am disappointed that I wasted my time and money on it.  The story was told in a very rushed fashion.  It has been said that the story takes a very long time to tell, but I found that very difficult to believe.  At times it felt like the author was reading from the back of the book.  There were many inconsistencies in the story.  I found it hard to believe that it was a "secret" that was going to be revealed.  The story is full of things that are not true and that the characters do not believe.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author spends an inordinate amount of time trying to convince me that my husband is a racist and a misogynist.    The problem is that the man who is the most racist and the most misogynist is a person I can trust to handle my purse when I'm out in public. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is bad, the book is bad. I am glad I read it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are just flat.   There is nothing that really stands out about them to make you feel anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending is unsatisfying, but not so much that the story didn't work well.  It's a shame that a book can't be both a good read and a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. It's a little hard to read at times but it's good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about the lives of six men who, through a series of unfortunate events, all meet a terrible end. This book should not be read, and it is the kind of book that you read just to know what it is about, but you do not want to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but I can't stand the cover. It looks like someone took a photograph of a bad photo. I mean, look at it. It's bad, but it looks like a bad photograph.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't have a lot of patience with self-help. But I am not sure what the fuss is about. The author, M.J. Bode, says she's a self-taught bookworm, but I don`t think she`s an average bookworm. The book is a bit repetitive and she`ll be hard pressed to put together a good book on her own.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the author's attempt at a literary style very frustrating. I was not expecting this. She seemed to be just writing her life story in a "what I've done" way. It doesn't make me feel much better that I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of this book at all. I don't think that the author understands the subject well enough to write about it. She doesn't really make a good case for the concept. She seems to think that you should just tell the story and let the facts take care of themselves. But, to me, that's a recipe for a bad story. I mean, it's the kind of story that might be interesting if you were a student in a class that studied something similar. I'm really curious about the idea of making the body and the mind into one and the same thing, and I'm sure that a lot of people do that. I just don't know that it would work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found a good book but it didn't live up to the hype. This book is about a little boy who is sick and his mother is a big fat fat idiot. I would have loved to have seen more of his mother, but it just doesn't work that way. I'm not a huge fan of this kind of book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy reading this book at all.  It was really boring.   The story didn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and thought, "oh my god. This book is so boring." I mean, there's not a lot going on. The book is pretty much about the protagonist who is being blackmailed into giving up the money she's been saving for a wedding. The only thing that is interesting is that the girl is married to a guy who is a cop. The guy is very nice and very kind, but his job just isn't that important to him. And the guy is kind of a jerk too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just found this book in my local bookstore and found myself not being very interested in it. It was a very long and detailed look at the history of a certain religious movement in America, and the way in which it was used to advance a certain set of beliefs. I'm not a big fan of history, but that's a very heavy subject that really can't be approached in a non-biased manner. The author spends so much time on the history and so little time on what the movement was really about. He spends a lot of time discussing how the group was persecuted, but there's no real discussion about the reasons behind that persecution. I found it interesting that he spends so many pages on the persecution, but doesn't discuss why they were persecuted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many books by and about a certain famous writer. Most of them I can see myself reading, but this one, The New York Times Best Seller, I have no idea why anyone would want to read it. The author's only redeeming quality is that he is good at the literary game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book very difficult to follow and it was not a good idea to use so many different sources to make it look like a cohesive narrative.  The most frustrating part was when the author says that the author of this book did not like the movie and is trying to make up for that with his writing.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book.   The book is about a guy who is a part-time teacher.  The guy's wife dies and he decides to become a full-time father.  I was intrigued by this idea.  There is a lot of good writing about being a father, but the dad character is a little stereotypical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.  The main character, the woman who took her son's virginity, is a total fraud.  She's not a virgin anymore, but her "wicked ways" don't stop her from having sex.  This is another example of how women who are into rape fantasies tend to get a bad rep.  I would have preferred to have seen her go to jail instead of going back to the rapist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've seen a lot of bad reviews on this book, but it wasn't as bad as I feared. The writing was good, and I thought the author was trying to be humorous about some very serious issues. However, when I read the actual text of the book, I was pretty disappointed. It's like the author is trying to get you to laugh at some really serious issues like racism and discrimination.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a public library on a whim. I've read a few of the books in the collection and I'm impressed by how well written they are, but this one felt like a complete mess.  The author tried to make the story about a girl who falls in love with a boy she just met, but he didn't even get that right.  It felt like it was written by a 16 year old girl trying to find her way in the world.  And the sex scenes were just plain weird.  I would have preferred if the book had focused more on the main character's struggles with learning to love herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad.  I would rather have read a nonfiction book about the "dark side" of the internet and cybercrime.  The book is more about a book about a web service than a book on cybercrime or cyberterrorism.  If you're going to talk about the dark side of the web, why not do a book that is actually about cybercrime?  I'm glad I read it, but I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a bad review for this book in a local book store.   It was written by someone who knows nothing about it.  He said he would like it if the author had written a new book and taken the old one's ideas and tweaked them.  I guess he would also like to be able to buy all of the old stuff he liked in a used book store too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as a freebie from the author, which is fine as far as it goes, but I can't get past the fact that it is a collection of short stories about a character from a different book. The stories don't really mesh well, and I can see the author trying to fit the short stories into a book of their own, but it doesn't really work. The only reason I read this was because the author was talking about the short story collection on Twitter, and a friend of mine is a big fan of this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book in a series about an evil dictator who tries to control the world through a series of bizarre, convoluted, and utterly ridiculous schemes. I loved the first book in this series, but this one just doesn't have the same charm. The first book was a bit more fun, but not nearly as over the top. I've never been a fan of the second half of the series either, but it's worth checking out if you like a little insanity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has so many problems that it's not funny at all. It is just one long rant about how the world is wrong about things. As someone who is a realist, I know that is true but still.   The first half is about how people will only believe what they want to believe and this book is no different.  It is all about the conspiracy theorists, which I have been very skeptical about.  And it all comes back to how everyone is right.  There is no reason to believe anything at all and everything is just an illusion.  I can't say that I am a conspiracy theorist but I am not a believer either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several of these books. The first is about an evil cult leader who has some interesting insights about the nature of religion. I thought it was pretty interesting. I was hoping that he would say something about what makes religion so great (as if that is even a subject), but he doesn't really address it at all. It's a very weak book, but it's good to see it being written by someone who understands how terrible the problems with religion can be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the two books in this series and have to say I was disappointed in both.   First, I have a bad habit of being irritated by books that seem to be written to sell a certain item.  These books are not about anything.  They are about people who want to sell things and then fail miserably.  It is very obvious that the author's intent was to sell books, not books that people actually want to read.  While there are many interesting characters in the book, none of them are very memorable.  The book begins with a character who seems to be the main character but it is obvious by the end of the book that he was a secondary character.  My second disappointment was with the author.  He seems to not understand the difference between writing about a real person and writing about fictional characters.  I am not sure what he is trying to say but the reader feels as if the author has forgotten the character he is writing about.  Again, not bad for a first book, but I would rather read a real book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  The first chapter, a description of a trip to a small village in Eastern Europe is the most embarrassing thing I've ever read in my life.  If you can't write a decent paragraph, you are not good at writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book by H.P. Lovecraft before he passed away and I didn't really care for it. It's a lot like The Horror at Red Hook, only with an actual horror theme and the occasional Lovecraftian reference. That said, Lovecraft is one of my favorite authors and I don't think that the references to the Cthulhu mythos would be all that significant.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is well written and the information is accurate, but the author doesn't know a thing about the topic at hand.   She mentions that the number of deaths of the "good guys" in WW1 was less than the number that died in WWII, and then adds:  The real reason for the decline in soldiers' health during WWII was that the US Army used more and more chemicals in their rations during WWII.  This is totally wrong.  In WW1 the US military used the same chemical mix used in WWII. It was called Tetryl.  Tetryl was a very popular chemical at the time, and was used in almost every other war from WWI to WWII.   I can tell you that the average soldier who got a Tetryll shot was probably just fine.  It was used mainly to wash out shell holes, so that when the shells came back they were not full of holes.  If a soldier had been in a trench in WWI, he was probably fine.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't want to read this book because I thought the author was a bit of a liar and the writing was kind of crappy. However, I got a copy of the book at the library and found out that the author's name is actually L.J. Hollingsworth, and the book is a compilation of her other work, including a series of books on "The History of the American Civil War." The first one was about the War of 1812, and she says that the Civil War was a mistake and that the South should have left after the war ended. The second book is about the Civil Rights Movement, and I found that the whole Civil War stuff really confused me because the South was fighting for the rights of the black race. She says that she thought it was an important story but I think that it was a really bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book. The characters are flat. The plot is confusing. The author fails to deliver an interesting story. The ending is lame. The only thing I can say that makes this book worth reading is that it makes me happy that there are still books out there about women who can't get a man, but who do anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an extremely disappointing book. It is so bad that I don't even know where to begin. I have spent the past two days attempting to read it, but to no avail. I'm sure it's just a matter of poor quality. I think it was a good idea to use a "proper" name for this character. This is a horrible example of a bad idea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book. It is written by a very knowledgeable person who is also a good person, but does not do well in relationships. She is not great with women, or even men, and her attempts at seduction are always too complicated. The first book in the series I read (in order) was about a guy who met a woman at a bar and the two of them had a good time together. The second book in that series was about two people who met at a conference and the one person who had a bad time was the woman who had sex with him. The third book is about a girl who is dating a guy and her best friend who she thinks will not be very good for her, but she ends up dating the guy anyway. She ends up cheating on him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so boring that I didn't enjoy reading it.   The main characters are so flat that they were made to be that way.  The plot is so simple that it takes no effort to figure out how it will end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was a real treat from beginning to end. I was very disappointed to find that it is all about the wrong kind of book, the kind of thing you read about in history books, but don't have to live through.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible waste of time.  If you are going to read about a religion, I recommend The Secret Doctrine by Michael Pritchard.  But this book is completely worthless.  There is no point to this book.  It is just another attempt by a religious person to convince the reader that the Christian God is not real.  I wish I could find some other religion that was as bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but I also found it boring and pointless. I'm not a fan of the "trolls" in this book and I didn't find any compelling reason for them to exist.   I don't even think they're a problem for the world.  The book is full of clichés that I don't think need to exist in the first place.  There's a lot of bad information in the book, and the troll stories seem like they're pulled out of thin air. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to read for a class on early modern Europe. Unfortunately, I found that there were a lot of inaccuracies about the early modern period.  The book's thesis is that there was no difference between medieval Europe and modern day America, that medieval Europe was a very good place to live.  But that is simply false.    There is nothing about the economic conditions in medieval Europe that is anything but the product of the economic situation in Europe at the time.  It's a nice picture, but it's only a picture.  There are so many errors in this book that it's hard to know where to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been out for a long time.  I've been looking for a good one that has a good story.  In this case, it's not a good book.  It's the story that is so bad that it is almost a crime.   It is so poorly written that it makes me want to throw the book across the room. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst of all the bad books I've ever read.  The writing style is terrible and there are just so many typos and bad grammar mistakes that it is laughable.   I think I just gave up on reading anything by Michael J. Sullivan. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book at all. I'm not sure if it was because I'm a writer who hates to be bored, or if I'm just not that interested in science fiction. In any case, I'm still reading the sequel, which is more interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. The premise is that all women are in love with men and men are in awe of women.   It is just that they are in denial about it.  The author talks about men who have sex with other men, but do not act on it because they are too ashamed.  It also makes me wonder about the author's definition of "love" because there is no evidence that men are attracted to men in love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book. It has so many errors in it and is full of errors that can be found on a wiki.  The author uses the "pig in a poke" trick so many times in this book that it is ridiculous.  It doesn't help that he uses this trick on a very old book that has not been updated for a long time.   This book is a waste of time and money and should never be read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to believe that I bought this book thinking it was a "good" book. I got it from a bookstore and thought it was fine. I had read some reviews about it but never thought much about them. But it's a very bad book. It's all about how some people believe in reincarnation. I thought it would be more interesting to know if this theory was true. Well, there's no evidence of it. I don't think the author did research and it's just another "mystical" thing. The author says that he read about it in a book but it didn't interest him. The book does not say anything about the evidence and the author didn't read much about it. The end of the book is a good example of how the author tries to put the best face on the bad theory. I'm sorry I wasted my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a collection of "memorized stories" that can be done quickly and easily in a variety of languages. The problem is, most of the stories have the same plotline and are basically "I can't understand why this is not on my list of favorites".  I have a hard time believing the author can be serious about a book with so many bad things in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a big fan of this book and was very interested in reading it. I wanted to love this book but sadly, it is a boring and repetitive book. I have read it twice but I found it hard to concentrate and not interested in it. The ending was very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible, and I would never recommend it to anyone.  It is very poorly written, badly organized, and is full of errors.   It's almost as if the author wanted to use this book as a promotional tool to promote her new book, which I will not buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book I was looking forward to. I really enjoyed the characters and story line.   It is very dry, but the characters make up for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book but it's a bit too long. It is a very interesting and well researched history about the US/Israeli relationship, but it is a bit on the dry side. This is not a bad thing though, it is an interesting topic that needs to be explored in a better way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the Kindle version from a friend and loved it.   I read it through and liked it. I was surprised at the good reviews.  I'm sure it's good.  But I also like my Kindle better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't care what anyone says about this book, but it's a complete piece of shit. I can't imagine why someone would want to read it. The only positive thing about it is that the author does a good job of describing her surroundings: she doesn't get lost or confused, she has good navigation skills, and she can always find a good hotel room if she gets into a bit of trouble. The book is a piece of trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  I had hoped it would be a light, humorous book, but I wasn't really prepared for how dull and uninspired it was.  The story itself is boring and predictable.  For a novel about a boy, it's not at all inspiring.  It's like he's been watching the same movie over and over again.  He's also not the brightest bulb in the box.  Not once in the entire novel does he do anything original.  A lot of his life is about how he's always "sneaking" into girls' houses and "waking them up".   He has this weird compulsion to steal things that he doesn't need.   The plot is a bit thin as well.  Why is it that the boy can't remember his own name?  Why doesn't he know anything about anything?   If he were more mature, he would learn to read.   3.5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about reading this book. It's been on my list for a long time, and when I found a copy on ebay for $5 it was a no brainer.   It is well written and interesting.  I hope the next book is as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the first book I read that has really made me look at my writing and see that there is a big gap between what I know I can do and what I do do.   The characters were interesting, the story engaging, and the book's pacing good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I hate it.  I hate the characters.  They are horrible.  It's obvious from the beginning that there are two different authors.  The first is the "real" one.  If you read this and think, "Oh, no.  That's not what he is doing!"  It is.  No, not the same one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor translation from the French by the late David Thomson. I didn't realize how bad it was until I'd gone through the entire book and noticed it in the index. The French original is excellent, but this translation makes it look like a bad English translation of a bad French novel. I'm a professional translator, so I would have made this book a lot better if I had done a better job translating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I did not like about this book was the last chapter that dealt with the author's experience of being raped by a woman. I would have liked to see more about the rape itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as a joke for a colleague. It was a joke, but it wasn't funny. It's a collection of really bad jokes that were bad enough to warrant the title of this book. The worst joke I can remember is that "a book is not just a collection but a story." If that is a joke then I am done with books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a problem with the way this book was written.   The author makes it clear that she is writing about her childhood, but the book doesn't come off as being about her experiences.  It comes off as just being a book about a kid that was around a lot of different things.  She talks about being around all kinds of people in her childhood:   "The first time I went to a zoo, I was just a little girl. I didn't know how to stand or walk or talk or run, but my parents were there to help.  The next time I was at a zoo I wasn't a kid anymore.  "The next time was at the zoo with a friend of mine.  When we got back from the zoo she said she was going to the park to see a guy who was a really nice person.  He looked like he had some sort of mental illness, but that didn't mean he was bad."  But then she describes some other people she met at a "super fancy" restaurant.  These people are not really "super nice".  They are just "super".  And while the book is about the experiences of the kids of her childhood (and there are some interesting stories), it seems as if she just got around to telling some of these stories in the last few chapters.  Her descriptions of other people in the book are just a bunch of words being put together.  I don't know about you, but I'm tired of books that have the author describing other people as being nice, then being shocked when they turn out to be not nice at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of reviews about this book.   This is a book that does not hold my interest.  It's like reading a boring history book about a war that didn't exist.  I'm sure there's a lot more to this book but I have a hard time following the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most confusing and disappointing part of the book is that, at first, he makes it seem as if the "sins" are being committed in a good faith attempt to bring the world together, then later he makes a case that the "sin" is not only wrong but also harmful.  I just can't understand the distinction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking for a good horror story for a long time.  This is not one of them.  The story is about the evil that people do to each other.  I would not want to be the parent of a child who reads this book and thinks that the people who were horrible were just "doing what others did" in life.  It is an excellent read for kids but I would stay away from it if I was a kid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I had a lot of free time and wanted to try out some new hobbies, and I thought it would be a good place to start.   The thing is, I didn't enjoy it at all.  This is not a book that I'll keep in my library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not well written. I'm not sure I would call it "well written" at all. It's more like it was poorly edited. There's no sense of flow or pacing or structure. This isn't a problem if the book is good. The author is clearly a fan of Tolkien, so maybe he tried to capture some of that feel. But if he did that, it just ended up being a bad imitation of Tolkien. If you've never read a fantasy novel before, read Tolkien. He has a strong writing style, so he's probably the best writer for fantasy in a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first two chapters of this book are quite good. It is not until the last few chapters that the author loses her way. I had a lot of fun reading this book but I can not recommend it to anyone unless you are already a professional writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after getting into it in a previous semester. It is a very good book, but it was very confusing at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to receive this book because it was such a fun read. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a very boring read. It was definitely a fun ride though!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of the book "Greed Is Good" by a good friend.  He recommended it because it was the "most concise book on the topic"  I have ever read  I thought it would be a good book  Well  It is very good  But  It does not address the root causes of greed
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was my first attempt at writing a book, and I'm very sorry I didn't finish it sooner.   I didn the basic plot, and had some good ideas, but couldn't keep the pacing from falling off a cliff.  I also felt a bit of the writer's self-loathing:  It's really not hard to come up with a good plot.  So why did it take me so long to do it?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a book you can learn anything from.   There are a lot of things that are wrong with this book,  but  this book is about people who have the same problems  as  I do and who have   tried to do something about it.  The people in the book are   all people who are just plain ignorant of the world around them.  They   don't realize   what's around them or   where they are going.  I think   if   people like   me   learn about   these   things   I   will realize . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is about a young man who is very religious and has a hard time finding a girl that he likes. He goes to a Catholic school where he meets a beautiful young girl, but when he asks her out, she turns him down. She's a bad person. I have no idea how much he cared about her and was disappointed that she didn't want to be with him. However, the author makes up for it with some funny dialogue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a hard book to read.     I don't want to use the word "flimsy" because I really don't think that is a fair description.  This is a good book with a lot of interesting information.  But it really did leave me with a headache.  It seems like they were so intent on creating a good picture of the war, they didn't give a hoot about the actual facts of the conflict.  They could have done a better job of describing the German attitude towards the people who lost their homes to the allied armies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a couple years ago as an assignment. I thought it was great, but I really disliked the cover.   It looks like a cheap paperback cover with a big white X through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a waste of time. While the concept is interesting, I found it to be boring. The author seems to be making the same mistake he made with the first book, which I found very distracting. The only good thing I can say about the book is that the pictures are a good way to illustrate some of the ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book.  I didn't get much from it, except that I had to read it twice to get the gist.   It's very hard to read a book like this.  It reads like a book written for high schoolers.  The ending is unsatisfying, but I won't bother to read the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is pretty boring.   I think the book is about a guy who is in the military, who is having a hard time dealing with his wife leaving him.  He wants to get over it, but his wife wants him to get out and get a wife.  I understand the idea of trying to get back on your feet, but this is a long way away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about a dog and his owner. The dog has a habit of breaking into people's homes and trying to eat their food. I don't know what the point is but it makes no sense to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I finished this book was because I needed a break after finishing the first one.   It took me a good 4 hours to finish the first.  This book is just so bad that I feel like it could have been done for free.  I am really sorry that I paid for this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great read, but the last half of the book is not. The author seems to have made up her mind about how to make her point and what is and isn't "relevant" to the topic at hand. In this case, her idea is that the purpose of the novel is to "give voice to women's experiences of abuse" (p. xi) and that "in the past few years, feminist writers have focused almost exclusively on male violence against women" (pp. xiv, xv, xvi). This, apparently, is the only thing that matters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is hard to read a book about the Holocaust that is also about the Jewish faith in general.  The book attempts to cover all these bases, but is just too limited.  I do not know why the author does not attempt to cover other faiths.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really like this book at all. I don't think the author really learned much about his subject matter. This is just a book about his life. He seems to think he has done some good, but his life is really the worst thing that ever happened to him. I think the book could be much more interesting if the author took a longer time to write about some of his bad experiences. But if you want a good story about how he met his wife (she is a very good actress, though) then I suggest you read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book by a good guy who had no idea how to do it properly. He tried to sell the idea of a book on "The Power of The Mind" to the world, but the book is basically a list of things that people can do to "improve" themselves. I mean, really?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so glad I finally found this book! It is so long (over 200 pages!) and dense with references, that I can't read all the way through. The only reason I was able to read this book was because I was a librarian and was able make use of a reference book. I had to check out several books to get a handle on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I found to be wrong about this book is the way that it's presented as a work of science, with references to the scientific method and the work of other scientists, when in fact it's mostly just a book about an unusual way of getting people to like you.  It's hard to find a better example of the "you get what you pay for" fallacy than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written for a popular audience, but not well.    It is a poor use of historical research and a bad case for the idea that women were slaves.  The author makes an effort to use as many examples as possible, but most of them don't have anything to do with slavery.  Even worse is the way she goes about trying to make the case that women could and should be freed.  She is very sympathetic to some abolitionists, but ignores the overwhelming evidence of many who were more or less abolitionists.  At one point she says, "Women, unlike men, had no choice but to endure a lifetime of servitude.  If we were not slaves, our lives would be much less unpleasant."      It is also a bad idea to assume that all slaves were good slaves, since slaves were very different from each other.  As for the argument that slavery was bad, we can all see how slavery worked in practice.  It was pretty awful, but it was not that bad.  Many of the people in this book had a good time, and it seems that most slaves were pretty happy.  I'm sorry that I was so distracted by how miserable slavery was in the US that I failed to see that slavery in general was a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book after seeing it on the television show "The West Wing." I wanted to give this book a try because I was a fan of the book and the show, but I didn't enjoy it very much. It's very difficult to follow the main plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors. It is not even a complete story.  I would have preferred a novel written by a student and published in the student newspaper. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited about this book. It seemed so interesting and original. Unfortunately, I found myself reading about how a good book can have terrible consequences for the author.   A few times I thought I could actually relate to some of the people in the book, but by the end I found it just as ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't get it at all. It's a fun story, but the characters are flat and the plot is boring. The only interesting part is the plot about a "magic" sword that kills people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a pity that the book was not written by a good linguist.  It has a lot of things that are confusing and unhelpful to the speaker (like the "I will say that a little more" thing and the "you know that" thing)  I could have learned a lot about how the language works and how to pronounce the word, if only it had been written by someone who knows that word.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poorly written book that is filled with spelling errors and factual inaccuracies.   The author never attempts to make sense of what he is trying to say.  His attempts at explaining the book is very poor.  He writes about a book that he never read:  He claims that the main character of this book is "an ex-navy man" who went through some sort of "disgrace" and is now a member of the "Mormon Church."  He then goes on to write about a "disgusting woman" and "a dirty, greasy, fat" man and how he must "have seen all this before" because "the Mormon Church has had this problem for years."   He does not seem to understand that the book he is referring to is a collection of stories about people who have been disfellowshipped, disenchanted, or who have committed suicide.  I don't know what he was trying to get across but it was not clear to me what the author was trying for.  The whole book is a mess and does not provide any useful information or insight into the lives of those involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not very good. It's hard to read the first few pages, and the first half of the book is so repetitive that I lost interest. The plot is really confusing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an attempt to get the reader to look at religion in a new way.   It makes no attempt to be a non-religious work.  It does not have the intellectual rigor of the religious studies books that it is modeled after.  The author is not a scholar of religion and does not understand the concept of "religion."   He is also too interested in making a quick buck and is willing to ignore the most basic rules of good writing.  This is the worst book on religion I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful. The author is a very smart guy and he has some great ideas about how to improve education, but he simply doesn't know what he is talking about. I have been studying this subject for many years, and I can tell you from personal experience that he is an extremely ignorant individual.  He talks about using some sort of mathematical model to understand education and his method was to compare what teachers are doing today to what was being done in the 1800s.  It is the same thing every time.  What has changed is the amount of data.  In the 1800's, you did not have the internet, cell phones, and computers.  The teacher in the book even shows a graph of students and teacher ratios in the early 1900's and says that was the way it had to be.   He then makes a big deal about how the student population is growing, but fails to note that a teacher ratio has been decreasing in America for decades.  This is not a new phenomenon.  I had a friend who had a history professor who used to say that the most important thing in a college education was having a girlfriend.  That is still very true.  And that is because a girlfriend makes you look like a stud.  To think that the best way to increase student enrollment is by giving every student an iPad and a copy of How to Win Friends and Influence People is ridiculous.  As for the math, I would just say that if you do it right, you can get a lot more for your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't think I'd like this book very much, but I guess I just didn't look hard enough for good books.   It is an interesting story, but not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book of lies and deceptions, but it is a lot of fun to read. This book is based on a very good book called "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle.  I enjoyed reading the book and I found it very easy to understand and apply.  It is very clear and easy to follow.   I liked the book very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book to read the cover blurb. It is bad. I can't believe that it is still being published after its first print run. I will not be buying any more books from the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a review for a book on the same topic.   This book, I believe, is not worth the price paid for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about the time I was at a bar with a friend who was a big nerd. She was a fan of the movie The Princess Bride.   He kept talking about the movie and how the girl had a lot of hotness for a 12 year old girl.  I didn't like her at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book because it was based on a movie and not a real book, and the book itself is very bad.    This book is full of bad jokes, bad puns, and bad characters.  It's not funny at all.  This is why the book was terrible: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author writes about the war in the book but doesn't give the context. There was a lot of talk about a secret war being waged by the US government in secret against the USSR. The US government was trying to make sure that the Soviets did not steal any of the atomic secrets that were being used to make the bomb. The secret war was a real one. The CIA did try to sabotage the Soviets and get the bomb but they were unsuccessful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is interesting, but I can't figure out the point.  The ending is a bit odd too.  I'm thinking of a different book altogether, but can't find it.  It's a very strange book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good story with a good ending is all you need to enjoy a book.   It's a very good read though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most useless book I've ever read.    It doesn't teach you anything new or useful about anything.  It's not even about anything you're interested in.  If you can't figure out how to get the data to work, there's no point in reading the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of shit. The writer tries to pull the reader into a story that has nothing to do with the story that she has. I didn't care for the character of the main character either, I mean I don't care about a bunch of bikers, but I can't say I don`t feel sorry for them because they do seem to be living in a shitty place. The book ends on a depressing note, so that is probably not the best ending for a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book ever!   It's a series of "what if" scenarios with no explanation of how they are supposed to be possible.   I'd like to see how many people got the idea that they can go back to an old life and be just like them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read.   My only issue with the book is the author's decision to use the word "nigger" in his book.  It is offensive to any African American and the book makes no attempt to hide that fact.  The book also contains a plethora of anti-black statements that I can not ignore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad. It wasn't bad in a bad way; it was just boring and didn't make much sense. The plot was predictable from the very beginning.  The book was over by the end of the first chapter, but I never got excited about it.  I also don't understand why the character who was supposed to be the villain in the book was actually the good guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book had a lot of good points, but I felt the author's point of view on the subject (I know this sounds like the usual author's opinion, but for the record: it is not) was completely flawed, at least for me. He claimed that his family's ancestors came from the Middle East, which I had always believed to be true, and yet he did not think the Middle Eastern people had any sort of cultural relevance in America, and instead was a bunch of people who did not make it here until after World War II. This is a complete and utter fabrication of history.  He also claimed that the "Arab" was actually the "Egyptian" as they shared the same "discovering the Americas" moment.     It is very possible that people of the Middle eastern descent were indeed a part of American history, but we can find no evidence that this was so.  It does not seem likely that the American Middle East was a part-time presence during this time period. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book. The characters didn't appeal to me, they were too "other" than what I expect from fantasy. This book is full of "bad" things. I didn the characters were really just characters, they didn't have a personality. I'm a very bad reader, but even worse I don't have time to read books anymore because I work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit dull. There is some interesting things in the book, but the narrative is a slog. I am very interested in the topic of evolutionary psychology and in the science behind it, but this book is too bogged down with theory and research to make a good reading experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author doesn't seem to understand how to make the most of a good idea. It's a great book about how to write good business books. The first half is a lot like "The Elements of Style" -- good examples of good writing, bad examples of bad writing -- and then it turns into a bunch of non-sequiturs about how the author is an "entrepreneur" and the author's business is the "next big thing" -- the first half of the book is really about the author not having the right business ideas -- and the second half of it is really the author having the wrong business ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book thinking that it would be a quick and easy read, but I was completely wrong.   It was very frustrating to follow all the steps and then realize that I was still missing something.  It's not that it's impossible to read, it's that it takes way too much time to read.  This is not a bad game, but it's not a good one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time, because it teaches nothing about writing.   It's the same crap you can learn from any college professor 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a terrible person, I mean that sincerely and not as an insult to a book about a terrible book.   She seems so intelligent at first, but her ideas are so silly and unrealistic that it makes her seem like a total idiot.  I've always liked that book and read it many times, but I just didn't feel that way about this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't know that the authors were a couple of former high school English teachers until I was halfway through reading this book.  It took a lot of effort for me to stop and think about it.  The authors claim that they got a "pass" from their teachers in high school because they were not writing about the problems of the times.  While I can agree with that statement, they did not get a pass for writing about things that are relevant to today.  They get a Pass because they are writing about their own experiences as a result of their teacher training.  Unfortunately, this book is very much a product of the 1980s.  Their style of writing is a little stiff.  I am not sure if they are trying to be modern or if their writing style is just that.  If you want to read a modern writing style you could look to many authors such as Thomas Pynchon or J.K. Rowling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that should have been called " The Most Important Lesson I Learned from Being Wrong ".   The main point is that people who believe in conspiracy theories can be very wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very interesting book about the history of science in the 20th century, but is ultimately a disappointment because it doesn't really tell the story it wants to tell. The authors focus on a few important figures, and make some good points about how science is used to advance policy, but the history that they do tell doesn't make much sense. They discuss the development of quantum theory, but ignore the more important contributions of quantum mechanics to the development and application of physics in general. For example, they focus on the development in quantum mechanics of the wave function, which is a key component of all of quantum mechanical theory, yet they do not mention the development by quantum mechanics in general of the quantization of wave functions to allow for the manipulation of energy states. As a result, they neglect to mention the importance of quantum field theory and of the quantum statistical mechanics, which has allowed for much better understanding of the nature of matter, and has made the quantum mechanical model of physics much more consistent and robust. In particular, they do seem to overlook the contributions of the theory of QED to the understanding of QM. The book is also very incomplete, and they only briefly mention quantum field theories such as the quantum chromodynamics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still waiting for the first installment of this series, because I've been told by several people that I should wait for the sequel to start from the beginning (as I am).   And I still plan on reading the rest of the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book that I purchased the first three books on Amazon.  This one, however, was so disappointing I had to give it a low rating.  The story line is interesting, but I didn't find the characters compelling.  There are a lot of contradictions in their stories and I found myself trying to figure out what the author was getting at.  I found the ending to be so contrived and unrealistic that I was left feeling a bit unsatisfied. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for a friend. It's good fun at times, but most of the time it's just not very funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this book for over a year and still can't figure out how she manages to be so wrong about so many things. This is not the case with her latest book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all about the ending and nothing about the rest of the book.  The ending is very weak as well.  There's a nice twist at the end but it doesn't come until the third book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was about a character I did not like, a woman with a horrible life who gets into all sorts of trouble, but then somehow gets her life turned around.  It seemed like the book was going to be about how much she struggled, how much effort she put into getting herself back on track, but in the end she didn't succeed.  I didn't like her and didn't really care about her, but this book was just so depressing.  The only redeeming thing about the book is that it was published in 1989, so I think it will have a lasting influence on those who love to complain about the poor state of women's lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not really a bad read. It is very well written. However, it is not a good book, not by a long shot.   The main characters were very well developed. They had a purpose. They worked together and did what they did in the right way.  However, this was not a story about a family of 4 or 5. It was about a group of 10 people living in the middle of nowhere.  They were in a terrible storm.  It was a very hard book to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that this is the only book I've read that has bothered me so much that I've had to go back to it. I was really looking forward to reading it, but it kept bugging me. I got the impression from the book's description that this was supposed to be a story about a young boy who gets a girl pregnant, and then goes into a depression. Well, I guess that's pretty much what it is. But I really didn't like it at all. I thought the narrator's use of "hilarious" was a bit much. I mean, that's what makes comedy, right? He's not kidding, either. Anyway, this book is just kind of a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to love this book. It was really nice. I can see why she wrote it. It's a nice blend of historical and contemporary information. However, it's the details of her life that make this book really suck. She married into the wealthy family of a powerful military man who died suddenly at a young age. She moved in with them because they were wealthy and needed help with the bills. She is still living with them today.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bit tedious and poorly written.  The main character is a very passive aggressive, snobbish person.   She doesn't seem to care much about anything except having her own way.  When she is in trouble or being asked to do something, she responds by complaining about how she doesn't have the ability to do it.  This leads to the whole book about her taking the easy way out.  It was tedious and boring to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book, but it is too long.   I am so bored by it.  The end is a cliffhanger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an insult to the intelligence of every reader, but especially those who can read a newspaper.   It's as if the author had never read a single news article.  The title is even worse.  There is no such thing as a "sociopath" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book after hearing a good review about it.  It is a good read, and has a very interesting idea.  However, it is also very long, so that is a bummer.  If you are in the mood for some history, try another title:  A World of Its Own: A History of the Great Depression
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of essays about the death of a loved one by a car accident. The only good thing is that I didn't have to read it all, but there are too many bad things about this book. I think there are a lot of people that read this book that are going to get a bad idea from this book, that is, that it is just about grieving. This book should not be used for that purpose. It should be used as a resource to help people understand what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given this book by a friend who had just finished reading it. I loved it but was disappointed that it is just a re-hash of the old "What a Long Strange Trip it Was" book.  The writing was good but there were no surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't normally read the classics of science fiction, but this book is just a bad, bad book. It has no sense of logic or plausibility at all. It's about a man who's been in a mental institution for 30 years. He's been lobotomized so that he can't talk to anyone or tell the difference between reality and fiction. He can only remember bits and pieces of his past. He thinks he's a woman who's become a man.   He has no idea what he's supposed to do. He does it because he has no choice. It gets worse.  It turns out that he's an alien. He has a kind of sex implant in his brain. It turns him into a woman.  He doesn't know he's not supposed to be a man anymore.  I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so happy with this book that I bought it for my son and gave it to him.  It was a fun and very educational book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible.   I've read a few books about the life of George Washington.  They're not bad books but this one has a bad title and is filled with lies.  I'm going to get another copy and leave it there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book written by someone who doesn't know jack shit about computers, and it's written with such a lack of understanding about what computers can do that the entire book is based on a series of completely false claims.   It's not so much a book about computers as a book that is trying to convince the reader that computers can't do anything useful.  The author makes the case that computers don't have the processing power to read documents, but there's really nothing wrong with that.  Computer viruses can't read documents either, but they can do a lot of damage to your computer.  My own computers were infected with viruses, and one of them, which was probably the most sophisticated, was able to open about 30 different Microsoft Word documents in the span of a week.  It took a couple of weeks to clean it out.  In a book like this, one can't help but feel that the author is trying his best to sell a book, but it's pretty clear that the book is written by a computer illiterate who wants to tell the reader what computers are really good at doing.  He also has a problem with computers having windows on them that aren't windows.  This book is very entertaining, and a good time was had by all, but if you are looking for a book on computers that is going to tell you what computers CAN do, this book isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part about this book is that the author is so nice about everything... it's like the book was written by a friend.  She even has the decency to mention in the end credits that it was a "co-author" with a woman (I can only assume this is to be a good thing).  This book is a complete disappointment.  It's like this author doesn't have the wit to write a real book.  I know this is an opinion book, but if this is what the book is like, I won't be buying a second copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book in order to use it as a learning tool in college, but found that it was so badly written that I was completely unable to use my newfound knowledge.  It's a very good book for people who are trying to figure out what to study for college or are just curious about the subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most disappointing aspect of this book is the poor writing.   It is so bad that I almost don't want to continue.  For a fantasy book this is about as poor as it gets.  There are so many spelling errors that I think the author just didn't get around to checking the spelling before typing it down.  The dialogue is so poorly written that it is laughable.  Most of the characters are simply flat and one-dimensional.  It's almost as if the author decided to make the main characters all a bunch of stereotypes (and he did).  The story is also pretty confusing, so it's a good thing that the author didn't follow it through to the end.  If you've read the other books in the series you'll be familiar with the ending and have no problem reading this.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book because I liked the original, but found this one very poorly written.  I guess the original was a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to my son as a Christmas present. I am not a fan of the Star Wars movies. But I had been looking forward to reading this one and I was very happy with the book. However, there are a few mistakes in this book. The first mistake is that Luke's Jedi training in this story is not really about the Jedi. He learns how to be a Jedi from someone he calls the Emperor. This makes no sense. The next mistake is when he tries to explain that the Sith are like the Jedi but they have no Jedi training. I understand that a Sith can be trained by the Jedi, but it makes no logical sense for a Jedi to be trained the Sith. The last mistake is in the book when Luke says that he is going to help the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. But he does not say that he wants to join the Rebel alliance or the Jedi alliance. It seems to me that Luke wants to have a role in the fight against the Galactic Empire but he is not prepared to do that yet.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping to read a good book but was disappointed. I can't wait for the next one though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a wonderful collection of poetry. It is the best collection of poems I have ever seen put together. I wish the publisher had used better editions of other poets' work to accompany it. But, for my money, the best of the best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an attempt to show that there are no moral absolutes in our culture. I think the author is trying to get at the same thing, but in a different way.   The thing is that we are told that there is one right and one wrong and we are supposed to pick one.  This isn't always true, but it is the prevailing view.  For example, there is an article on the BBC website about a boy who, upon learning that he had to get permission from his parents to use the bathroom, found out he had been given a choice between either having to pee in the woods or in a toilet.  So, in a way, this book shows that sometimes the right thing is the wrong thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just bad. This is the type of book that should have been called "badly written" because it is full of poorly thought out ideas that are poorly executed.   The author writes the book like a bad screenplay, with the actors being played by the actors,   and the movie being made by the director.  It's a terrible book and I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing in this book is very sloppy. I have no idea where this book came from. The only thing it seems to do well is tell a story, and that's it. It's a good story, but not a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the cover, the way the cover is laid out.  It looks like it is trying to say, "This is the story of a woman."  It doesn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good book to read, and this one fit the bill.   However, the book was written by a man who is a complete asshat.  He talks about all the great women he's slept with, and then talks about how they all hate him.  It is sad to see how much he cares about his looks, but it is also sad to learn that he's going to be a complete asshole to a woman he just slept with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that will be read by few. I was given a copy from my sister-in-law's husband. I had to wait to pick it up as he was out of town for the weekend. The cover art is fine. I'm not a graphic designer and the color choice on the cover does not fit my mood.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poorly written book.   The author's name was not provided in the book and no one seems to know who she is.  The writing style is terrible.  Some of the passages seem like the author wrote them in a hurry without having had time to study or research the material.  This book is an insult to those of us who have spent years researching the subject, and if you can find this book you will regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, and was very happy to get it for my Kindle. Unfortunately, it is just too short.  The only interesting thing about the characters is that they are so realistic and well written.  I would like to see them continue in this story, but the plot was very weak.  It is very sad that they had to get a loan from a bank so they could pay for college.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't do it.   It is all about sex, but that's about it.   The writing is pretty lame too.  There's no emotion or thoughtfulness, just just the usual bad-writing, so I gave it a 3 star instead of 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is very poor. The characters are shallow and the plot very predictable. The plot and characters do not change once they get to the part where the evil overlord is in power. The only good part about this book is the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely disappointed in this book. It's been several years since I read it. It was the first book I've read where I was just kind of confused by it.  It's so obvious that the author doesn't really care about anything he writes.  The book starts out with some really cool ideas.  He has the concept of a "mind machine", which is a computer system that allows people to enter a trance-like state to "remember" events from their past.  This would obviously make this a great time travel novel.  But it turns out that the book doesn't work that way at all.  As I mentioned above, the computer doesn't actually allow the user to enter the trance.  They have to first enter the mind machine and then go through all the mental gymnastics they need to do to enter trance. This takes about an hour.  At one point the author even admits that the computer is a bad idea.  That doesn't stop him from going on and on about how cool it is.   I mean come on!   Why not just have the user "remember"?   Or if it does happen, why would it be "mind" so that it can be used to remember things?  The idea is so ridiculous that it almost makes me feel bad for reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters, I thought, were so bad that I felt they should be the villains. They were bad because they were bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book.    I found the characters uninteresting and had little hope for the outcome of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a good story about a man who finds a new love, but this book is a dud.   The author says he's been writing about this subject for 30 years and I think it's been longer than that.  He's got the man's back, but the woman has no backbone and is just there for her man to pick her up and put her down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so poorly written and illogical.   The most illogical part of the book is where the characters try to make sense of a problem with their DNA (i.e. the DNA is a key to immortality) and come to the conclusion that they should take the DNA of everyone they know and stick it in their forehead.  In the end, they find a way to make that work, but the process is not explained in any way, nor is the solution actually explained to anyone in the book.  That part is a complete waste of time and energy.  It's also not clear why it would work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a long time reader of science fiction/fantasy books but had not picked up the John Varley series until this year. It was the first book of the series that I could recommend without hesitation. Varley writes a good story. His characters are well thought out and realistic. He writes in a modern style, with all the jargon of the time but the language is well chosen to show the time and place of the story. It is clear that Varley was a good student of history as well as a good writer. The characters are likeable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why people would buy this book.  It is not as good as "Wizard" or "Worm" but is still bad.  There is too much talk about magic, too much magic, and too many people who can do it.   It's a fun read for the "fan" of magic and magicians.  The author's knowledge of magic seems to come from watching tv shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a copy of the book that I bought over 10 years ago, but I haven't read it in a while. This is a really great book about a really sad guy. It's like a real life version of The Godfather. He's not a good guy at all, but he's an interesting character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of my time and money.  I read this book back in the late 90's and I thought it was interesting.  At that time the only books I had read were the old Harry Potter books.  So I didn't know what to expect.  It was interesting but not that interesting.   The author was clearly having fun.  She did some interesting things in the middle of the book that I don't remember.   But by the end of the first chapter, I knew I was reading a book that had little or no value.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad fantasy book. I found the characters to be rather bland. This was just a bad time in the fantasy genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book but unfortunately was disappointed. It's an excellent book on how to create a successful book from scratch but there are so many inaccuracies that I don't know how anyone could possibly have read this book and still believe that they have made a great book. The first two chapters about the author, Richard Ford, are great and explain how he got his start in the book industry but once he became successful, he got sloppy. The author claims that he did a lot of reading in his early days but he just seems to make up the details to fit his story. Also he claims that his first editor didn't like his first book so he sent it back and that editor told him he was a good writer but he never published the book. He claims that one of the book's editors was a very wealthy woman and she told him she couldn't be bothered with a writer who was so poorly paid but he still refused to work with her and went on to sell many more books. Finally he claims he had a writer in Paris who was interested in writing a book about him but after reading some of his earlier books she didn't want to work. She told him that the book would never sell.    My only positive comment is that the author is a very nice man and I have met him in person a number of times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very sad book. It seems that many people who have been involved in cults have become more cynical in their thinking over the years. That may be true in some cases, but I'm sure that many of these people who became cult leaders had been deeply moved by the stories in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really interesting. It is about a book of "real life" things people have done in their life that they regret.   It really makes you think about your actions and what you have done and could have done better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a really good book but the author did not tell the whole story.   A lot of what happened in that apartment had nothing to do with that apartment and had nothing at all to do to do her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited about this book! I was excited about reading anything written by a woman who has written on various topics, but especially when it's a book about writing. I was also excited about her approach to writing, her ideas about how to write and how to edit a book. And then, I got to the end of the book and... well, I didn't like it. It's not bad writing per se, but it's just not that interesting.  I'm usually very impressed by self-published books, but this is just a little too generic for me to enjoy it as much as I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't find this book very interesting or interesting at all. I am a big fan of Stephen King but this book did not impress me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a guy who has a very bad experience with his first girlfriend and goes on to date other women (but has trouble finding a good one) but doesn't get his head together and move on. It's so frustrating that this book doesn't work for me because it was such a great introduction to the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was about the most bizarre of oddball creatures. The author, a biologist, says she's a scientist, but the book is full of mistakes and gross errors that make her look more like a layperson.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad it's good. I didn't like it at all. It's like an episode of South Park with an extra large amount of bad jokes and bad writing. I don't know if it was the author trying to be funny or if it's the author's fault.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that I wish I had a copy of when I was a kid. It has lots of good things about it and I'll admit that it has a couple good jokes, but I was annoyed by the main character. It's really easy to see why people who have kids with them like him, but he's annoying and completely unnecessary.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked the first chapter but it became completely redundant with the second and third chapter, I felt as though the book wasn't going anywhere.  I am sure the writer's goal was to give the reader an idea of the background of the characters but as I was reading the book, I became tired of the repetition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very badly written book. The narrator is a stilted, unnatural narrator. The story is about a man who was molested by his brother as a child, but he was so ashamed that he tried to destroy his memory of it. The book's subtitle suggests that it was an attempt to write a horror story about the molestation of a child. I find this very unlikely, and it's just a way to explain the narrator's voice.  I don't know why this author thinks that this is a good idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so sorry to hear about your bad experience with this book.   It wasn't as bad as I expected, but I can't give it a high rating because it wasn't what I expected.  It was a bit of a challenge for me to get through the first couple of chapters, but once I did, the story was quite captivating.  I loved the main character and how he was portrayed.  Although he didn't get a lot of development, it was clear he had a very strong will.  There were some very cool events that were portrayed very well.  Overall, it wasn'y a bad read, but it wasn 't as good as I thought it would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an exercise in self-promotion. It's a pretty standard book on the principles of business and management. The book's authors are all big business types. They talk about the benefits of a "good" work ethic and the fact that, in a capitalist society, it is a good thing to be good at whatever you're good at. And they talk about how there's a difference between "doing the right thing" and doing the "right thing because it's good for the company." This book might be a useful supplement to the C.V.S. if you're looking for some more business advice. However, it's not a good way to promote yourself or a company. The authors don't have a strong, solid reputation in business. Their writing style is clumsy and they often seem to be writing about other people's books. And the book is full of errors and omissions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book, "The Bible Made Easy," to be very boring. I found that I had to reread sections several times just to make sure I had understood it. Also, as a former Bible college teacher, I was annoyed by the amount of "The Old Testament" that I never used.  This book is a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book.   It's a fun read about a small girl that doesn't understand why she's different from other girls.  I don't think the book was written in a way that is easy for kids to understand.  The ending is a little depressing, but still fun to read.  It will keep you reading, even though it's hard to believe a story can get so dark so quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm just gonna say it:  When I was a young kid, I bought a hardcover copy of this book.   It was one of those books that made you feel like you were reading a good book.   It is.  It is just.  The plot is really good.  I could just imagine my own mom reading it.  And my brother and I liked it.    But      that was back in the day when the author wrote "Good Omens" for a popular series.  Nowadays, they are not doing as well as they used to.  If you are looking for a good old time read, this might be the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author doesn't know what he is doing with this one. The characters are annoying and the story is a bit cliched.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a mess. The story is terrible, the characters are all shallow and unoriginal, and the writing is horrible.   The story takes place in a country called "Majuro", where people are so used to living on the edge that they don't even notice that the edge is being used as a crutch.  For example, one character is so good at reading her phone that she can tell if it's on the line by the sound of it.  One character is a "lazy" woman who can only remember the last thing that she did.  The other character is called "Nagato" because she has no real name.  This leads to all sorts of weird sexual references.  There is also one character who is obsessed with being a "good girl" (not saying this is good or bad, but it's just bizarre).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring.  It is not a bad work, but it is boring as a result of a lack of ideas and not having a good plot.  The author had a good idea of the main characters but decided to ignore it and just make a list of all the things that are bad about it, so he can sell more books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know how you could make the book worse.  The whole premise is that all the characters have some sort of mental or psychological disorder, but they don't seem to get any better.  I think the idea of someone going through something bad is always interesting, but I don�t know why they�re so stupid or how they�ll ever learn to be better people.  It�s like the characters were all just created in a lab.  This book should be considered an example of bad writing and poor story telling.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I wanted to see if I could learn something from it.  The book is written by a psychologist and does a very good job of introducing you to the field.  I was really impressed with how they presented information and the techniques they used to create a psychological profile.  However, the book did not give me much to work with.   The only thing I took away from this book was the idea that I should get to know myself as well as I can. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing I can say about this book is that I can now read about the "good" parts of history.  The parts that would normally be ignored.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written with the intent to make me laugh and I'm disappointed by how bad the book is.  There are many stories that don't make any sense and there is no story at all about how he met his wife.  I would love to read a real story about the guy, but I think I'll just wait for a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a poor attempt to explain how a complex subject such as the "social contract" can be made to fit into a narrative framework.   If I had to guess, the book was written by someone who did not understand social contract theory and believed that they could present it as a clear cut "good guy" vs "bad guy" argument without anyone knowing the difference.  The first part of the book is just a long rambling explanation of how the social contract is a myth that people need to learn about so they can work together better.  It's a pretty boring explanation and while I'm sure it was meant to be entertaining, it was boring.  However, after about 2/3 of the way through, the author does a good job of laying out the case for a "contractual justice" framework in which the bad guy is punished for the good guys actions.  This part is where I had problems.  I found it confusing to see how people could be so clearly motivated by the pursuit of self interest that they would willingly violate the basic social contract and even break it to save their own skins.  Why would anyone voluntarily violate the social trust that they were bound to maintain?  I'm not sure how the author could make the case that the bad guys had the better of the deal, but he did a good enough job to convince me that it was a necessary foundation upon which to build a more nuanced framework.   The book did have a couple of interesting moments:  The author mentions that people who live in "gated communities" have much more to lose than people in "the free world" do.  He gives an example of a town that has its own jail and no public roads to use for the community.  But the people who lived in the town without public roads did not benefit in any way from being in a gated community.   This is an interesting point and I'm curious to see if the author can apply this to his theory.  And he mentions that some people are more equal than others:  There is no one right way to do things.  There are different ways to live.  These ways differ in how much each person can gain from them.  You can't really take a stand against others and expect the outcome to be equal.  Maybe we could have a better way to think about this, but it's a point that is really difficult to make in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a fan of the book until I found out that it is basically an infomercial for the anti-vaccination movement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book about an extremely bad book. It's not bad per se, but I'd be very reluctant to recommend it to anyone unless you're going to give it a high score just because it's about bad books. It was a long time coming.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been looking for a good book about the Vietnam War for a while now, and this one just didn't do it. The book is based on a TV documentary that is very good, but the author has a very narrow and very biased view of the war. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to use in a class I teach on a variety of spiritual topics.   The author clearly doesn't know much about these subjects.  His writing style is a bit dated, as he makes a lot of claims without providing any supporting evidence, and there is too much repetition of information that I already know.  It's hard to find the time to read a book of this length. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've seen so many bad movies and books in the past couple of years that I've become jaded about the genre.   This book was a big let down.  I can't wait to see the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and read it. It's about a young girl, who is in love with a very rich man. When her mother dies, her dad and brother come to live with her. He has a very expensive house, a Ferrari and a yacht, so her brother is a little jealous. The father's money helps her to pay for her college tuition, and she decides to have a boyfriend instead of a husband. He doesn't like her, but he is too afraid to tell her that. The boyfriend, the very rich guy, thinks that the mother is being too hard on him, and he wants her to go away and live a more normal life.  I was a little disappointed in the ending because of the relationship that the girl had with the rich guy. It just didn't seem like it would work out for either one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad and stupid book about the American dream.  It is about a very smart, well-educated and very rich girl.  She is so very different from everyone else that it's almost as if she is trying to find out how different everyone else is from her.  The people that come up to her in the mall are like the "other" people, except they are not.  That is how she knows what it's like to be different.  This book is about the bookish, intelligent and well-dressed girl and how she has the same dreams as everyone else but lives a life that is very different.   It's a really dumb book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very good but the story is terrible.  I liked the story.  It is the first book of a series.  However the story makes no sense and is not worth the read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a huge disappointment. The author is a master of wordplay, and he is able to turn a few of his own observations about other authors into fun stories about himself. Unfortunately, the book isn't all jokes, and it isn't even a good book. I can understand the author's desire to write a book about a favorite author. The book is fun, but I can't say I enjoyed it. I didn't like how the author uses his favorite authors' work, and the author has a habit of using his own works to describe other works. This book could have been great if the author had taken the time to use his favorite author's words more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book a 1 star rating it would be a no brainer. The story is boring as all get out and the ending is horrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. It's too long. I have tried to read it over and over, but it just isn't worth the effort. It is basically just a long list of things that are not going to happen, and the author just doesn't seem to care about any of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read and reviewed this book a lot of times but this time I just couldn't get into it.   It was just too confusing and over-thought.  The ending was pretty good but it just felt like it didn't really add anything to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a huge waste of time. If I had any money, I would buy this book and keep it for my office to use in my class. The author has nothing to say that hasn't been said many times before. It's an interesting idea, but the execution is pathetic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a long time ago. I used to read a lot of fantasy but I stopped after a while because they were so repetitive. I'm not sure if I will ever re-read this book again. It is so dry and predictable.  I guess I will have to look for a good fantasy novel to read next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in 2005.    The first 3 or so chapters were very interesting but the rest was very dry.  I got the impression that the author had very little interest in his subject and the writing style was very strange.  This is not an unusual book in the genre but the fact that it wasn't any good and that it's almost 20 years old makes me think it might have been rushed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book. It had all the elements that I like about fantasy and sci fi and all the things that I don't like about it. However, the writing was so bad, the characters were so stupid, and the world was so bland that it made me feel like I was reading a fanfiction that was written by a 12 year old.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about a week ago, and I hated it. It is a terrible piece of crap that I found out about through some internet searches. The plot is just a bunch of bad stereotypes: black women as bad drivers; women being a lot more sensitive about being insulted than men; and so on. And the characterizations: the black woman is a good wife, and the women in the other characters are just plain silly. I guess the author was trying to do a "mixed race" character, but they are not mixed enough to be any good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke. The "how-to" is very useful but the "how" is the wrong way. This book does not give any specific tips.   In fact it doesn't tell the reader what she should be doing.  She should be "doing" the things that are in this book.  I got through the book pretty quickly but still have a hard time getting through the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed to find that this book is a collection of short stories, not a novel. The stories in this book were good, but they were written too quickly and were not well written. This book should be read after The Hobbit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a bad version of the old book.  The story is bad, the characters are dumb, the plot is weak, and the ending is just awful.  I could never see myself reading it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no idea what it is talking about, and it is not a very good book to boot.    I have read a lot of other authors' books, and have had a lot more fun reading them than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a terrible book. I can only imagine what the author went through before he published it:  The author is a good writer, but he has no idea what he's writing.  The narrative is all over the place, and the dialogue is uncharacteristically bad.  There is no sense of humor in the book.  I was looking forward to reading the rest of it, but I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book.   It is badly written and the characters are awful.  It makes me think about what my father was like when he was younger and he used to say he never wanted to read a book he thought bad about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be very annoying and poorly written. I couldn't get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of romance novels, and I'm quite sure that I've enjoyed most of them. However, this one wasn't for me.  I think it's an over-written romance.  It's so over the top and cheesy that it's hard to take seriously.  The characters are flat and boring, and there are so many characters that it gets really confusing who's who.  There's a little bit of romance in there, but it's very much in the background.  As far as I'm concerned, the author needs to be more careful about writing about her own past and not just about her characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a very critical person and when I found this book it made me feel bad. The author's lack of knowledge about chemistry and its relation to writing are obvious. This is one of those books where the writer can't decide whether to be witty or to be profound. His writing is so bad it's embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I've ever read.   I'm an old hand at reading and am good at it.  I was thoroughly confused as to what I was reading and felt that I was being lied to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that it's hard to put down.   It's written in a clear, easy to understand style that will help anyone with a general interest in the history of religion figure out what the heck is going on in the Book of Mormon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever written. The authors attempt to justify the death penalty by suggesting that those who commit capital crimes "are the worst of the worst." I don't believe that this is a fair assessment of murderers. I think it's a reasonable statement, but it's one that fails to account for the circumstances in which most murderers are brought to justice. Most murderers are not like the ones in the book. Most of them are not in prison, most of them have a criminal record and most of the murderers I know in the "real world" are not murderers. This book makes the ridiculous statement that we need to look at the criminal justice system to get a sense of how we treat people like the murderers in the movie. This is a ridiculous claim, but that's what this book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book. The plot, though interesting, was completely irrelevant to the characters and the book was a slog. The main character's name was not even mentioned, and he was only relevant for about a page. The characters were also bland, as though the author was trying to write about the "normal" life of a college student. The ending, which was so rushed and uninteresting, was especially disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was one of the first I had ever read about the great war and I was interested in learning more about the events leading up to the war.  The author has done a very good job in researching this and I enjoyed it very much.  I'm still a little sad that we never got to see the British take over some of Germany's key cities. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit skeptical about this book.    This is not a good introduction to science for the general reader.  I would have preferred a book that had something new and interesting about science, not just some random facts about science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm still waiting to read this. I had the good fortune to read a review from a very good friend of mine, and I was thrilled to hear her take on this book. Her review is so well-researched, so well reasoned, so entertaining... I can't say enough good things about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disappointment.  I am a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and this book is a huge step back from the series.  This book is about a guy who has a bad day and has to spend it at the beach.   It is just as boring as all of the other Hitchhikers books that I have read.  If I ever get a chance to read this book I will never waste another minute of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book I have ever read about the rise and fall of a company. I am surprised that the book is about a company which is no longer in business. I find it rather hard to believe that a company like IBM would be able to sell its computers so well to such a wide variety of customers.  I would have expected more of the same from the new Apple computers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book. It is not the story you want to read about a group of students who try to bring a woman back to life. It's the story of a bunch of people who have been trying to do this for years and haven't succeeded. This is a good book, but it's not a book I'm going to buy to read to pass the time on the way to class or while working.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book, but after reading it, I realize that it's not really about a character in a book.  I really don't understand why this is in the book.    It's not like the character of "The Man with the Red Beard" was a unique, interesting or compelling character.  He's just a guy with a weird haircut and a bad haircut.  It was pretty funny at first, but then after the second half of the book, it's just really boring.   It might have been nice if they had a third person who was also weird, but I guess that's not very believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for a Christmas gift for a friend who is a science writer.   He didn't like the first half, but I'm a sucker for science fiction.  In the end he gave it to his wife as a present. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was never a fan of this book. It is not bad, but there were a few moments that left me bored. I can see why some people love it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the characters but,    The book is very boring.   There was no mystery to be solved and the ending was really a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book at all. It was just not my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an example of how not to write a history book. The subject matter was interesting, but the writing was amateurish. The author seemed to know almost nothing about history. I could have done without the use of quotation marks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry but I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would.  I found it very dry and boring, with little of the humour and humor that I was hoping for.  It is well written, but I just don't think it will be a popular book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason this is not 5 stars is because it does not come with a good index, and the authors are so sloppy that it's hard to see where the quotes came from. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found a lot of the information I needed to understand my new language to be very basic and not worth the time to read over. It would have been nice if the author had put in a couple of examples instead of a few sentences that are not very helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a real disappointment. I've read many of these'modern' histories. This is one of the worst. The main character, Richard, is a bad guy, but not because he is a war hero. He's not even bad in that he's not as good as he could be. The book says he was 'no great leader', but then he was a 'good general', so what does that tell us about him? He's a great guy, a good man, a decent man, and a good soldier. But that's about it.  I can't see a reason for having him as a character.  This is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  It has many problems and has very little in it to recommend it.  I will be using it as a text for my students on the "what is a good story" question.  The author has a problem.  There is nothing good about the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book that has given me such a sense of "I'm a bad reader", that I will not waste my time reading anything from now on. It's just not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it makes me want to go out and eat some of that bad cheese that the author has made famous.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be extremely difficult to read and not very interesting.  While it is a very well written book, it does not inspire me to think about any of the subjects discussed in the book.  It is very much a book for the "professor in the classroom" who wants to know what everyone else is reading about but doesn't want to actually read about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad novel.  It is very badly written and has very little to do with the real world.  The main character, who is an atheist, is a pathetic failure.  His only hope is to convert a woman he is attracted to to a religion he does not believe in.  She is a Christian.  This book is really about the Christian religion and the fact that the Christian God wants you to be a good person and to be happy.   This novel is a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but I found it extremely boring. It is basically a long account of what a typical person in this day and age does while sitting in a chair reading a book. There are a few bits that are interesting and it is a good description of a day at work. The only problem with this book is that the author is a lazy person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a book that would give me a good laugh.  This book doesn't.  The author, a guy who is not that good of a writer,  wrote a pretty good book.   It's got a good story,  but I find that the funny parts are very predictable.  I've heard this book compared to "The Catcher in the Rye" but "The Great Gatsby"  would have to be a better comparison. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not going to review this book. I'm sorry to say I did not like it. I have heard good things about it but I just did not find it good.   It's like a cross between a Stephen King novel and a Stephenie Meyer novel.  I've heard good about it so I have a soft spot for Stephen King but I found this to be a poor translation from the author's words to English.  It seems that King used to work for the BBC and he is a bit more "out there" in his ideas.  This was also a "mockumentary" which made it even worse.  The book is about a man who was involved in a shooting and he went insane and shot a cop.  King used this as an example of a mental illness and there was a bit of the "tortured cop" in there as well.  There is a good interview with the author on his blog.  But the book just seemed like a cheap attempt at a "modern" novel that failed to stand up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a huge fan of the original Harry Potter series.  It was my first book and I was hooked from the beginning.  I have yet to read the books in the series but I have read some reviews about them being bad.  This book is a farce.  The writing is bad.   The characters are boring.  There is no plot.  A few things happen in the book and the book is about the characters not the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in an effort to get a handle on the various kinds of mental disorders that can afflict people.   The book covers a wide variety of mental illnesses:  "depression, bipolar disorder, mania, schizoid, delusional, schizoaffective, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder"   None of them really seemed to fit my diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  I don't think they do, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time.  It's a waste of my time, and yours, too.  If you want to know what an average human life is like, go to a bar, order a couple of drinks, and spend the evening talking about your feelings, instead of reading a book about it.  The only reason this book got four stars is because it was a decent enough read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book. It contains little but an assortment of "jokes" that do nothing to add to the book's enjoyment, and the book is littered with grammatical errors and typos.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a big disappointment. The writing is terrible. The plot is extremely cliche and the characters are so flat that it's impossible to care about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really like the book, but I found it a bit tedious.  It's an excellent story about a man who becomes the target of the mafia.  But in the end it turns out that the mafia was right about him after all:  he was only after a better life.  I don't think I'll be reading his next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very poor attempt to explain to the lay person how to make a very good knife.   It is full of very poor instructions, with some sections that should have been skipped over entirely. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was curious about the origins of " The Book of Job." I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were at least two versions of the story, both written by people who knew about the ancient Israelite history, including the book of Job.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book. I read a lot of sci fi and fantasy, but none of it seemed to match up to this book in my eyes. The story is really interesting and the characters were very well done.   The only problem is that the plot is so convoluted and confusing that it is hard to follow.  It is really hard to get caught up with all the back story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting look at a fascinating subject. It's well written and the photos are interesting, but the book is very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of all the bad things that a good book can be: poorly written, badly researched, poorly argued, poorly edited, poorly designed, etc.  The problem is, all these things can be found in almost any good book, and none of the bad features are the author's fault.  It's just that the author has an obvious and unrepentant dislike for all things medieval.  I don't like to put my faith in other people's interpretation of ancient history, but I can't help but think that if the author had read more about medieval archaeology, he'd have known that the idea of the "old world" was simply a creation of medieval authors who wanted to explain away all the problems with the "new world" that was emerging.  If he had, he wouldn't have been so quick to write the book he did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good book on the Bible but this book was not what I expected.   It is very technical, it has many factual errors and a lot of jargon, and the style is extremely technical.  It seemed like it was written for a very small audience,  It was a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not worth it. The only good thing about this book is that it has a happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was really great until the end. I liked the main characters and the plot but it is really hard to stay focused and the ending is just a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a lot of books on self-development and self-improvement. This book is not only a waste of time, but also an embarrassment.    It is basically just a bunch of advice about how to get a job or become a better person.  This book really is written in the form of a personal story, which is fine, but not as fine as the book claims.  The author claims that he became an alcoholic in his mid-20s and that his life has been ruined because of it.  There is nothing about his life before that that he can point to as a reason for his drinking, and his alcoholism is really a symptom of some other psychological problems that have been developing in his life.  He claims that a bad day at work can lead to a bad week at home, and he does not seem to be able to separate his drinking from that.  It just doesn't make any sense that a guy who has a bad year at work at work could also have a bad month at home.  So many people who drink have a very good life, but this guy seems to be living in his car and buying his beer at 7-11.  I am glad he doesn't drink anymore, but he should have been more careful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm giving this book a 5 star because it is the most fun I've had with any of the Harry Potter books.   It's the story about how Harry Potter lost his magic wand.  The story is pretty short, but you have a lot of fun reading it.  Harry was pretty dumb as a kid.  He couldn't read very well.  But he used his knowledge to do everything he did.  So when Harry lost his wand in the Tri-Wizard tournament, he didn't lose a single spell.  In fact, he gained a lot more power.  It was so fun to read the stories about how he kept trying to get it back.  If only I knew then what I know now!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's prose is very choppy.  I didn't understand what was going on in this book, or how it related to the previous ones.    The book is about a young boy who is raised in a Christian home by a mother who is very religious.  The mother has a very strange way of talking to her children.  She makes it sound like she is giving them a lecture.  There are times when the book is hard to understand.  It is also hard to believe that this is supposed to be a "progressive" book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed by this book.  It was very disappointing to read this story about a poor, lonely boy who falls in love with a beautiful girl who is a freak.  There was no development in the story or character at all.  Even the author has admitted to making some mistakes in this book, but it is hard to read about the same story over and over again.  In my opinion, this book should not be on the shelves of libraries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of the books of the late Stephen King and have been waiting for this to be published for years now. However, I found the book tedious and poorly written. I would not recommend it to anyone and I would be surprised if it sells very well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an attempt to make the "Bible" seem as important as the "Book of Mormon" to the average reader.  It is not.  There is no reason why the Book of Mormon should be regarded as the final word on anything.  The Book of Alma is probably the most important source for understanding the early life of Jesus and his ministry.  We have not been able to understand the nature of the Messiah, which is not because he is any less than the Son of God.  I do not believe the gospel is to be taken as it is given, but rather as it will be given by the Church and the leaders in the future.  While it is very important for the Church to take the Book as the word of God, it is equally important for members to understand that this is only a portion of the original message that was written in the original language.  For the most part, the Church today is the same as it was at the time the Book was written.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read.  It's so confusing that you have to go to another book to figure out how it all fits together.  The last few pages are very confusing as well.  I feel bad that I wasted so much money on it but if I was a young adult, I would have been better off reading something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring, poorly written book. I don't know why it's called The Art of Selling.   I don�t think anyone will read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book about a good book about religion.  It is the kind of book that is written as a good religious book would be written.  Unfortunately, it is the bad religious book that most often emerges.  The author does not present his own religious views in a very honest and positive way.  This may be an issue for some readers who are more open to religious viewpoints. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about a person, it's about a story. This is a book about a girl, who is in love with a girl (the hero). It is the perfect book to teach you about romance and relationships because the book has a great ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good story, but not for the story.  A lot of the book is told by characters that are supposed to be on the side of the angels, but instead they're all on the good side.   It's like the good guys were just told to turn the other cheek, but they never did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a book that'll teach you how to do a good impression of a bad person (such as me ), this one isn't for you. The writing is a mess.   The illustrations are just so   horrible that they make me want to give it to my sister for Christmas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, Peter Orullian, has a knack for writing bad books. He writes "This book will probably only be read by people who want to find out how much of an idiot the author is."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed in this book because it is so badly written and the ending is so... disappointing.   The main character is such a wimp, and so completely unable to be a man (despite being a woman) that the story makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that can be used to promote the teaching of the Bible. The book is about a very poor man who is trying to raise money to buy his brother's house, but it turns out he's using a false Bible to do so. His brother, who has a decent Bible, is so upset about it that he is willing to go to jail for it.  It's just one of many things that is wrong with the Bible that is being taught in the schools, and that are being used to push the Bible down our throats. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an ex-gay man, a former evangelical who had been raised to be a Christian by his pastor (a pastor who himself had been a sex addict and then was cured by Jesus, who was then a Catholic). He went to the Catholic church for a while, but then he went to a Pentecostal church where he was able to change his life and find God. However, it turned out that there was nothing in the Bible that supported his new religion. He didn't see God in the cross or at the death of Jesus.  It was pretty much a waste of time, but it was an important time for him to find out that the only way to find God is through faith in Jesus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not for the weak of heart. The only reason I read this book is because of the author's "F" rating. However, I'm still glad I did read it. It is definitely worth a read, even if it's a short one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not well written, and the whole thing seems rushed.   It is an interesting read, but it is not one that I would be willing to read again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a public library a while back and just threw it in the trash.  I was never a huge fan of the Harry Potter books but this book sucked the life out of me.  If only the author would have known that there was a Harry Potter series coming out, I might have taken a chance on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that I will never get over.   The premise is that it is a modern day "Romeo and Juliet" type tale.  The author makes the point that most people will be fine being alone in a car, but when it comes to sex, they can't be bothered.  I know what the author means.  When you are single, and you want to have sex with someone, you are not going to get it.  You have to be in a place where the person is available, and also willing to do something that you might not otherwise.  If the two of you don't like each other, then it is not going be a good experience.  But if you can work it out, the payoff can be great.  This book is so full of the author's opinion about how women need to stop trying to be all things to all men, and instead just be attractive and good at something.  Most of the women who end up in the story do not know they are being played, so they end up being really disappointed when they have sex.  Then the author shows them how they can be good at other things besides sex.      I can understand that people may have a lot of sex in their life, but most people do not have all the sex they can get.  It is just not possible for them to be that successful all the time.  Maybe the author has never had sex, but that is no excuse for the author.  And the fact that the author seems to have no problem having sex with men, even though he says he has never, really makes me wonder if he has ever had sex with a woman.  Also, what he says about "good girls" who want to be good girls is not just a joke.  Women who are good at anything are not just "good" at sex.  I mean really good at it.  If a man wants to be the best at everything, he has to be able to do it better than the best man.  Why would you want a woman to be like that?  I can't think of a single thing I can do better than a man.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been looking forward to reading this book since it came out. I'm going to wait until the last page to review because it is so good and I can't wait to see what happens next. The story is interesting, and the author is an expert on psychology. I found myself laughing out loud at some points because it's hard to get a grip on how much the author knows about psychology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books I was so looking forward to that I couldn't wait to get it, but after finishing it I can't put it down.   The author really knows how to write a book about a time-traveling adventurer and he's even managed to make the time-travelling part interesting.  But, the characters are really not believable and it's very hard to see them as anything but "bad guys." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a friend who is a teacher.  He gave a book that he has just read about the life of a woman to his class.  When he was finished reading the book he asked me how I felt about the book.  I told him that I felt it was not good.  After reading the comments about how "brave" he was I felt ashamed that I had agreed to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so poor. I bought it so I could learn about the real story behind the movie but this book doesn't tell the story at all. It's about a very good movie that was never made and the studio was just trying to sell tickets.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of bad examples of bad writing. The author is not a writer. She is not even a bad reader. It's almost as if she's never written a story before, just borrowed some bad habits from some of the worst writers in the book and just went ahead and copied them into her work. The book is bad because it's bad. I have read a lot of terrible books and read a fair number of good ones and this is one of the worse I've ever read. The worst of these bad examples is the author's description of the events in her own life:  In high school, when I was a big fish in a small pond, my life had a happy ending: I met my dream girl, married her, and had three lovely children. But as time went by, I began to see things in a different way: I could not have my kids because I was too busy playing video games and watching TV.  She then goes on to list the most awful things about video games:  Games have made me a better person, and made me think deeply about my life.  Games are the greatest thing that ever happened to me.  My kids are so grateful for games.  I have spent hours on video games. It has taught me to be patient and to be grateful for the small things in life. I can't believe how much time I've wasted watching TV and playing video Games.  This is the worst kind of bad.  There are a lot worse books out there, but this one has the highest percentage of bad to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is just about as good as a bad mystery novel gets. I read the first half, which is very dull. The second half was a different story altogether. It was more interesting, and also made a good change of pace from my usual mystery reads.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a collection of three stories that are a lot like one another. All three are about people who are unhappy in a relationship with a person who isn't really who they think he is. All of these stories are about a man who comes into a relationship, takes it in stride, and then decides to make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting to enjoy this book but instead found it tedious.   The characters are all either "evil" or "trying to be evil" and there's no depth to any of them except maybe one who is trying to be nice.  The story isn't very good either and I'm a little annoyed that it's about a girl who has a "sick" family.  I think that's a theme that runs through most of the YA genre and books like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was skeptical at first, but once I started reading, I really liked this book.  This book is written from the point of view of a female student at an elite university.  She is a woman who wants to be a lawyer, but who instead ends up doing a lot of research to get a job.  It's a good story with good characters.  The bad part is that some of the characters seem so unsympathetic that I found myself rooting against them more than rooting for the main character.  I also found myself frustrated at the author's poor writing skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that made this book interesting was the title.    The only reason I didn't give it a lower rating was that I have always been curious about the concept of "a man who is born without a penis."   It would have been interesting to know how he got a penis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no idea why a "bad book" is good enough to be included on a bad-book list. I mean, there are a lot of bad books out there (I'm looking at you, John Updike) and I'm not saying this one is one of them (because it isn't), but it is a pretty good one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not as bad as it sounds.  It does a good job at illustrating the various ways that the Bible is mistranslated and at explaining how it is not wrong.  In addition, there are many good examples of how Bible scholarship and biblical interpretation have advanced.  However, I would not use this book as a reference when I am looking for a Bible translation.  This is not a book that will help you to discover that the King James Version is not the only translation of the Bible.  I would recommend this book for students who have taken a Bible class, but would not recommend it for students without such a class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read. I don't like this genre.  It's not about a real person and I think it's just meant to be for people who have been abused by people who are trying to be nice.  I was expecting something like, "I'm not sorry I can't get my kid out of that stupid thing."  I don 't know why the author didn't just have her son be a normal little boy who just wants to play baseball or be a good friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a pretty decent book, but it is very heavy handed with the feminist critique of modern society.  It's one thing to say "the world would be a better place if women were in charge" but to go on to say, "I do not think that society can be reformed or made more egalitarian without destroying its cultural roots" is simply silly.  The last thing that modern society needs is a group of people who believe that women can fix everything.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because of my brother's fondness for it and I was disappointed. The book is basically about the story of the author's wife, who was so attractive that a doctor suggested she wear make-up. She tried it and didn't like it. It didn't help that her husband wanted her to be a housewife. It was a horrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a sucker for a good romance. This one was just okay. There were times I thought, "I'm sure I'll be able to find something that will make me want to read it again," but they were all too few and far between.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a couple of months ago and it was a total waste of time and money. I don't know why, but the first couple chapters were really interesting.  There were a few interesting characters in the book, and the plot was really well thought out.  The author also made a lot of claims about some ancient people.  I can understand that, but they were not backed up by any proof, so I just stopped reading.  A lot of people seem to think that the authors claims about the Ancient Egyptians are true.  It is a little sad that a book is written about ancient Egypt that is so bad.  If you read it at all, it will just make you feel bad about ancient Egyptian culture.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first time I have purchased a book from a non-US publisher (Amazon.com) and it was well worth it. I have been looking for a good, informative book about the history of the United States. This book has it all, and is the best of the lot. It is well written, easy to follow, and the book itself is beautifully designed and printed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a very tedious experience.   The book is based on a very bad novel  that I have read several times.  It is not a very good book.  The author has no interest in writing good books, but is more interested in telling a story that she thinks is interesting.  There were times when I wanted to throw the book away and tell her that it was a terrible book, but it would be so much easier to just ignore it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so glad I don't have to read this book again. I'm a huge fan of the book, but this one is simply a complete mess. I've been meaning to read the book for a while now, but my procrastination is preventing me from making that happen. The book takes place in the 1970s, so it's not too far from the present day. The plot is pretty simple: a writer who is about to turn 50 has a terrible, horrible accident and is left in a coma. He doesn't remember a thing from that night, but a nurse at the hospital gives him a few pills that he remembers being taken by a man named Richard at a club where he worked. That's all he remembers about it, and it doesn't help him to recover. His memories of that night have been completely erased. That was all the plot that I remember from this book. I guess the premise was a bit over the top, but there wasn't anything that was actually wrong with it. I was pretty bored by the whole thing, and I was disappointed that the author didn't write a better book that I would have been happy to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good story with a twist ending.   I thought the story would end with a happy ending, but the twist is that the man is the villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a man who goes to a small town to work as a preacher. It is a very interesting read about a very important person in his life. It was a great read and a very good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry but   that   book   just   sucks  .   It's a great   story   but  I think it's just  misleading   for young readers.      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in college. I enjoyed it but the ending left me disappointed.  I think that the book was written to get a high score on a school test, but the author didn't have the skill to write a good conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad.  I read the first 50 pages or so to see if it was going to be bad, but it is.  It's really not that great.  The plot is really boring and repetitive, and the story just isn't very original at all.  If this book had been a movie, I would have skipped it in favor of something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my son but he did not like it.  It is not an enjoyable book to read.  The story is just confusing and it took me about 3 hours to finish the book.  I do not understand the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for a good book about the occult and the Illuminati since I first heard about it, but it is hard to find good ones, and I have heard good ones but not quite good enough.   This is the first one I found that did not make me want to run screaming to the library, but rather made me want more.  I am so glad I bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a long book that I found myself getting distracted by throughout the book. It's really good but it took me a while to really enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that just doesn't get it.   The first 50 pages are fine, but the rest just doesn´t make any sense.  The story is about a guy who is abducted by aliens and then goes on to tell his life story.  But then there is a sudden cut to the aliens saying "We are going to give you the power of the universe" and a spaceship appears in the sky and takes them away.  It´s obvious that they don't understand the point of the story and are just making a stupid joke.  So this story starts off okay but after the aliens´ return they suddenly just give up and give up on the guy.  If you are not going to understand why you´re reading a book then don´t bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this book.    It's not terrible but it's just not good.  This is probably because it is a collection of short stories.  A lot of the stories are funny but not very original.  It is a good story collection though, especially if you enjoy short stories like I do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and loved it. It was fun to read and it was well written. However, the plot is extremely contrived. It's hard to get invested in a book when you're constantly reminded that you're reading a novel. I'm hoping the second volume comes out and the plot isn't that contrived but that's just me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, but it really needed a good editing job.   The first half is a bit of a slog, but the second half gets interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a complete waste of time, and I will probably never read another one of his.   The book is all about how to manipulate people into doing what you want, and the way that people are not really good at what they do is really what he focuses on.  I'm not sure if he is trying to explain why we can't really tell how good a job someone is doing.  If that is his point, then it's not a good book to read for someone who wants to learn. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. It is a textbook case of why bad writing should not be used for any purpose. The writing style is so bad that it actually makes the text more confusing. The information is given in a confusing, contradictory, and confusing manner. Even the title of the book says it all: it is about "how to be a good parent." This is the worst kind of book to be taught to children, especially by a bad teacher. I'm sure that the author got some good feedback on the writing, but if I can get something else out of this book, it's that I really hope people who are teaching children to read are as incompetent as this author. I hope that this book is used by the parents who read it to get a bad grade on their report cards, or for them to find the time to read it before taking the test that they have to take in order to graduate high school.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping for a more realistic portrayal of the Holocaust. I found the author to be very biased.   A good book: This book is a must read if you are looking for a good book about the Holocaust and if you like a good historical novel about the Second World War.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's good that this book isn't being made into a film, but I'm glad the story of a real-life girl who had a heart attack in the middle of her high school career is being told.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring to me, as well as to the people I know. The plot is boring. The characters are boring.   The plot was predictable from page 1.  The main character doesn't have a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me years to get to this one, but now that I'm finally getting the hang of it I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I've been a fan of the Harry Potter series for years, but I have to say I was never a huge fan of Quidditch. Now that I know it is about a team of students trying to win a tournament, it's actually kind of interesting to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third book in the series and I really enjoyed it, but the plot just doesn't add up.  It just seems to be there to create a tension between the characters.  And the characters are just so shallow and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the most pointless books I have ever read.   I know I'm not supposed to like books about cars, but this one is so stupid it's insulting.  One of the main characters has a dream that he's in a car accident and wakes up in a hospital bed.  He's confused as to why he is there.  So he walks around the hospital for about 15 minutes.  And when he is finally asked what's wrong, he says "The doctor told me to get out of the car."   That is literally the dumbest thing I have EVER heard from a car.  I'm sure it's a very common dream.  It's just very hard to take seriously when it comes to a car crash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent, interesting book about the ancient and medieval church. It is interesting to know that many of the "best" writers on early Christianity were non-Christians. I'm sure that they enjoyed their work but they could not have had the depth of the book they produced without the inspiration of the early Christian faith.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has absolutely no purpose other than to tell us that the bible is the truth, that's all it is, and that's why we need to read it. I don't care if it was written by a non believer or a believer, it's not a book about what it says, it is a book that tells us what it didn't say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. The book is about a very poor boy who gets involved in some very bad people, who in turn get involved in lots of bad people. He gets into a gang, gets beaten by the gang, ends up in a mental hospital, and ends up dead. That's about it. The author doesn't even seem to have bothered to learn the history of the gang and its activities. If I were a gang member, I'd be embarrassed that the author gave me such a crappy book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a horrible waste of time.  It's written in the   style of a book written by a 12 year old   about an imaginary friend.   It is filled with   inaccuracies,   factual errors, and omissions.   The only thing that makes the book interesting is   the    descriptions of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor book that is badly written.   The characters are mostly unlikable, and the setting is a farce of a society where women and children are put to work in the fields to produce food for the rich, but are then treated like slaves in a system of "domestic slavery" and can never be truly free. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book about the history of the Church and Mormonism. It was very well written. I learned a lot about early Mormonism and early Church history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't understand what the author was trying to accomplish with this book. I can't even fathom why he bothered with writing a book about a guy who has a big penis, since most men don't have a penis that large. It just seems like a waste of money and time to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was extremely dry, and the story just fell apart. This is a book that has a great premise, but it's so over the top that it doesn't hold up to any real scrutiny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know what I expected from a book called "The Secret Life of Bees."   Bees are the least interesting bees you can possibly imagine, except perhaps for a queen bee who has some sort of bizarre compulsion to mate with her own father.   She was so obsessed with mating with him that she even used the term "mating dance" when describing how she tried to force her father to mate her.  It was pathetic.  I found it very sad to read about this poor bee. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book very much, but I did read it. I was surprised by the amount of detail that was given about the different kinds of animals that lived in the woods. I don't think I'll read it again but maybe I'll when I have time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot, setup, characters, etc., are very good, but the writing is so amateurish that I almost gave up on this book.   It is very difficult to understand what is going on, or why any of the characters are doing what they're doing.  This may be due to my having read a number of poorly written novels (i.e. "Halloween"), but it seems that most of the plot points were already clear to the author before he started writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed that my favorite book by the master, Joseph Campbell, did not appear to be about a good man.  This is a book about a man who is so well-spoken that he can speak to anyone about anything.  If you want to read a book on how to be a good person, this is a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing but a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a tedious, repetitive, poorly written exercise in the use of clichés and the misapprehension of social context. It was very tedious to read, but that's not the only problem.  The book is rife with grammatical errors.  I've already mentioned the grammatical problem about the boy in the book.  In other cases, it's unclear whether the author is actually trying to say that one thing is good and the other is bad or whether he is just saying that the other thing is bad.  It's as if he is attempting to make one argument into two arguments.  Some of the other problems:  The author's explanation of the difference between being in love and being in a relationship is confusing.  He is arguing that a woman's love is stronger than a man's because of a deeper and more intimate connection, but in my opinion it is a bit like saying that a person's body is stronger because it is in better condition.  What he means is that a man can feel stronger feelings about a woman because he has a bigger and better body, but the reason why he has that bigger body is that he is in a better relationship with her.  This is not a very good argument.  Another problem:  This book uses a lot of the same type of stereotypes and caricatures as the movie, but it's not that good either.  There is a lot in it about the woman's inferiority complex that is very common in Hollywood movies about women.  While this book is certainly no worse, it just isn't very good either
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not about how the author was "wrong" or anything like that, but it is about the fact that he was so very wrong about so many things that I just had to look up what he wrote about in order to confirm everything he said.   I'm sorry, but the only way that anyone could have made this book more accurate would be to go to the original sources and try to figure out exactly what the author is getting at.  The book is a total of about 500 pages and in that time the author has made no mention of the following:  1) The original version of the Declaration of Independence was written by Thomas Jefferson.  2) The Declaration of the American Revolution was not signed by George Washington.  3) The Continental Congress never sent the Articles of Confederation to the states.  4) There was no "Declaration of Independence."  5) The Articles of the Confederation were never ratified by the states and were never even discussed in congress.  6) The Treaty of Paris did not include any of the 13 original states.   7) The War of 1812 was not a war between Great Britain and the United States.  8) The Constitution does not give Congress the power to declare war.  9) The government is not a "federal" government.  10) There is no such thing as "an individual right to own a firearm."  11) The US Constitution is not the "founding document" of the United states. 12) There are no "uniform national colors."  13) The phrase "all men are created equal" does not apply to the US Constitution.  14) The term "involuntary servitude" does NOT appear in the Constitution. 15) The words "freedom of religion" do NOT appear anywhere in the US constitution.  16) The word "loyalty" does in fact appear in many places in the constitution, but in a very limited sense.  17) There have been no attempts at "national unity" for over 100 years.  18) The "United States of America" was not founded by a religious group.  19) The Founding Fathers were NOT "founders" of any other countries.  20) The Federal Reserve is not "a privately owned Federal Reserve Bank."  21) The UN charter does NOT grant the US the right to enforce "global governance" and its "law of the sea."  22) There were no
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good read, but not a good one. It is good for kids, but it is also a good book for adults. It contains many good stories about different species of plants. It does have the annoying story about how plants get the seeds from animals.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a very interesting and well written book, but it just doesn't really do much to engage me.   The story was interesting and the information in it interesting, but I was more interested in the story of a girl and her dad getting divorced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after I read a review of it.   It has many similarities to The Last Battle, but the author's writing style is so different that it is difficult to see them as anything more than the same author writing about the same subject.  I have also read a few of the comments by other reviewers who say they are "not a fan of fantasy" or something similar.  The problem with this is that fantasy is a very broad genre, and it is not uncommon to find a fantasy novel that does not meet the criteria for the genre.  To suggest that it has no "fantasy" or "literary" elements is just insulting to the many authors who have tried to put their own spin on a genre. I do agree that it takes a lot of effort to write a fantasy book, but that is because writing a fantasy is so difficult.  If you can write a book in a genre that is familiar to you and is not too hard to write, that is even better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never really been a big fan of YA. I've enjoyed reading about teenage angst, but I can't really relate to it as a teenager.  I don't really get the desire to be popular, to get good grades, or to be an expert in a field.   I know the feelings are there but I just don't understand them.  The book really bothered me and I don a lot of bad books but I was still reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was 16-17 years old and it scared the hell out of me. It is a story of a girl that kills a guy in a car accident and I didn't want to be near her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. The story has some good points but it is too long. The characters were too thin to be believable. This is just one of those books where I can't get the point the author is trying to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book, but it is not a good story. I really didn't like the way the main character is described. He seems to be some kind of a freak. I also don't like how he is constantly described as a 'freak'. This is a very small part of the story, but I didn't really like the details that were given about how he was "born" in a strange way. It was also confusing how he could talk about himself like that. Overall, it wasn't bad but it was not good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a classic in the field of self-help literature. The advice is good but the book is dated and hard to read.  The author is a narcissistic person who has no interest in making people happy but wants to be the center of everyone's attention.  This leads to an awful lot of self deception, a lot of ego stroking and no real advice to be found.  I gave it 4 stars because it was an interesting read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disappointment. It is a collection of essays written by some of the most respected American academics of the last two centuries: the Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, the anthropologist Howard J. Ehrlich, the sociologist Paul Goodman, the poet Wallace Stevens, and the social theorist Herbert Marcuses.   The essays are, in fact, mostly interesting.  I found the essays that dealt with Marcuse especially interesting: Marcuse's theory of radical democracy (which has been used as the foundation for some of his more recent works) and the fact that Marcuse himself was a communist and a Marxist.  It's possible that, while Marcuse is interesting, the essays in the book are too little too late.  Marcuse was a brilliant thinker, but his ideas fell on hard times after the fall of the Soviet Union.  (Though Marcuse has had some influence on the New Left and is an influential philosopher in his own right, I have yet to find a work that can be said to be truly influenced by him.)   Marcuses ideas have had a resurgence recently, in part due to the influence of the New York University philosopher John Searle, but also because of the writings of Richard Rorty, the philosophy professor who helped popularize the concept of "postmodernism" in the 1960's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the first part of the book. It was great.   It was the book that gave me the idea to read other books, especially non-fiction.  It is about how the government, including the United States, is run.  The information is presented in a very interesting way, but the writing style was slow and a little too long.  This book will give you a good understanding about what a government is, but you will be able to learn more about it by reading other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was hard for me to get into this book.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I could hardly understand a word of it.   The characters were like cardboard cut-outs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with information that can be useful in any situation. It's all too obvious that some of the information in this book is not applicable in a real life situation, however, it is very useful in a classroom setting where the teacher has to make sure that all the information is conveyed and the students understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this book is written by a drunkard. This book is a bunch of blather about the history of the United States. Not only is it written by an uneducated drunkard, but he's an unlettered drunkard as well. The "history" he presents is full of errors, errors which the actual historical records prove. His descriptions of events are also full of inaccuracies. For example, he talks about the first man to jump off a ship in a parachute without the proper training: "I am not sure how the first person to jump from a ship without parachutes survived." How about the fact that he didn't die? How about his death? How do you not die from jumping from a plane if you jump from one? I can think of many things that could have killed him, but they weren't in the record at the time, so the fact is that he was alive. Also, he describes the history as if it's a good thing that America has a government: "It is only in America that the rule of law and freedom have been established." What? How many countries do you know where the rule or freedom are not established? How is this any different from how a "law" is established in any other country? And then he talks more about how the rule and freedom in America are bad: "Our law does not protect the rights of the poor or the powerless, the elderly, or those who are weak." I know that sounds terrible, but it's true. America does not have a system of law that protects the poor and the weak, or the elderly and the powerless. It does not. America has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any industrialized country in the world. So this is what he means by "the rule of the law and free speech are not protected in the U.S." And he does not mention that America is also the only industrialized country that doesn't guarantee basic health care to all its people, including the poor. So he's saying that because we have the rule that allows us to have a government where the rich are protected, that we are in fact not a free country. This is complete nonsense. And to top it off, he has a complete lack of historical knowledge. When he says, "The U.N. is a threat to the survival of humanity," he seems to forget that he's talking about a group of people that were created by
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about this book. I've been wanting to read a novel by this guy for a while, and finally got around to it. I can't say I'm impressed with this novel, and if I had been reading a more conventional book about a guy's struggle to find his place in the world, I'd have just left it at that. However, I was able to get through it, which is good since I'm not really a fan of these kinds of books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book very useful in my study of the history of American anti-Semitism.   The author has carefully researched his sources and his thesis is a solid one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is interesting, but it is not believable.  The characters are too similar to be real.  There is no real reason for the main character to be there or how the plot is going to develop.  It seems like the author is just throwing things at the reader.  I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on Amazon for $5.   This book does not have enough information to be useful in my day to day work.  There is no reason for a doctor to give a negative report on a patient who has been treated successfully.  The information is not clearly presented in the book,   or presented in an objective way.  I would recommend that this book be used in a medical office and not a clinical laboratory. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been using this book for a while now. It's a very helpful introduction to a complex subject that is both very useful and also a bit confusing at times. However, the author has not done a very good job at explaining a lot of the more complicated aspects of the subject. I'm not sure what he's trying to get at with the "structure" he's referring to but I suspect he has a different meaning for it than I do. I think the "Structure" that he's talking about is really the "methods" that can be used to explain the "details" of any given subject. He seems to be talking about the process of "thinking" about the subject and how it can be divided into various "sections" which can be applied in various ways to different types of information.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got this book and found it to be a poor translation. The main character is called "the little mouse". The translator uses a lot of words that the original didn't have.    She also uses a different word for a boy's penis (instead of a handkerchief) and the word "titty" for a vagina (instead the the word that is used for penis).   In a good book, this would have been fixed but it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of short stories written by a writer named Robert J. Riggs who died in 1997.   While the stories were well-written, they are all too short to be anything but self-serving.  Riggs, in my opinion, wrote stories that he wanted to read and he was not interested in writing stories about people who he knew very little about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book but it is not worth it. I have read other books by the same author and liked them better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of the way this book has been written up to this point. It's mostly just an exercise in trying to find a way to describe the characters in a way that feels good, or at least that's what I get from the summary. They're all bad people in the end, but the badness of them doesn't always make them good people (although it can). Also, the way that the bad people end up being the ones in control of the bad stuff (even if they were the ones who started it) is a little silly. I don't think there's a good way to do this kind of thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very tedious book.   It has all the trappings of a good thriller: the dead woman's voice, the murder weapon, the car chase, the evidence, the victim's last words, and so on.  It is a good read though, as I was able to concentrate.  But if you are looking for a good novel, read something else, like the James Patterson novels, or the Michael Crichton novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book was just a little too predictable to be enjoyable. The characters had very few redeeming features.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book because it was a book about a famous magician, and he did tricks with magic.  He did many things that were really amazing, but it was hard to follow because he didn't tell you where to look.  For example, he would do a trick with a coin, and you have to pick it up.  It would take me a lot of time to get used to picking it up, but I eventually got it.  I didn't like the "hanging" effect of the coin.  The book could be more descriptive about what he did with it and when.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author uses many "facts" that are wrong in order to support his point.   He claims that the "Bible" was written by "The Apostles" and that the Apostles were inspired by God.  He also states that the Bible was "inspired by the Spirit" and "the Spirit of God" in addition to the "authority" of the Apostles.    The only "author" that is mentioned is the Spirit of the "Apostles" but even he has no authority over God.   It is a very poor argument and does not even hold water.  The book has no facts about the book of Revelation or about the "New Testament" in general.  This book is a complete load of bs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a bit hard to read at first but I managed to finish it.  This was a book written by a woman who does not know much about men or relationships.  The main character had a lot of problems with the women he was attracted to.  I thought that he would have found someone else to love and he would still be happy but he ended up alone in his relationship.  He does not even know why he is unhappy.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent book on the topic of the relationship between science and religion, which is an interesting subject and I found it extremely interesting.  It is very good that a scientist writes a book on a subject he understands, because it is a very difficult one to write about.  I find it interesting that a physicist would be a very serious believer in God.  As a scientist, I believe in the scientific method and believe that if we can find out how things work, we can understand them better.  But I also believe that religion can be a valuable tool for spiritual growth.  While this book may not explain how religion is used in science, it does show that both the religious and the scientific approach have their place.  This book is good on the spiritual aspect of science, but it seems that it is not well written on the science aspect.  The author does not seem to have an understanding of what the science really does, nor does he have a clear understanding of the science and religious viewpoints.  He does make some very good points about the importance of the scientist as a believer, but at the same time, I think it is more important for a believer to learn about the scientific world view than to try to use science as a tool to try and understand religion.  For those interested in the spiritual side of science and the relationship of religion and science, this book will be an excellent read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting something good but was disappointed. I would have loved to see a real investigation into the events surrounding the assassination of JFK. Unfortunately this book does not provide that. This book is nothing more than a biased look at the events of that day. The author also has a history of making false claims. He also seems to have a fascination with the assassination and a hatred for President Kennedy. The last two things don't seem to bode well for his book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that will get your son involved in a religion you do not believe in.    This book does not give you any answers.  This only gives you more questions to ask your son. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first chapter is great and I really enjoy the stories. Unfortunately, this book is a mess.    In particular, I'm not interested in reading about the women in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book, filled with boring and unnecessary detail.  The only interesting part of this book is that it's by a man who's writing for women who are very "smart" and very "in control".  That makes sense to me.  I don't have any problems with being "in charge" - in fact, I have plenty of problems with having to think for myself and do things myself.  In fact, in some ways, it's really hard to think about doing things yourself when you have a lot of other people telling you what to do.  But I don;t get why he thinks it's important to talk about "smarts" and "control" when so much in his life is a mess.  This book is a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a bit more action than the author has provided. Instead, it's just a bunch of exposition about the book and its author's past, which really doesn't provide a lot of context.   It doesn't help that the characters are such cliches, too: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. I have to admit that I was really looking forward to reading this book but I am now a little disappointed. I would like to give it a good review but I can't. I can only give it an "I wish I would have known better" rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was so poor.  This book has very little to do with Christianity.  It's all about Satanism and how you can be one too.  I have no problem with that as I'm a believer in the Bible and the church.  However, I would not be so quick to believe the lies about Satan.  In fact, there are plenty of things that he does not do.  For example, he does NOT say he has any children that he uses to gain power over people.  He's been married for 30 years.  Also, he is not an occultist.  These are common beliefs.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about anything other than the Bible. I found the material to be boring and useless. It's a good book for the occasional Bible study, but it will not be used again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of books about the paranormal. However, this book is NOT about the supernatural. It's about a man who goes to a museum to look at a wax angel statue. He is horrified to find out that the statue is a fake. I mean, what is the point of having a fake statue if it doesn't even have wings? It's not like that angel was going to save the world or anything, but still...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad that the only good thing about it is that it is a good book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad read. The writing is very sloppy and doesn't match up with the events that occur in the story. The book is about a man that was "born with a devil in him". The man had a "dark side" that is never revealed, but it's a part of who he is.  The book starts out with a scene where he's drinking, and he ends up in a fight.  This leads into a scene in a bar where a woman and man start arguing.  She makes the argument that the man has "a dark side", but he says that it's part of him.  I feel that this is a cop out, because the woman is saying that the "dark sides" are part of the man, but the man is saying he doesn't have a dark side.  It's not the same person at all.  Then the woman takes him to a therapist to try and get him to admit that he has a dark heart, but he refuses.  He does admit that there is a part that he's ashamed of, but this is nothing compared to what he's done to others.  A few chapters later the book jumps ahead and the story switches to another man who has a "light side".  This man is a good guy, and is trying to help the other man.  However, when he goes into his apartment to get a bottle of wine for himself, he's confronted by a stranger.  There is no light side in this man, and the other guy doesn't seem to care that he isn't a good person.  So what's the solution here?  Why is this a good man who is trying so hard to be a good father?  It just doesn't add up.  What kind of character is this guy?  The writer has to be very lazy to write a book like this.  If you want a good book about a good character, look at "The Da Vinci Code". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is an idiot.    His attempts at making the characters seem like real people is just plain bad.  His characters are just as cliched as the other ones.  He has a hard time writing anything about people.  "This book was a total failure.  It is a book about a girl that is obsessed with her phone, and her friends, and all her gadgets, and the only thing that really seems to matter is that she has a phone."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to prepare for a seminar on "The New Social Paradigm," a course I'm taking this semester. I was very excited to be taking the course and was hoping the book would help me understand the concepts behind the course.   However, the book is so dense with ideas, that the only thing I was able to get from it was a general feeling that the social paradigm changes in America are very significant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading "The Girl on the Train" (The New York Review of Books) for a while now.   But   it's just not that good.  It's like a really bad movie about a really good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book for my birthday. It was pretty bad. The main problem was that the main character didn't know what a "no" was. He thought "no one" said no to him. This is bad because it makes the entire story seem fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims in this book to have been a "real boy" growing up in Chicago. This is a nice idea, but not one that applies to most of the boys in this books, most of whom are just as clueless as the average boy. This book is not about boyhood, but about "boyishness," which is a concept that is only applicable to a select few. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read this book, and I am sad to say that it didn't do much for me.   The book is so focused on the problems and the problems with the book that I could barely get through it.  The main character was boring and the ending was just an unsatisfying and disappointing ending.  I wish I could recommend this book to other people but it just isn't worth the effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was good but was hard to put down. I had to read it again and again, to find what was going on. It's very difficult to get through a book like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm very sorry to have to write a negative comment about this book. I found it quite uninteresting and uninspiring. It was not that the content was bad. It wasn't bad. I just felt like the author did not have much experience in the field of business or finance. It's hard to get a read on someone's financial expertise if you can't even understand what a financial statement is. This is an extremely simple book that is easy to understand but it's hard for me to take a business book that doesn't really cover the basics of what a business is all about seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this book for over a year now.  I like the idea of the book but am a bit disappointed in the execution.   It is the book that inspired my "Get a life" attitude.  However, this book is about the end of an era in the "Gospel" movement.  It should be about the revival after the era.  The whole concept is wrong and the execution is poor.  A better title would have been "Jesus: The End of a Great Era." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man who is obsessed with a fictional character from a tv show called "The West Wing".  The book has a few good ideas about a president and how he operates but really it's about the guy who's obsessed with the character and how it affects his family.  It's just so predictable and annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters in this book were terrible.   They didn't even come across as human.  They were evil, vicious, viciously manipulative.  When they were on the run,  they were like snakes,  slithering around like snakes in the grass.  I have seen the movie and I would have liked to have seen a few scenes like that.  It seems the author was just going for a cheap laugh,  but  he didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. The characters were interesting and the plot kept my interest throughout. The author's narration was also good, as it was always a surprise to find that the book wasn't written in the third person. The writing was good and I like that she does some historical research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book about 3 times and I've been hoping it would be better but it's not.   There is a lot of good advice but the bad stuff comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this book, but couldn't do it. It was too much about the history of the US and I didn't care to get involved in that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book.   I was given a free copy of the book as a present, and when I read it I thought, "No way is this gonna be good."   There were some parts that I thought were really interesting, but the rest of it...   This book is a piece of junk and I'd rather read something interesting than read a bad piece of crap.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is about a man's journey to find out his identity. But the writing is really awful.  He just can't seem to come up with any interesting things to say about his life or why he is a good guy in the first place.  The plot twists are so contrived that you think he has some plan to escape and then realize that he's just going through the motions.  It's like a bad TV show about a guy who thinks he is an astronaut.  If it wasn't for the great cover art, I would have given it zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, a child is taken into a fantasy world, is killed, and the adults who took him into the fantasy world are all happy about it. I didn't find the book to be that exciting, but if you want a fantasy with some adventure, it's worth a look.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't normally read long fiction books but I was enticed by this one after reading the reviews. The plot was okay but the characters were poorly written and I couldn't understand the story. I guess they're trying to say that people can't really live forever but why would anyone live forever? I guess the writer wanted to prove his point but the message was lost on me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad book. The author is a good writer, but I didn't enjoy this book. I don't think that he has much in the way of original ideas. I found the whole thing rather boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that the main character of this book is a bit flat.  He's not a good character.  I mean he's a nice guy, but he's not that kind of guy.  This book's main character is not a "nice guy."  He does things that are wrong.  It's not like he has some kind of special insight.  Like most men, he's just stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in a few days and was disappointed. It took me quite a bit of time to get around to it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book, and I have to say that it was a bit of a disappointment. I really wanted to like this book; after all, it was written by a woman. I was looking forward to the more historical aspect, but she only used historical sources that were not particularly interesting.  She did get one thing right; it was not always easy to find information about women in medieval times.  I also found the descriptions of the men to be somewhat stereotypical (though this does not seem to have bothered her at all), and there were several instances where she made a mistake in her use of the words "sexually provocative" and "sex" that I did not understand at the time (but that may not have been important).  Overall, I really was not impressed with the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of the book was when it was first announced.  But now, I am sad to report that it was not.  It was a very nice book and the subject matter was well researched, but the writing was very dry.  I had to stop the book because I kept wanting to turn the page and find out what happened to the other two men.  This is a good book, but it would have been nice to see something more out of the two main characters, but there is a lot of information that is not used. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book and I can tell you that it is not for everyone. I love science fiction, but this one left me very disappointed. It is very poorly written. There are so many errors that I could write my own book about the problems it has. It's like it was written by a 13 year old boy. I have no idea what was the point of the book but I'm not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very confusing. I was having a hard time understanding how this is supposed to work. It is very difficult to understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, while excellent in many respects, has many flaws. There are many "why didn't I think of that" moments.  The book seems to be all about the "big idea" (the "drumming down of prejudice"), but that idea is a bit too weak to get past the "why" problems.  There is also a lot of backtracking and back-and-forth, as in the discussion of the effects of race and class on the American "dream."  While the book is an attempt to show that the "dance" is really just the dance of class, it fails to explain the why of the dance at all.  I do understand why the book presents the dance as a classless phenomenon; the social hierarchy of the past (the gentry versus the poor) has not really disappeared, but we have come a long way from the "lower class" and "upper class" distinctions.    However, the explanation is only half the story.  We have seen the effects in the past.  A wealthy elite is now able to use the power of its wealth to keep the poor in a state of subjugation, and that is one of the primary reasons that the poor are so poor.  Thus, I do not see the reason for the dance to be about the class hierarchy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about two months ago.   This is a good book about a good person who screwed up big time and who still managed to do good, but for reasons he could not have anticipated.  I have been on a journey of self discovery over the last two years.  This book has helped me understand that I am not always the smartest person in the room.  It has helped give me a good example to follow when it comes to being more self aware and being in charge of my own life.  A good book like this can help you to get there too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have bought this book many times because it is so fun and is so interesting. I enjoy the way the author talks about the history of the early English school and how they created their own grammar and ways of speaking.  However,   the grammar is incorrect and   even in the examples provided the grammar   is wrong.   It seems that when a teacher tells the children that   they must   use   all    of   their   words they have to get out of their chairs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. I can't imagine anyone liking it, but it is certainly the worst book I have ever read. It's a waste of time and money, and it is so poorly written that it is impossible to put down. I don't know what a writer has to do to make a book as bad as this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most boring book I have ever read. It's a book about the life of a famous actor (Oswald), and it's all about how Oswald was a "sicko", how he was a pedophile, how he died by falling off a balcony. No actual information about the case is given to make it more interesting. The only part of the book that makes me want to read it again is the part where Oswald talks about how he met his future wife and how it turned out: "It was an accident. I met her at a party in New York, when she was a young actress. She was a pretty girl, and I had a thing for girls, too. She didn't like it. She said she'd like to be taken off. We were friends for a while. Then we got married." So, there you have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first section of this book is a list of "the worst" things in life. These are all things I would rather not have happen to me. There are plenty of other "worst" things to be listed: getting shot, dying, or being beaten. It is nice to know that people are "less than" me, but I wouldn't want to be in that position.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I wanted to understand what is behind the "bluetooth-hijacking" in the film, which in the book is explained by the fact that the Bluetooth technology was stolen from a British intelligence organization (though the movie was filmed in London, the actual British Bluetooth agency had no knowledge of the theft). In the movie, it's the Chinese that stole the technology from the British and are now using it to attack U.S. military forces. I suppose I can understand that the Chinese might be interested in using the technology to get a foothold in the United States, but there is no mention of that in the movie. I'm still curious as to how a foreign government would be able to gain access to the technology, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had no idea who John R. Fraley was before this book came out, but this book just makes it all worth it.   I don't know that there's any more I can add about Fraley or his book, but it's so entertaining and well written that I will most likely be reading it for a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a couple of these books and I can tell they were poorly written.  The characters are boring, the plot is very predictable, and the characters are very clichéd and predictable.  This is why I like to read romance.  I like the fantasy genre, but not when it's this bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poor book about a poor man. I was hoping to get a better book out of this author, but this is just not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book that is filled with the typical Christian apologetics that is common in the genre. In fact, I am glad that I didn't read it. I think I was just getting bored of the genre and wanted something new. I am going to put it back on my shelf, but not out of the way of other Christian books that I enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad, and the writing is horrible. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 1 is that I still found it interesting to read about the history of the Roman Catholic Church. I have to say I find the concept of the Church fascinating, but the book is not very well done in that regard.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of space and the author is a dolt.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I like about this book is that it's a quick read, but not a very good one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was about 18 and found myself pretty engrossed and turned on by it.   After the first few chapters, I had to put it down.  I don't know how, but this book is not one that I'd recommend to anyone who has any interest in women's sexuality.  It is not a book about sex, but rather a book that is written to make you feel guilty about enjoying sex (and women in general).  It takes the reader through a series of events that involve the reader finding herself masturbating, and even then, she is not satisfied with the experience.  If you are the kind of person who can't get aroused by anything, or if you don't want to admit that you have a problem with masturbating or have tried but failed, then I would highly suggest that you skip this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so long that it doesn't help me understand what the author is trying to say at all. I don't think I've read a book that makes me go 'whoa' like this one does. I mean it's just a lot to take in. I'm glad I read it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is not a good story, it is not interesting, and it is boring. The characters do not do anything, the plot does not advance at all. I hate reading about "bad" books, especially ones with a bad cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not the biggest fan of horror.   The genre is one that is prone to creating some very  disappointing stories.  The last book in this series I had been looking forward to.  I'm glad I did but I can't help but think that the author went a bit overboard in trying to "demystify" the mythology of vampires. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. However, I really don't understand how some people find the writing of this book to be so good. First of all, the story is pretty much just a bunch of people in a bar talking about themselves. The characters are not well developed. There is a lot of character development that isn't really shown in this book (e.g. the relationship between two people who can't stand each other, or the way the author doesn't really explain how he came up with the name "Cynosurr"). There are no real characters that really matter. The story just kind of happens and is very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read is the third. It starts out very good but then it devolves into an incoherent mess of a story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading the Harry Potter series for several years now. However, this book is a complete waste of time. I did not enjoy it one bit, and I am going to have to start looking for another book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of stories. Each story is about a different person that I know and I have known since I was little. I've met my ex-wife, my exes, my siblings, my cousins, and many others through this book. The stories are mostly about my own experiences.   I hope to get out of the cycle I've been in and start living a more fulfilling life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to finish this book when I was in middle school but couldn't get through it. It was really frustrating.  The characters in this book seem so unrealistic.  I wish it would've just ended and I would've been able to move on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book quite helpful but was very disappointed in it's conclusions. I was hoping that the author would say that the idea of the afterlife is not "scientific fact" but is rather a superstition and that there is no evidence that anything is real in the after life. He actually does say that, but then says: "Some people have no interest in any sort of afterlife, and they do not think that there's any point in trying to find it."  This is a rather strange statement to make if he actually thinks there is nothing to find.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read.  I got it for my birthday but couldn't finish it.    It's not that I hate the characters or the story.  It just has nothing interesting to say about the people who live in that part of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad translation from German to English, and the translation is bad too. The book is about an atheist, who gets annoyed when people tell him that they are religious because he is an atheist. The only good thing about this book is that the author is good at his job (writing a bad German book).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not have a happy ending. The ending was very disappointing and the way the author wrote the story was a little off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a huge disappointment for me.   It is a complete waste of time and is more of a rant than a serious look at a serious subject.  I would not waste my time with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this one a few times.  The author's story is a bit dated now.   It's about a man who has a girlfriend.  I think a man should date a woman who's not his girlfriend.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just another "troubled teens" book by the authors. It's about as close to the original book as they could get. Not the worst book they ever wrote, but not one of my favorites.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a couple years ago, and thought it was a good introduction to the art of photography. However, the author made no attempt to describe the technique in any way other than a paragraph. He made no effort to describe how the negatives were developed, nor did he explain how the camera and film worked. Instead he gave the impression that it was just as easy to take a photo of a bird as it was to take one of a horse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written by a woman who is obviously a man obsessed with her own womanhood.   She doesn't know anything about science, medicine or women's health.  She also has no interest in learning about women's issues.  This is a book for women who are looking to gain self confidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read the book, I really enjoyed it, but after reading it a few times, I realized that it was just a bunch of nonsense.  The narrator, who is also the narrator of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," is just a bad narrator.  It's like a bunch more nonsense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not bad.  The plot was interesting.  I would recommend this book to my friends who like dark fantasy and dark romance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can understand the attraction to a good story, but when the author starts introducing all of the plot holes and inconsistencies it makes it almost impossible to keep reading, the book becomes almost unreadable.   It seems like it is written by someone who has never done any research into the matter at hand, and instead relies on his or her own assumptions to fill in the blanks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed with this book. It's hard to take a book about what I'm trying to do as an introvert seriously. It is a good book to learn about what you're good at and why. It can be helpful to think about why you enjoy certain activities more than others. But in the end, it's just a list of what you don't do well. If you're not good at things you don.t do well, then you shouldn't do them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. It is the story of a family who lost their home because of a fire. The husband, a firefighter, was killed on the job. The wife is very strong and determined. She is the first one to go in after a fire and save the family. She was also in a bad car accident.  The whole family has lost a lot. The fire caused the family to lose a lot of money.  This book is about all the sacrifices the family had to make in order to have a home. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was skeptical at first, but I gave this book a try.  The author's claim that "there is no other book like it" is well-founded.  This is a highly readable, well-organized, and well-researched book.   It is also entertaining and entertainingly written.  There are numerous examples of how the author has successfully applied the techniques to different subjects.  I have to say that I found myself reading about how to make a good pie crust, when I have always loved pie crust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really interesting, but a bit difficult to follow at times.  I have to think about the relationship between a child and his parents as an adult.  This is the book that introduced me to the concept of "mild mannered" people.  It is a fascinating book and well worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of useless. There is no point to it, nothing to it. There are only two characters in the whole book, and one of them is a guy.  I can't think of anything good about this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never understood how people can enjoy a bad story.  It has been a very long time since I read a good book and now I'm going to be reading this book in my car...  I know I should get off my car, but I can't get myself off my laptop and read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book because I'm a fan of J.K. Rowling.  However, the characters are not real, and the plot is nonsensical and contrived.  I'm going to start a petition to get Harry Potter removed from bookstores. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing to do with my life as a professional artist.   It is a collection of short stories about the world of competitive eating.  It's a pretty boring topic, but the authors do a good job of presenting the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read two of the books in the trilogy.  I did not like them.  It was obvious that the author wrote them to get the attention of his literary agent.   He wrote them quickly, in a style that is not his, and in a way that is very self-indulgent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I have ever read.  I was hoping to read about a young boy's struggle with the disease that caused his parents to abort him.  The book was terrible.  There were no details about the actual condition, the child had a completely different brain structure and was suffering from severe brain damage.  It was a long, confusing story about his father and his father's behavior and behavior alone.  This was the most depressing book I have read in years.  It was all the way down to the end that I wanted to just throw the book away and never go through with reading anything about it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book that was poorly edited, badly written, and has a very confusing ending. The first half is interesting, but the second half is completely pointless.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know if I'm ready for the end of this book yet. The characters and story are interesting enough to be interesting. It's just the ending that's so horrible. It really leaves a bad taste in your mouth after the last few pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I've ever read.   The main character was created by a character from a previous book.  This book is basically a book about how a character in another book created a new character in his own book. It is a sad story and a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe I've been stuck with this book for so long.   First of all, it's terrible.  There are so many problems with it that I'm still not sure how they even thought to get this out in 2015.  I'm a huge fan of the books by Stephen King, but this one is a disappointment.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is that the "bad guy" is just a dumbass.  That he doesn't know how to get the book he's looking for is just stupid.  Secondly, there's no explanation for the weird noises he makes.  Thirdly, he has a weirdly huge vocabulary.  The most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life was in a video game (I don't want to mention which one) where someone's character uses the word "bitch" over and over again.  So, he can say the word, but it just doesn't mean anything to him?  And if he can't get the fucking book he wants, that means he's got a huge vocabulary and doesn't use it.  Fourthly, there are so few of these books out there that I can only assume that the publisher was just trying to get as much money out of a book as possible.  And finally, it just isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry I didn't buy this book.   It's a poor read.  It makes it seem like the author just made up a bunch of stuff about the Civil War. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book but has a major flaw in it. There are a lot of bad things about this book, and I'll tell you right now that I won't be buying another one. My kids have never liked the books they get from the library, so when I came across this one I thought, "Oh, it's another good thing that we can read together!" But it's not. The book is just a waste of time. It's not even worth reading, I'll give you that. It has nothing to do with the topic at hand. I'm sure it was a good idea to write a book about this topic, but it just goes on and on. It doesn't really say anything that I haven't heard before. The people in this book really don't seem to have a good thing to say about anyone in the world. The author talks about how the French have been dominating the world for the last few hundred years, but the French don't really seem to like the French. The Germans don't like the Germans, the Russians don't feel very good about the Russians, the Chinese don't want the Chinese. It gets even worse in the last chapter. The Chinese are just so miserable about the Chinese taking over the world, the author even says that it's because the Chinese didn't do anything all these years to help the Chinese people. Oh my god, is there any other way to read this book other than just being mean to all the people in it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first few pages, a woman is shown sitting at a table reading a book on how to be a successful female author. This book is so full of cliches and nonsense that the whole thing is a little tiresome and annoying. I'm guessing that a lot of other women have read this book, but have never actually written a book, much less written a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a lot like "The Hunger Games." Both books are filled with gore, blood, and death. Both books have an "I've seen this movie/TV show before" feel to them.  They both take place in a dystopian future.  "The Killing Game" is filled with people who are being murdered for no reason.  In "The Slaughterhouse," the main character is a "hunter" who hunts people because he's sick of seeing their misery.  Both of these books feature a young protagonist that's trying to find a purpose in life.  The main character in "The Hunting Game" goes so far as to kill himself in order to prove he can do it.   The characters in " The Slaughterhouse" are so completely unlikable that it's actually funny.  These two books are horrible, and they're not even that great at being bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never read a book so full of inaccuracies. There are several inaccuracies in this book: The first time that the author tells the story of the Bantu who came to the UK is when the book was published in a British magazine, so the book is basically a reprint of the magazine article (and a rehash). The Bantus had been in Africa before the British arrived and lived in the jungle. The author makes no mention of the British's arrival in 1837 and the fact that they destroyed a major tribe of Bantues in the process. The second time that she tells the history of the Black people is when she's talking about how the black men who came with the Black slaves to the United States were more intelligent and better suited to agriculture. Again, this is a re-telling of a story that was told in a book about slavery. I don't see how a retelling of this is necessary. The third time that her story is told is about the Banting and his family who were "taken in" by the white man in South Carolina. Again there is no mention about the fact the Bants had been slaves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoy reading about the history of a culture I don't know much about but am sure is fascinating. However, the book is full of errors and blatant errors that I found appalling. For example:  "In the first half of the nineteenth century, the American republic was dominated by three large industries: railroads, textiles, and banking."  This is wrong. The railroads were not a "large industry" until about 1900 and were already becoming a large industry in the 1830's. They were also not a small industry until after WW I.  The textiles were a small-medium industry until about 1875. It was very important to the United States that we have textiles for the army and navy during the Revolutionary War and were very important for the American Civil War. Textiles also played a big part in the founding of the American Republic and the American colonies.  is an odd choice for a subject as well:  the "American Republic" was not a country as we understand the term today. It consisted of several colonies (New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina) and was ruled by a monarch. It never became a country. . The word "United States" does not exist until after the Civil War, and even then it is used by several other countries.  in "The American Republic" does NOT mean "United State of America." I also found this interesting: . "This was a time when the most influential American politician of the period was a former president of the Confederacy. "  I am not sure if this is a typo or not. It would be interesting to learn more about his life and how he influenced the United Sates government, but as far as I know, there was no such man. (Of course, I might be wrong, but I can't find anything about his death or his political career in my history books).  and "The financial crisis of 1929 led to a massive government bailout of banks that had taken on too much risk."  the government didn't bail out banks until 1933, a year after the crash.  "The New Deal's New Dealers, like Franklin Roosevelt, were deeply committed to public works." . This is also not true. Franklin Roosevelt was a strong advocate of government spending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited about this book until I found out it is a "classic" by a man who is in the business of selling such books. The basic idea is that he has spent all his time, money and energy to make sure that his clients never get cheated out of their money. In his own words, "I want to make the customer happy. It's not that I want to be rich but that I don't want to let people down." If that isn't a classic then I don' t know what is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really poor book about an excellent author. I was looking forward to the story about how a very famous author came to be, but as a result of the author's illness and other complications, this story is not as compelling as it could have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was really hard to read this book. I really wanted to like it, but it just was not for me.  It seemed like the author was trying to make some sort of social commentary about the culture of the 90's.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've tried this book over the years but always felt   like I'd missed the point.   This   book   isn't really about     the  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I got this book is because I'm so desperate for a good historical fiction story that I had to check it out.      But the story is so bad that it's hard to believe that the author even knew the names of any of the people he was writing about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit worried about this book because it's called "How to Be a Good Girl", but I was completely blown away by it.  It's a really well-written and thought out book about dealing with bullies and the repercussions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first couple of chapters are great, but the last one just completely fails.  I mean, you can't really blame the author because she's a professional writer, but why make your readers read the same book over and over again?  I tried it once and it was way too much, so I never read it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of time.   The first 30 pages is about the book's subject.  There are not a single "gods" mentioned.  In the last 20 pages, the author talks about his love for a woman who has two children.  The rest is a litany of his life mistakes.  It's almost as if he is trying to convince himself that he doesn't need a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poorly written book. The characters are poorly developed. I felt bad for them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad story.   It is a good story if you have read the book, but if you haven't I'm not sure you will like it.  The book tries to create a compelling story about a girl who is a great dancer and goes to a school for dancers.  It uses some of the dances from her dancing class to create the story.   Unfortunately, there is no actual dancing in the story and the dancers that were introduced in the book are just props that have no effect on the story or character development.  I don't really think that there is any real story in the novel, but the author is trying to tell one so she puts in some dancers.   The main character doesn't really develop much at all and is just a character that is there for the sake of having a story about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has everything you can want in a thriller:  bad guys,   bad places,  horrible situations,  good old fashioned suspense,  and  good writing.   I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars but the main character is just a bore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an ex-wife of a well-to-do family. She has gone to a party for a family friend, and her husband and son are there. She is a very good friend to the family. After the party she has gone home. She sits in the living room and she is upset because the family friend doesn't seem to be as good a friend as her husband. She goes to her car and looks at the clock.  Then she gets back into the car and drives off.  I really didn't like this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for the first time, about a year ago.  I enjoyed the book but I didn't find it compelling or original.  The protagonist is very weak.  It is clear that she's trying to make herself better but it's just not working.  She just wants to feel better about herself, which is easy enough to do with drugs but difficult to do in the face of the world around you.  For me, that was the real problem with this book.  And for those who have a drug problem, this is a good book to read because it gives a lot of useful information about how to get off drugs.  However, I was disappointed that the author was unable to make her own personal story compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe my santa read this and didn't get it!   It's a short, uninspired book about a man who's a giant.   The story is very predictable.  It really doesn't have a great plot, either, so I can see why the author would have written it as a short story.  I do really like that he did a parody of the "Happily Ever After" books, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a really good book.   The only bad thing about it is that it is a bit over-long, but this is the first book in a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's soooooo slow, it makes it hard to follow what's going on.    The ending doesn't work either, but the book is so slow, that's forgivable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was given this book as a gift by my mom and was thrilled to read it.   Unfortunately, it is not at all a good book.  The main characters were not very interesting and did not seem to really care about the plot they were working on.  My mom bought this for me because I like fantasy and I thought I could relate to the main character, but I did not find it interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book.   Unfortunately, the book is riddled with problems.  The author seems to be trying to sell it as a "serious" book about how the bible is an accurate history book,  but that's not the case.  Instead of making the book readable, the author is trying to present it as factual.  I was expecting a more balanced book, but unfortunately this is not it.  Even if you do believe in the historical accuracy of the bible, the fact that it is so biased makes it seem even less true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "real story" is the story that is presented in the "real" book. There is no "real life" story in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. The main character was well written and had a great personality.  This book was good, but it just did not have a good ending.  I don't know how much longer I will keep reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so disappointed with this book.   The narrator, Mr. C, is a terrible narrator, but the story is so bad I don't care.  He is the worst narrator I have ever heard.  Mr. A's dialogue is terrible too.  The story is also badly written.  It was hard to follow.  Also, the author doesn't use the word "shit" enough.  I thought he was talking about a "shitload" of "shit".  I also felt bad about all the "shit I've eaten" comments.  Overall, I feel sorry for Mr. M.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the first book by this author.   I am not sure I will ever get the second.  It was just a bit too preachy and preachy for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book as it was too short and I expected more from it.  This is a good book about a good idea but the idea is flawed and the execution of the idea poorly done.  I enjoyed the idea but I think it could have been done better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an interesting book, but the subject matter is a bit dry.   The author does not seem to have done much research, as he quotes a lot of people without bothering to check their credentials.  This may be an example of "the devil makes the best prose" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about how good people sometimes make bad decisions.   The book covers the years when people were going after Michael Jackson as they did the victims of 9/11.  It seems to be the most popular book about 9/ 11 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part about reading this book was the amazing artwork. The book is a collection of comics that were made by artist J. G. Jones. It's like you are reading a comic book that has the most interesting characters in comics history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed that this book is so poorly written.    The whole thing is just   poorly written.   In general, I'm a fan of Stephen King.  He's got a knack for writing a good book, and this is no exception.  I just can't get past the fact that it was just a rehash of   the old material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why I bought this book, but it's one of those "I'll read anything" books.  I'm always looking for new authors that I'll give a chance, but I've been on a bit of a literary roll lately, so I was expecting a bit more from this one.  This book is not bad by any means, but there's not much here to entice me in the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not found a book that was really worth the money that I paid for this one. It was a waste of time and energy for me. I had to do it over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read, and the worst part is the author. The title is a misnomer: there are no elves in the story. This is simply a story about a girl who has been turned into a monster, but in the process has to learn to live and love again. The book is also a bit too long. This book is an adventure story about how the world is turning into an alien-filled wasteland, but the author seems to think that we need to read about all the things that are turning us into aliens (such as the internet, cell phones, the internet and the internet) in order to understand how the human world will be destroyed. This has become a pattern in her work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very, very bad book. I know the book is not about a character from a classic science fiction novel, but even in that case the character has the character traits of a bad writer: overly clever, an arrogant snob, and a pretentious jerk.  The main character spends a lot of time on his phone in a boring way, he's rude and condescending to the woman he's with, and he never seems to make a serious effort to learn anything in the book.  He just does what he thinks he's supposed to do.  I don't want to say he's a bad person, but he's not as interesting or memorable as he could be.  His attitude is also a huge turn off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was great as a general history of medieval and renaissance art. The problem was that the author was not good at writing history and the text was dry and repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have bought a lot of books over the years, but this book is by far my least favorite. I have had to turn it down more than a couple times. The premise is not all that compelling. I'm not sure why I would read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book but I kept having the same thought as in another book - it's not bad enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've ever read. I loved the first two books but this one was just a waste of time. It's like someone who has read my other review was reading my book and just threw it out. It was boring, poorly written, and didn't really explain anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished a book called The Good Life. It is a book that I have read several times over the years but never found a good one.  The Good life is written by a man who is the author of several other books, a man I have never seen do a bad job at writing, a book I have no interest in reading.  This book is a failure.  It has no redeeming quality whatsoever.  I can't help but feel that I will not read a book like this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has absolutely nothing to do with the topic of this review. It is nothing but a "how to" manual for the self-promoter who loves to brag about their accomplishments, but has little real knowledge to back up their boasting. It's not a bad read, but you will probably find yourself just as bored by the "self-promotion" part of it as you are by the actual book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book sounds like a bad joke. The book is full of spelling and grammar errors.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed that the author has a problem with gay men having sex with each other.    He has a tendency to make these types of things out to be the whole point of the book.  This book is written with the sole purpose of making the author seem like a genius. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it was in a library and I wanted to know what happened in the war. It was not the best book I've read in the last 15 years or so. The war was a bad decision on the part of the US government.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read.   It's full of blatant factual errors that are so blatantly false that I can't believe that a book about medieval life has to make them.  The author claims that "The Knights Templar, the military order that grew out of the Crusades, fought as a mercenary band.  But they never made more than a handful of mercenary contracts."  This assertion is not only completely false but also seems to be completely invented.  For one thing,  the Knights Templar were a regular military force during the Middle Ages.  And for another, the Templar orders in general had a reputation for recruiting young men.  What is most laughable is that the author claims this mercenary business was not "worth it."  He writes,  "There is no evidence that the Knights Templars ever gained more than about a few thousand pounds of silver a year.  It is highly unlikely that the Templars could ever make more than that through their mercenary activity, and they certainly could not make it from their own personal wealth."   The claim that the Templar "did not make more that a handful" is also false.  During the time of the Templar leadership, it was estimated that the order made more in revenues than it spent on arms and supplies.  Yet, he claims that the "Knights Templar were not able to make more" while they were in control of the Knights Hospitallers.  This statement is also completely false.   The Knights Hospitors, as the Templers were known, did in fact have more wealth than the Knights of St. John.  When the Hospitels were attacked in 1210, the Templards made a substantial contribution in the form of the ransom that was paid.  By all accounts, the Hospiterians were much better paid than the Templarians.  To support his claim that they were never able to become more than "a handful,"  the author makes the assertion that the Hospitan leaders were forced to flee from the city.  He also states, "The Hospitalls, however, were not allowed to stay in the city, but were forced into a castle in the countryside."  Again, this is completely false, and the author should not be making these claims about the Templar leaders.  Finally, the author states that the reason for the Templar's failure to "make more than" a few hundred pounds of profit is because the Templiers were not given a
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an attempt to explain what is wrong with feminism. It is an extremely poor attempt. The main problem is that feminism has no place in science. That is not the same as saying that it is bad science. It isn't. Science isn't just about facts. It's about the questions that need to be answered. Questions like: How do you know when someone is lying? How do scientists do that? How does science help you understand a society? What is the problem with feminism? Why is feminism bad science? Why should we care about a movement that is largely about sex?  I wish this book had been published in 1981.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting to enjoy this book more than I did.    The author seems to have a thing for describing women as stupid, or at least as being stupid.  The first two thirds of the book were very enjoyable and it's clear that there is a lot more to this story that was not written about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that this is a book that should not have been published.  It is full of misinformation about a subject that should be taught in high school.  The author seems to think that anyone who believes in creationism is ignorant or mentally handicapped.   This is absolutely untrue.  In fact, most creationists have advanced degrees in biology, physics, and mathematics.  This book is filled with inaccuracies and false statements about the subject that is not supported by evidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written in the 60's by a famous science fiction writer. The story is about a planet that has been devastated by an extraterrestrial invasion. The aliens, in turn, invade the earth, bringing a plague of death. After a plague kills everyone on the planet, the humans are forced to take refuge on a space station orbiting a planet in the solar system. The humans are kept on the station as slaves by the aliens. The book is about how the humans cope with this. The author's prose is very cliche and the aliens' motives are not that well defined. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a difficult time finding a good book to read, and then I found this. It is the story of a poor man who had a bad childhood, and was abused by a bad mother and finally his father. His childhood ended in tragedy and his life ended when his father went to prison for murder. He had a life-changing experience that changed his life for the better. However, the book is a little heavy on symbolism, and the ending was a little unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a few of the books in the series, but I always feel like the story is a little off. The plot seems rushed and has a lot of holes in it, but the ending feels forced and not really satisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a bad read. It was very confusing, and the story didn't come together for me until I reread the first chapter. I liked the characters but the story just didn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but it's a bit boring.  The characters are all very good at what they do, but there's nothing exciting about them, no twists, no "oh shit" moment.  I'd rather read a fun, funny book that is also interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been wanting to read this book for quite a while but never got around to it.   The plot was really bad and the characters were just terrible.  I feel like it's not really about a man who is going to be a famous writer.  It was more about the fact that he was a womanizer.  She has her faults but I just found her so unpleasant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book written by a man with a great ego who was a "bad boy" and who had a hard time admitting his own mistakes.   In the first half of the book he is a "nice" boy who never gets the girl, and in the second half he is one of those boys who can't admit he is wrong.  He can't take responsibility for his bad decisions, and so he blames everyone else, the society he lives in, and even himself for his failures.  It's so much easier to blame other people for your mistakes than to take responsibility yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book from Amazon because it seemed to be the best on the subject, but unfortunately I found the book to be very inaccurate and confusing.    While this book is good at its core, it is far too much of a handbook for the inexperienced writer to get a good result.  It also has the potential to make the reader a worse writer, which is unfortunate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've had this book in my library for over a year, and while I know it's not as good as the classic, it's still worth buying. The main problem is that the characters are basically flat, and their reactions to the same events are almost always the same.   It's also hard to care about the characters, even when they do good things, because they never seem to develop beyond their roles as cannon fodder. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book the author tries to use scientific evidence to back up his position that the world is flat.   But the evidence he uses is of little value, as it is based on a misreading of an existing scientific paper, a mischaracterization of the conclusions reached by a different group of researchers, and the flawed assumptions behind the paper's conclusion.  The paper itself states that "the surface of the Earth is probably not flat"   and that "flatness cannot be proven."   What a waste of time and money for a scientist to waste his time trying to prove a point that is already established 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it would be good because I love the old ones. Boy was I wrong.   The stories are dated and the illustrations look like they were drawn by a 3rd grader.  The story about a woman who killed her two children was terrible.  This is one of the most vile and disturbing books ever written.  If you want to read about the worst people in the world that is fine but don't waste your time with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed in this book. The story is so contrived and contrived that I found it ridiculous.  There was nothing at all that made me want to continue reading.   I can't even imagine what would happen in a fantasy world like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a very bad read for me. I don't normally read books by women authors, but I decided to pick this one up after hearing the good reviews on Goodreads. I have been wanting to read a book about women's history for a long time, but never found one. I thought this would be the book, but it's just the opposite.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been wanting to read this book for ages but couldn't find it.   So I bought a Kindle and now I'm very disappointed.  I know this is supposed to be a young adult novel but it's not.  It's a book that will get a grumpy old man going. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a lot of historical books and am very impressed with the authors' work. This book is no exception. However, it is hard to get through because it is so long. I have only read the first two chapters, but it is a long way to go just to get to the part where the British, under the command of the incompetent Henry VIII, are marching up the River Thames to the Tower of London. The only reason the British did this was because the Pope was angry that Henry was marrying Catherine of Aragon. It was a bad decision that the Pope made, but that's what history is all about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book for people who want to learn about the Jewish holidays.  This book is about how the holiday of Purim has influenced the lives of Jews all over the world.  I don't know how the author came to write such a book.  If the author was trying to prove to a certain group of people that Jews are better than everyone else, it didn't work.   It was a waste of my time and I'm sure of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very boring book.   As a historian of literature, I have always been fascinated by the life and writings of George Eliot.   But this book does not interest me at all.  The book is written as if the author has spent all day reading about the life of the woman he so detests.  If you like the way he writes about her, I don't mind.  But he should have just put it down and stopped.  This book is just too depressing for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story has a lot of potential but doesn't seem to be going anywhere.   This is a very basic science fiction tale with very few interesting characters or plot elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever. It has so many errors that I can't believe they got it published. The only thing I can say for it is that the author is a very smart woman.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very sad book, but at the same time I love the way that this author explores and uses some of the most tragic of events in his stories. It is very hard to accept that people can hurt so much, but then it's nice to know that they do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a really hard book to read.   I can understand why the publisher is charging so much for it, but I'm afraid I won't be picking it up in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting to be blown away by the author's mastery of language, but it's a pretty bad book, so much so that I found it impossible to put down.    She makes a case that the use of "fri" (frigid, etc.) is a form of passive-aggressive   abuse  .   It's really hard to take the author seriously, when it's clear that the author has no   competence   in   the   subject  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very basic book on writing. It is a book on how to be a good writer. It makes you think about your writing, and what kind of writer you want to be.  It is not very well written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad, boring book. It has no originality, no plot, and the characters are so uninteresting that you wonder why they even bothered to read the book. I am a good writer, but when you have to write a bad character to make a bad plot work, it's hard to keep up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping that it would be good and then realized it wasn't. I was hoping that the characters would be interesting and that it was written well.   Instead, I found it very boring.  I would only recommend this book to those who want a good laugh and a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very similar to another popular book I've read recently: The Power of Positive Thinking.  Both authors are well-known for their positive books.  This one, however, does not deliver the same positive message.  The main reason for this negative review is the lack of detail provided in the introduction.  It's obvious that the authors had little time to really do research or research on their own before writing the book.   This was very disappointing.  If the book had given a good explanation of how they got their information, it might have been a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is a bit clunky and sometimes hard to follow, but if you can make a point about an aspect of life that you know to be true about a particular group, this book is for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read the first two books of this series by Stephen King.  But I was disappointed to find out that the characters were all the same.  I can't help but feel that King has no interest in writing characters that he can relate to.  The author is so into writing the characters that the writing becomes tedious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got a copy of the audiobook version of this book, which I really wanted to read. The book has been out for a while now, but I still found myself waiting for the final installment. The audio was very good, with good acting from the actors, and an interesting story. The only problem is that the author had to do the narration, so I had to listen to a bunch of the same actor narrating the whole book. It took a little while, but it was worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of fantasy, and this one is among the worst.  It's poorly written, badly plotted, poorly written with an unnecessary female character who's an obstacle, poorly plotted with a male character who is a caricature of a misogynist, poorly done, poorly realized, poorly planned, poorly executed...  The only redeeming factor is that the author's other works are good, which is enough to offset it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book as a gift for a friend and her son.  I was disappointed in the book.    It is based on the book  A Secret Life: The True Story of My Dad and the Secret of His Success,   written by William M. Buckley Jr.  The book, however,  does not follow the book's title.  This book was not written by Buckley himself.  Instead, it is based in part on a book he published,  My Dad: The Life and Times of a Conservative,  published in 1983.  It has an entirely different tone.  Buckley is a very nice man, and his book is an enjoyable read.  He is certainly the inspiration for Buckley's book,  The Conscience of a Liberal,  published a few years later.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book for a bad writer. The book reads like a poor man's autobiography. The author spends the entire book talking about how he was a great writer when he was young. I found that to be interesting but I also found it a little tedious. He talks about how the writing changed when he became a published author but the writing isn't that different than when he started.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a very long time to read this book because of the way it kept going backwards.   I wanted to like this book but   after the last couple chapters   the story starts going backwards again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most fun I had reading a book in a while. I thought it was a good read, but I didn't care for the characters. They were dull and boring. The story wasn't bad though, but the characters just weren't interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author spends so much time in this book trying to be a nice guy that the story falls flat. The guy has to be the hero in the story.  He's trying to keep the peace and save the day but he's the bad guy.  It's like he is trying to do the right thing but can't manage it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book.   It is very dry and boring.  It seems like a good idea at first.  However, after reading the book, it seems like there are no real conclusions.  The only conclusion is that the author is either crazy or incompetent.  I can't understand how she managed to write such a boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a fan of this book when I first heard about it but I'm glad I gave it a try. I don't think I'll ever read anything by Robert Silverberg. It is just so...boring. I think his work is very good. I've read several of his books (and I've listened to several of them on audio) but this one seems to be the one that makes him seem a bit "old school." He is a good writer, just a bit of a drifter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad. I am a medical student and had heard a lot about Dr. Peter S. Sargent's work and his book, but I had never heard of the author, a guy named John D. McAllister. It seems like he has a ton of money and is a celebrity for no reason. This book seems to be a collection of bad advice, all of which is based on the same flawed logic, and many of which are contradicted by other sources.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that it's funny.  I'm not a big fan of humor in books.  This book is funny though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so disappointing.   It has no story.  It is just a series of bad jokes.  A lot of the jokes are very bad, and the jokes were mostly made up to fit in with the main story.  The ending was also very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book.  It was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited about reading this book when it came out that I picked it up off of a shelf and immediately started reading it.   It wasn't bad at all, but the writing was terrible.  I didn't get any of the characters.  The one that I did get a good glimpse of was a woman that was very "girly".  She was just the worst.  It took me a long time to even start feeling bad for her because her behavior was so bad.  She didn't even know that she was a bad person, so when her mom called to ask why she was behaving like that, she didn't know that it was wrong and that it would only make things worse.  In the end, the book did not make me feel good about myself or my ability to handle stress. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read, even though it's supposed to be a work of historical fiction about the early years of the Soviet Union.  The entire story is about a group of people who live in a little village in Siberia in the early 19th century.  They all go to a school where the teachers are all female teachers.  And they have to dress up like women in order to be able to attend class.  This has never been a good idea to me, since it's a very sexist idea, especially when it's enforced by the teacher.  However, this is what makes it even worse.  While the teacher is insisting that these men all dress as women for class, they are all still in men's clothing.  How is it that the men are still men and can wear dresses while the women can't?  It makes no sense.  Why do these women have to have a different uniform?  This makes no fucking sense.   I really don't know what to think of this book.  I'm not even going to bother trying to figure out if the author is just an idiot or is actually trying to portray the women in the book in a sexist way.  It doesn't matter because the fact that the story is based on a real-life event makes it all pointless.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The main character is a complete idiot who is an insufferable prick and seems to have the least sense of humor in the world.  This book was the last thing that I read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been looking forward to this book for a long time, but I wasn't sure about it until I saw the title and was reminded of one of my favorite stories from the book: "Bunny in the Snow," in which the bunny who has become famous for being an extremely good climber is actually a liar.   The story makes it very clear that, although he is a very good climper, he doesn't actually have the skill to scale a tree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had my doubts about the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" for years, but the fact that a book I liked so much was taken down after only a few years is extremely disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a very interesting read about a man and his family who moved to Alaska after World War II. But the book was so bad I couldn't even finish it. The author did a very bad job of presenting his life story, he makes up a lot of stories and is not believable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a few dollars to read in the car.  It's a very boring story.  I can't find a single good thing to say about this book.  There's not a single character that makes me laugh out loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the series, but this book is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book. It's a good read, but the book is full of errors, and the story is extremely unoriginal. It takes place in the 1800s, and there's a lot of historical inaccuracy that is just plain stupid. Also, this is not a good book for anyone interested in the history of science or religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was going to read this book because it is being touted as a great biography, but after reading a couple pages I realized I wasn't interested in what she has to say about her time as a child of Hollywood, how she was "the first black actress to have her own movie," how she "wasn't a great actress," etc. I'm not even sure what the point is in the book, but it seems to be a "me too" campaign to promote herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story about the poor man with the good side-eye is the main event in this book. It's not bad, but it doesn't have much to do with the plot, which is so weak.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book a negative rating, I would. I'm not even sure what I got out of it. I don't really want to read about a murder, because I'm very much against them. I just don't think the book was worth my time, especially when the book is so poorly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was in college in college I loved this book but after reading it and realizing the stupidity of the author I did not give it a rating because it did not interest me as a reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book very difficult to read and the story just wasn't that interesting to me. I didn't really like the main character, either.  The author is clearly an educated person but it's not enough to make the story interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the original paperback and the hardcover versions, and I can say that they are very similar to the original edition. The hardcover edition is slightly smaller than the paperback edition, but the quality is the same.  The author is a nice person, so I'm happy that I bought it.  I read it on my Kindle for the first time and it was a very good read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really know why I didn't like this book. It's not bad by any means, but I find it hard to read. It seems to be written by a man who is either very lazy, very self-important, or very lazy and self-importance. The book doesn't really have much to say about a lot of interesting subjects. He seems to have a very narrow view of the universe in general, and this book is about as broad as he gets. It really doesn't help that he seems to think that everyone who is interested in religion has some kind of deep-seated, spiritual belief about the universe, which he can't understand because he doesn't believe it himself. He doesn't get it, he doesn. It doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, if I believe that the universe is infinite, and everything in the universe revolves around me, then how can I not know that there are millions of other planets? If I don  I'm always on the lookout for books that have something good to say, but just don't get past the middle of the first chapter. This is one of those books. It has some nice ideas and some nice examples. But, I just couldn't really get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book by the same author very frustrating, I found it very hard to understand, and the content very confusing. I think I have a better grasp of what the author is trying to do. I am looking forward to trying other books by him, but will probably not pick up anything else from him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that was supposed to be " The Bible in Modern Language," but instead it's just a boring translation of the Greek text in a non-traditional way. The translators clearly know how to use modern language (in this case, English), but there are many grammatical errors that make the translation a real challenge. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so good, and I was so happy to have gotten it. However, I'm so disappointed with it that I'll probably have to cancel my subscription.  The main reason is the main character is an evil person who abuses the disabled.  He is the worst   I have seen in a while     I'm very disappointed in this book.  This is the first book I've ever had to cancel because I was completely unable to read it.  I just didn't like the main protagonist and the entire premise of the story.   It's like the author took a story about a kid who gets bullied and changed the whole concept to make it about him.  That's just not very good writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book. It was so very bad. I am really not sure how a publisher like Random House would give a book like this to a young child (my daughter) and a mother. I just don't understand. She is not old enough to even drive. This is so wrong on so many levels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author says that he didn't really know what the book was about until he read it, but it's a horrible book. It's the kind of book that makes me feel like I can't be objective about something, that the author is too good to be true.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a girl who gets her own back on her bullies and bullies the bullies back.   It's not a very good book and I don't think it's well written.  I feel like the author had no idea what she was talking about and it was just a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a poor reflection on the subject.   It is a well written biography of an unknown, probably unheralded author who made a name for himself by his novel The Golden Bowl.   He is one of the most interesting figures in twentieth century literature.  However, his reputation is a product of his time.  He was a young man in the 1940's and early 50's.  His fame came at a time when the publishing industry was dominated by men.  This is a period when the romance genre was at its peak.  And although he has become a well-known author in the last forty years, he still doesn't get the credit he deserves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so badly written, it is hard to know where to start or even if it is even a book at all.  It was a complete waste of my time.  I could have saved myself a lot of time and trouble by just picking up some other authors' work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a sad commentary on human nature that this book is so popular and so difficult to put down. If you like reading about what makes people think and feel, you will enjoy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that makes me feel like the entire world is a giant scam.  This book has been used in several different ways by different people in different ways.   I found out that I was one of them.  It makes me angry that I found this book out in the first place, but I'm still grateful that I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a fan of fantasy.   However, I found this book very enjoyable.  I found the main character to be likable and the story intriguing.  The book is written in a manner that is not too complicated, but also not so simple that you will be lost at the end.  There are a few points that were hard to grasp at first, but I did eventually understand the basic concepts and the writing style.  My only complaint is that the book is a little overlong, but it was very enjoyable!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters in this book are not very interesting.  I mean, I've read a few books about vampires and witches, and I'm sure they've been fun to read, but this book is about two people who just can't stay out of the way of each other.  This book doesn't seem to be very good for a vampire/witch book, but I don't have the time to read a book about vampires/witches, so I'll give it a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the story. I think that was all. It didn't matter that it wasn't based on anything that actually happened.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not a fan of this book.   It's very bad.  It has a lot of problems and it's very poorly written.  I have a lot more respect for the book's author than I do for her writing skills.  The writing is sloppy and the story is very poorly thought out.  This is a book that's meant to be a mystery, but it's a bad mystery that's not even close to being believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe how many errors I found in this book. The first is the author's claim that there is "no good evidence" for the existence of God.   As anyone who has studied the subject will tell you, there is a wealth of good evidence for God's existence.  For example, the following are from a book I recommend highly: 1) The Bible as historical text:  In the last chapter of the book, Haggard attempts to "prove" that the biblical account of Noah's ark is a "fabrication."  This is a common fallback claim from non-believers when they encounter a problem with the Bible.  However, the Bible as a historical text is not a good "evidence" for anything.  The reason is that the Bible contains errors that make it less reliable than a good historical source.  Here are a few examples:  "The text that contains the oldest known written version of the Flood story is found in the Book of Jubilees.  It was written around 200 BC and tells the story of how a group of Israelites abandoned their home in the city of Jericho and went to live in a cave.  They built a large ark and were saved from drowning in the Mediterranean by a miraculous sea creature, a sea monster that ate up the men.  In Jubileis, there are several mistakes:  The account of the flood goes on to describe the creation of the earth, but does not mention the Flood of Noah at all.  This omission is quite important as it makes it difficult to determine the time of creation as the Bible claims.  Similarly, the text tells us that the ark landed in a marsh, but the fact that the story ends with the arks resting on the shore of a lake is evidence that the text was written some time after the Flood and not before.  Finally, the story is filled with other minor problems, such as the story that Moses was given a golden calf, the claim that the Flood covered the whole earth, and the story about the Ten Commandments.  If these details were added to the text, it would be very difficult to reconstruct a text that was accurate to the original." (S.L.D.M.T.M.) 2) The Flood myth:     The author claims that Noah's Flood was a "myth."   The Flood story in the book of Genesis is very
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, one is taught to do things right (like not use a computer with a hard drive), but they are taught to be wrong. The "right way" is actually just a different way of doing the wrong thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want to learn about how to be a great cook and a great woman, this is the book for you.   A woman who wants to make her own meals and enjoy cooking has no idea how to do either.  She has to look up everything on the internet.  It was not until I read the directions that I understood why she did not like to make anything herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so looking forward to this book, but unfortunately, it just wasn't as good as I was hoping. I'm sure the author had a good idea, but the book just didn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. It takes forever to get going. It is also poorly written. It seems that he did not know how to write a book. The main character is a "psychic" who is very confused. He doesn't understand why his mom never comes to visit. I felt bad for him but the book is too long and he is too "mysterious" to get through the book in a reasonable amount of time. It will not entertain a reader, but I can't complain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a good book but the ending made it less than that.  It was too simplistic and lacked any sense of adventure.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a huge fan of the books by the same author, but this one is just...a little too far.   It is like he wrote it in a hurry and forgot to do any research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not as interesting as it first seemed, even though I enjoyed it.  It is about the early days of a religious group in a small community in America and the various ways the group is affected by religion.  The author was very clear about her religious beliefs, but made the book feel very academic, as if it were written to be an adjunct to a class in religion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been reading the D&D manuals for years now.   They are great fun for the kids.  They're short and easy to understand.  But the first one is just a bad joke.  And then there's the second.  The last one is terrible.  My boys have read it and have said they won't play it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me months to finish this book.   I can't say I didn't enjoy reading it, but after finishing it I knew I would have to go back to reading other things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last 20% of the book is about a person's reaction to a bad relationship. This was very good as I was able to relate to what this person was going through and understand how difficult the last couple of months had been. It also shows the difficulty in maintaining relationships when you are struggling in one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband was very pleased with this book. It was the first book that I read by a well known author that actually interested me. I also liked the fact that he included a section on different types of dogs in the dog world.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was thoroughly disappointed by this book.   It's a very good introduction to computer science but it fails to teach how to do anything useful with it.  I don't care about computer science, so I'm really not interested in reading a book on it.   I'm just interested in how computers are designed and used.  It would be nice if there were some sort of reference to the design principles that are used to make a computer work.  This is a great introduction to a lot of the basics but it's too bad that most of it isn't useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very interesting and educational. However, I think the author did not do a very good job at presenting it.  The first half is the first part of a longer book.  For me, this part was not very interesting.  It seemed to me that she was just writing about her experiences as a girl in the 1960's and 1970's.  After all, it is hard to imagine that the 1960s and 1970s had anything to do with the history of feminism.  I have read the first two parts of this book. I have to admit, I enjoyed reading it but I also felt that it should have been more of a "what's happening in the world today" type of book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been reading about how much I hate books that are supposed to be inspirational, and then one of those books is actually just so sad that I'm thinking, "Well, that's too bad. That's a sad book." I'm not sure what the point of these "self-help" books is. It's like they're writing about things they know they can't change or that they don't like to change. The book is basically the same over and over again: "If you can't get good at anything, you should learn how to do it!"   And "If everyone did that, it would be a lot more fun."   "People should do things they find difficult, and do them with joy." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the first book in this series, and was very excited about it. However, I found it hard to read.   The characters are very shallow.  They are all rich and successful people who have a lot of money.  The only characters who have any character are the two guys who talk about the girls at the bar and the girls who are in their group of friends.  I wish that they had more depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is not as interesting as I had hoped. His character does not seem to be developed at all and I found him to be extremely boring. This book does not give me the impression of a good book. It was not my favourite book, but not bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but I have been disappointed.    In the first few chapters the book jumps around so much it becomes confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good read to keep my mind off the depression and anxiety I have been going through lately.    Instead, I found a book that was boring, dull, and boring.  The story was interesting, but the ending was unsatisfying.  It was a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very hard to understand.  The first few chapters were very easy to follow and the descriptions were easy to understand but the descriptions in the next few chapters went off the rails.  I have to wonder if the authors actually wrote this book or if they were told to make it as easy to read as possible.  Also, it's hard to find an author that is willing to write in the third person about their own experiences and not in a condescending way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful.   I'm used to getting books that are good and not great.  It's not like this one was bad, but the quality just wasn't there.  This is not a bad novel per se, but I expected a little more from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure if this book is a bad or a good book. The premise is very interesting and has the potential to be very entertaining. However, the book is very confusing and I was left with a lot of questions. The book starts off by introducing the main characters, the main conflict, and the end result, but the author never really explains how these things work. The characters don't seem to care about what they are doing. There is little sense of purpose. It's clear the main character is being used as a tool to advance the plot. The main conflict is a very vague concept that is not well developed. The whole thing seems very amateurish and I'm glad it's over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mother always had a book she wanted me to read. This book was the one.   It was a wonderful book about a little girl's journey from a "normal" home to a life with two boys.  The boy is very well-behaved and is very much a good role model.  His behavior is the result of a very poor upbringing, but he does seem to be a happy person now.  He is not "normal", but he has overcome some problems and I believe he will be a good person.  I liked that he was the only child in the family who didn't get picked on, or have to be "taught" anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found a good book by this writer, but the writing style is horrible. It is so boring that I stopped reading it after the second page.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's very frustrating, and I have to agree with others who have said the same thing about this book: that it is completely predictable. I can't believe that it was actually published.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of this book by my friend, who used to be a professor of mine, and he loved it.  The book is well-written, well-researched, and well-supported.  This is a great book for students, especially those who are going through a divorce.  I'm not sure that it would be a good book for the average person.  It would be better if it was written in a more accessible, non-academic style, but I think it still offers a lot of value to anyone who is going through any sort of divorce or family separation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this but couldn't do it.    The main character is really annoying.  The plot is not compelling and it really doesn't need to be.  I'm sure I could get a good read out of it, but not on my own. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in the style of a popular popular novel, the kind that can be found in any public library. However, the plot is weak and it is difficult to follow along. It is an interesting story, but it does not deserve a rating higher than a two or three stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished the first book of this series and was very disappointed. The story is very good but it is just not very original or fun. I don't think there is anything about it that will stick with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for this book for years and finally found it in a used book store on a good day.   It was great as I am a HUGE fan of the book series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to pass the time at work. I did not enjoy it one bit. The characters are weak and they are presented as having no sense of personal dignity or respect. The narrator is condescending and makes no effort to learn the background or motivations of his characters. I can't imagine how he would have done in a real life interview setting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As soon as I finished reading this book, I realized that I had bought a poor book from a poor author. It had poor writing, poor writing that was worse than that of the book's main character, and poor writing about other aspects of the world that was all in the past.   It was almost like a poorly written sequel to another book, where the main character was still in the same place but had grown old and forgotten things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the "Tales from the Crypt" books by Richard Matheson several times over the years, but this is my least favorite. It's like reading a story about a guy who had a dream about the Queen of England. It seems like all he wants to do is get a picture of her. That's not the Queen's style. The book is about the man's attempts to create a time machine. The story isn't bad, but it just seems out of place in this genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The premise of this book was a little far-fetched, but I read it anyway because I liked the concept.  It was a good read though.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed with this book.   The author claims she grew up in a "cult-like" environment where "spiritual values" were instilled in her.  The truth is she never even heard of a cult.  She never went to a formal "cult" meeting but did meet a few women who did.  These women were highly educated.  They also taught her that women must be in charge and that it is the women's responsibility to care for the children.  When I met them, they were both quite attractive and very intelligent.  That was the problem.  I found it very frustrating that she would make up stories about the women and not mention that she was also there and didn't have a problem with the women.  There is no mention of these women in any other book I have read about the group.  It also seems that she is not very knowledgeable about the subject matter she is writing about.  In the book she describes a man being told he could have a lot more sex if he didn't like having it.  Her description is that a woman was sitting next to him and said, "You're really a little weird.  You should be happy having your dick in the hands of a woman."  I would have said the same thing about that man.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read so many horror novels about vampires, that I've almost become one. This book, however, is so weak that it doesn't really stand out from the others.  It's like reading a horror novel in which all the vampires are evil, and all the humans are good, but you don't get to learn any of that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never had a good read from this author. Her book is about a child psychologist who is a bad therapist. It is also about a girl who goes missing and ends up finding a missing girl. This book was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is completely ridiculous, but I'll give it to this book because it's about a real-life historical event:  My father, the last living member of the original crew of the Apollo 13, has died.   He was the second man to walk on the moon.  I think this book is meant to be a tribute to the real heroes of the moon landings.  It's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a woman who decides to have an abortion and ends up having a child that she doesn't want. It's a fairly typical story about a child whose parents don't love him. But the way it is told is very disturbing. This is not a good book for anyone to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that's better in print.  I used to be a huge fan of George R.R. Martin but  now  I'm not so sure  He's too easy on the female characters.  This book is just bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really enjoy this book. It was just a really bad book. I know that there's a lot of stuff in this book that's true, but the things that didn't work for me were just too much to take. It's like the narrator had no idea what she was talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to use as a reference for my graduate-level computer science classes.   The author's use of metaphors (and the occasional wordplay) to explain concepts is fascinating, but I found myself struggling to keep up with the "technical" language.  I don't really know the first thing about networking, but the author seemed to be using the concepts as if they were common knowledge.  As for the concepts, they seem to me to be pretty basic, and as such are probably applicable to almost any technical problem.  Perhaps the best part of the book, however, is the illustrations.  They show exactly what is being discussed, but also make it look very cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a boy's experience with a bully at school. He goes to the principal's office to tell him what happened, and he's told to get lost. He can't remember his name or any details of what happened.   The author doesn't make any attempt to provide information about what happened in the story, and doesn't provide the bully's name.  I think the book is a good one if you don't care much about bullying or you don 't know any bullies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard that a good book doesn't need to be written, that you can just get it from a book.  Unfortunately this isn't true, because a good read isn't just about the writing.  There's an awful lot more to the story than just that.  The world building is superb.  If you've read a fantasy or sci-fi book, it will be very similar.  But this is a story that is totally original.  It's a story about a man who is fighting the darkness in his mind, a story of the nature of reality, of how the mind can be manipulated by something as simple as fear.  And it's a really well written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read by an author I'm not a big fan of.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character in this book is the perfect example of what happens when you're forced to take on a new hobby.  The guy just started collecting stamps, and I'm sure he's gonna be a real hoot when he finally gets to use his collection.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a bit hard to understand as to how the author comes up with his concepts.   His ideas are so original and original concepts are rare.  I found it hard to follow the logic of his ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a poorly written, poorly researched book that attempts to answer all the questions about the Great Depression by presenting some of the arguments from people who were involved in the business. The book does a great job of answering questions about banks, savings and loans, loans and mortgages, and business cycles. However, the book fails to address the question of whether the Great Recession was caused by a banking crisis or whether it was caused in part by other causes. I don't think the answer is simple. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book at all. The whole thing is just bad. The author is really out of his mind. The writing is just plain bad. He's clearly trying to make a name for himself. But he just can't write well. It's just so badly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just found this book by Mark Bittman while browsing a used book store. It was a good buy, but I was hoping to find a better book by this author. This one is pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to read this book.    It was a good book. but the story line wasn't good at all  .   The story line is about a boy named Billy,   who lives in a house made of bricks.       He is the only boy in the world who has never been to the moon.  It is said that there are some people who have never been   to the sun,  to hell or to heaven.  But this boy never heard about any of that   because he is only 5 years old.  He thinks that all of this is so cool   but he doesn't know about   any of the things he is supposed to know   until he goes to the Moon  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really enjoy this book. I felt the characters were rather shallow and the story, as it did start out, seemed rather contrived.  The first half is fairly standard fare.  It's a story about a guy who was hit on by a beautiful woman at a party.  He tries to get her to come back to his house, but she rejects him.  After that, things start to go downhill.  One of the main characters is a very unsympathetic and annoying character who is constantly trying to be the hero.  She keeps trying to push him to a romantic relationship and the guy has to constantly put up with her.  Then, when she finally makes a move and tries to sleep with him, he rejects her.   It seems as if she never gave a second thought to the fact that she would never ever get anywhere near him.    The other main character is a girl who goes out of her way to make people feel guilty about their failures.   It seems she's only there to get some attention and that she is trying to take advantage of everyone's naivety.  When she's finally caught, it's clear she has no idea how to deal with people and is trying too hard to be liked.  I don't think I would want to be friends with someone who constantly tries to be loved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a lot of fun reading this book. It has some of the best characters I've read in a while. The main character is great. His personality and attitude are great. I really hope I can get ahold of his book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for a good book about the history of computer technology but didn't find it.   It is a good read though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book that you will enjoy.  I am not sure why, but it seems to have been written for the 'adult' crowd.    It has a very heavy focus on sex, which I know I enjoy, but I found myself feeling quite tired and drained by the end of the book.  It is very hard to get into the story, but once you do you realize that this is no ordinary story.  The author does a good job of keeping the sex interesting and interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's use of the phrase "I feel like an idiot for buying it" is hilarious.  There is no way in the world that I could buy such a book for under $20.  I don't know who made this book, but whoever did, he/she is a genius.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and found it completely uninspiring. It's hard to put into words how disappointing this book is. It took me two whole days to finish it. I know this is a short story collection and not a novel, but I was left feeling like a book that's trying too hard. I'll just say that I didn't like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't stand books that do not provide information about the topic of the book.  In this book, the author fails to give the reader the information needed to read the book on her own.  I have a lot of respect for the authors of books about science.  However, a book on science should be a complete and accurate account of the subject.  This book is a complete mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so hoping this would be a great book about a woman who was a good Christian, but in my reading it has only been about her having to do with men, not the women in her life.  This is so common in so many stories of women being good Christians but never being called to lead, but that's what I thought I would learn in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a 4 star review because I loved the story but hated the author's lack of respect for the reader.  The first half of the book was amazing!  The last half is just tedious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I am on a quest to find a good book that can do for me what the first book did for me. It's not as good as that one, but it's very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know how I can rate this book lower than one star, especially since I'm a professional who enjoys reading about history, but it was so poorly researched and written that I couldn't finish it. It's an excellent book on World War II in the Pacific but the author's sloppy research was so bad that she simply made it up as she went along, sometimes quoting people that had never been interviewed about what they said about what had happened. The author also seemed to have forgotten about the U.S. bombing of Okinawa and the American invasion of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima and the thousands of American and Japanese civilians killed or wounded.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad, bad book.  It has some good ideas, but is badly written, and lacks in detail and plot.   The idea of a society where the poor have a place in the community is good, but the book fails to follow through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most embarrassing I have ever read.  The writing is atrocious and there is no plot or character development.  It's all about the author's own sexual exploits and she clearly doesn't understand why people like to write about themselves.  She is also really, really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book many times before and never really enjoyed it. The first time I read it, I was quite disappointed, and the second time I didn't care for it much either. It was a great idea that got old really fast, though, so it's a good way to start a new series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a piece of trash.   It is the same crap over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can not recommend this book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I thought it was a great deal. I liked the cover, and the story is good. However, I'm very disappointed with this book. I thought the author did a great job explaining the history of how the "fad" started. She gave a very interesting history about the first use of the term "fat girl" and her struggles in the community. However I was disappointed that she never went into detail about the history or why it became a negative term. I am glad I bought the book, but I was hoping for more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character, who is supposed to be a former war hero, is very one-dimensional, as a character.   He never learns any new skills or even uses the things he learns to accomplish his goals.  He is just an all-around jerk.  The writing style is also pretty much the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had the misfortune of reading this book when I was a kid, and the reviews I read back then were pretty accurate.  This is the second book in the "The Dangers of the Black Art" series by the late Philip Zimbardo, and I found the writing style to be pretty lame.  It's basically a mix between a high school newspaper and a gossip magazine, and Zimbard's writing style is very dull.  The best way to describe the writing is "boring."  I found Zimbarde's "The Psychology of Control" to be more interesting.  In that book, Zimbord gives a pretty good overview of the way people "control" themselves in relationships.  Zimbardon explains how people manipulate others in order to get what they want, or what they fear will hurt them, or even what they themselves want.  I liked that, but it's just a little too simple.  One thing that stuck out to me is how the authors of the "Black Art" seem to use all of the techniques described by Zimbardi, even when it seems counterproductive.  For example, in his book "The Game" Zimbaud describes the idea of using an "accidental" kiss as an "exploit," but he explains how that same kiss can actually be used to your advantage.  However, the more you think about it, the less appealing that sounds.  What if you're with someone you like, and you have a chance to kiss them, but they don't like it?  What then?  It seems to me that Zimbarded would say you should use this as an advantage.   I also found the description of the various techniques to be a little confusing.  A few times I just couldn't understand how Zimbardy was describing the same thing, but the more I thought about it the more it made sense.  Sometimes he would say it as if it were some sort of "magic," but other times he would use a metaphor that was a little more clear.    Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment, but maybe if I had been in high school I would have found it a little funny.  If I had read this when I had just started my freshman year of high school, I might have enjoyed it a bit more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to stop reading this book. It's so poorly written and constructed that it makes me think the author is just having a bad day and has no idea how to write a story.   It's like he didn't even bother writing the beginning of the book.  There's no real reason to believe that it is going to be anything but a boring and predictable romance.  The characters are just a collection of clichés that don't even get the chance to grow or develop before the author decides to make them into complete idiots.  I know it's not a very original idea for a romance, but it just seems like he hasn't tried to write any other type of story before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book a year ago. I was really looking forward to it, but I am so disappointed. This book was just an awful waste of time. It took a long time to find the right book on what to read, and then it took a few hours more to read it. It is so bad that you can't even get past the first few pages to the end of the book. I can't believe that someone can make a decent book out of such a terrible one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first reaction to the title: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I read this book was because my friend's daughter was reading it. I wanted to help her understand that being a woman can be a good thing. I guess that's a bit of a stretch, but it's an interesting view.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book. It's full of lies and misinformation and is riddled with errors, especially the claims about the American Revolution, as the first US president who had a slave as a wife. The main problem with the book is that the author was so full of his own biases that he was unable to understand that history is written by the victors, and that there are no real victors in the Revolutionary War, but only the people who fought against the British, the ones who lost their homes and their loved ones to the British armies, and the ones with no real hope of ever having a home again. As an American I can't believe that this is how the Revolution was supposed to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't think it's necessary to explain this one. This is a classic of the genre, but it's not a very good one. The characters are flat, the plot is dull, the writing is sloppy, and the ending is predictable. The author seems to have had a lot of fun making this book, but not so much fun that she's managed to make it anything more than a boring waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got a good review for this book. However, it is just a bad story, and not a good one at that.   I understand the story line.  This was my first experience with it, and I've seen many other bad books, but I still don't understand how people could have a good reaction to it.  It's just a terrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because of the publicity about the movie. I thought it was terrible, but the book is terrible too.  The main character, a "woman of the world", spends the whole book thinking that he is a woman of the year.  I felt sorry for him, but that didn't make it any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found a good book on my last trip to the beach.   The author is very knowledgeable and is able to make the book fun to read.  The book is written in a casual tone that keeps the reader engaged.  It is fun to think about the possibilities for a trip to a beach and how different each beach is.  I do not think I will make it there next year but this book will be a good addition to my book shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to use as a reference in my first grader's math class. It was fun to read and has some nice pictures and interesting math concepts. Unfortunately, the book is not up to the job. There is a good deal of math that I couldn't follow at first, and the text is a little hard to read. I hope to get a better grade in my class, but I wouldn't buy this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in a style that sounds as if it was lifted from a college philosophy textbook. As a philosopher, I thought it was interesting that he would make a similar case that there is no such thing as absolute truth or knowledge. He does make the point that it is not possible to prove a negative and it is possible to argue that someone is a complete idiot or a complete moron for believing things like that. This is very interesting to me as I believe in "scientific" skepticism. As long as we can make sense of things by using scientific methods, then I don't think we should be so arrogant as to believe that we know for sure what is true and what is false.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book very much, but I guess that's the point.  It's basically a collection of a lot of the bad science in popular books about dinosaurs.    This was published in 1987.  I've heard of some bad books, but never anything so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to put down the first time I read this.   The story is interesting and the illustrations are well done.  The prose is not always clear.  There are several things that are not explained clearly enough to me.  I am sure there are things I am not understanding.  But I do not like reading things that were written before I was born. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible piece of trash.   It's not bad in the way that a bad movie is bad, but it's bad in a completely different way:  It doesn't have any plot, or character development, or depth, or even good writing.  It reads like a very long story told from a very limited point of view.  The only interesting thing about it is that you can see how the authors tried to make a story about a man who goes to prison in a future with a lot of drugs but no prisons:  One way the story goes is that he's trying to escape from a drug dealer, but he can't because he's caught up in the system that's keeping him in prison.  Then he has to get back to the future he wants to escape to.  But that's not interesting, it's just a list of problems:  You can't escape, you have to stay and be locked up, and you're trapped.  So, you're locked up forever.  Oh, and then the other guy from the future turns out to be a drug addict.  Why didn't they just do that in the first place?  Why are they trying to make it more complex and interesting?  That's what a lot people write in this genre:  They put in problems to make the characters seem more realistic.  They don't give a damn about the characters.  This isn't even a story that makes sense.  Even the ending is an excuse to go back to another part of the book and make it even more boring.  I know it's supposed to be science fiction, but there's no logic to it at all.  There's a lot wrong with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but I really hate how the story is written. There's a lot of self-importance in this book and it's pretty clear that the author has never had to deal with depression or other mental health issues. It's also pretty clear she's a total snob. I don't mind people's opinions but when you're writing about how you have to take care of yourself because of depression or anxiety, you're clearly not taking care of others. The story itself is pretty dull too. There are a lot more pages than there are interesting things to happen. I'm not even going to talk about the plot holes or the way it ends. This book just didn't do anything for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so intrigued by this book I purchased it right away.    However   it turns out to be one of those "oh, the horror" books.  It is really just a "who can you trust" book with a few twists.  The main character is not well-rounded and his wife is not likable.  There are also two other main characters who seem to be the main characters.  This is also the first book I have read that does not have a positive message.  I'm not sure what to do about this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this as part of a "How to be a Bookworm" book, and it's pretty bad. It is very difficult to read, with no flow at all. The first few chapters are very slow, and even though it was a very long book, it only made sense when you got to the end, which took forever to do. It just made you want to read something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poorly written book. This is the third time I've tried to read this book.  I've read it in multiple editions and have never had a good experience with it.  First time was with a paperback, second was a hardcover.  The last time I read this was on a Kindle.  It's not a book I'll be returning to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending is horrible.  This book is all about the struggle to have a child, and the woman in this book (the mother) was having all sorts of problems.  She had a difficult birth, was not used to being pregnant, and had a terrible cold during the pregnancy.  I can't imagine having to deal with all of that.  The child was born prematurely and was born with severe health issues.  They were very sick.    After that she had another miscarriage, then another.  It was obvious the pregnancy was failing.  By this time she was on all sorts the medications to try and prevent another miscarriage.  Finally she gave up trying to have another baby and decided to go on her own.  If you think about it, it's almost as if the writer is saying the child should not have been born, but then she decided she was having it anyway.  There are some very difficult decisions to be made, and I'm sorry that the author felt she had to go down that road. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read.  It is about a man who has a crush on a boy, but he doesn't act on it.  The book is not written well, there are some very bad things that happen to the characters, and the story is not as interesting as the book would have you believe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a kind of last hurrah. I didn't care for the first book, and found it too repetitive. I wanted something new in the third book.   This one was fine, but didn't stand out in any way, especially as a stand-alone novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about 5 years ago and never got around to finishing it.   The book is very poorly written and full of typos.  The author's grammar and writing style is very amateurish and sloppy.  I would never recommend this book for anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I have not read it, so I don't know if it is a bad, good, or otherwise.    If you are in the mood for a bad science book, give it a shot.  If not, it might be a good idea to wait until the next edition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a very poor excuse for a horror story.   It was as though the author had forgotten that he had just written a book about the supernatural.  It didn't feel supernatural at all; it felt   typical, and it was just that: a typical book.  The writing was bad, the characters were boring and I didn't care about any of them.  I don't recommend this book at all, but if you really want to learn more about the occult and the occultists you should try to find a book written by a real occultist like Robert Anton Wilson or Jack Parsons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.  I had high hopes for it.  This book, with its dark humor and strong female characters, is perfect.   I found it to be a fairly well written book.   The characters were not as strong as I would have liked, but that's probably because the author had no experience with the subject.  There was one character in particular that really annoyed me:  The woman who had a daughter.  The story about her daughter is what really drove me up the wall.  It's like a book that I don't want to read.  That woman is the worst mother I've ever seen.  She can't seem to understand that she can't keep her daughter out of trouble, she can never seem to control her child, and she is unable to get her daughter to take her job seriously.  Why couldn't she just put her child in an orphanage?  Her daughter is being raised in a filthy old home by a drunk father and a drug addicted mother.  No wonder her daughter didn't want her to be there.  In my opinion, that woman is a horrible mother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this is the worst book I've ever read.   It has the same problems that have plagued many of the recent YA novels that have come out.  It's the same type of story that's been done many times before, but it's still an embarrassment for the YA genre.  If it had been a couple years ago I would have bought it as a YA title, but now, the fact that it's a book with a female lead, the only other female lead that I can think of, and the protagonist being the protagonist makes me think that this book might have been better off as a teen rom-com. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I tried reading this book, I really didn't like it. The characters were boring and uninteresting. I'm not sure why this book is so popular. It was too much information for me to absorb.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very boring and boring I didn't understand why it's so bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the second time I have purchased a copy of this book.    It was so hard to get into.  It is a very difficult read for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book hoping to read a good fantasy/science fiction book that would inspire me to read more. Unfortunately, I found myself reading this book over and over again, because it is the perfect book to inspire me. It is a fantasy, but it is also a science fiction book. The author manages to combine the two genres perfectly, and this book was very interesting. The world building is so good that it makes me want to go out and explore this world, because I do not know what it is like outside of the "mainstream".  I am currently reading about the creation of the universe, and I am very excited about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a great book. It was informative about the ancient world and some of the most interesting historical information about the Romans. However, the Roman characters in the book were so lame that I was disappointed to learn about them at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book about a good girl.  The book's heroine is an abused, lonely young girl. She's in therapy, but still can't be herself.  In my mind, she is also abused, as her father is.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read most of the books in this series (they all started out as short stories) but this is the worst one. I am really disappointed that a good story was ruined with a stupid plot device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished a book by a guy who never reads a book. I'm not saying he's a bad author, but there was no enjoyment from this book at all. The only thing that kept me from throwing it out was that it had a pretty good ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of time, not only to read, but to pay attention to. It was about a little boy that lived in a house in a middle class neighborhood.  It was a sad book because it told the sad story of the boy's father and how he was abused by his mother.  I was surprised that the book was not called 'How a poor black boy came to live in a wealthy white neighborhood.' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book quite annoying. The story is about a guy who was at his worst while he was trying to get over a crush that he had for a girl in high school. The guy didn't know what to do with himself. He was depressed and suicidal and just wanted to get away from her. He did get the girl's phone number but she wouldn't respond. The book ended with the guy realizing he has feelings for the girl and how that turned him around. I guess the author thought the guy would never come to his senses and stop doing stupid things.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is great for a very limited time only.  I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series but have been disappointed with many of the adaptations (especially the films).  This book is perfect for a quick read that does not require a lot of reading skills to understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most unreadable books I have ever read. There is so much wrong with it I could never finish it. This is not a book for the intelligent person, and that is a pity because the author is clearly a good writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very good introduction to the theory of evolutionary biology. Unfortunately, it is riddled with errors and poor analysis, especially of evolution by natural selection. The book contains a lot of good information, but there are a number of glaring errors. I was hoping for more from this author, but as a result I am now looking forward to reading more about evolution in biology textbooks.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book.  It's not bad writing or bad plot, but it is very slow paced and boring.  This book is about the adventures of a boy who grows up to be a very wise man, but can't remember his life as a kid.  The book ends on a very bad note and I don't know why the author wrote this book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book in the mail a few weeks ago. It's about an atheist who attends church but doesn't have a religious affiliation, and who ends up in a terrible situation where he is attacked by religious zealots who believe in reincarnation. I don't care that it's a book. This book makes me feel ill. I'm so glad that I got rid of it, and that I don' t have to deal with people like this in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so boring, and there is so little of anything to it.   I don't like reading boring books.  The only thing that's interesting about it is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just plain awful.  I had been a fan of the author's work for a long time, and this was the first time I'd read anything by him.  It's a good story, but I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a bit of a disappointment. It was a lot of fun when I read it, but it is rather predictable and the writing style is cliched and very repetitive.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad little book that does nothing but tell you that you are wrong about everything you have ever read.   I was wrong about many things about the Bible but now I know that the Bible is not the literal, word for word book that the book claims to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible. It's so bad, in fact, that it's funny. There's one paragraph in the middle of the book that is supposed to be a "plot point" that's so badly written that I was actually laughing out loud at it. The plot point is that the characters are going to have a bad time at a bad party: They're going to be drunk, and there's a fight. I can't even imagine what would have happened if they didn't get into a fight (though I would have been in the wrong). The characters are such garbage that it is hard to take any of it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book is that it's a history of the French Revolution.   This is a very detailed book, which takes the reader through a number of key events that led up to the revolution.  It's clear that the author has a good understanding of the revolution and the events surrounding it, and has done a good job in presenting this material.  I was impressed by the fact that the book covers the entire period from the beginning to the end of the Revolution (and some time during the first decade after the Revolution).  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a well-researched, accurate account of the events of the last century.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a really bad book. I thought I was being funny, but I wasn't. I don't even want to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.   The first time I read it, I felt like I was reading the worst fan fiction I've ever read.  This was after the first three chapters.  If you haven't read a fanfic or a bad fantasy novel, you will be sick of it after the third chapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a little disappointed that I didn't get a good book out of this one. I'm not sure what the author was thinking when he chose to make a story about a man who's only aim in life is to steal things from other people about a theme that doesn't really apply to him.  The story itself is interesting but the ending is the biggest let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that the author makes the point that one of the reasons why I don't like fantasy is that it is full of cliches.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is so incredibly annoying that you'll want to kill him at the end of every book.  He doesn't have any character development, he's just a complete asshole.  The story is so poor, you don't even care if the main character dies or not.  I didn't give a single thought to the main guy's personality until he got the girl.  There is so much more to say about the story but there is no way in hell that I can find it in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a fan of the book but the author has a way of making his characters stupid and annoying without actually being stupid and/or annoying. I was very entertained and enjoyed the book, but it's a bit too long for me to enjoy it all the way through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not enjoyable at all.   It was a book that did not seem to understand that the way a character is described doesn't necessarily have to match what is said about them in the text.  This is one of those books that has been written by someone who knows nothing about writing.  I found myself wishing that the author had simply ignored the first half of the book and simply described the characters and what they do.  Instead, she spent the whole book describing the actions of the first person narrator.  The story has been described so many times that it is hard to know what to do with it.  If you are looking for something interesting to read that does not seem too out there or too far from the norm, you might enjoy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't recommend this book.   This is a poorly written book that could have been a good one.  There is no real story here other than the plot, the author's desire to sell a book he has written, and the author being an unprofessional hack.  If you are looking for a good, suspenseful read then this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, as a whole, is terrible. The story has all the elements of a bad sci-fi story. It has an overly complicated plot. It is too complicated to understand. The characters are so over the top that they don't make sense. The author's explanations are a total joke. The whole book is about the characters and the story, which is just... well, the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is so thin.   I am not a fan of these type of books at all, but this is not what I expected from the author.  He tries to tell a good story about a good man and it just does not work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of time and money.   It was all about how I had to go and get an STD test before I could have sex, which was a complete lie.  They told me to go to my doctor and he would check for STDs and tell me if I had any.  I thought this was all very clever but I still had to pay for it all.  My only other complaint is that he never told me what the results would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book twice now.  I think that the second time around I was just trying to get the story to move along.  The first time I was thinking to myself, "Is this a movie or a book?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of all of John Green's books, but this one is just too damn long.    The first half is fine, but it's over before it really gets started. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that I have been looking for.  I have tried many other "how to" books.  This book covers most of the essential concepts.  It also covers some of the less obvious concepts that are often overlooked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was given a copy of this book as a Christmas gift. I read it in a couple days but didn't finish it because I couldn't figure out how to put it down. I was so angry that the author wasn't willing to admit that she was wrong that I just threw it away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible. It is very bad and if you are a woman it is very likely that you know someone who has read it.    It has a story line that is so bad that it makes me cringe every time I think about it. The plot is really bad, the characters are not that likable, the setting is bad, it is full of sex, drugs and violence, the main character is a complete bitch and you should be ashamed of yourself for buying this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a compilation of articles on the subject.  It's a lot of reading, but the authors all use the same old lame arguments about why they think the current system is a bad one.  I am very disappointed that there is a "New American History" edition that includes a "sneaky" (read: false) statement that the American Revolution was "a democratic revolution."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. The first half of the book is interesting. There are lots of good observations about human nature, as well as about the ways in which technology can make us more rational than we should be. But then the authors move into a discussion about human morality and how people treat one another. I'm a moral relativist, and this book is a lot more interesting if you agree with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting book but it lacks in depth. The author has done a very good job of introducing the reader to the history of the American South, but I was unable to find anything to make me interested in the author's history.  It is quite clear that the author knows very little about the American Civil War and that he uses the book primarily to tell a good story.  The author does not attempt to present an objective account of the war.  He presents the conflict as a struggle between two sides, a battle between slavery and freedom, which will one day be over.  In addition, the author has not a clue about the political and cultural implications of his thesis, or why it is important.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a child. I know that this is a common trope in books about children, but the book is a complete waste of time and space. I'm reading a children's book about a boy who can talk to his dead grandfather, but is still haunted by the fact that he's never really been allowed to do anything with his grandfather. It's an interesting premise for a book, but as far as I'm concerned the story is going nowhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book to use in a science project but never got around to it. The writing style is very hard to read. I'm a fan of science fiction but I find it very difficult to read the kinds of books that are published in science fiction and fantasy magazines.  I'd rather read a book that is actually worth reading instead of the garbage that comes out of those magazines.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of half-truths and outright lies. The author claims that "the U.S. had a record 5,000 documented cases of rape during the 1980's" when in fact the number is closer to a few hundred. The book says that "The U.N. estimates that one-half of all women and girls in the world have been victims of sexual abuse. And a large number of the victims are in the developing world." This is false as the U. N. says that one in five women and one in seven men are victims of rape.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to use in my science class to teach people about how the brain works.   The book starts out with a lot of hype about how complex and important the brain is, and that people who are not familiar with the brain have problems.  I found this to be totally misleading and I found that I couldn't use this book.  My teacher had me do some exercises in the brain in order to make a point about how a brain does not store memories but rather that the brain stores associations.  This is a very important concept to know, but the book just doesn't explain it in a way that makes it clear to the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really want to read this book at first, but once I did, I didn' t enjoy it at all. I was hoping that it would have some good things about it, but it's just a waste of space.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book very much.   It's a story about a woman's quest to get a book about the history of a town she has lived in since childhood, but never seen, published.  This is a book written by a former city manager of the town, who had the town's history in his head as a young boy, but was never able to get the town to pay him to write a book.  The only thing the town seems to have to offer in return is a good old fashioned good time.  It is not hard to see why a woman would want to get this book published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has one great line, and that's the line about how some people "love the sound of their own voices" and don't "get the big picture" that others "get."  It's an interesting idea that many people are unaware of, but it is hard to believe that anyone who doesn't get that the only "voice" is the one you hear, is a "true" Christian.  This is one of those books that is good because it's a good book, but also has some problems that don't add up to the book being worth the cost.  The most glaring of these problems is the way that Paul's view of the afterlife is used.   Paul claims that those who are "saved" will be able to go to heaven (1 Cor. 15:21-22).  He claims that "Christ has purchased for us the inheritance in heaven" (1 Tim. 2:5).  Yet Paul claims to know that there will be no resurrection of the dead (2 Cor. 5:3).   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part about this book is that it is not about the "spiritual" aspects of the Book of Mormon.   As I read the first few chapters, I started wondering if the author had simply stumbled upon the story about Lehi's family after reading some of the stories in other books.  That would explain a lot.  The whole book is based on one "spiritually inspired" event:  The story of Lehi and his family, who are "carried away" by the Lamanites to a land they call the New World.  It's interesting how much of the book is about the book itself:  What happens when one's faith is tested?   What did Lehi actually do to make the Lamechans so angry at him?  What is the relationship between Lehi, the Lama and the Nephites?  The most interesting part is the section about Leavitt's family:  Leavit's family seems like a good example of a "cult."  The idea that people would follow a "great man" is something that is hard to imagine, but that is what the Book is about.  This is a great example of what Joseph Smith is talking about in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and omissions. I found this book to be a good read, but I couldn't believe that so many of the people interviewed in it didn't live up to their reputations.  I guess that's just the way the world is these days.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like the stories that this book presents. The characters are interesting and interesting to read about. I found myself looking forward to the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is so ridiculous that I just laughed out loud. The premise of this book is that people get sucked into a fantasy world where they are told to dress in the clothes that they like to wear, and then they get to live out their fantasy. This is exactly like being told to wear a particular outfit at a specific event, then having to actually wear the clothes. What makes it even worse is that the people in the book never actually go to the event they are supposed to go to. It's like a one-night stand that is only supposed to last a few hours. This book is so wrong and silly that it's a real waste of time to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because it is a book about people who work in fast food restaurants. I found the book to be very disappointing. The author does not take into account the personal experience of the person working in the restaurant. Instead, she makes a series of assumptions about their character based on a very small sample size of two. This book is the opposite of a good job interview. The interview should be based on the person's performance, the culture of the company, and the level of pay that is being offered.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to read this before I could decide whether or not to read the other two books in the series. I read it in a day.  I didn't really enjoy it.  My main gripe was the author's over-the-top depiction of a fictional universe.   I can't imagine why anyone would read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a review that stated "the book has some really great ideas, but I have to admit that the writing is not very good." I was shocked to find out that this reviewer had read a second or third book by the same author before reviewing this one. I've read a lot of books that I thought were very good, but were really not.   The reason for the bad writing is that the book was written by an author who is really bad at writing.  I found myself wanting to throw my copy of the book across the room in disgust at the poor quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character of this book is a dumber version of Sherlock Holmes.  He doesn't think about the consequences of his actions.  I was surprised that he was able to get away with killing a man for two minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of false ideas and has many holes in it. The author claims to have "solved" a number of problems with the current generation of cell phones but doesn't actually do it. He's just a poor salesman and it shows. The book has a very poor author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not care for this book.  It was very poorly written and poorly paced.   The plot was so poorly written that it did not feel like a real story.  I can't imagine what it was like for the author to sit down and write a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so badly written that I thought it would be a quick read. The writing is awful. It is a complete mess and a major fail. The characters have no personalities. The plot is a joke. This book should have never been published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, but I can't give it four stars.   The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that the last chapter was completely unnecessary, and it ended abruptly.  There's a lot of great information in this book and it's well worth a read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is the story of a young girl who takes a lot of drugs in high school to make herself feel better about being a fat, depressed, and awkward teen.   I am not a fan of drugs, and I am always a big fan of literature.  But  this is really a bad drug story.  The main characters is also pretty unrealistic.  If you are depressed, fat, awkward, and don't have a lot to do in highschool (I don't blame you, I was there too), then you probably don't need to take drugs to make yourself feel better.  Also, the book tries to tell the story from the main characters point of view.  It doesn't work at all.  And the drug use is pretty silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a huge fan of both Buffy and Angel, I was very excited to get the first installment in the Firefly/Serenity crossover.   The book was ok but not great.  It was fun to read but I felt like I was reading a really long book at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just bad. The characters are awful. They were never believable and were nothing more than cardboard cut outs that were there only to give the author a chance to say "HOLY SHIT, SOMEONE DIE!" The only character that I actually liked was the guy who had the most fun with the characters. He was like a kid in a candy store.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I wanted to read a good story about a group of people in a small town who had the opportunity to learn a lot about each other in a short time. The story about the town meeting was fun, but I was expecting a lot more from the characters.  The author doesn't have a lot of story to work with.  I found it really hard to connect with the main characters. They didn't have enough personality.  Even though I thought it was a good book, I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that you can't put down once you start reading it.  It is a work of science fiction that attempts to answer the question of how we become evil, but ends up not answering it at all.  The story has many interesting ideas about the nature of evil.  However, as the story goes on, the answers that are given are unsatisfying.  In the end, I found myself wondering how it is that someone who is already evil can become evil in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disappointment. It was a very difficult read, and it is impossible to believe that this is the best work of non-fiction on the subject.  The book is full of mistakes and errors.  I don't know why they have put this out, but if you want to learn more about the history of the American Revolution, this is not the book to get. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. It was written in the early 1990s. This was the height of the alt-lit genre. It had all the elements of what a modern romance novel could be: suspense, tension, mystery. But it fell flat. The writing style is awkward and stilted. I was hoping it would be a good read, but I found it boring. I got to know the characters better, but it didn't feel real.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had no idea this book was going to be so bad.   It's not bad enough to make a bad story good, but just not good enough to redeem a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has the nerve to compare his book to the Lord of the Rings series (which is also a bad fantasy book) and then goes on to criticize Tolkien's book for being "too complex for the average reader." The idea that the reader has to be a Tolkien expert to understand the characters in his book is absurd. The characters in Lord of Rings are far more complex than the characters of the first book in the series, The Hobbit, and even the characters from the third book in this series are better developed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book hoping to find the same insight and wisdom that I found in "The Art of Fielding" but alas   it was nothing like that book   It's about a very young man who is a very good baseball player but he's also a very bad person   he thinks that all girls want is a guy with a lot of money   which is exactly what he has   but he thinks he's too good for them because he's "too good for"   so he's going to try to get them in bed   this is how he starts off in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it makes me wish I never took a class on it in college. I spent a great deal of time researching it, but I just couldn't get through it. The writing is so clumsy and clumsy that it's just not worth it. It's like reading a book that was written by someone who just had a bad day at the office.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is really interesting and well written. But, the second half, which was mostly just a bunch of weird names, weird places, and weird people, was a bit too much. It got a little tiresome.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is not great. There is a huge amount of filler and repetition in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to get this book, but I didn't really like it. I didn the author is very good at making a point, but her characters were dull. I was so tired of the same plot lines, and I couldn't get into the book until the last 20 pages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a bunch of "wicked" people who make poor choices because they were raised in a culture that encourages people to make bad choices. It is a pretty lame story but a fun one to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read in my spare time after I finished reading the other one. It's a good book. It has a lot of good ideas but, it's not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been very confusing and very hard to follow. I have been looking for something similar to my old favorite, "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" and "The Boy Who Lived" by the late Ray Bradbury. This book doesn't seem to fit in at all, and I have no idea where I should begin to get a sense of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a pretty bad book. This is the third or fourth time I've read this. The main thing that bothers me about this book is the fact that it takes so long for the characters to really develop. This book is just a lot of people talking about themselves, it's not a character study like most books on the topic are.  The author has to be writing about himself because he doesn't know anything about what he's talking about.  This book can only be about two people: the two main characters, the girl who wants to be a girl, and the girl that just wants to fit in.  She tries to be more like a boy, but her feminine characteristics don't go over well with the boys and the parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a young age, and found it to be very dull. I was too young to understand the plot, and the character development wasn't any better. I didn't enjoy the ending very much either. I wish that the author would write a book that had more character development and plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a good book about the Bible, but I was not happy with this one. It's too heavy on theology. It uses a lot of jargon and a lot is left out. If you want to know what the Bible really says about a particular issue, read a non-Biblical book about that topic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this book to anyone.    In fact, I don't even know if I can read this book anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not for everyone but it is a good read and worth your time to read it. I've read many of these books but this one is very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a poor choice of words for a book about the "end of the world" to be written by someone who has no personal experience of it at all. The last paragraph of the book is "I had a lot of trouble understanding how I could be so sure about my position on global warming in the midst of such a great uncertainty about the future"  It really does not say that global warming is a certainty.  He states that he thinks that it is likely that humans will cause the world to be a more dangerous place for humans to live in than it is now  I think that is a very strong statement about the likelihood of humans causing the world in general to become a more hostile place for human life than it currently is.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a long time reader of the John Galt series by John G. Robinson, and the new one by Michael Crichton is no different.   It is the same story, just told with a different plot.        It is a bit hard to understand at times.  The characters and plot do not seem to be connected very well.  For example, one character has a lot of money in his bank account, while another has no money at all.  What's wrong with that?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive thing about this book is that the authors were able to get a great group of young adult authors together to write about a very popular young adult book.  The worst part of this book are the plot twists that the author has to twist so many times before it comes out right.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like the characters in this book, you will like the next.   It seems that a group of people that live in a small, secluded area of California are being plagued by strange, demonic beings.  These beings are known as the   "Raptors" and they come to the house when they are unhappy.  Their behavior is not unlike those seen in movies like the ones about "the demons from hell"   The book is written by a woman who claims that the Raptors come to her house when she is angry, and the  "sucking sound" she hears when they approach is not just noise, but it is a message.  She believes that they come when she gets mad because she is "out of control".   I am so glad that I did not pick this book up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors.  For example, in chapter 2 the author says that the "pulchritude" of the early Greek world is what made it "tolerant" of other religions.  In fact, it was the Christian church that persecuted other religions, as well as the Roman empire.   In chapter 5 the author claims that a "futile quest" is for a "simple" way to find God.  He really means that a search for God is "futaile" (meaning "unfulfilled").   It is also quite funny that the author believes that "Jesus' disciples would have to make up for the shortcomings of their teacher."    This is why Jesus taught that we should take a census of all the peoples on earth (Matthew 19:16). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is one thing to read a good book, it is another to read one that you have already read and enjoyed.  It was just like a bunch of books you already own or are familiar with.  The only difference was that this one seemed more like a commercial than a real book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone but a serious student of history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of garbage. This book does not tell you about the science behind the food you eat, nor does it tell you what to eat or how to eat it. It tells you what it is that is good about a particular food and then says, "You might as well eat it too." It is very easy to do.  The information in the book is in the form of a diet book, and I would not read it if it were not for the fact that I am a vegetarian. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a couple days, and the book is a piece of crap.   The writing is cliched and bad.  In my opinion, if you want to be a good writer, you have to write like a bad writer.  The style is lame.  My favorite character is the bad guy.  I don't think I will buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just a horrible book about how bad the world is and how much worse it's going to get, which is pretty much all we can do about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book and can tell that the author is just plain lazy.  This book does not give the reader enough information to figure out what to do with her life.  I was expecting a much more realistic and less fluffy story, but all I got was an author's note saying that I was wrong and that she does have a realistic view of life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book.    It was the first book in a trilogy that promised so much but fell so short.  I'm sure I'll like the next book but I'll not be returning to this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that it's a good book.   If you don't read, you're going to have a bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a number of books about the early history of the United States and the Civil War. This book was good. It's a history of how the War Between the States was fought, how the South lost it, and how the North won. It was very interesting. The only problem is that there's no way to find out who wrote it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A terrible book that has to be used as a way to teach people how to do stupid stuff.    It is full of errors and is hard to follow.  I found this book to be very useful for a general understanding of how to use a computer and how to work with files. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book very hard to follow.   This book is about a boy who wants to be a hero, and who wants the world to think he's a hero.  I didn't know what to think.  This boy has a very strange sense of humour, but I don't get the feeling he's actually laughing at anyone.  He's just acting out in a weird way.  And he's doing all this to a very cute girl.  It's not really a funny book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read a lot of these, but had no idea how this one would be different. This is the first one I've had that has a realistic, believable ending. There's a scene where a woman with the mental disability, "mental retardation," is told by a doctor that she is not mentally retarded, but simply "different." The doctor then goes on to explain that if a woman has a child and the child has a different physical appearance, then the child's mother must be "mentally retarded" too.  I just read that one on Wikipedia, but it's the first thing that came to mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed that after reading so much about the history of feminism, I found this book lacking.  There were many interesting things in it (especially the history about women's liberation and the suffrage movement), but the historical inaccuracies and general bias of the author really bothered me.   I can only assume that the author has a bias, which would explain why she was unable to make an unbiased historical analysis of a feminist movement that is so successful.  I hope that the next time someone is trying to explain feminism, they find this book and point out how biased the author was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poorly written book, with a bad plot, and terrible characterization. It's the kind of book that makes me think that I am a terrible person because I didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know why it took me so long to read this book. The first sentence of the book is just plain wrong: "In the mid-1970s, a young African American man from Memphis, Tennessee, decided to go to Los Angeles, California, to find out what it was like for a black man to live in America." The author says that he went to California in the 1960s and that's where he learned about Los Angeles. But what he did not say is that he also learned about the Los Angeles Police Department. In his own book, "The City That Dares Not Sleep" (1964), Los Angeles is described as "the greatest police force in the country." The book also talks about the LAPD's "surgical, surgical, surgical operation." It does not mention that he was stopped, detained, arrested and jailed for nearly three days. (And it was his refusal to answer questions about his ethnicity that got him arrested in the first place.) He was only released after he agreed to give up a picture of himself and a piece of his luggage that he had taken along. He was eventually released on the condition that he could not go back to Los Angels (which he was about to do anyway). The author goes on to say that he did "an interview with a reporter" and that the reporter asked him what he thought of Los Angeles and if he thought it was "a good place." He answered that he thought that it was a good place. But I wonder why he didn't write that. It is a good question, but I am afraid that I cannot give a definitive answer. It probably was a writer's mistake and he will have to explain himself if he thinks that he can't have a conversation about Los Angles without mentioning that he lived there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book very much.   It's too much work to get a book like this done right, but there is just so much wrong with it.  This book should not be used as a teaching tool.  If it is used at all, it should be used to illustrate the problems that I had with the earlier books.  For example, in the first edition, the authors wrote that the first chapter was about the problems in getting a computer to recognize text that it did not recognize.  The second edition changed that to "It is the problem of writing good software".   The third edition makes it clear that the book is not about computers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book and was not disappointed, although it did not live up to the hype. The story is very well told.   It was a good surprise that the characters were all female (even the bad guys!)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book is the final chapter. The characters in this book are all great. There are also some great scenes in the middle of the book that will stick with you long after the last page has been turned. The ending of this novel is great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been following this book since the beginning. I've read a lot of paranormal, paranormal romance and I really wanted to like this book but it just wasn't for me. I'm just not a fan of romance in general and while I do like paranormal romance a lot (and I do believe this book is paranormal), this one just didn't work for me as much as I was hoping it would.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I've read this book so many times that I've forgotten how bad it is.   The plot, which I can only assume is meant to be a satire, is a complete joke.  I am no fan of satire, but this one is really not funny.  There is no way the author could be a satirist if he/she had even one of these points: 1.  It's totally false that people who don't believe in God cannot appreciate a good book about a man who is trying to prove the existence of God.  That would be like saying that someone who doesn't believe that God exists cannot appreciate an article about the "Great White Whale" because it doesn't contain any evidence that the Great White Whale exists.  (Yes, that would be a joke. The author has to know it's a joke.) 2.  The only reason God is good is because he can do things people can't.  If that were the case, then we wouldn't need God in the first place.  And the author doesn't say anything about the problem of evil in the world (or the fact that the only reason for the existence (or existence) of God is because people can do bad things). 3.  A good book should make people laugh, and I can't tell if this book did that.  You have to laugh at a bad joke to laugh with it.  4.  God is a really annoying character.  He is so self-righteous and judgmental that he never seems to realize that people aren't going to be happy being around him.  Also, his sense of humor is horrible. 5.  My favorite part of the book is the ending:  If God was so bad, he should have left people alone.  How he has gone on to destroy the earth, and to create the greatest evils in the history of the world, is beyond my comprehension.  Maybe God's real goal is to destroy all people (as he did in the Bible)? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is written by an author who clearly knows nothing about how to write a book.  As the author himself says, the book is not a good book. The book is a horrible attempt to make a book about the death of a child into a good one.  I don't see how he was so desperate to have it be good that he used a bad writing style to make it look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very disappointing that this book was so bad. It has been a long time since I read a book like this, but I still was able to finish it. I found it very hard to keep up with the plot and had a hard time following the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first part of this book, and I felt like it was an introduction to a different kind of magic.   It was all about tricks, but it was not magic that was the focus of the story; it was trickery.  This book is all about how magic can be used to fool people, but at the end of the day, it still doesn't mean that it's magic. It's just trickery that is more subtle than most tricks.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very good, but the story is just so flat. It's the kind of thing that could be explained by being told in different ways.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is a fraud and has a long history of writing crap.  The story she tries to pass off as her own is not only poorly written, but a farce.  I would not give it a positive review at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an example of the worst type of anti-gay bigotry. It was very anti-Christian and anti-Catholic. The author said that there was a secret gay cabal that controls the Catholic Church, the Illuminati, and the government. The conspiracy is centered in New York City and consists of a gay man who is in cahoots with the Freemasons and the Illuminati. He is the "Masonic Man."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a pretty good read. I got a copy for Christmas but my boyfriend didn't like it.  He said it was boring and made him feel bad for not liking it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me a good five hours to read this book.  The prose is very bad.  It's like he just sat down with a blank piece of paper and tried to write a good book.      It is a long book but I guess it was the only book I could find that could be so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author had the opportunity to write a well researched and well written book about the early history of science. Instead, he has chosen to write about one particular event, a few selected anecdotes about the people involved, and one general criticism of science and its practitioners.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about this book is that it is so short. The book was a bit long when I first bought it in 1994, but by 1995, I had read the entire book in less than a day. This is another one of those "If only it had been longer" books. It does not help that the author makes the whole thing up as she goes along.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be an over-dramatized version of a famous tale about a great hero.   This story was told to me in a book written by my great-great-grandfather in the late 1920s.  This book was very popular in the early 20th century.  I have heard of this book before but never read it.  Now that I have, I find it a sad and sad story.  It is sad that a great man was not able to achieve his dream. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book.  It is very dull.  The characters are just as dull as they are in any other bad book out there.  A terrible story that is just about bad people and bad situations.  I will never buy a book from this author again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book. It was not good. The author claims he has no bias, but he doesn't have any idea what he is talking about, and I don't think he has any interest in history either. He makes many historical errors. His argument about the Roman Empire is based on a lot of conjecture. I know this, because it has been refuted by many historians. The Romans did not invade Greece. The only reason the Romans were invading Greece was that the Greeks had refused to pay a tribute, the equivalent of about $40,000. The reason the Greeks were resisting the Romans was because they had been in the process of establishing a state for a long time. The Roman Empire was a collection of small states.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not worth the money, it is not a good book and it does not have any real depth or meaning.   It is a short book that is really not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a fan of this book. The author has a tendency to jump around in her story. In one chapter she tells the story of a very long night in the city where the group of women meet a man at a bar. When the woman goes home she finds her husband in bed with another woman.  The story ends with a description of a man she is in love with who doesn't know her.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book to read because of the positive reviews it was getting on Amazon.   This book is a disaster.  I would recommend against reading this book unless you have some time on your hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about reading the new edition of this classic, but my excitement was short lived.   The new edition is mostly correct, but the errors are so glaring I can't help but think the author is not a competent scholar.  This edition is supposed to be "the definitive edition," and it is certainly that.  I can hardly believe I've been reading this book so long and never noticed the glaring errors.  The text is well-written, but there are so many spelling and grammar errors it's hard to believe the author doesn't know how to spell.  And some of the historical facts are so obviously wrong they must have been added later.  If I'm ever in a situation like that, I'm going to start calling the publisher " The Great American Baking Company."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narrator of this book, who sounds like he's from the 1930's, is extremely dull. He does not have a clue what he's talking about. I'm sure he's very smart, but that doesn't mean he knows the history of the last half century or so.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with others who state that the book has some of the worst writing ever to be published in a children's book.   It is filled with spelling mistakes, poor grammar, and just plain bad writing.  I can understand the publisher trying to market the book as a fun, educational story, but  the actual text is so bad that I feel like I am reading a third-rate horror novel.  It is hard to explain to someone that the writing is so awful, and so poorly edited, that it makes me question the actual purpose of the book. It is as if the publisher just made the book, and did not even try to write a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really not a good read.   It is a good book for its time and I am glad it came out, but there are better things out there, at least in my opinion.  I guess the authors had to sell some copies to pay the printing costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of the author's own opinion and is not at all based on any real experience.  The first part of the book is an account of a few of her first attempts to find a good cook book, but she failed.  It is really just the author being a terrible cook and writing about her mistakes, but it is written in such a way as to make it seem like she has learned a lot about cooking from her mistakes.  I do not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading the Bible for many years and have always enjoyed it.  However, this book by C. S. Lewis has been so bad it is impossible to enjoy it. I can't believe a professor at a college level like Lewis should be writing about a text that has been around for so long.  I have read some of his other works but this is just a terrible read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I have had the worst experience with a book that I have ever read.   It has the same name as a good book.  This book is not a good read.      If you are going to read this book, get the first one and get over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very basic, boring and predictable book that could be used as a basis for an academic paper. The author is very poor at conveying her message.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice that the author did not learn from her past mistakes. This book is supposed to be about the "rehabilitation of an ex-Nazi", but the entire time the narrator is talking about her past, she is constantly talking about the horrors of her past. The author's previous book about a child murderer did not make her feel as bad as this book did, and yet, she did not change anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book to a friend to read. He got it on a lark, but I was hoping to read a little more about it. I didn't really care for it, and I didn`t understand it at all. The best part about it was that it was in print.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping for something great when I decided to pick up this book. I'm sure there are some good books out there but this is the first one that I've heard about that I found to be really disappointing. It's got a lot of really interesting information about how to get started in the field but it's very hard to find out what the hell is going on when it comes to the different types of research and analysis. The author doesn't seem to know a lot about what he is talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the idea of this book, but it failed miserably to live up to its promise.  It was interesting to see how different the different parts of the human body are.   The concept of "the vagina" and the "anus" is really interesting.  But I never really understood what these parts were supposed to be used for.  The book talks about how the "vagina" was originally used to clean the genitals after sex.  I can't say I find this too surprising.  Perhaps it's because I've always had a theory about what happens after sex and that the vagina was just a "gateway to the vagina" rather than a "door" into the body.  It's just a bit too much theory for my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an odd story about a woman who, after being told by her doctor that she's a "chronic smoker," decides to get a cigarette lighter. It's a bit cliche.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total waste of time. I am very unhappy with this book. This is a book about the relationship between a teacher and a student. The relationship is completely and totally dysfunctional. The teacher, Mrs. D., is very domineering, and the student, Mr. F., is an obedient little boy. The author, Ms. Williams, does her best to describe the relationship as if it were a real-life romance, but it just isn't. There is a lot of passive-aggressive behavior from Mr. D. There are times when Mr.F. tries to get Mrs.D to be his friend, and she gets very upset at him. This behavior is completely out of character for the little boy she's trying to get into bed. Mrs. B. is also a total bitch. She's a teacher, but she's also a little bitch. I wish the author had put in some character development. This was a very dull book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book. However, there are two very obvious flaws: 1) The author is a former fundamentalist and a fundamentalist, he has little knowledge of the Bible or even what a fundamentalist is. He has an uneducated view of the world. He's an extremist who believes in nothing. The story is about his journey from being a fundamentalist to being an atheist. It is about an experience with a very important person. However the author doesn't seem to have a clue what is important. 2) This book is an autobiography and it's not very interesting. It's about a man's experience. I would give it 1 star if it were about the life of a fundamentalist. But it's about something else and the author didn't seem very interested.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book that I was glad I read. However, it has one serious flaw that I don't think is very important: the ending. I understand that the author wants the story to end on a happy note but that ending just doesn't work. The story was already pretty good so I was hoping for a little more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.   It is filled with unnecessary facts and unnecessary details.  It has no plot and the characters are flat and annoying.  The author doesn't understand the importance of an authorial voice.  She doesn't explain the meaning of the word "love."  She writes about the same old cliches she writes about in other books: "There are two things you can be certain of in life: death and taxes."   I hate it!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, but I bought this one because of its title.  It's not a bad story, but it's a boring one.  I can't wait to read the other two books in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a quick read about how to be a good Christian in the 21st century, this is it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an avid fan of the Harry Potter series, I was very excited to read this one.   Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of children's books, so I'll probably have to pass on this one, but I do appreciate the efforts of the author to bring the characters to life in a very realistic way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book.  The author makes the whole book about the problems with religion and how they lead people to bad choices, but it's just not true.  Religion is not a force for evil in people's lives.  It's about the best we can do when life forces us to make bad choices.  This book is full of things that are true, but have been distorted by the author's opinions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I was interested in it, but    It's   awful  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book quite difficult to read and it was frustrating that it was such a good book. However, I found the information and insight into the inner workings of the mind useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to report that this book is a complete waste of time.  The author, who seems to think that everyone who read this book needs to be a professional writer (and who is a graduate of an accredited literary training program), does not know what he is talking about when it comes to the craft of writing.  His examples of bad writing are more examples of his own bad writing. I am also sorry that he is an idiot, but I think it is okay to say that about anyone, even if they are an idiot.  I don't think I am going to bother reading anything else by the author of this book.  He has said that he does not have a PhD and he is probably right about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I bought this book was to read a story about the first time my daughter tried to read the Bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading this book since I was 12 years old. I still read it once a year or so. It's about a little girl, her father, and the time he and his son were on a camping trip. They were hiking up a mountain when the father's watch stopped. It stopped because it was too far into the night.  The little girl's father looked over and said "I can see the stars tonight" She thought he was being silly but he didn't give up. He went back to the top of the mountain and climbed it again. He came back down and climbed down a cliff to get back to his watch.  After climbing the mountain over and over he climbed down and over a second time to get to his last watch.    I remember the book and the story, but the way the author describes the story doesn't make it any better.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a huge problem with this book. I am not a fan of science fiction. In fact I have never even read a good one. I'm a huge fan of the old pulp magazines. I read "Alien" and "The Fly" in college. I can tell a good pulp magazine from a bad one by the cover. It's a hard book to describe. The first time I read it I was confused. I couldn't find the right ending. The author says that the ending is in the "last paragraph" of the book. This is a great concept to begin a story with. I know what the ending will be. It may not be exactly what the author wants, but it will make sense. The beginning is a little confusing. I didn't understand why we were sent back to the beginning of time. Then again I'm not sure I like time travel. The ending is really the only thing I didn  The idea of a time traveler coming back to fix the problems of a past life is a neat idea. It is just a bad idea to tell it in a book. It makes the book about a time travel book and not a time traveling book. There are two main problems with the book: (1) the author didn't have a good grasp of time travel (he says in his introduction that he is a "time traveler" which doesn't really work). (2) the idea of time traveling is a concept that is difficult to wrap one's head around. I really thought that this book could have been a good book about time travel if the author had done a little more research about the concept.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book. I would say it is better than I expected. The plot was very weak. There was no real conflict or struggle. It is very hard to get anything done. Also there is very little humor in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a friend who is a big fan of John Green. He is so good at putting words together that he is a natural. But it just isn't that fun. The plot is pretty good, but it is all so contrived and repetitive. It is also very dry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure there are others out there who will love this book. It's a fun little read, but it's so far from being good that I have to put it down. It has a lot of good ideas, but the writing is not the best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read this book but it was just too confusing.    It didn't seem like a good idea to pick up this book, so I didn't   Read more
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The writing is bad, the characters are poorly drawn and the plot is stupid. The book is about a guy who takes a picture of his dog's poop to a woman who lives in his apartment building. He is told that the woman will not get upset and that the picture is not dirty. He takes the picture, but he is disgusted when he looks at the poop on her floor. I hate that the writer tried to give the main character a good and loving personality but couldn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. I don't know how anyone could possibly find it enjoyable, and it was more of a chore to read than a pleasure to read. There's no humor in it. It's just a very slow, very dull read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a real waste of time.    The main character has no depth and no purpose.  He is just there for the sake of the plot, and is only there to be used.  The rest of the book is wasted space.  I hate to think of the amount of time I wasted by reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to use in a class about medieval life. It was terrible. I don't think the teacher would have approved of the use of this book in a high school class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very sorry that this book is not a complete hit.  The plot is interesting and the characters are well-developed, but they're not that much fun to read about.  I found myself wishing for more "action" than there was.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good read at all.   There are many things in this book that are wrong.  There is no evidence at all that the Prophet Muhammad had sexual relations with any women other than Aisha.  He is also making claims that are false.  One thing I did not like about the book was the lack of historical sources that would have supported the Prophet's claim.  The author also claims that the prophet Muhammad was not the perfect person that he was described as in the Hadith and this is false as I have shown in other books.  I did like that this book had no historical sources at all and it could only be accepted on faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read.   In fact, I've never even liked a book by an author I disliked.  In fact, my first experience reading about religion is probably why I hate religion in the first place.  It's just not that interesting a subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is absolutely ridiculous. The main character is a psychotic killer. The setting is a small rural community. The characters all seem to be living in their own private hells.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of books on this subject, but this is the most misleading, ill-informed book I've ever seen.  It completely misunderstands the nature of the "dynamic" and the "structure" of "possession."  In my experience, possession is something much more dynamic and more complex than the book claims.  The "dynamics" are much more subtle and less obvious than the "structural" of possession described by the author.  He has no idea what he's talking about, so he just tells you what he thinks you should think, and does so very poorly.  If you're going to use possession to explain how the Bible is "true," at least do it right.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written that I felt the author had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, that he had no idea how to write about a topic that doesn't need to be covered at all. The whole story of the book is about the author trying to come up with a way to sell his latest book, but he just doesn't have a clue. The only good thing is that it's about his own life and he can't help but talk about it (I didn't find any of the other people in the book that interesting, either), but overall it's just another mediocre book that nobody but the author would want to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's own book, which he self-published, was published by a major publisher and is much more of a "serious" novel.   I would have preferred a more straightforward approach, which would have been more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to give to my brother who's a huge Star Wars fan. Unfortunately, he is not a huge fan of the Star Wars movies. He was disappointed that I didn't like the story, but overall it was a fun read and I'll definitely read more of the books he's got coming out in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all, "The Girl Next Door."   This book is about a girl that everyone wants to marry.   She is cute, but she has no friends, no interest in any boys, and no other interests.  It is sad because her friends think that she is a little weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a lot of good information, but it is presented in a very confusing way that I have difficulty following. The author describes how to find out more about a good deal that I wanted but never found:    I got my book on the subject of the Cajun and Creole in a bargain from a friend who got it through a book club and I didn't. I was curious about the subject but had never found a good book. The information in this book is interesting but not easy to understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has many of the common "discoveries" about the scientific methods of naturalists, and they are well done. But the book is really a series of bad science-based conclusions.   It's a great deal of fun to watch a scientist figure out how a frog can eat a mouse.  It is also fun to see a scientist use scientific evidence to support a conclusion he has already come to.  But the conclusion is based on a bad understanding of the physics of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a collection of three short stories that I've written. I like all three of them but I prefer the story about a guy who tries to teach a computer to read: It is so short that you almost don't notice it is there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been reading this book for a year. I bought it on a whim because I liked the author, which is pretty rare for me. I was excited about reading the first book, but I really didn't enjoy it. It's a very long book.   It's written as if it were a very good book, and it is very good.  It has a great story and is filled with action.  However, I felt like the author tried too hard to create a compelling plot for his story.  He was so over-the-top that I felt a little cheated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the only book in my collection that I didn't want to read.   There were some things I found interesting, but not enough to get me interested enough to read the rest of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book.  It's not really a good read, it's a very bad book. The pacing is off, the writing is sloppy, and the characters are all shallow.  They all have the same basic traits:   - they're very stupid  - very vain  - want to be liked  - talk a lot about themselves  - get angry when people don't treat them like shit  - are really good at acting  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading this book for years now, but I never finished it.    I have no clue why.  This book is just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't like this book. It's a very shallow book. I like deep books. This book isn't deep. It has very little depth to it. I don't care about the characters. I feel like the author is trying to prove that he knows how to write a good book but it just isn't there. I could give a f*ck about the plot but then again I have a hard time reading anything about people's personalities. I mean, is there really a personality in there that is more important than what they do with their lives? Is it just about their relationships with others? Or is it just that they like to talk about what other people are doing? And who cares? This is just shallow, superficial, and it's not good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the kind of book that is so bad that it is fun to look back on it later. I'm sure there are good things in it, but this book just lacks the spark that made me enjoy it so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad.   It starts with a bad joke that gets worse as the book progresses.  This is bad from the start.  The only redeeming quality is that it makes you laugh at the jokes (or is that the only good thing about it?) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fun read, but it's also really bad.   The main character is a little girl and the setting is a fantasy world.  I like fantasy, but when the magic in this book comes in the form of a boy, it's really weird.  It's like he was just added to the book.  So he's a girl in a boy's body?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about how a guy who's always good at everything he does gets to be good at nothing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like the author's writing style.  He takes a look at modern day morality and explains it in such a way that I feel like I've already had a good discussion about it with a friend, rather than someone who isn't really a big fan of the genre.   This is the first book I've read by a self published author in the last few years that I've found that really hits the nail on the head, or at least on the metaphorical one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is one of the most embarrassing book I have ever read.  It was very difficult to follow the plot.  I had to go through all the pages again.  This book is about a young girl who is kidnapped by the same guy that stole her father's car.  The book is basically a horror story that uses sex as a plot device.  She was raped and murdered by her own father.  Her father was not a very nice person and is not a nice person by any means. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of stories that were not funny at all.  These stories have no entertainment value to them and should be left on the shelf until the next time you need to get up from your couch to read something.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an old book that has been on my bookshelf for a very long time. The plot is nothing to write home about, and there is no reason to read it if you don't like science fiction. But if you like the books I have read by Ray Bradbury, I think you'll enjoy this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not a good book and I am not interested in reading any more.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so bad I can't put it down.   This book is about the life of a child rapist and his family, and how they lived in fear.  It is really just a very sad book.  I don't understand how anyone can look at a book like this and think that it is a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a family who has a daughter that is the very definition of a "good girl" and a very bad mother.   The girl is very much like a spoiled little girl.  She can't take a compliment.  She's a good student but her grades suffer because she has to do her chores.  There is also a husband that has a hard time giving her a chance.  I think it is important to note that there is a positive side to her life and that is she has a mother that is trying to teach her some valuable life lessons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that it is embarrassing to have it published. The only redeeming factor is that it was written by a woman who has written well before and she was able to do this in a manner that is actually enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all. I have read many of the reviews on here and in other books by the same author. They all have to agree on this one, that it is the worst book I've ever read.   I guess my issue with this book is the fact that the characters in this book are very annoying.  It's very hard to get into a character's head when they are always doing the wrong thing.  The only time the characters really did anything interesting was when the characters were trying to get out of a bad situation.  And the character who's problem was solved, was in a position where he could be used for good, but didn't do it.  My problem with the book is that I thought it was over at the beginning.  I was ready to put it down and go back to other books I've read. It really was a chore just to get through the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very good, but it is not as fun as I thought it would be.  I was hoping it would have more humor and more of a story than it did.  However, the humor in the book is great.  It's definitely worth a read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about this book is the title. "The Drowning Girl" is a great title, but I doubt anyone would have a problem with it. This book is about a woman who becomes a shark to escape a husband who is a terrible father.  She is forced to learn to live on her own, without the family support that she never got in her family.  In the end, she learns to accept the horrible things about her husband and learns to love again.  The ending is horrible, but in the end I think she has to accept that she will never be able to go back to her family or the good things she had in her life.  If you are a woman and you want to know how to avoid the horrible husband, read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful.  The plot and characters were a joke, the writing was awful, the pacing was awful (there is not one single sentence that was paced well), and the ending was awful as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard that a few books from this series were bad, but when I finally got around to it I was disappointed. This book had a couple of good parts but the rest were so bad that I had to toss it.  The plot was a complete mess and the characters were so stereotypical and one-dimensional that I can't even imagine this being a good book for children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like the idea of this book at all, even though I was intrigued by it.   The main character is a woman who is always in the hospital.  When she goes into labor, she has a son and decides to name him.  She gets a lot of grief from the medical community because they don't want to deal with a woman giving birth.  The story is told through her thoughts, her feelings, and the conversations she has with her son.  It's very interesting, but I can't get past the idea that this is an excuse to write a story about a woman going into labor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book but disappointed in how poorly it turned out. This is the kind of book that is perfect for someone who wants to get the most out of the classics but is not into reading the original texts (I am not that kind of reader). This is probably because it is written for the modern reader but the ideas in the book are really outdated (and really stupid) and the book has a lot of typos.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just read a very bad book by the great Alan Moore.   It's a parody of everything that he has been doing in comics.  It is very predictable and just a bunch of stupid scenes.  I was expecting a lot more from Moore but, as I read, I realized that there are no surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about as interesting as a hot mess in a microwave. The only thing that was entertaining about this book was the part about the three of them being married, and that made me smile. I didn't find it very interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a lot of good ideas, but they are not well explained.  The author explains each concept in a very detailed fashion but never explains why they are important.  I can't say I like the idea of the "lobotomy" but I'm not sure if the author is actually advocating it or if he just feels it is the way to go in terms of getting over a problem.  This is not the kind of book that I would use as a reference book, but it is a great read for those that want to know a little about how things work in the world today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of "The Great Gatsby" but    I did enjoy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoy books about the Vietnam War, and this one is a great example. The book is well written, and the subject matter is well researched.  Unfortunately, there are a few errors that I noticed, as well as several omissions that would have made the book better.  For example, there is no mention of the bombing of Haiphong on 4 November 1969.  That was a major turning point in the war, and was responsible for the deaths of more than 1,000 people.  I can't imagine what it was like for them to go back into the field after a week or so.  There is also a problem with the author's characterization of the U.S. Army as a bunch of "hippies."  While I don't believe that is exactly the case, the Army is certainly more militaristic than the UAW.  The author also fails to explain how the Americans were able to take the Ho Chi Minh trail with only a few men and an old C-47.  It seems that the Americans had a good idea of what the enemy was doing, and were able take the trail without any casualties.  In a war where people are dying from all kinds of causes, and soldiers are risking their lives in the field every day, the lack of a plan to capture the trail is really curious.  If you have a good general officer with you, this is an excellent book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting more from this book, and that it was going to have a great story to tell.  The story is intriguing enough.  But it's not that kind of story.  It's a good story about the consequences of a stupid, self-centered girl and a bad boy.  I won't read the next book by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no patience with a poor book. I was disappointed to find that my favourite book, a classic on the history of the Church, had no discussion of the Book of Mormon at all. I didn't expect it to be this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very dry. The writer clearly is not very well read. It's the kind of book that you can find a lot of information about the "origin" of a story but can never really figure out the story itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was bad until I read the first few chapters. Then I thought it was pretty good. It's a good idea, but I'm sure most people would not find it as interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure.  It is written for a certain audience, but fails to satisfy.    As an avid reader, I have spent years and years in the same book format, and I can tell you from personal experience that you are much better off if you write for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading many good books about American history but never one like this. I am in awe of the way that Ms. Smith has put the history of the American Revolutionary War in a new perspective. She shows that the British had the upper hand in the war in all the key battles, that the Americans were fighting on two fronts, and that the war was not one of good versus evil but of the will to win.  I am going to have to go back and reread this book to fully understand what she has said.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited about this book when it was released in 2005.  I've been wanting a good book about the Cold War for a long time.  It's the first book I've read by an American who has worked on the subject since 1989.  Unfortunately, this book is more about how not to write a good memoir than about what actually happened.  While the first three parts are a good read, the final part is so poorly written it makes me feel like I just read a badly written novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is not descriptive enough.  This book is about a girl in the 90's that had the same life as a guy in the 50's.  There is nothing like that about the man's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that should have been called "The book that no one needs." I'm a professional bookbinder, but in all my years of doing that, I've never had a book come back that needed binder-ing like this one. I can't imagine what kind of time it took for her to write this one:  The author seems to think that there is no difference between the book she wrote (which is a collection of short stories), and a book with the author's name on it (which she wrote).   It's not that the book isn't good (it is), but if you don't already have a book of her stories (which I don't, because they're all very good), then you probably shouldn't have bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoy this book.   I am in a good position to get a lot of good information about the various fields I work in, but as I read the book I can't help but be a little disappointed.  It seems like the author has spent a long time in these fields before trying to do something good with them.  He doesn't really do anything other than try to "re-invent" them, and that is a bit disappointing.  Also, the writing is just okay.  A little too much about himself and not enough about others.  I think the best part about this book is that it is full of practical advice, but it's not really that practical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book boring.    This is not the first book I've read by a professor of the classics that was very slow and boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book about a great actor. It's just not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely disappointing.   The main character is a woman in love with a man who doesn't love her back.  I can see how the book would make a good romance novel.  Unfortunately, she's an incredibly annoying person and doesn't even deserve to be loved by her man.  He does, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad. I bought it because of the good reviews it had been getting. This book fails to deliver on its promises. It is so dry that it makes a bad cup of coffee taste better. It's written by someone who knows nothing about how to write. I can't wait for it to go away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a few good ideas, but the book itself is a poor copy. It's like a poorly written copy of a poorly wrote book. The idea is good, but there's just so much that doesn't work. The character of the main character is a complete waste of space and should just be thrown out. There's no sense of plot in the book. It seems like it was made by someone who's had a bad experience at a restaurant, a bad trip at the movies, a terrible shopping experience, and a bad day at work, and then decided that this was the perfect excuse to write a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many books by the late, great James Patterson over the years, but I'm very disappointed by this one. It's not the worst book he ever wrote - he's a talented writer - but the plot is absolutely retarded. It takes itself seriously but makes very little sense.  It is the story of a man who is trying to figure out what's wrong with his wife - he has two girlfriends - and one girlfriend who isn't really his girlfriend at all.  I'm sorry, but that's just dumb.  The other girlfriend is the main character's mother, and she's supposed to be the reason the man is so obsessed with her.  And what is his girlfriend's name?  Her name is "Jenny", which doesn't make sense at all because she doesn't have a middle name at all (and isn't even from the USA).  I can't believe that Patterson had to write a book about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books where you can't put it down.  It is filled with so much information that is essential for every reader.  And the photos are superb.  The only problem is that it doesn't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I love this book, but it's not for everyone. It's too complicated for some people to get into.   It is hard to get the concepts through to the reader and understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of non-fiction, but this one is absolutely horrible.  I read it to my husband, who was reading it to me, so we could have a "teachable moment" about why things happen the way they do.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find a single lesson in this book about anything that is not common sense.  It is, after all, a book about a dog who loves to eat her own poop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as a Christmas present for my son. He loved it but it was very boring. There were only a couple of good ideas and the story wasn't that interesting. I thought it would have been better to have read it as a college textbook.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was just the right amount of frustrating. I felt like I was reading the same old, boring, and overlong story over and over again. I can't believe the writer thinks he's clever by making his characters' names and hometown sound alike. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. It's just a book with lots of ideas but it's all wrong. I don't get it. The whole idea is that there's a conspiracy to keep the truth about UFOs out of the media. I've been on the fence about UFOs for a long time. I just can't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't like this book. It is the same old "I'm not a Christian because I am good" that is common among Christian groups and is completely irrelevant to me.  It's a waste of time, and my kids have enough problems already. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so long I had to finish it in one sitting.  The writing was pretty good.  It's very difficult to read about someone who has a life-long problem and is doing everything he can to avoid doing anything about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book, but it's not great. It's well written, but there are parts that don't read well and some that aren't really all that interesting.  I didn't get what was so funny about it.  It seems that the authors were trying to make a point about how we are so used to seeing animals in our food but we still tend to treat them as objects.  There's some funny bits in there about eating animals, but they are too few and far between.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 50 pages of this book are just a bunch of nonsense about a woman who has had a traumatic experience and has just returned from a long time away.   It doesn't make much sense at all, and is written as though it were a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. I am a bit of a snob about books with a lot of fantasy in them. I also read a lot and think a lot about how I read. This book just fit the bill. The prose was good. The characters were interesting. There were good twists in the plot. The ending was nice. It would be interesting to see if the author had any ideas about what she wanted the book to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an abomination. The premise is sound: a father finds his son is "special" and sends him off to boarding school. However, the actual story is just as bad: The boy is put in a home with a bunch of other "special kids" and then is put on a bus to the airport, and is never seen again.  The ending is especially disturbing, as the author gives a last, pathetic attempt to sell the story, and then throws in a horrible last-minute twist: the "special kid" gets sick of the boarding school and leaves to start a new life somewhere else, leaving his father heartbroken.  This is a book about "specialness" that doesn't hold up under scrutiny.  It is just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book.   The concept of a book that makes a point about the history of the U.S. with a fictional account is interesting, but   this book is a complete waste of time.  The main character, John A. Williams, is a very interesting character and the events he goes through in the book are interesting,  but  there is no real character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible. It took me forever to get through it. The first 5 pages I was reading were awful, and then I realized that I'd already read all of the reviews about how much I hate this book. The author tries to be funny by writing a book about her husband's alcoholism. The rest of the book is just terrible. I really don't know how the author can even read the reviews to come up with her story about her alcoholic husband. It's just so terrible that it makes me wonder how anyone could possibly write a book like that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of stories by various people who have written about a "gift" or "goddamn gift." The stories are interesting and funny but most people I know that have received one have ended up regretting it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time, and a complete waste of my time as well. The author tries to make it a story about a boy who is so smart that he doesn't need to read books.  This is absolutely untrue.  The book starts out with a lot of spelling mistakes, spelling errors and other stupid stuff that is just as annoying to me as it is to anyone else.  As it goes on, the writing gets worse.  It's very annoying to read, but I can't really say I enjoyed the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know about you, but I have always been a fan of Douglas Adams' books and his humorous writings. However, this one really got the funny bone out of my head. The story is about a man who has been diagnosed with cancer and is about to undergo a transplant. The doctors have already told him that he will be dead within two months.    I'm so sad about it because I really like the guy but I can't wait to see how he recovers from this horrible diagnosis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a high tolerance for bullshit.  This book, as is often the case, has been full of it.  The book is not even about the Holocaust.  It's about Hitler and what he did to the Jews.  He did a lot more than just kill them.  I found it hard to believe he could have made any difference in Europe in his lifetime.  A lot of the Nazi leaders, including the ones who were supposed to be his friends, were in the army or other professional fields.  Hitler was a poor leader.  Why would he have thought the Jews would be so helpful?  This was all done to make a war that never happened.  And the Jews were the main victims, not the German soldiers.  In fact, he made sure they were the primary victims.   The Jews were not going to help Hitler anyway.  Just as many of the Nazis who came before Hitler were not as effective as he thought.  As he got older, he became more arrogant and careless.  His final downfall was that he couldn't see past his own self-interest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a great book.   I liked it, but I wish there was more about his early life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in the    style of a self-help book.   I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for some   practical advice about money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. The main character (Beth) is very young, and the first few chapters are just boring and confusing. She's told that she's a virgin, and so a few times, she does some sexual things. But not in the way you'd think. In my opinion, she's trying to become sexually active at a very young age, and that's not very mature at all. Beth's story is told through the eyes of a baby who's trying very hard to learn how to be a child. The baby is very immature, and has no concept of sex, so he has to learn that from his mom. But it's not so bad, the book has lots of interesting scenes and Beth's relationship with her dad is really cute.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book extremely disjointed and lacking in content.   The plot is basically a waste of time.  The characters have no depth or depth at all.  There is not a single good thing to be said about the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of this book, but I really couldn't stand the way she put the book together. First, there were too many scenes set in the bathroom, where she has the characters make up their stories. It took me out of the story, and made me feel like I was reading a very long list of names of people to make up stories about. It was a lot of unnecessary and unnecessary detail. Second, the ending was just a lame excuse to have her character make up a fake backstory about how she and her brother were taken away by the FBI and put in an orphanage, because they were involved in some kind of terrorist plot. I found it hard to believe that the FBI would actually be that stupid. It's a very poorly done book, and I don't know if I will ever pick it up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the only book that I have ever found that completely lacks the depth of knowledge that is so important in a great book. The author seems to believe that the only way to learn a language is by talking to native speakers (which he says is not true of English), and that all the other "learning" he has done has been through reading. That is a pretty ridiculous claim, given that the basic vocabulary and grammar are there in the language, and you can read any dictionary to get a sense of the language.  I do like the fact that he includes a few good grammar examples at the end, but that is about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to read this book, but my book bag and Kindle are a little heavy, and so I never managed to pick it up. It was just too heavy to read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a pretty bad book. It's a little more like a children's book about how bad things are than a "real" book. I wouldn't read it again. It makes me feel very old and silly. I mean, I know I should read it over again, but it makes me laugh to myself when I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very sad story about a young woman who goes to a very bad place. It is a bad story about how someone can go from being a good person to being a bad person in a very short time. It makes no sense, and there is no good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought I was going to like this book because it was based on a book by a friend of mine who is a writer and I was really looking forward to reading that book.  The book has nothing to do with that friend or her book. I mean sure it was about a guy who has a secret but the book really only deals with his obsession with the "new woman" he meets at work.  I don't know what the "secret" was or if it was even a secret.  If that is what this book was about then it really was just a fluff piece about someone's obsession with women.  This book also had nothing to with any book by her friend which I find very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those stories that was written for kids, and as a result, the story isn't very good.   The plot revolves around a man's discovery that his brother has been kidnapped, and he finds out the identity of the kidnapper.  It's a simple story, but it has a very sad ending, and I was disappointed by it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book from a bookstore for $5 and am glad I did!  This is the first time I've read anything by the legendary John Irving, and the quality of his prose is just astounding.  The characters, the dialogue, the stories are all top notch.  His prose is so fluid that I found myself pausing and rereading sections several times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just so bad it makes me want to quit reading. It is like reading the worst part of a bad movie. The first half of the book is a collection of letters and journal entries about an unnamed woman who had been a part of his life since he was a boy.  It was his mother who introduced him to the idea of writing, and his mother was a very good writer.  This book is not a collection about a woman, but about a man.   I found it so interesting to hear about this woman and her life.  The letters are so good that I just kept reading.  In the first letter, the woman has an interesting description of her first love, and then she writes that she is in love with him still.  I do not think she was a good match for this man. I think she fell for the bad boy, and this book shows this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book that is full of holes.   The author is an incompetent writer who is using his own experiences to create a "feel good" book.  The characters are poorly written.  There are no real emotions or feelings portrayed in the story.  This story was very poorly written and is just about a man's attempt to find love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not difficult to read this book because the author is an academic who clearly has the ability to write well. However, I find that in his writing, he has failed to make his subject as relevant to real-life situations as he has made his own life. The title itself is not wrong; the main problem I had with the book is the author's obsession with religion. He says in the opening pages that he wants to "show the way the West can deal with religion."    This book is about a group of people who are so obsessed with religion that they cannot see that religion is a social construct.   As a group, they cannot make a real-world decision about what to believe and what to do without going to church.  So, I just finished reading this book.  I found the author to be extremely dull.  He was a professor and I was expecting him to have more knowledge and ability in dealing with real- life situations than he actually had.  But he didn't even make that much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be boring. I got the impression that they were trying to write a book about something that really happens in real life.  The whole thing about the girl who was shot in the stomach by her brother, and her sister who shot the brother in retaliation.  I get it, it's a good story, but   It's boring and the author didn't seem to have a real story to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment. It is very bad. I thought that there were other ways to portray a young man who is being abused by his father and what happens to a boy who can't take care of himself. I also thought that the book would be good if the young man had an older female role model to talk to. I'm sure that the author was very careful in choosing the girl who is so young and so naive. It seems that the young boy who is supposed to be so good with his hands has been given a bad hand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book that I would have picked up on my own. I have read and re-read it several times, and it just is not very good. I am not sure that the author has ever read a real book, so he simply tries to write a novel. He has also been using this method to get published many times, so I can see why it would work on him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry that this book is so bad. The characters are like cardboard cutouts, they can't even be considered characters because they act so cliched and stupid. The book was terrible and I have no intention of picking it up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book.    It is a great story.  However, the ending was extremely frustrating.  It was very predictable, and completely wrong.  As a reader I felt that the characters were being forced to make a choice between what they knew and what they wanted.  This is something that I am not sure is even possible in real life.  So this was a disappointing book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not good. It's bad, and bad is not fun. It does not get the job done in the first place, and doesn't give you any reason to pick up another book.  This was the only book I read in the past year that I would not recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on the plane from the library, and I'm disappointed. I like the idea behind it, but I can't say it's the best. There are too many errors, too many mistakes, and it reads as if the author didn't even try. I don't understand why there is so much text about the author's own views about the issue. Why doesn't he mention what he thinks about the issues in this book? He clearly isn't going to make a big deal about the religious issues. I'm also not sure why the author uses "God" as a plural noun. I can imagine him making a comment about how one of the books he's reading uses that plural noun, but "God"? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this was just an excuse to go out and get some food, but I was very disappointed in the final product.   It's a very basic explanation of the laws of nature, which are so common sense, that you can't even imagine that you're reading about them.  This is not a book for the serious scientist, the physicist or the biologist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all. It's a long book, so I thought it was the first book in a series. But it's just another "dying" book from a self-help author who's written books about everything from sex to weight loss.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a real waste of time. It had many of the same ideas as other "philosophy" books, but there was no actual discussion of philosophy. In fact, it was more like a short survey of philosophy's ills. I was looking for something more substantial than this, so I read the whole thing, but I think I'll just read my own notes here: 1. It's hard to understand why people who have made such big gains in their own lives seem so stuck. This is a book about the ways in which people who've had great success get stuck, but it never gets to the actual problem: The problem is not that people who succeed are "stuck," it's that they've failed to achieve success in the ways that would actually be the most effective. The solution to this problem is to accept the failure, to embrace the fact that it's a problem and not a failure, and then to do the work that will actually lead to success. 2. This book's main flaw is that it treats the "philosematics" as if they are all of one type, while at the same time treating the philosophy as if it were all of the world's philosophies. 3. I know that's what I was expecting, but that's not what the book offers:    I was hoping that this book would present a better argument than "philoseness" does. I had expected it to argue that "philOS" is just an alternative to a "philospher" - a different way of using philosophy. Instead, the book presents a different kind of "philoser" - someone who's good at philosophy but who can't do it well because he or she has a "stuffy" personality. That's the "problem" that "stubborn" people have, and I don't see any reason to believe that anyone who has a hard time thinking about things in general is in any way special. 4. This kind of book is useful to those who are not very good at using philosophy, because it shows them the problems of the "sticky" type of philosophy, and the advantages of "stubby" types. However, it is only useful to these people, and not to others. 5. This isn't a good book: There's a lot wrong with it. The book is a waste of my time, and it has no real content at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book.   The premise seemed to be something like, "Why don't more people use their imaginations to invent things instead of relying on technology?"   It was supposed to be like the world in a video game.  It didn't turn out like that at all.  I tried to imagine the world, but I was pretty hopeless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this book would provide a useful analysis of the history of the U.S. Postal Service. Unfortunately, it does the opposite:  It tells the story in an unnecessarily tedious way, while at the same time completely ignoring the role of the Postal Service in creating the modern U. S. economy and government.  I'm a postal worker myself, but this book is clearly written by someone who is very interested in the postal system and its effect on the U S. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been following the author's books for years and have been really impressed with the quality of his work.  This one is no exception.   This book has been in the works for some time, and I am really excited about it.  The writing style is unique and unique is good.  I am going to have to read it again and see if it is any good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is well told but the ending is so bad. The story ends after the main character has had the main antagonist captured and is in the hospital. There is no mention of where the main protagonist is and who his wife is.  The end of the story also leads to the main characters death but they did nothing to prevent it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about an abusive relationship.   It was so sad to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after a great lecture by a great professor at a university. It's very well written and presented, but the most important lesson is missing: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of books about vampires.  This is one of those books.    It seems like a bad attempt to cash in on the vampire craze.  It is also not very well written.  I found it hard to get into the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just the opposite of a good one.  The premise of this book is so wrong that it is impossible to imagine that the author has a basis for it.  It is so easy to dismiss the book because it doesn't make sense.   It seems to me that this book was written by a graduate student who didn't have a clue about how to write a thesis or how to use statistics.  He had a thesis about how much better it would be if everyone used e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes.  I can only imagine the difficulty in writing a book about that topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the same kind of story as "The Rediscovery of Alexander the Great" but in the same book, written by a different author. The premise of the book is interesting:  I went to the library to check out this book. It's interesting and the author does a good job of describing the culture of ancient Egypt. However, this book is a complete waste of time. The book spends so much time talking about how the ancient Egyptians used a form of electricity (which is not even mentioned in the book) that it becomes a distraction. This is particularly unfortunate because the book does a decent job of giving you an idea of how the Egyptians used electricity and how the technology that they used in ancient Egypt was actually quite advanced. The problem is that this book, as well as other "science" books, doesn't tell you about the actual science behind how ancient Egyptians worked. It just assumes you know about it and tells you how they did it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an absolute disappointment. The whole book is a complete fabrication of fact. I had no idea that the book was written by a woman, and had no interest in this book.   I am disappointed that my high school English teacher did not give this book to me for my English final exam.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all about sex, and that's not a good thing.  The writing is so awful, so self-aggrandizing that it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be funny or if it is supposed to make us laugh at a silly premise.  It doesn't really matter.  This book is just about sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason to read this book is for the "best" line in the book (the "best ever" one).  As I have read this line a thousand times before, it just sounds wrong and wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited about this book.  The characters are likable and the plot is intriguing.  I'm a big fan of John Green's works, but this is definitely his most polished work to date.  It's a shame it's such a short book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   If you're looking for a good mystery or a good thriller, go elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible disappointment and will never be taken seriously. The characters are just silly and the plot is ridiculous. I thought the story was so interesting at first but by the end I felt bored and just wanted to read about a good book about an evil person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this book.   It's good to read about things that are interesting, but I found it somewhat repetitive.  The book is about a man who was born with a mental disability, but that does not stop him from being a good leader or caring person.  I like that this book doesn't make him a saint.  He is still a bit of a jerk, but not like a jerk you would find in a book like that.  It is the other characters that make this book fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard that many people are upset about the changes made to the original novel by the author, and I'm one of them. I'm not going to be one of those people though. I've read all the previous editions of the novel, and each one is better than the one that came before. That's the way it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been waiting years for a book on the history of the modern Democratic Party to come out, but this one is a disaster.   It's an extremely well written book, but it's a complete waste of time.  The book starts with a "discovery" by the party's founders that it needed a party platform to compete with the Republicans.  Then it devolves into an excuse for the party to get rid of its own candidates.  It is clear that this is the only thing this book is about.  This is what they think the book is all about:  To me, the history behind the current Democratic Party is a sad and pathetic excuse for a political party that has lost touch with its core values. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at a party and was disappointed. It is very dry and does not offer much in the way of insights.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the second edition of this book and it is a total disappointment. I read the first and it was a nice read. The second edition is the first thing I read after work, and it's very boring. I don't really care about the subject at hand, so I can't see why anyone would want to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great story about the last days of a wonderful person. The characters are well-developed, and the book is well written. I wish I had read this when I was young.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't put it down.  I read this book in a day and didn't realize what I was missing until I went to the store to pick up another book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a few months ago and found it very repetitive.  The author talks about how much he hates his job and how the company he works for is corrupt and has poor service, but in the end he still has to work there.  I feel bad for him because he works very hard and probably has been overworked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about reading this book, and I am still excited about it, but I have to say that I'm disappointed that the book is too short for the amount of content that's contained in it.  The story of this family has some very compelling elements:    A mother who was raised in the south who had a very difficult time adapting to the north (this is the only one in the book that I found myself thinking about), a mother who has difficulty accepting her children's behavior, and a father who never really got what it meant to be a father.  All of the children were brought up by a single father (who is described as a "miserable, self-destructive drunk" and a "terrible disciplinarian").   I think the main thing that was so hard about the book was the fact that I couldn't relate to it.     It is the first book that is really "my kind of book"     
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry I had to buy this book as I had read about it in a review here.  This book is about a girl that goes to school to be a doctor, but gets a little too obsessed with a man who is supposed to be the father of her child, and then has a breakdown.  The book doesn't make sense to me.  I understand that a man will not go for a girl who is a doctor but if the girl really wants to go the man is supposed be the one to be.  She was so obsessed with him that she did not want to go to school with him, she wanted to go and live with him.  So I understand her wanting to stay with him but if she is that obsessed with the man she should be doing a whole lot more work at school and if not then she shouldn't be going to school.  Also the author is the son of a doctor so the father has a great say in her education.  I also don't understand the idea that it's so important that a girl be interested in a man, if she doesn't want to do anything at all.  Is that so that she can have a man in her life to live with?  She should be having sex to be with and be happy with.  If a girl is interested in something in a book she should have to actually do it, not just read about a man doing something.   I can understand that she might not want a man to be in her sex life, but a man that doesn't even know about her sex has a problem.  Now I understand this is a fantasy book so the author does get her girl in bed, but I don't like the way the author treats the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not provide the necessary information or background to understand what the book is about. The author is a bit too interested in his own theories to give the facts. Also, I think his definition of an authoritarian is just that - an authoritarian. The book could have been better if the author had chosen a different book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the most boring book   I've ever read   in my life .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most fascinating and interesting thing about this book is that the author (who I don't know very well) is a very, very bad writer. She has such a poor grasp of grammar that it's impossible to tell if she's making a sarcastic remark or just using a bad word. She is using an inappropriate word like "throb" and "lobby" instead of "threshold" and I thought that was a big mistake. Her sentences are so ungrammatical that it doesn't matter what she is saying. For example, "I couldn't help but be impressed with how the book described the way that a woman who's been in an unhappy marriage for some time, but is still deeply in love with her husband, can manage to make him feel better about her, even though he doesn't understand what she's going through." This is an inappropriate way to describe a difficult and sad situation, especially if he's a very emotionally abusive person. It also doesn't make sense when she talks about how a woman's need to be loved is so important to her that she feels like she can't possibly be happy unless he is. It's like saying a woman can't be happy until a man loves her. It sounds like something she would say if she were the kind of person who needed someone to love her. The book also doesn't really address her personal life, although it has a very interesting chapter about her marriage and why she wanted it to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry, but this book has been a waste of my time.   This is a collection of stories about people who seem to have a very hard time dealing with their problems, and I am convinced that it is a bad idea to try to write about them.  I think I will start reading other people's stories and see what they have to say about the things they have gone through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure this is true but I still don't know what to think about this book. It is based on a true story about a woman who worked in a small shop selling women's clothing in the 1940's. The story is told from the woman's perspective and she says she was a "good worker" but she had to work for money. I can see the author trying to make a story about this woman work but she just didn't. She would get tired after working for a few hours, and when she got home at night she would go to bed hungry. This is one of those books that you read and say "That is true, but what happened next?" If I had to guess, I would say the author got a "yes" from a woman in a similar situation who also worked in an early 20th century store. It was said that it was the same thing. This book has lots of "I-told-you-so" type stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible   It's bad   Why?   I hate to be negative about a book but   The author has done a poor job writing this book   There's a lot of 'how did I not see this before' in this book but the main problem   is that he is so obsessed with trying to explain the world   in terms of the'superhero'   and that this is the main focus   If you want a good story with a good plot you'll find it   but if you are looking for a good superhero story   it's not there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did read this book, but I never finished it. It was a boring story about a little girl's attempts to get a pet turtle that her family keeps. The story was all about how the turtle is not very smart.   The story didn't have much substance to it.  It was just about the turtle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book.  I really liked the book in high school about a girl who gets pregnant at 17, and her mother decides that she needs an abortion.  The book is great, and it's a shame that she had to go through with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't stand the writing style in this book. It was bad from the beginning and is just a tedious mess. The characters are completely useless. The story is nothing more than a series of pointless mysteries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It's a collection of some of the worst "self-help" advice ever written. It was written by a guy who believes that he's "God's gift to women" and that he can tell women how to "make them beautiful". It's all about "self help", "love" and "getting what you want". It was so bad I gave up reading it after a few chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is not very interesting and has no real depth or interest.  He is a generic soldier in a bland setting with no depth or character development.  The book is basically a plot device to have a main character go off and do some random thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but useless advice on how to succeed in a bad marriage: don't have sex with your husband, never give your husband gifts. It's not hard to find information about how a woman can be unhappy in a marriage - this book just reinforces it. This book was so terrible that I'm going to put it on my shelf until someone finds a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me forever to get through this book. It's basically a series of vignettes, but each is so over the top that it doesn't make sense. One is a cartoon of a woman in a head scarf talking about how the government is trying to keep her from having her own opinion on political matters. I am all for free speech and freedom of speech, but when you talk about something that is so completely out of touch with reality that I don't think the writer actually read any of the articles she was commenting on, that's just silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this book but could not. I found the writing to be very dry and there were a lot of spelling errors. I know I can always find a way to spell but the spelling was so bad that I just threw it out.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of the same stuff as so many others: a lot of bad grammar, a lot a bad writing style, bad characterization, bad plot twists.   I don't care if it's an adult book, it's still a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is about how we use technology to make the world better, to help us all do better. We use computers, we use GPS devices to make driving safer, and so on. I'm not so sure about that.   We don't use GPS technology to help ourselves or others. We just put the GPS in our car and take the risk of being behind the wheel when we get into an accident. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the creation of a video game and the development of the game over the years. The book is good on the basics of the development process, but really falls apart with the end of the book where the author tries to make the game look like it has been made in 3 years (a really bad comparison). The book starts off with the idea that the game was a commercial failure, and that the publisher lost a lot of money in the game (it was sold for $35k), but then the author goes into the details of why they got so much money in their first few years in business. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   The author describes the experience as having an affair with her husband.  This, however, was the most disturbing aspect to me, especially as I'm still married to my ex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read all the reviews of this book and have to say that I don't agree with the majority of them. I do like the idea of the book but have always found it difficult to actually follow a story. The first time I read this book I really liked it and was looking forward to the next book. But this time around I found myself frustrated as I couldn't seem to follow a single storyline. I have seen the movie and I was excited to see the movie but it is very disappointing that I will have to wait to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of stories about a group of people, who in the late '60s lived in the abandoned building at the corner of Spring and Park.  The building is still there today, but the stories of the group's lives in it are as fascinating as they are horrifying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a bit dry and very academic.  However, it is very interesting and the concepts are really interesting.  I would like to read more by Dr. Sperber. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been using this book for over a year, but am just now finishing it. It is a very dry read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most unreadable book I have ever read. I am not sure why it is so poorly written. It is so boring that I found myself wishing I had written the review myself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was extremely boring. I found it extremely difficult to read as I kept having to look up words I already knew. It's a bad idea to go to school for a "science" degree when you can just as easily have the same degree in the humanities.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with all kinds of misinformation about the history of medicine. First of all, Dr. Segal's main sources were all the quacks who peddled their quackery. It's a pity he didn't include a list of the more reliable and trustworthy sources. It would have been helpful to have a bit more information about the great contributions that other physicians made to science and medicine. He also tries to convince the reader that we should all be taking vitamins instead of eating well-balanced meals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever written. The only good thing about it is that it will hopefully bring attention to the problem of bad science fiction: the fact that there is a LOT of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book about the good things about the Roman Empire.   The only good thing I can think of is that the author did not write a history of the Germanic peoples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been waiting for this book for years. It's not a bad read, but I could not finish it. It is too tedious and doesn't make sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about a man who is a master of martial arts, but he can't do anything right. His son is also a master martial artist, and he's a total badass. He gets involved in a deadly martial arts tournament. The winner gets a million dollars and the loser dies in an explosion of a gun.   I don't know what to think about this book.  It's a good book, but not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very interesting and educational. However, as I was reading the book, I realized that this author does not believe in the existence of evolution. She also seems to believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God. I was really interested in this book until I realized what a nut she was. I really hope that others find this book interesting and informative, but if you are looking for a book that can actually teach you something about evolution, you are better off going elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the entire series of A Song of Ice and Fire novels. I'm not a fan, and have never read anything by Robert Jordan. The books are repetitive, the characters are one-dimensional, the stories are repetitive. There is no sense of wonder or surprise in any of the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little skeptical about this book. I read about the history of the book in a few reviews on Goodreads.   The history was good, but it seemed too little too late.  This is a book about a great hero and his quest to find his wife and daughter.  It is a very fun story, but I felt like I was missing out on some history and maybe a bit more detail.  Overall, it is a fun read and is worth a re-read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not worth the time it takes to get through it. It is an extremely poor read and is only worth a few minutes of your time if you can find someone else to read it to you. It's a terrible excuse to get off on someone else's story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an "experiment" conducted by a government department. The researchers took a bunch of people, all of whom have schizophrenia, and put them into one group and gave them all a drug. They found that the people who had the drug did better. This led the researchers to conclude that schizophrenia is a "lifestyle disease" and that people need to change their lives.  This isn't true.  People with schizophrenia are not more likely to be able to change.  In fact, the opposite is true: people with schizophrenia do worse when they change their life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm just going to say it:    I am a huge fan of this book.   It's the first book I ever read about the history of the Jewish state.  It was my first real introduction to Israeli history and history in general.  I've never read about such a long history of Jewish people in Israel.  In many ways, this book was a revelation to me.  The way it explained the evolution of Judaism, and the fact that Jews are still part of Israel, was refreshing.  And as I've read more about Israel and the Arab-Israeli conflict, I've found that this book is very true to my experience.  However, there are a few things that I don't like about this book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been out for a while now, and the only thing I could say is that I would rather read a good book than read a bad one.   I don't like the "what if" aspect of this story, but the plot is interesting and interesting stuff is often worth a read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was skeptical of this book until I started reading it. It is a very interesting and original way of looking at the problems we face today, and is an interesting book in itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most irritating thing about this book is that the author seems to have read my reviews about her previous books, but just didn't care enough to even read them. It seems as if she wanted to cash in on my bad reviews by writing a book that she's sure to be a big seller. If she'd just bothered to read my other reviews, I doubt she'd have put her name on a book she thinks people will hate. This book is about as bad as a book can get, and it has more of the annoying cliches of self-help book than the actual good advice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good novel, but it is nothing more than a series of bad jokes, poorly written characters, and cliches. It's hard to take seriously anyone who is willing to tell the same old jokes over and over again, or be just as lazy and pretentious in their writing. It is also hard to believe that the author didn't think that the audience would be able to relate to the characters, since they are constantly complaining about the things they want to do or what they don't want to get involved in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. It was written by a great scientist, and the information was very interesting. However, the book was just a waste of time. It's not like he ever gets around to explaining why the moon is not made of cheese. I'm sorry, but the "science" in this book is just so, so weak.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to buy a book about a serial killer because the name of the author reminded me of a murderer (I have no idea how many serial killers there are but I'm sure there are more than one).  The book is written in a style that's like someone with no real skill writing a non-fiction book on the subject is trying to get a story published.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series and get more insight into this particular murderer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  The story is about a man who was in the Army and the girl he had a sexual relationship with.  It's about their son who is about 5 years old.  In the beginning he's the perfect little kid and then he gets a bad attitude and acts stupid.  He does everything wrong and then when he tries to be a hero he just gets his butt kicked.  I think I'm going to read a book about a boy who was beaten by his parents before he got into the Army but that would be a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting and very interesting book. But the subject matter of it is so awful, that it makes me want to vomit. It has been suggested that the story is based on an actual murder that occurred in the mid 70s. I don't know if that is the case, but that is what I thought of it when I first read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a horrible book with many flaws. First the plot.  It's not about a war between a group of evil people and a good group, it's about a woman who tries to get revenge on a rapist.   Second, the author has a tendency to make her characters stupid.  For example, in this book she describes how a man who raped a woman will not stop raping women.  She also describes a man raping a woman in this way:  I don't know what he did, but he's a rapist, just like my ex-boyfriend.  Third, this book is filled with so many inconsistencies that I don�t know what to believe about it.  The main character goes to great lengths to get what she wants.  Her boyfriend does not.  There is no love triangle.  Finally, I found it odd that the main character would have sex with a woman when she was a man.  This is a good book, but not a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read most of the "Star Wars" novels but I've never found the story to be compelling enough to finish them.   It seems the characters are constantly being dropped from the book to make way for new ones.  I'm not sure why. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very strange and somewhat disturbing book that doesn't fit with the rest of the series. I've always been a fan of the Twilight series and it has to be said that The Body is a really cool idea. I can't imagine how much work went into it and the end result is a fairly well written book. But in terms of story, it's just very confusing. There's some very good ideas here, but they just seem to come out of nowhere. As a result, there's a lot of unanswered questions that never get satisfactorily answered, which makes the book really hard to swallow. There are also some really weird plot twists that just don't seem to make sense. Overall, I'd recommend this book for Twilight fans and for fans of weird science fiction, but for a series that's been around for a while, it needs a lot more work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book, but not for me.  I don't like the character of the "bad guy," and he's a very shallow character.  He also seems to have no real moral compass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand to read this book.  The only good thing about it is that it has a short and cute summary in the back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to love this book. But unfortunately, it doesn't work. There is a lot of information in the book, but most of it is repetitive and useless. There are a few interesting things in the way the author handles certain things in this case. It's just hard to understand how this all worked out, especially when the police made a big deal about it. There really isn't anything to be gained by reading this book; just read a book about the history of the case.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I was buying a good book but this one is so poorly written and poorly edited that it makes me want to throw it in the trash can. I have bought books that were worse in the past but this is a really bad book. I've read books from other authors but I can't imagine I will be able to finish this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring. It was a little funny at first but then it became a total drag. It is about a guy who has an abusive wife but doesn't realize it. I found it very hard to relate to the character. I didn't really like his wife, but I didn' t find the abusive part to be very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a real let down.  I thought it was a good book.  The author is a brilliant writer and I enjoyed reading the story.  However, there are several flaws in the story that I found frustrating.    First, the main character, Ayla, has a child at the same time she is having a relationship with the son of her best friend.  When I was in college, this was common in the '80s, when my friend had a child.  That's not to say Ayl's character is bad or that Ayl was wrong to have a relationship at that time.  But in a book about the 1980s, this is a little much.  Also, the "jokes" that occur are not funny at all.  They are just unnecessary.  In one story Ayl says, "I'm so good with a hammer that I've broken a few of my nails."  There are no nails in the picture that the reader is meant to be looking at.  Ayl doesn't need to have broken a couple of them to be good with one.  Lastly, there is a lack of a real plot.  There is a lot of information about the history of the American Family, but it's not explored in any detail.  It's like Ayl is just throwing information out there for her characters to pick up.  If you like a good story, this one is worth a read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about a woman who is trying to make a living as a real estate agent, but she is so out of shape that the only thing she can do is eat fast food and take long showers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written in a way that makes me wonder if the author is aware of how bad the book is.   It is full of errors, omissions and blatant plagiarism.  The main character is a woman who uses a lot of bad language and who has a terrible personality.  I found it difficult to follow her.  There is also a lot about sexuality, which is not really my cup of tea.  She is an atheist, and it is not clear if she has any faith in God.  It makes me want to say "well then, good riddance". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased the book from amazon.com after reading a good review on it on a good book site.   This book was a complete waste of money.  The book is an extremely well written, but completely boring book.  I read it for the plot, but the author has no idea about the characters or plot.  In the beginning, I thought it was the first book by a new author.  Then, I realized the author did not have a clue about what she was writing.  It was very disappointing to read a book I paid a lot for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I've been looking for a good "hard" science fiction story for a long time now, and I've never found it. This one is just not good enough.   The plot is really bad, as it tries to be a hard sci-fi adventure book about a stranded space station crew trying to survive a plague. It's really just an excuse to do things with lasers.  It's not that I don't like lasers, I do, but the story just doesn't make any sense with them.  The whole plot is built on the fact that everyone on the station is immune to the plague, so there's no point trying to kill them all.  I also can't help but feel like this book is a huge cop out, as there are so many things that could have been done with it. The whole idea of a spaceship with a space elevator is an excellent one, but there's really nothing here to make it work.  This book really does not come close to living up to the hype that it's already been given. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with all the same old bad ideas and clichés.  It's hard to get excited about any kind of science fiction/fantasy that's supposed to be a fun read when it's full of boring old plot holes.  This is the first time I've seen someone complain about the fact that their character has a brain but a b- in their name.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found myself very bored in this book. Not even by the first chapter, which I thought was funny and well-written. It was, but then again, so were the rest of the books in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever written by a professional journalist. It's a very bad, self-righteous, arrogant book about how to live a happy, fulfilling life. It sounds good on paper, but it's full of false assumptions, half-baked ideas, and poor thinking.  If you're a professional writer and you think you can get away with anything, you're wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring.   I have no idea why anyone would buy a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really disappointed in this book. It's a great introduction to the subject, but for me, there are too many glaring errors in the book. There are over 300 errors, I found one in a sentence about the early modern understanding of the scientific method that seems out of place in a book on scientific methodology. There is also a mistake about a key figure in the development of modern physics, Albert Einstein. This is a book that I have bought several times and has been good at times. It is not good at all at this time in science history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book because of its title. The book is actually very good and interesting but the title is just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book to a friend who was looking for a good story and found that not one of the many things in this book are true.  I have read many good books and enjoyed them, but this book is not one I would recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book about how to live a happy life. The author is a great guy, and he shares his experiences as well as his advice with you. However, if you have any idea what a person is like, or want to know how to do things better, this book will be worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not only boring, but contains no plot or character development. It is simply the story of a woman who is married to a man who is constantly cheating on her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a bit put off by the "novelty" of the story, but once I was into it, the writing was actually pretty good. I did have some problems with the character, but the main characters were all interesting and the main plot line was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a big waste of time.   The only good thing about this book is the first 3/4 of the book is about a group of people that were sent to hell to live with all of the sinners in heaven, but they still couldn't even get themselves to read the Bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it would be a fun book about "a lot of different stuff."  The book was well-written, but it was not well-organized or easy to read.  The pages were so thin that you could see the pages underneath them and that is a very bad thing.   This book is a lot of fun, but I didn't want to spend time reading this book so that I could find my favorite bits. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second time I've read this book, and I can't tell if it's the same author or not. I don't care, either way I'll never read this kind of crap again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting more from a book about the Holocaust than it delivered. It is true that in a few cases a reader might find a mistake, but the fact is that the authors themselves were Holocaust survivors who could not read and had difficulty finding the correct sources. They did not write as if they had studied the subject thoroughly. In this book, they rely too much on hearsay and on the "tales" of the Holocaust survivors. This leads to a lot of hearsay in the book and the authors' own words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with the actual subject matter. I've already read this book once, and I was disappointed by it. It's a very dull read and it's hard to get a good grasp of the overall story. It feels as if the author was looking for a way to get more money out of his readers. I think that if the book had just been about a very serious subject (like the war in Iraq) then the writing could have been better. I didn't like the ending either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been waiting for this book to come out since it was announced that it would be written by Richard Matheson. This is a good book, but I was disappointed in it. It took me several tries to realize that there was no good reason for the characters to be in this position. They were so poorly written that I would not want to spend time with them, much less read about them. This book should be about a young girl who goes on a road trip to get a book written by a famous writer. The author should not be so arrogant about his own writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book to a friend who is a fan of the X-Men, but is a big Batman fan, and he loved it! He said it was better than most of the movies. I was expecting a good story with lots of action and a good villain, but I was very disappointed. It was just too boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of junk. This book has little to no depth and is an over-blown, long-winded, overly technical treatment of a complicated subject.  I didn't like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a bad read. I read it as a book club discussion with the group and my sister. We discussed this book, which I don't think we could get past because of the "unintended consequences" of it. We were trying to come up with ideas for a book on gardening and what can be done with it. So we looked at the "what's wrong with it?" and then the "why?" and realized we were talking about something that is really easy to fix. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of very good stories about the good things in life, but very little about the bad.  This is why I gave the book 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so disappointed in this book. I am a big fan of Harry Potter but I was so shocked and disappointed that I didn't know who Draco Malfoy was when I first picked up this book because I was just so intrigued. Draco is supposed to be one of the "bad boys" of the series and yet here he is trying to get his parents to take him in. And then he ends up getting all the way into Slytherin and the whole thing is just kind of sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a very good time with this book. It's a great read for the history buffs and a good read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War. However, there are some holes in the evidence presented that I'm not sure are fully addressed. The book's thesis is that the U.S. military was deeply involved in supporting the VC in Vietnam, but there is no evidence that this is true. The VC were the ones with whom the U,S. was in constant contact and with whom they had a close working relationship, but the VC themselves did not support the U.,S. The U. S. was not even aware that the VC were using American weapons until well after the war had begun.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a poor attempt to provide a "bible" on how to use the internet.  I've never seen a book like this, it's basically a compendium of how to make the internet work for you.  It's a collection of how-tos from various internet gurus.  If you are in the market for an internet book it's probably a good idea to avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a guy named Jack who is a "homoerotic" gay.   He is also a big fan of all the Star Wars characters, including Yoda, but also wants to be a Jedi.  This book was pretty good in a "well, duh" sort of way.  I am glad I was able to read it before it was released because it will definitely be a great reference book for me when I have to write about Star Wars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad story; it's a story about a terrible book.  It has nothing to do with the book's content and doesn't even attempt to explain what's wrong with it.  The author doesn't care about the story, the characters, the plot or the language.  Instead, she tries to make up for the shortcomings of the book by putting it down in a really bad way.  I can't recommend this book highly enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book, but it lacks the magic of Tolkien's work. The characters are all pretty shallow, with no real complexity. I can see the appeal of the Lord of the Rings story, but the story is just too shallow to be satisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given this book as a gift and I was not impressed at all. The book's style is terrible. It is so thick that you can't see the pages. The writing is poor and so many characters are so uninteresting that I was constantly reading a synopsis and wondering why I was reading about a character that wasn't worth the time to read about. It was so bad that I even stopped reading halfway through the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is very well-versed on the subject of sex and sexual history. However, she makes it seem as if this is not as important to a child as the sex education he receives in public schools. This book is not very interesting, and doesn't offer much of an insight into a child's life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a classic. The characters were so realistic and relatable that I felt I could have been in the shoes of one of them.  I'm glad I read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried out this book on a whim but I can't even remember what I was doing with it.   It was hard to read.  The characters seemed like they were made up of the worst possible things to write about and I was left wondering if I'd been given a bad copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a copy of the first edition of this book. It's a very nice book.   The book does a good job describing the history of the game of football in the U.S.  It is not so much about football in particular as about the American love of the sport and the history that goes with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've ever read. I was so disgusted by this book that I don't know if I can even take my kids to a zoo. It was a huge disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's almost funny. It's an attempt at satire, which is good but ultimately just makes this book even worse. The main reason why this book failed is because it was written by a moron. The author assumes that because he has read about something he can write about it too. The actual facts are so wrong that it's insulting to readers. The most laughable thing about this book is that there is a chapter on the best sex positions and that's a joke to the reader because it's not true.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "newer" edition has a lot of typos and grammar mistakes in it. The original book had some typos but no grammatical errors.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book a very interesting read, but very frustrating. It is an excellent read about how the United States government has been manipulating its citizens, but it is very difficult to believe the author was actually there. He doesn't even seem to be from that country. The author does an excellent job explaining the US government's involvement in the Vietnam War and the "War on Drugs" in terms that are easy to understand. He also does an amazing job of explaining the various ways that the government has attempted to manipulate and control people. I can only hope that the book continues to be interesting, but that it does not get repetitive.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a boring book. There were no new ideas, and the only new ideas that were offered were just as dull. I know this book was supposed to be about how people use the Internet to communicate, but the author never actually got around to explaining how people do that. I didn't care about the people that he was talking about, and I found that this book only got more annoying as it went on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say that I am very disappointed that this book is no longer in print.  The subject matter was interesting and the writing was very good.  However, the book is just too heavy.  It is not an easy read.  I would recommend it to any serious student of history or military history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. It was very interesting and I wanted to read more but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. The author made a few valid points and the book seemed to have been written in a very entertaining way. However, I didn't feel any more like I had really learned anything new about the subject matter than I did when I started.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is good, but the book itself is very poor. I'm still trying to figure out what I didn't like about it. I like the author's style and how he uses humor to tell a story, but I don't think the book is funny enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be just another boring, boring book. I'm sure that's what it was intended to be but I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't know about this book, I'm sorry. I am so confused about it. I'm not a fan of any sort of "urban fantasy". I just read it because it's a new one. I've heard about it from my friends. I can see why a lot of people like it. There's a cool twist at the end. I don't think I will buy the next book in the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, despite being well-written, does not offer much in the way of actual teaching. While the book is interesting and informative, I do not find it particularly helpful for the student. This is because the book does not deal with the more practical aspects of writing. The writing style, which is very similar to that of a first-year college student, is difficult to read and the book itself is very poor in grammar. This book is for those who are interested in learning to write, but want to do it without a lot of extra effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book several times but it is always the same story:    A young man is kidnapped and beaten for several hours.   He is then dumped in a remote area and told that his family has abandoned him.  Then, he is forced to watch as his friends murder his family.  This story is repeated for the next several pages, but never is the reader able to figure out who is really responsible for the violence or why the perpetrators are willing to hurt an innocent man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is one of the most boring, unimaginative, and cliche-ridden books I have ever read. I would have been better off if I had just read the first book. I don't know why anyone would bother to read this book other than as an exercise in masochism. It's not bad in the least, just a bit too over the top.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a HUGE fan of this series, and have read all the previous books, so I was excited to read this one.   However, the only thing that I could think of that might have made this book a better book is if the narrator hadn't been so bad.  I know I'm not the only one who felt like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very poor translation of the original Russian by a very good author.  The original Russian text was extremely good.   It is written very nicely, the grammar is very clean and the translation is accurate.  But when the translation was changed into a much more boring, and much less interesting, book, this is not the book that I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I was afraid I'd end up a murderer, but then I realized that it's actually a really nice book. It's a lot of fun and has lots of interesting ideas about psychology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on the plane.   There is a lot of information about the life of the author (a very successful man who has no regrets), but I don't think it would be a good idea to start thinking about a new book just to get that kind of information.  The author is a very good writer, but I'm not sure this book would be very good in any genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I wanted to learn more about the book's subject, but the information about the subject was not very good. The author, Robert F. Bly, did not really try to cover the subject adequately and was at times overly descriptive. I was expecting much more than he gave. I found the book interesting enough to read over and over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an extremely disappointing book. I bought it hoping for a good story but instead got a terrible one about how a man was made a criminal by his own mother, how she ruined him, how he tried to commit suicide but could not, and how her life was a waste.  I don't believe it's good writing, the characters are annoying, the plot is dull, and the whole book is just boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not sure that my husband would even like this book because of the subject matter. He was not a fan of the previous book he read (The Secret Life of the Boy Scout).  I was surprised by the subject, however, and hope that it is interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not for the faint of heart. It is an in depth analysis of the subject, with a lot of detail and depth on a subject I am still learning about.   But it is not without faults.  The book is very biased towards the idea that the Soviet Union was not a communist state at all.  This is not the case.  There were many, many flaws in the Soviet system, many of which the author has discussed.  Unfortunately, he is not willing to give them all due consideration.  It seems like a lot was just tossed in without a thought out analysis, to try and make this book into a "pro-Soviet" book.  I find the book to be very dull and a bit repetitive.  Not enough focus on the major aspects of the Soviet economy to really make this an interesting read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read the books in this series, but I'm really hoping that the next book in the series is "The Last Great Battle."   The first two books are so good that I can't wait to get to the third book.   This series is a good example of how a series can be both good and bad, but it is so good   that I find it hard to stop reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a good writer and does have some good ideas. But the story is a terrible mess. I'm sure she'll get a good review one day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just that...this book just doesn't make any sense. It doesn't explain why it is necessary to be a good listener (why he didn't simply just leave the girl alone?), why he did not leave the room until the end of the date (he had to make sure that it was actually going to happen) or why he felt compelled to talk to the girl after she had been crying for a long time (even though the book says that this would be wrong). I'm guessing that the authors were too lazy to go into the detail of why he needed to be such a good friend to the woman, but I'm not willing to trust their word on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this book is a bad read.  The characters are poorly drawn and their plot is weak.  They are only there for the sex.  I wish that there were more to the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in one sitting, and found myself frustrated and bored by the end.   The only thing I found interesting was the section about "pornography" in the novel.  It's true, but only in that the author seems to think that porn is the way we should go about getting what we want in life.  I guess it's true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the first two chapters. They are about as good as any non-fiction book I've read.  They give a very thorough, well-written account of how the early Christian church was persecuted.   I think I'll read the rest of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is so misleading, but it's hard to not be impressed by the depth of the writing.    It's a well-thought-out story, but the characters are really only given surface level descriptions.  I feel like there were a few times where the authors really got a chance to show their own writing and how it's like the characters' own life:   I liked the fact that this is the first book by a female author, but I don't think it's a great sign that it takes place in the same universe as A Dance with Dragons, as this book doesn't seem to be very good in that respect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read it but the book never arrived, and after waiting for 2 weeks for it to be shipped, it finally arrived, so I have been waiting to read the rest of it.   This book has very little in common with other books in the same genre.  I really enjoyed the story, but the author made it difficult to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very good book about a really good woman but the woman in question is a bad one.   If you're a woman reading this book don't get involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book.  The idea of the story is good, but the characters are all stereotypical, which makes it impossible to enjoy.  It's like they were pulled out of a fantasy novel and put into a normal one.  I would have preferred a novel set in the future about a group of people who have lost their powers and are trying to cope with the consequences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in hopes that it would help me understand my mother's behavior when I was growing up. Unfortunately, I am now finding out that it actually does nothing but confuse me more and more.  I found myself wondering what on earth I am supposed to make of my mother, especially when I realized that it is my own fault that my mother is such a narcissist.  As a young adult, I can see how the book is helpful to someone who is struggling with a bad mother.  The book suggests that I should be able to identify with my mother as a child.  My mother, who is not very good at showing me love or caring for me, is at least a person who loves me.  Her behavior when she is very young makes me think that maybe I can identify with her as a little kid.  It turns out that my inability to relate to my mother when she was a child is my real problem with her.  Even though my mother has improved a great deal over the years, I have found myself unable to relate with her at times.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a rehash of the book by Peter V. Brett. It is not very interesting and does not have any new information to add. This book was written by Brett in 1986 and he repeats the same mistakes. I will never buy Brett's book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a fun book. It's not for everyone, but if you are like me, you'll love this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a young adult.    The book is written by a young girl, and so much of the material is written in a very young-girl-like way that the reader has to make a conscious effort to look up the words for the sake of the story.  I'm not sure that the author had any intention of the reader doing this; she may just have been writing about something she knew well, which may have been a lot of her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written I would have given it to my 4 year old nephew and he would have finished it in an afternoon.   It was so terrible that it is hard to even believe that this is a real book and that someone thought it was a good idea to write a book about a book.  This is a horrible book and I don't know if I'll ever look at a book the same way again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for the first time last night and it made my day a bit better. This book is full of fascinating and well researched information about the life and times of a little known American President, John F. Kennedy. This isn't just a book about a politician, it's a book that goes into a little more depth about the man behind the name. I know, I know; there are a lot of people out there who think they know about John F., but this book makes it clear that, at the time he was running for President, he was the first American President to have a Secret Service detail, and that he wasn't the first to be assassinated by one. Kennedy was the only President to be shot while he was in office. As far as I know this is the first book that's written about Kennedy's assassination, and while I can't say it's the definitive history, I found it very interesting and educational. I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in knowing more about the President who made the country the strongest it has ever been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book.  I am a very large woman who has to learn to do some of the less "girly" things that are important in life.  This book was supposed to be about my experience learning to do these things.    This is the first book that has ever shown me how to do them well.  The author claims that she has done the things described in the book and that she is a very successful woman.  But the author is a complete idiot.  She has a very small bust, no body hair, has a huge chin and is so fat that she can't wear a tank top or pants.  As for her "gift" of being able to do this stuff, I am so sick of her using that term.  It is not something that can be taught.  Her own mother did not have this gift.  So I will never believe that being fat can be a "gifts" or a "skill".  So if you are going to tell me that I need to get over my fatphobia, I would like you to show me.  There are plenty of fat women who don't have to learn how to dress, do make up or do other "glamourous" things to be successful.  And there are plenty who are obese but don't think it is a problem.  I wish this book had been about other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of lies and exaggerations.  The author claims that she has a Master's Degree in Clinical Psychology.  She is a PhD in counseling psychology, and she is not a master's in counseling.  This is not just a lie, it is an outright lie.  I know that in the business of psychology, PhD's get paid more than Masters, but still, there is no way in the world that she is a master of counseling.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that it is a compilation of a bunch of good old SF stories from the 40's and 50's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting to love this book, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment.   The main character, who is a brilliant physicist, has a very unrealistic view of life and science.  The scientific method is just a fad and not worth using in everyday life.  His theories were ridiculous.  He made no attempt to learn more about the topic, and the book does not even mention how many times he was wrong.  I am not even a good physicist, but this book showed me what it takes to be an idiot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book about the history of the American Civil War, but my poor eyes just couldn't handle it. The book is about the war from the perspective of the slave holders. It makes no attempt to inform the reader about the other side of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after I read "The Great Dinosaur Detective" by Richard C. May and I am still a little disappointed in May's work. May's book is much better than his (and my) but the writing style is still very clunky.  It's as if May wanted to make a point by writing this book but had no clue how to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a lot of good information but fails to make the most of it.  The author provides some interesting information but it is not applied to the book she is writing.  She does talk about the effect of social pressures on people but I am not sure how that is relevant to someone who doesn't care about social pressures.  I found that information useful in my own life but she doesn't use it in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about as close as you can get to a bad translation without getting the original written in another language.   It's like if someone translated a bad movie into another language and then wrote it as a bad story about a man who has to learn how to cook French food from scratch.  This is like that.  There's just so many errors.  It all comes down to a basic misunderstanding of how a certain verb works.  They are the same errors that you would find in a bad copy of an original book.  The translations are just plain bad.  I can't wait to find a good translation of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't recommend this book to anyone who's not familiar with the subject. It's like reading a bad history book about a war that doesn't exist.  The author spends too much time on the negative aspects of the US war on the Vietnamese.  It's only when the author talks about how the US failed to win the war that the real story begins to emerge.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was very boring and had little to do with the plot. The characters were very shallow and uninteresting. The author makes a point about how she has been a victim of bullying, but there are no actual examples of such a thing happening to her.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting read. The main character is very well written. I'm looking forward to reading the sequels, which are going to be much more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting this book to be the most boring of all time. I have been reading the same ones for years and always get the same kind of information. This one was the worst of all. It was a terrible read and I'm just not interested in reading more about the Holocaust or how the Jews were treated after the war. It is all so boring and it just made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poorly written book. I was looking forward to reading about a boy named Joe. He is a bit of a goofball, but at the same time he is not stupid. Joe has a big imagination and loves reading. He loves the Lord but also wants to be like his father. He also has a little bit of an inferiority complex. I'm not a big fan of fantasy but I like a little romance in my fiction.  This book had all the ingredients to make me enjoy it. It was fun and interesting and it was easy to follow along.  I can't wait to read more about Joe and his family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an abject failure. It was bad on so many levels. The characters were not interesting, the plot was predictable, and the author's style of writing is atrocious.  I'm so glad I read the last few chapters first and then put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking for a good fantasy book, but none that is good for children.  This book is good   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book at all. It is filled with unnecessary and inappropriate sexual information about the characters.   It is difficult to follow a book that is about so many things that are not sexual. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still not over this book. I read it a couple years ago and have been meaning to review it ever since.   I've always liked the series and the books are usually great but this one was just...well...I'm not even sure what to call it.  It had everything going for it, a good plot, interesting characters and a well written story but the writing just felt...wrong.  I mean, I get that sometimes writing a book can be hard.  But at times, you just feel like the writer is not on the same page as you.   It wasn't just my opinion that the writing felt off.  Other people on Goodreads had the same complaints and the reviews on GoodReads were not that kind of bad either.  In addition, there were a few reviews that said the book was not that good to begin with.  So, I was not surprised when I found out the book has a bad review by a few other people.  For the most part, they were right.  The book is not bad.  Sure, there are some parts that I didn't like.  Yes, there is a bit of a twist at the end that was unnecessary.  Still, the main characters were interesting enough to carry the story and I am looking forward to the next book.  If you are not a fan of the series, you might want to pass on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a good read from the author but this book is a total disappointment.   There were no plot twists, no twists at all.  It was all predictable from the beginning.  They have been married for 20 years and they are still married.  I have to admit that I am very happy that they are a married couple but the author should have had a twist in mind when he wrote the story.  The husband was never in danger and had no chance to do anything to save himself.  As for the husband, he was a good man and I hope he can move on from this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not have the "spiritual/mystical" elements found in a lot of the other works that I've read. This book is just about good looking people doing a bad thing (sorcery) for money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a copy of the latest collection of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  by H. P. Lovecraft.   In the book, Lovecraft recounts his attempts to contact a Dr. Frankenstein who was supposedly murdered by his own creation, a man who looks like Dr.Jekyll but has the personality of Mr.Hyde.  In my opinion, this is the worst of all the Lovecraft's.  The author is just plain wrong about everything.  First of all, the book says that Dr. Hyde was Dr. Jacob Jekyl (Jekyl is a common name in England).  Also, it says that Jekyll is the first of two brothers, the other being Jacob.  This is false, as the name of the second brother, Hyde, is mentioned in the story (he's a character).  In any case, I think that it's a big mistake for Lovecraft to go with a story that is written by someone else, and to try to write a book about it.  I can only hope that Lovecraft will not do it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not really enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. I am really disappointed by the fact that the author tries to make the story about the relationship between a man and his daughter as if it were the relationship of two people who live in the same house. It isn't. This is a very sad book and really, you really want it to be about the dad's feelings but it doesn't work at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book. It had a lot of good ideas, but nothing that really clicked with me. It's really a good idea to read a good book, but not one that has the potential to be a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad.   It was hard to find a good book on the topic and this one was just awful.  I hate that the authors decided to use the term "brain drain" instead of "brain gain" and that it wasn't based on hard evidence.  It's just a myth that we lose people because they have better lives elsewhere.  If that was the case then China would have the best brains in the world and the U.S. would have to pay them to stay.  As for the claim that the US is losing the best and brightest from the U...well that's just plain wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but it took me a long time to finish it. I was hoping for more detail on the story's backstory, but that didn't happen.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read several books on "curing" cancer, but none have lived up to the hype I paid for. I read this book after I'd given up on other cancer treatments. The book was a waste of my money and time. I would never have bought it if I knew what I know now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book hoping it would be good. I didn't have high expectations for it.  It was mediocre at best.  I had to read the other reviewers reviews on Goodreads and my opinion is that the author is simply too inexperienced with publishing to be successful with a novel.  He wrote a story that was about a girl in high school who wanted to do something but didn't want to because she had no idea how to do it.  The author makes no attempt to explain why the girl was a bad role model for other kids to follow.  She is an awkward and unlikable character.   The main character is supposed to be a bad guy, but his motives and actions are completely selfish.  The author also tries to make a romance with the main character.    The main character does nothing to help her and even when she tries, it doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of John Scalzi's books, but I have to say that this book is a major let down. It's a sequel to the popular trilogy The Human Division (which I also read), but it feels like an adaption of the first book in the series. There's just so much more information in this book that didn't make it into the trilogy. The main character is basically an identical copy of the main character in the trilogy - only he's a little more likeable and a lot more sympathetic. The only good thing is that he gets some action in this one, but it's just a tiny little thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book. It's very poor in so many ways. I am an English major at the University of Oregon and am currently studying a history book on the Chinese, Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans. I was looking for a book on Asian Americans in the American Civil War and came across this one. I really wanted to like it but this book was just too poor to read. There is no character development, no history, no reason for the war, no real insight into the Japanese, and not enough information about the Chinese Americans. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that the main character is a "ditzy, annoying, ignorant, ignorant" person and that the whole book is about his struggles. But that's not how it is at all. The book is very informative, but the main characters is a ditzy character that I would have to learn a lot about to like him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a fan of this book at all, but I was forced to read it because it was the only book that could be ordered from my local bookstore.  It's a story about a young woman who becomes a witch, a witch who becomes obsessed with the devil, and who eventually realizes that the devil has been trying to get her for years.  I don't get how this author could come up with such a terrible story, but she did.  There is a lot of information in the first few chapters that seems to be missing from the book.  She tells us that witches "are always looking for something that doesn't exist."  The whole book seems to say, "I found a book about witchcraft that I believe in."    I really hope that someday the author can come up to speed on the science of witchcraft and realize that there is more to the story than just her finding a book that she believes in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a person with severe autism. His behavior is that of a child with a terrible disease. He is a loner who doesn't fit in at school or at home. His brother is very close to him and they talk about almost everything, except his illness. His diagnosis was a shock to me.   It is not a good book to read when you know there is a good alternative out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story, despite its flaws, is very intriguing and interesting. It has all the elements of a good story that you expect to find in a good book. But the main character is a complete and utter failure and I can't understand how a person could be so stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to get a better understanding of how to use your Kindle and to learn how to work with a Kindle that has not been used before.  The author describes her Kindle, which is a nice touch.  But I am still waiting to get my Kindle working with the book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book I'm glad I read but very disappointed in the book itself. It's a terrible, boring, overlong account of a very good book, but not in a bad way. I'm surprised it hasn't been recommended more often.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an amazing book about the history of the Christian Church in America. The author has done a fantastic job in writing a concise history of what happened to the Christian church in America and the impact that it has had on the world. However, he seems to have missed the fact that in the Christian world at the time of the first century there was no real Christianity. There was no Christ. There were no Apostles. There is no Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in the world today. This book is good for history lovers, but it really makes me wonder why Christians are so adamant about the "church" as a thing. I am glad that there is a book about it, but I wish it would have been a bit more honest about the church in the first centuries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of all the Stephen King books I've read but this one just didn't seem to click with me.  I enjoyed the stories but this was a slog to get through.  The characters were interesting but it just seemed to be a bunch of stuff about the characters that was done over and over again.  There's so much in the book to learn and it seems to take a while to find out what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with this book.   The characters were interesting, but the writing style seemed a bit too fast paced for my tastes.  The world building was a bit much and I'm sure a lot of people would like to have read more about it.  I'm going to be hard pressed to get into this series in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard so many great things about this book that I bought it with great enthusiasm.  I love the writing style and the way the author uses different historical figures to comment on their current role.  But as an historian I'm disappointed in the way it's told.   It's not the first time that this kind of thing has been done.  It takes the author to say things like:  "It is no exaggeration to say that the whole subject of war is a mystery to most historians."    This is like saying that the history of the United States is a big fat mystery.  We know more about the Civil War than we ever did about the Revolutionary War.  For the same reason, we know less about the French and Indian War than the Revolutionary.  And the same is true for the war against Spain.  The author makes a good point about how the Spanish-American War, the War of 1812, the American Civil War, and the War with Spain are all, in a way, the same war.  As he says in the final chapter:   War is not only a matter of victory and defeat; it is a question of the will and the willfulness of men.  War, as a means of settling differences, is no less a matter, then, of victory or defeat.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was young and it was awful.   As a child, I thought that all women who had children were   so miserable.  Now I see that they are   just as unhappy as the rest of us, but they have a very different   point of view about their   existence.  I really wish that some people had listened to my parents when they told me   not to have children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was recommended by someone I know.  It's not bad per se, but there are several glaring omissions:  First, a lot of the history about the early days of the American Revolution is quite bad (I'm thinking of the ridiculous tales of "Miles to Freedom" and the "Founding Fathers"  The "Mile to Freedom story" is the worst, since the author doesn't get that the British won the war in 1812 by getting Washington to sign a treaty giving up their Indian allies).  Second, there is not a word about the American Civil War    Finally, and most damning, the author has an agenda:  It is her personal desire to rewrite history, to make the American revolution seem like the work of a benevolent, Christian movement  She is also an anti-Semite, since she wants to rewrite the history of the "Jewish slave trade."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author is a complete moron and the writing is very sloppy and unprofessional. I'm glad that I didn't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think it's very important for teachers to know about the Bible. This book is a good resource for those who want to learn about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all.   It's a long, boring story about a woman who is constantly getting into trouble with men.  The story is about a man who thinks she's an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment. I didn't really like it and found the concept of "being a good person" rather silly.    A really good review by a good book: If you like the concept behind this book you will like it as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is good, but the story is not. I had high expectations about this book. This book was more of the same: it's supposed to be a good story, but it's a boring one. It's interesting to read about how someone who is a drug addict got into trouble by selling the same drugs to different people, but that's about it. It is possible that there are other ways of looking at the situation, but I wasn't interested in that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book. However, the author has some poor judgment. He begins with the statement:  "A woman was a very strong person in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."  He then continues:  "A woman is strong, strong enough to break the neck of a man and throw him over a bridge."  I don't know about that, but it's not very pretty.   He continues:   "The fact that women can do a man's job is a weakness of ours that the average man will never fully understand. It has always been so, but we were taught to believe it was a strength, and that is a problem.  I'm not trying to be rude about that point, but I would prefer it if our culture could be more honest about its own weaknesses.  This book is honest about that weakness.  The author's last point is the most important. He says:    "You can get a lot of strength from other people, but you can't get strength from yourself.  It's just not true.  If a woman can do the job, the man should do it."    He doesn't say that women should do the men's job, but he does say that a man should.  His point is that a woman's strength is a strength of a society, not an individual, so a woman who is strong should be a society.  That is why I give it 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very difficult to read. I could not get into the main story line because the characters just didn't add up. I think the author needs to have more experience writing characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so boring and poorly written that it made me realize why the majority of the people who've written bad books are never able to write a good one. It's so boring, you really can't tell if he's being sarcastic or just trying too hard to be edgy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought several of these but I have never been happy with the outcome.   My second attempt at a self-help book was disappointing.  It was a very good book but had a lot of bad advice.  The bad advice was not just about things you shouldn't do but also about things that you should do.  One thing that was not mentioned was that when you start reading about the negative effects of alcohol on your life it will be hard to read about how it has helped me become a happier person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to get this book.   It's a very interesting study of the history of "modern witchcraft" that was so popular in the 1970s.  It really makes you think about the difference between "real" witchcraft and the kind that was popular during that time.  I found it interesting, but not as compelling as I thought it would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a teenager (I'm almost 27 now). I was in high school at the time and a good friend of mine recommended it to me. The author describes in detail what it is like to be gay and I found the story fascinating. I loved the author's writing style, and the way he described the characters was very well done.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just so-so. There is no story, and there is no character development at all. The characters are all a bit bland, and the plot is just a bit of a chore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has so many bad ideas and so many factual errors that it becomes a waste of time. The book is a compilation of short essays written by different people, some of them famous.  Most of them are completely uninteresting.  This is not a bad compilation, but it is just so bad.  It is like reading a bunch of bad poetry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not only boring, but the author uses a lot of old-timey jargon that makes it difficult to understand.    The only reason this book is on my list is because the cover was so pretty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was very interesting and I really enjoyed the story, but there were so many glaring errors and holes in the story that I was almost tempted to throw it out.  The main problem was that the book's main character, Mrs. Beaumont, was a woman, not a man.  This is one of those stories where you can tell a woman was the original source, and the male characters just were copy-pasted into the story.  It also had some problems with the use of the word "pig."  There was no need to use that word in the novel because Mrs.  Beaumond  was not a pig, but rather a very attractive woman who had a great sense of humor and a great love of animals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was good, but the writing was awful. The author talks about how she was in the military and that she used to be a military officer, and how she would have loved to have served in Vietnam. However, she never actually served in the Vietnam War. She doesn't know what it was like to go through a war, because she never served in it. In fact, she doesn't even know what a military uniform is! She also talks about being married and having children in her 40s. The military was a good job, but she was just doing it because her husband was doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to read this book because of the good reviews. However,  this book is poorly written.  The author states she did not like to read books, but she is in love with this book and had to write about it.  She states her story is a good one.  However, there is so much wrong with it    That I would not recommend this book to anyone  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story of a group of young people that lived in a small town in Maine during the time of the American Civil War.   It was a bit too easy to be cynical about the characters and their motives, but I think it's a pretty interesting read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a Christmas present. It was written by a friend of my mother who is a medical professional.  The story is true.  I'm so sad I never had the opportunity to visit my Grandma who has lived in that neighborhood since she was young.  She still does.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed in this book. The author doesn't seem to understand the concept of "taste" as she says in her introduction:  "I don't like to have the taste of anything on my tongue for more than a minute, but this book tasted like nothing ". She doesn't explain why, but I assume that the smell of the book might have been the cause of her bad experience. I would have preferred something like "This book tasted funny" or something else that would make it less disgusting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very dry. The author doesn't care about the characters. The plot is not original and it has some weak plot twists. I didn't find it very funny. I don't think it was very well written either. The characters are not very memorable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of reading a book by a non-expert. The author is very experienced with the field but the book is very poor and the content is often misleading and just plain wrong. The book is full of false statements, half-truths, and non-sequiturs. The only thing I liked about the book was the references to other studies, but then the references often went on to say that the study the author is referencing did not actually show what it claimed it did. It was very frustrating reading a textbook and having to figure out what it really meant.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had this book for several years now and I keep buying it because it is so good.   The story is good and the characters are real.  I just wish the plot didn't get so tangled up with a bunch of other characters, and then ended with a cliffhanger that the author didn't bother to resolve. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has several problems.  First, the book is a collection of essays by people who write about their negative experiences with pornography.  Second, the author claims that pornography is the cause of most of the problems she has with men.  Third, it seems like the author is trying to justify the consumption of pornography in general.   It is a very poor book, I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.  The main character, the protagonist, is supposed to be a good guy, a moral person, and a loving family man.  Instead, he's a rapist and a murderer.  This book makes me think about my own life, when my mother's boyfriend was also a rapist, and she tried to run him out of town.  It makes me realize how hard it is to be true to yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about the book is that the author claims to have "a PhD in 'the psychology of learning'." She's clearly an MD who has never read any psychology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The premise is very well thought out and the plot is well executed.  It is unfortunate that the ending is a little too predictable and that the story is a bit too much like a cross between a "Dune" and "The Handmaid's Tale."  The characters are just bland.  This is a very poor novel and I would not recommend it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my daughter, but after reading the first few pages I found myself wishing I'd bought the "Moral Animal" series instead.    The book is not only badly written, but it is so filled with moralistic platitudes that I found it very hard to get into.  I know that the author is a trained psychologist, but that does not excuse this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most boring book I have ever read. The writing is horrible and the author can't even make a sentence clear enough to understand what he's saying.  I feel like I've been reading the same book over and over again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot of this book is interesting and the characters interesting, but the plot itself is not.   It starts out interesting enough, with a mystery of a missing piece of a puzzle, but then it becomes a tedious and boring read.  The mystery was interesting because it could be the missing piece, but by the end it wasn't.  I hope I didn't ruin the mystery for anyone else by being too negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book about the most terrible human beings in history. There is not a lot of discussion about the history of the slave trade, but there is a lot about the human misery of Africans being sold in ships and brought to the New World. A good book about what happened to the poor, and the way the English and French people dealt with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not an enjoyable book to read. I found it very tedious, very tedious. There are so many pages of nothing but a list of what I could have done better. The book does make it clear that the author has an ulterior motive, and that she's not in a good place emotionally or mentally, but that doesn't stop her from trying to make a case for it. I could understand why a book like this would appeal to a specific kind of person. However, it is very hard for me to read about something that I feel strongly about and then have the author make it seem like I don't have anything positive to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be the least interesting of all the biographies I've read about the men who were part of the Nazi Party's secret police. It is full of historical inaccuracies, which is not surprising since this is the story of how a lot of people found out about Hitler's secret organization through the media and then used that information to get themselves into jail.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most disappointing book I have ever read. It is filled with false claims, false facts and is an extremely biased and biased book. I could have used more information about the science involved in the creation/evolution debate. For instance: I was very confused about why the Genesis 1:1-2:3-4:5-6:7 is not in the Bible and was looking forward to reading the book of Moses. The book of Genesis is the story of the creation of man and it is a part of the Bible. However, it is missing from the Bible in the KJV and in many other translations. This is not a scientific argument but a historical argument. The Bible is the only book in the world that contains all the information on all the different theories of how the universe was created. For those that still believe in a creation/Evolution debate this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a fan of sci-fi books and want to read a good one this one is a great one.   It's an action packed book that you will not be disappointed with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time.  It tells us a lot about how a modern civilization has become the center of so many wars, yet it fails to mention that there is a fundamental problem with all war: it is very expensive.  If we don't want to go to war we have to come up with a better way to spend our money, and we haven't.  We need to rethink the relationship between war and the economy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing good about this book is the cover.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book very much, but I had no idea what it was about when I started it.    I'm a big fan of the series, but this is the first one I've seen where the characters actually seem to be living the way they wanted to live. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on a whim when I was looking for something that would explain the strange phenomenon of people "turning themselves into chickens" (which I have experienced too). I have been looking for a book that would give me some of the answers to my questions. The book was well written, but I found that the explanations seemed to have been taken from a video game or the internet, and I was not very impressed with the whole "chicken" thing. It seemed to me that it was more about people turning into chickens than anything else. I was more interested in how one can live a long time in a small space, or what it is that makes a person's hair stand on end. This book just did not seem to be that useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in high school because I thought it would be fun to read a history of the Holocaust that didn't focus on the Jewish people. I was wrong. It is very disjointed and very boring. I would recommend this book only to people who are in it for the "chosen ones" aspect.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried this before and not much has changed. This is a book about how a young child can be abused by a parent, and it is written so poorly that you wonder if the author has ever been a parent. I had high hopes for this book. I'm very glad I didn't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really boring book about a young man who goes around telling people how he "taught himself how to be a wizard". It's a really bad book, but it is written in a very interesting way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had just finished reading the first half of this book and was eagerly anticipating the conclusion.    It's the only book I've ever read that was so clearly written for an audience other than itself that I had to stop reading and take a break.  This book's goal is to entertain people by having them laugh at the stupidity of others.  Unfortunately, there is so much stupidity in the book that I didn't feel like I was being entertained at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's very hard to describe a book like this as a positive review. It's so easy to describe it as a negative one.   This book is really bad.  This is one of those "this book is so bad it's good" type of books.  I was looking forward to reading a good book about an important subject.  Instead, I got a bad, biased book that doesn't seem to be based in reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've tried several times to read this book, but I have always been unable to get through it. The characters are so unrealistic and the setting so unbelievable that the story seems to be written in a style of the late 19th century.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book after being intrigued by the cover and then finding out the book is full of errors and misrepresentations.   The author has tried to use "alternative" history as a way to present his "political" beliefs, and while that might be entertaining for some people, it isn't a legitimate method.  The authors claim that Lincoln's "political beliefs" had nothing to do with his decisions about the Civil War.  He just happened to have a different view than the majority on certain issues.  It seems odd that Lincoln, who opposed slavery, would support it in certain circumstances.  I also find it odd that he would support abolitionist politicians like Henry Ward Beecher who were strongly anti-slavery.  These are just some of the many errors in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a lot of promise, but ends up being rather dull and uninspired.   It has a good plot, but the ending is disappointing.  It's not bad in the sense that I don't like it, but it's a little disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a bad novel by any means. It's good but not great, and the ending is unsatisfying.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. I thought it was going to be a good book, but this book is way too confusing and the end result is that I just don't get the meaning behind some of the things the author is trying to say. I guess the purpose of the book is to show how to create a story that is compelling and interesting but I just couldn't get past the story of how a boy with a gun went missing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a big fan of the first book in this series, but    the new book just doesn't do it for me.   It has a lot more   cliche   "fairy tales" than   that book did,   but  it's just so   repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know if I'll ever be able to read a book as good as this again, and it's because the writing is so excellent. The story and characters are well done.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry but I'm done with this book.    It's a series of short stories that doesn't have anything that stands out or gets your imagination going. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a collection of poorly researched, badly written, badly worded rants about people's problems. If you don't have any problems, you won't be affected by these rants. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of good ideas, but the writing is just bad.   It is not clear at all who these people are or what they do.  It does not make any sense to me, why they are in the room at the same time.  I don't like to talk about other people's work but I just think that a lot of the ideas are good, but just too poorly presented. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to believe that this book is more than 200 pages long. It's a good read but it's not as good as the reviews say.   I got tired of reading about what I already knew, or why it was so important to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't recommend this book highly enough, and I don't think I will be reading another YA fantasy book from this author. The story is well written and interesting, but the characters are just awful. The characters seem to be based off a bunch of stereotypical white people who just happen to be bad people.  The writing style is awkward at times, but I suppose that is inevitable when writing about people from the '80s.  There is one character who is so stereotypically bad, I can only imagine how awful his childhood must have been.  He's the main reason that I can never understand how a black person can be so good at basketball.  Overall, this book was just a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time.  The whole point of reading this book is to understand the concepts of differential geometry, but the author goes out of his way to make this very hard to understand.  It is not clear to me how a book about differential geometry could not be more clear about how differential geometry is used in physics.  This is especially so in the sections on the special functions of linear systems.  I suspect the author wants to convince us that differential geometry makes sense in physics but it does not.  Perhaps the author should start learning about differential equations from the beginning, and not waste his time on this silly book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. The plot was too contrived to be interesting and the characters were so shallow that I was bored to tears by the end. The characters who are supposed to be so important have no depth and only exist to be used. I really liked the main character but she was never able to make me like her. I'm not going to recommend this book but I don't think you can make it through a book about a child and not get disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in high school as a history class assignment. I got a B- because of my poor memory. The only thing that bothered me about the book was that it was written by a white man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that the author has a sense of humor about the whole thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had a bad experience with the author.  I really liked the idea of the book, but after finishing it, I realized the author was completely wrong about a lot of the things he was saying.  For instance, he is talking about the "inverted pyramid" of the social sciences.  The "inversion" is only a function of the fact that a number of the topics that are discussed are of interest to the social and economic sciences.   For instance:  The Social Sciences  and the Physical Sciences   (a.k.a. "The Social" )      (I'm paraphrasing here)       There is a difference between the two.   They are both based on "Social Constructs".   Social Constructs are a sort of "true belief" which can be changed if you put in the time and effort.  In other words, it can be "invisible" to a "natural" scientist.  (I've noticed a lot more "natural scientists" lately.)   You can also "invert" this concept to create a different type of "scientific" consensus:  If you think about it, the world is made up of many different types of "social construct"   (for instance, "The Physical Sciences" ).   The social sciences, on the other hand, are based on  "Natural Sciences".  If a natural scientist were to look at the world, he would see the "Social Sciences" as the main component of the world.  But, the "Natural Science" is a "supernatural" thing.  This is why you see a lot "naturalists" in the social science world (like  Einstein,  Freud, etc.)  but not so many "natural-scientists" (like Newton,  Leibniz, etc.).  In fact, "the social sciences" is the same as "the natural sciences"  (or the "physical sciences" )   in the sense that they are based upon  "natural belief" .  And the "natural scientific consensus" (the "super-scientific consensus") is based upon that "natural disbelief".  The book also said that the natural sciences are not limited to  "Physical Sciences" (although I would argue that the physical sciences is really only the physical part of the "Physical" sciences).  It also said (and I
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was skeptical about this book until I got to the end.   It had a lot of information and a lot that I didn't know.  The story of his childhood is compelling.  I learned a lot about the things he loved most about life.  He's a very nice guy and a good father. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting book that will be well worth reading if you have the time. It does have a lot of useful information but the subject matter is too general for my liking.  The problem is that the author seems to have an agenda.  He is pushing his own agenda by writing a book about the "secular humanist" movement and is trying to portray the movement as one of the good guys (even though it's not the good guy that I know).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of this book is filled with a lot of self-referential "this is my theory about..." nonsense that I just can't get my head around.  I know that this is supposed to be a historical work about the early Christian church but the way that it is written is like the writer is sitting in his kitchen going "yeah this is my way of explaining it...  but it's really the same thing!"  So, while I'm at it, let me say that the whole idea of Jesus as a Jewish messiah is a total non-sequitur to me... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is interesting, but is not the best thing I've ever read. It's very technical, but that's okay because the subject is really interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it was a funny book about the life of a bad boy.  I was wrong!  It's so bad that it makes me feel sorry for the author and his poor writing.  The main character is a complete idiot and the only reason he has a job is to help people like him get laid.  And the woman he sleeps with is so unattractive that she makes a man like me cry.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very long and tedious book. It is extremely frustrating to read a good book and find it to be poorly written.  The main reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does give some very interesting ideas.  It's not my favorite book, but it is worth reading and I would like to read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a little boy who has a very strange, almost magical talent. His parents are the most religious people in their town, and he's a good child and a good student. But one day they tell him to pray and he starts making noises. His father says that the sound is an evil spirit, and it needs to be put away.   I'm sure this is a common experience.  But to have that ability, and not know it's a gift.  I guess I just wish my parents were more religious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in my university library when it was in its original hardcover.  It was one of the first non-fiction books I ever read, and it's one of those books that just stays with you.  The writing was just...well, good.  This is a book that was written to be read.  There are some really interesting topics covered, but the writing isn't perfect.  I wouldn't want to have to do a re-read of it every few years to keep up with it.  So if you don't like the topic or the way the book is written, it's definitely a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is very good, but the book is not. I read this book in preparation for my book about the 9/11 attacks.   It is so poorly written, that even the title is misleading: "The Terrorist Next Door: The Secret Life of an American Spymaster".   If you want to know how the 9-11 attacks were planned and executed, this book is useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not good. It was a lot of fun reading about a book written by a writer who doesn't seem to have any interest in literature.   The characters are very simplistic and the book itself is very predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute train wreck. This book should be in the trashcan and never used again. The first time I heard about this book was in a book club I was in.  I was horrified at the terrible writing, terrible story line, and bad grammar in this book.  The plot is horrible as well.    I can only imagine how many kids would enjoy this book, but they won't.  This is the worst book ever written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read two of this author's novels (I am a long time fan), and this is the worst yet. The story is a train wreck that should never have been published, and is a bad example of how to write a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been waiting for this book to come out for a while now and I finally got my hands on it.   It is not a bad story by any means.  It was a good read.  I did enjoy it but I do think that it would have been better if the story was about a little girl that is a bit older than the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last three chapters are so bad I just want to throw the book away.  I read the first two chapters thinking that this would be a good book to read if I wanted to learn more about the LDS Church.  It really didn't help that the author made some statements that are not supported by the evidence.  There are other books that could be used to answer this type of question.  As for the Book of Mormon, there is no way that Joseph Smith could have translated it without being influenced by the gold plates. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book when I saw a rave review about it on Goodreads.  It wasn't until I read it that I realized that I'd be wasting my time reading it.  The writing is terrible.   The plot is terrible.  The story is poorly done.  There's no plot at all.  I just wanted to throw it across the room.  So, yeah, I would avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but it's not a very good one.  It is a very bad and confusing book.  The author makes the argument that women in medieval times were more respected in the military, and therefore they were allowed to marry.  This is not only wrong, but also very confusing.  In the Middle Ages women did not have the rights to make their own decisions.  They could not own property, vote, or even get into positions of power in the church.  Instead, they had to be given the honor of marriage.  She also argues that women could only have one husband at a time.   I don't know how she is arguing this, but she does not seem to understand the medieval system of family law.  Maybe she should read up on the law, because her point seems to be that it was better to marry a man from the military than a woman.  I just don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book on a "free" CD that comes with a book. The CD is good but I really hate the CD player. I can't use it to play my mp3 files and it only has one song. The book is fine. It was just a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story of the three brothers who built a new house is great, but the author doesn't seem to understand what they were trying to do. I had to read it three times to get it right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the best thing I have ever read about how to create a better quality book. It is a must read for any self-respecting book editor. The book is also available for free at the author's web site.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping to like this book, but I just can't. I am a professional who has a hard time working with people who don't know how to work. The author did not impress me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first chapter is not really about the main character (a professor who has a habit of telling lies) but about a character in the previous book who also has a lying habit (this one a doctor who keeps trying to convince people he's not a fraud but it doesn't work). It seems that it was decided early on that the main characters would be a liar who is a doctor and a liar (who doesn't actually know he's a doctor). The next few chapters are devoted to trying to get the main person to admit that he's lying but he keeps saying he's telling the truth. The final chapter is about him finally admitting that he knows he's wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad I bought this book for my son. The author gives an overview of the major theories of evolution: natural selection, the common descent of species, and the gradualistic theories. However, in spite of the great research that went into the writing, the author has a tendency to jump from one point to the next. For example, he says that we should accept that all animals are vegetarians because they are the only ones that can digest cellulose. I can't believe I have to type that. But he is correct that all organisms can digest fibrous foodstuffs like cellulose and lignin. In fact, the digestive enzymes that do the work of digesting cellulose are the same enzymes that we use to digest celluloid, plastic, and other non-food plant materials. If you want to digest food, you have to use enzymes that are specific to your diet. And if you don't, you're going to have to start eating some animal products.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm glad I read this, but I couldn't give it 5 stars. It's just too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is a mess. This book is just as good as the last. The story does not take place in the future. It's a time travel story. So the characters have to go back to the past to change a past event. So they travel back in time to kill someone that is still alive in the present. The end result is an over the top ending that just doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. It was a good, entertaining read. It made me laugh out loud many times. The story was very interesting and the ending made me want to continue reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of YA books. This one did not have that feeling. I don't understand why anyone would want to read a book that doesn't make me feel anything. It was so hard to put down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written in an effort to convince readers that the Bible is a good book and that the Christian religion is good. It is not.   There is little historical information in the book, which is interesting but not worth the time to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only wrong but boring. The author has some good ideas but is a horrible writer. She is clearly a bad writer. The subject is interesting but she does a bad job of explaining the basic concepts.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like books where you have to do a lot of reading to understand anything. This is just like that. If I'd read a little more, I'd have learned something.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book as it has been on my to read list for a while now, and it was the first one to actually make me want to pick it up and read it.  However, the book was so bad that I never finished it, and ended up just reading some of the reviews.  This book was basically about a guy who tried to get into the film industry and got his foot in the door.  The book is about the time he went to Hollywood to get his foot put into the door, and how he failed to realize that he couldn't work in Hollywood.  It was a really terrible book.  I'm sure that many people who read it will think that the author is right, and that I'm a terrible person for thinking that I was ready for Hollywood.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger was a wasted opportunity. I bought it hoping for a solid novel with a well-developed world. Instead I got a slog with an overused plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book, but the ending left me unsatisfied.  This is a great story that is set in a very believable world.  The main characters seem real.  Unfortunately, I was not convinced that they had any good in them, and I had to wonder if they were just a ploy by the author to create more money.  I am sure the author will find a way to write more interesting characters in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a compilation of "The most boring books ever" from a certain period of time. I've read it and I have to agree. It is basically a collection of boring old stories and no new ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those that I am forced to buy and read.  I can't find anything bad to say about it.  As I've read many other works by Dr. Schacter, I find the ideas to be compelling and very useful in my practice.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most pathetic thing  I have ever read.  It is so pathetic that  even  when  I tried to read it, I just couldn't  get through it.   It has the same  flaws  in it that I see in  this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the kind of book that was too good to be true. The author's idea of a story was so amazing and exciting, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  It's a story about a kid who had to deal with a family member's murder, the consequences of which had a devastating effect on his family.  There's a little bit of romance and a lot of dark drama that makes this a great read.  I can't wait for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story of how I fell for a book I was told was a good read (that I didn't like) was amazing to me. I was so impressed I read it twice in one day and have been looking forward to reading more about it.  I have now finished it and am thinking of purchasing the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't normally enjoy romance, but I was enticed by the cover and got this book pretty quickly. I didn't like the first book. It was kind of confusing and had a plot that just seemed to have no place in a romance.  It also made me think that it was just a good book, but not as good as the first.  I'm happy I gave it a shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.    As a professional scientist and educator, I am always searching for good, science-based information.  However, in this case I felt that the authors failed to present science in a clear and concise way.  I think the main reason for this is that they are both very conservative.  They both have strong religious views, and I felt like they tried to convince me that science is always right.  It's a shame that they chose to use the Bible as their main source of science information.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book a few times, and I can't believe I bought it.  I know I'm supposed to read the synopsis at the back of the book, but I just can't get past the name, "Bud" (I think that's the name of the dog).    He's got no personality at all.   I was thinking about writing a negative Review of this book,   but then I thought about this review,  and I think,  "If I can review this book in a negative light,  then why can't I review it in a positive light?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete joke. I love science, but this book has no place in my life. It was just a little too "cool" for my taste, and too "unrealistic" for me. I am not a fan of science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several other books by this author.   He is a good writer but has a tendency to write things that he thinks are funny.  I'm not laughing but he makes a funny point in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a Christmas gift for a friend and I was so disappointed. The protagonist is such a shallow, self-centered person that I couldn't help but be annoyed by her.    She is a total idiot who is always doing the stupidest things, but doesn't realize she's doing it.  There are some good ideas in the book, but the author never takes the time to develop them.  She also seems to be a big fan of the 80's movies and her own work.  I'm going to read a different book from her soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total waste of space. I can only get one chapter on what's wrong with the movie. If that's all the movie is about, then I can't see why it is a must-see movie.  It's just another lame movie that is trying to capitalize on a well-known movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a man who is a bit of a loser.  I have read a lot of books about "good guys" and "bad guys" but not like this one.  He is a man that doesn't like being treated badly by anyone.  This is a guy that is "always right" but he is "never wrong."  His "good side" is not as great as he makes it out to be but he "never gives up."  This guy is just the type that just can't seem to get it together.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it had "good reviews" but I didn't read any reviews so I was very disappointed.  I had a hard time understanding the text and I found it very hard to follow.  It's very hard for me to find good writing in books because I'm a visual person.  This book really sucked me in and it got me very excited to find more good books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a good book called, "The Dark Side" by Joseph M. Farrell in high school. The story of a child psychologist is a little too creepy for me, but the plot is very good and there is lots of psychological depth.  This book, "Pretense," by David E. Smith is a bit less interesting.  I don't get the main characters in this one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book. The plot is interesting, but it is so badly written it's ridiculous.   The first chapter, for example, is about the protagonist, a college student who goes to her university's campus rape center and finds out that a lot of the women who were raped in college don't report it because the man they went to the campus with didn't seem that bad of a guy.  I'd say that's a pretty strong indicator that the rape culture exists, but that is really all that the writer has to go on.  The second chapter, however, is where the writer really drops the ball.  She tries to set up the next part of the book with a few sentences about how a lot men don't act like rapists, but doesn't go into much detail.  In fact, the next paragraph just says that she's a victim herself:  I don't know if he's ever done anything bad to me.  Maybe I'm just overly sensitive.  But he's never made me feel like that before.  And he was always polite.  Even the time he shoved his finger in my butt.  He never did anything that felt bad.  That's how it was supposed to be, I suppose.  Now I don'   really know if I'm wrong or right.  Or if he was ever good at making me feel good.  (She also implies that he's been raping women for years.  ) But I really don't want to get married to him.  It would be so much easier to just stay at home and watch TV.  At least he's not a terrible husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I had to work with a man who was a former Marine. I had not heard of him before, but I was interested to see if the author's book would have any real impact on the subject of the book: the Iraq war.   The author is a Navy veteran, and I'm sure that his book will give the readers a good picture of what life is like for those who serve.  But it didn't really have any impact on me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book I bought it, but I didn't get it because it was so poorly written that I had to go back and read it again to make sure I'd gotten it right the first time.  I would like to have seen a better ending and better characterization.  This book is just a bunch of boring old cliches.  It's not a good book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an incredibly boring book. It's a "mystery" book about a man who has a strange compulsion to write about people who have been murdered. It seems like it would be very interesting to know the killer, but he doesn't know it and the reader never gets to find out what the killer is after. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. This is one of those books that just reads like it was written by a 6th grade English teacher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that kept me from giving this book a negative star was the fact that the author, Michael P. Carroll, does a bad job of explaining the differences between English and American English grammar.  I'm an English major, and I'm pretty good at it.  But the grammar errors in this book make it very difficult to understand what he is trying to say.   It's also hard to believe that he had such trouble explaining a sentence like "The only way to stop a bad idea is to make it good".  I found this book very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am writing a negative reviews about a book I have not read.   It's not bad per se, but I just couldn't understand it.  It is not so much about the "big picture" as it is about the characters.  The main character is a very good one, but is very lacking in personality.  He is very passive, and he is not very likable.  His love for a man who is not there to love him is so much more believable than the love he had for the woman who was.  What I liked about this book was the idea that all of life is about relationships.  I think the author really did a good job with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and it was just not that good. It was very repetitive and not very interesting. I don't want to read a book about the war on drugs because I can't stand drug users. But I would not have minded reading about it because it is an interesting story and I wanted to know what happened to the kids who died in Vietnam. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it was just as bad as the other three I've bought. The main character (he doesn't seem to be a very likable person) is a total asshole. He's a very well-meaning but totally clueless person. He can't seem or even want to learn a thing about anything that is not directly related to his own business (he's the owner of a huge clothing company). He is totally clueless about anything. He has no concept of what a professional is. He makes the mistake of using his own name in his business name and calls himself "Mr. L". He's just not very likABLE. The ending was also pretty lame. I just wanted to leave it there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. I really did.   The main characters were interesting, and the worldbuilding was interesting.  But the characters didn't like each other.  The author seemed to be writing a love story between two people, not an intimate relationship between a male character and a female character.  I was so frustrated by the book that I just put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I've ever read.   I had never heard of it until I stumbled across it while perusing the "great reads" section at a bookstore a couple months ago.  The book has been covered a bit, but the main problem is that it's a really, really bad book.  It's about a group of people who go to a country club to watch a golf tournament.  These people are in their early twenties, and they all seem to be a bit immature.  One of the members is a bit of a douchebag.  His best friend is a rich girl, and she's a good friend of his.  They're all friends in a group that seems to think they're "special."   The other members are all pretty cool, but they don't seem to get it.  There are also some other people who are "cool" but aren't particularly nice.  This is the kind of group that gets drunk at the country club and start throwing up, and then end up having sex in the showers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those "dumbing down" books that really only teaches things we already know. For example, if you are a newbie, you need to know how to write a good summary of a long paper.  There are a lot of other things you should know about writing a good paper, but this is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I read the first one in 1997, and then a few years later picked up the second one, The Gathering Storm.   I loved the series, and the books had some nice bits.  I've only ever read the books in the order they were published, though.  The second book, which was published a couple years later, is a mess.  There is a ton of material in this book that I've not read yet, which is a shame because I enjoyed it a lot.  Also, the author's notes at the end of the book are just not worth it.  All in all, I was a bit let down by this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a complete waste of time and effort to listen to someone talk about how they were born bad at things they are bad at.  The worst part about it is how easy it is to be bad at something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series.   The first book is great, but after that, the series has been downhill.  The second book was horrible.  I'm not saying that it's a bad novel, just that I found it too boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible mistake that is made in this day and age. It's a book about a girl who is about to leave the convent, who has been in a very bad relationship with the priest for many years, and who's boyfriend is a serial philanderer. She ends up in a terrible situation because of his actions, but her father does nothing. She gets a new job at a convent. She is still in a bad relationship, but she can't go there because she is Catholic. So, her boyfriend gets a job there too, and they go back to their old ways.  This is a bad example because the father doesn't care that his daughter is in a relationship with a priest. He is still married to the mother, so he can't be happy about that, but he still can't get rid of his daughter's boyfriend.  The mother is a great example because she was so happy about her daughter getting a job, but that's only because she knew that her daughter was in a good situation.  I wish I could say that I learned a valuable lesson from this book, but the truth is, this book is just another example of how people are just looking for easy solutions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on the strength of the blurb.   It was very poorly written,   was full of inaccuracies,  and the author made no effort to show the source material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about reading this book because it was a book about the occult. I am not into occult things, but I like books about them. I had heard about this book for a while but never got around to it. This book was a bit of a let down for me.   This is a book that claims to tell us the history of the ancient Egyptian religion and it doesn't.  I got the feeling that this book was written by a student who was trying to prove that he was right about something.  This book does not tell us anything about the ancient Egyptians.  It also has nothing to say about how the ancient religions were related to each other.  So, to sum up, this book is just a bunch of people talking about a bunch more people who did not give a fuck about the subject at hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't get into this book because it's so badly written. I found myself constantly having to re-read certain sections just to make sure I was reading correctly.  The characters are not very well written either, and are poorly written in general.  This is not a good book for children, but if you're a parent and you don't like children, it's not going to be a good read either.  It's just a bad, terrible book, that's all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was boring and not interesting at all.   I'm sure the author wanted to get some "bad" reviews, but it doesn't seem to have worked out that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book on the topic of "mental illness." I'm a psychiatrist who has been doing psychotherapy for more than 30 years and have always been interested in the topic. This is a really good book that covers a lot of ground. I've enjoyed the book so far.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed to find that this was a first edition of a book by an author I'd already read. It seemed like an early draft, not a final product.   It was the same with my recent (in the sense of being finished but still not ready to be released) reading of The Three Musketeers:    it seemed to me as if someone had already finished writing it, but was waiting for the right time to publish it.  I'd love to see a revised edition of this book with a few additions and a few revisions to the text.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book. I don't know why I waited so long to read it. I've read some very good ones in the past, but never anything as good as this. I can't wait to read the sequels, which are coming out soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book about a very interesting man. However, I feel it does not really capture his greatness. There are so many wonderful stories about him in the book, but the way the author depicts him in it is pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of "hard" science fiction, but "The Man Who Sold the Moon" is a very bad hard science fiction book. I would never go to a sci-fi convention or a convention in general just to read such a bad sci-fie, and I was quite disappointed that the author had not at least done the same for "Alien".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book, as I've been looking forward a few books to read this year (I've already read the last two).    I'm not sure what I expected, but I'm glad I didn't expect it to be so boring.   The main character, Dr. Benesch, is so clearly trying to be a good doctor, and is so self-conscious about it.  He has to constantly remind himself that he's a good person.  It's the first book that I've read that made me think I was going to like a doctor.  That said, it's definitely not a bad novel, just not my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very bad book. This is the first time I have had any problems with this publisher, which is the third time I bought this title.  The writing is terrible, the story is just as bad.  I have no idea how it got published.  It seems like a book from a teenager's book club.  This book was so bad I had to keep re-reading it, even after I had bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that are so bad it's good.   It's just a bunch of stuff about things that happened and that I didn't really care about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's bad enough that it was rejected by the New York Times Book Review for being "too negative."  But they rejected it as a negative book, too.   It was too negative.  It made me wonder if the New Yorker would reject a book too negative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time, not worth the money. There is no plot or anything like that.  It's more like a collection of people talking about how much they hate each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is a bit of a let down. I found myself skipping a lot of the chapters as I just wanted to get to the good parts. The main character is a rather lame one, with his own problems but a strong drive to be the best. I'd love to see a good romance novel with a decent protagonist but this one just doesn't do it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a fan of the "dark" fantasy genre. I can see how this book could be interesting, but I can't get past the fact that there is nothing "dark". The magic system is boring, the world building is poorly done, the characters are predictable, and the plot is convoluted and not all that interesting. If you like your fantasy gritty and gritty and grim, then by all means read this book. It is not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that's just so bad, I can't believe it's actually written.  It's bad for several reasons:  the characters are flat, the plot is stupid, and the writing is bad.    The worst part is that I actually like the characters!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book several times but I've never really understood why the author would write it in such a way as it does.    The plot is not interesting at all, there are not enough characters, the dialogue is very stiff and unrealistic.  This is the third time I've listened to this, the last one (the first time I listened to it) I actually listened to the book to understand the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so glad that I found this book!  It is not only an entertaining read but it has some really great tips on how to deal with difficult people and not let them get under your skin.  It's funny as hell and I highly recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really sorry I bought this book.  I was looking forward to reading it and then I found out that it is not a good book, it was a poor book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never been a fan of horror books.    I read this one because I was told about it by a friend.  I did not enjoy the story at all.  It just seemed to be about some guy trying to get laid.  Maybe it's because I'm not a very good lover, but the book didn't turn out to be a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I needed to learn more about the history of the "Great Leap Forward" and so was happy to find this book on the shelf at the library.  I did learn a lot about this history and was glad to see it referenced in other places but found this book lacking in depth.  The fact that Mao used Soviet technology to build these rocket systems is interesting but it doesn't change the fact that he was using the Soviet system for the same thing that he said the Soviet Union was working on.  It also is interesting that he went from a system that required large amounts of metal to a system made of plastic that used less metal but also required more people.  This isn't to say that there isn't value in the Soviet model or that Mao was wrong to use the Soviet technology but the value in his use of the Soviet program to build his rockets is much less than the value that the Soviets offered him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that the author clearly has a lot of knowledge on the subject. I got the gist of it, but I was unable to follow it to its logical conclusions.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book.  I'm sure most of us have been on that bookish path that seems to go straight to the bathroom on the way to work.  It is a good book that is written in an entertaining and readable style.  But  the story is very thin and there is not enough of it.  The ending does not really come close to a satisfying conclusion.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very disappointing book. The author claims to have studied the history of "possible solutions" to the "Ponzi" fraud (and other frauds) of the 1930's but fails to provide a single source for any of these possible solutions. He says the only reason it is a problem is that no one "could imagine it". This is just not true. The idea of a Ponzi scheme being fixed is very common in American history, including many people from the 1800's. It is even used as the basis for a book by a major author on this topic (I read it years ago). It is common to suggest that the government can fix these problems. There are many people who believe this is possible and even possible that it could be done in the US. The problem with this theory is that it is not even true (I could go on but it's pretty clear what is wrong). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read.  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book.  It's a complete waste of time and effort.  If you have a good memory, you can get the gist of what is going on in the book.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book for people who enjoy reading about horror or horror movies. The book is about a couple, who are not good people. There is little suspense, and I thought they would be able to find a way out of the situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about this book when I found it at a library sale, but it turned out to be a total dud. I can't say I was too disappointed. It was supposed to be about the first book of the series and that was it, but the book was so confusing and full of spelling mistakes and typos that I gave up reading it. It's an interesting idea, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of John Brunner's work, but this book is so bad it makes me cringe. The main character, Ben, is a total douchebag. He's also the one who thinks that the movie, "The Exorcist," is a good movie. The first book in the series, "Ghost Dog," was a great book. This one is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is poorly written, and as a result the story is terrible.   It takes me a couple of chapters to understand the point of the book.  I have seen many movies based on books and they always seem to make the plot work, but not this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not have a lot of historical value.  It's just a lot more of the same.  I read this book to learn about the life of a slave trader and the many ways that he exploited black people.   I was disappointed in this book.      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disaster. I don't even know what to say about it. I loved it when it was first published. But it is now just a joke. It is like they wanted to sell a comic book but couldn't find anyone that could write it in a way that would be funny. I'm sorry that I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading this book for a long time now and am at a loss to find the time to finish it. The book is full of historical errors and distortions that should be ignored or refuted by any serious history student. This book is not a serious history book, but a history book that wants to make you believe that the American Revolution was caused by the "evil" of slavery. The truth is the "pro-slavery" colonists and the "anti-southern" colonists were on opposite sides of the Civil War. I am glad that this book has been debunked in recent years but I am sad that it is not the last time this book will be read and taught as an accepted historical fact.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most interesting part of the book is the section on how to make a real-life, non-fiction book about a historical figure (Hoover, Truman, Gandhi, etc) in a fictional setting (The Truman Show).  It would have been much more interesting if this section had actually been written by a Truman Show expert. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a good book, but it does nothing to convince me that there is no god. I have a high opinion of Mr. Paley and his other works, but I cannot accept his conclusions about evolution, for example. I am also very uncomfortable with his idea that "there is no God, only the devil" as he puts it in this book. I think it is very unlikely that the "devil" is simply the devil as he has written it in his book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't get into this book, even though I am a huge fan of science fiction.  First of all, it's set in the year 2410, not in 2045, which seems like an unnecessary step.    Second of all it's very, very long.  Third of all the characters are extremely shallow, and the plot is basically just that: a plot.  Fourth of all there are some very bad typos, especially when the author has to spell things out.  Fifth of all I don't think the author even realizes what he's writing is a sci-fi novel.  That said, this is a good book, and it's certainly not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book but the whole book seemed to be about the author's relationship with his mother, as if the author was trying to make his mother feel bad about something she did.   Her negative reaction to him is never mentioned and she was always very supportive of him.  I mean, I love my mother too much, but she doesn't do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is a good, but immature person. The plot doesn't make much sense and is so far from being original that I'm not even sure it was meant to be an adult book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm just going to say it, the only positive thing about this book is that the authors know how to make a good first impression.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book that should never have been published. The first two pages are a little amusing, but then they fall into a very serious mode: "The most disturbing, horrible thing about the whole affair is that it had to happen to us." This is an adult novel about a man who is abused as a child by his father, but is eventually able to leave him. But the author tries to make it seem like the abuse was the only bad thing that ever happened to him. The book starts off strong, but eventually, after a lot of telling and no showing, it gets dull and tedious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not good.  The writing style is very off, but it is supposed to be set in the Victorian Era.   This is supposed be a historical novel set in Victorian England and is not.  It is full of spelling and grammatical errors.  I had to look up the word "gibberish" to get to the point.  This does not help the book's credibility, but is still a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment.   It was supposed to be about how to get out of a bad relationship with a girl.  This is not the case.  Instead, it is about the ways of manipulating others to get what you want, and it is filled with a lot of bad examples.  I really don't understand why anyone would buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to get a copy of this, because it was supposed to be a book that would change the way people think about the Second World War. The first part is pretty good. It does a good job of laying out the case for why the American soldiers were so ineffective, so hopelessly outgunned. The second part is a lot more interesting, though, and it is the only part that I can find that really makes sense. The only good thing about it is that it has a really good ending: the author comes out looking good in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been waiting for this book for a while. I really wanted to like it, but I was just not. I think I have been waiting a lot longer for a good book on the subject of the "secret societies" that supposedly control the world. I've heard of the Illuminati, the Illuminati's "secret society", but not the Rothschilds. I can see the point of them, but to have it be explained in such an over-the-top way is just...weird. I guess I'll just wait for a better book on this subject, like I waited for the JFK book to come out, or the JFK assassination book to be written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the book, but it's so long and hard to follow that it's impossible to get into it.    It doesn't have anything to do with the plot or the characters but just goes on and on about "this is how I feel".   If I ever have the chance to buy the book I'll just read the other two, just to see what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as an introduction to the field of cognitive neuroscience, but found myself frustrated with the chapter that introduced the concept of "executive function." The "executives" in the chapter were mostly either boring or inept, but the "attorneys" were interesting, to say the least.  The "attorney" in question was a neurosurgeon, so I assumed that the "execution" of the plan would be flawless, but my hopes were dashed when the plan to treat a tumor with radiation and chemotherapy failed.  Even when the attorney did succeed, the "patient" still died from the cancer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from Amazon and didn't even realize how much I'd already read about this book. I've already gotten through the first 50 pages and am now wondering if I've just been too busy to get to the good stuff.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so boring, it is laughable. It is just a bunch of boring facts about how different cultures think and do things.  For example, they talk about how the Germans think of the Jews in terms of "the Jews are the people who created capitalism."  I am surprised that they were able to find anything interesting to say about the Jews as a people.  It is a shame that there is not more about how they did not like Jews.  They talk about the German view of how women are treated in Germany, which is to say that women have it so bad that they must be controlled, but they never mention that Germans think that women are like children.  I wonder what the German female is doing in Germany that she has to be controlled.  This kind of stuff makes me feel like I am watching a German propaganda movie.  Posted by Lisa at 4:15 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to get into this book, but after reading it, I don't know if I ever will.    The story is interesting, but there were so many mistakes in the book that I could not finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to start this book but I am so disappointed. The writing is atrocious. The main character is a girl who has a crush on a boy that she thinks is her friend.  The main guy is really creepy.  She is very upset that he wants to take her to the prom but she says no because he is not her type.  This is the third time I have read this book.  I am sorry but I won't be reading it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has some good ideas, but they are never put into practice. The authors claim that they had to find a way to help young people find work they were interested in.  The first part is a good primer on what a "work-study" program is.  However, the authors don't use the work-study program to get a job.  Instead they teach students how to lie to get the job they want.    The rest of the book is about how to get money from people.  This is a bit of a scam because students can just make up any work they are interested in and get paid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most annoying book I've ever read. I read it as a joke a couple of years ago. I'm not the target market for this kind of humor.  The writing is poor and the humor is bad.  I wish I had never bought this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. The author does a great job describing the various aspects of life in the Soviet Union, but when I got to the part about what I thought was wrong with the Soviet system, it became a little confusing. She does describe how the USSR was a communist state, but I was wondering if this wasn't simply an excuse for the poor living conditions. Maybe she was just trying to make a point about communism.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. I don't have much to say about it other than I wish it hadn't been written in the first place. I read it as an undergrad. The author doesn't know a lot about the subject matter, so he tries to shoehorn in everything that he can think of. It is hard to imagine why anyone would want to study a subject that he does not know very much about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book and I still love it.  It was fun and I didn't feel the need to read the other three books in the series.   This book will probably stay in my top 10 all time! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't know what to think about this one until I finished it.  It was so boring that I didn 't finish it till the end.  I'm sure that the story would have been interesting if it was told in a different way.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a young man who goes to college in order to become a priest, and what a huge mistake that is.   I can only hope that the author, whose book I had been enjoying, is having an epiphany about this book after I've finished it, because the author's writing has always been very good, and this book is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it's good.    The only good thing is that the book is in good physical condition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not impressed by this book.   The writing is extremely sloppily done and lacks any real purpose.  The characters have no depth or personality, and the story is so poorly constructed that I had to look up every single word to make sure I was reading the right book. This is the first book in a series about a serial killer and a group of detectives trying to find the killer.  It has no impact on me as a reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't enjoy this book. It was a bad read and I had to stop reading it because I was angry at the characters. I thought that there was a problem with the story, but that was just me being angry about the characters being selfish and self-centered. This book just seemed to go on and on, without any real purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most disappointing thing about this book is the fact that I bought this book expecting something that was different than what I've read. I was very excited about it and hoped that it would be different.  It isn't.   I feel as though this book just has a different purpose than what it is being used for.  I don't know why it was written, but the purpose is very obvious.  The whole book is about the use of music as a means to seduce and gain sexual pleasure from others.  This book is so shallow that it doesn't really have a purpose.  The only reason it is written is so that the author can make money off of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an important work that deserves careful reading by anyone interested in the topic of women and science in the twentieth century. I can understand how someone might think this is an unnecessary and perhaps unhelpful work.  But I disagree.  The material here is excellent and the discussion is insightful.  This book is an interesting way to look at women in science: the many who were denied their chance in life or who were marginal in a field they were trained to excel in, the women who worked their way into positions of power while often being ignored, the ones who succeeded despite sexism, the most courageous ones who made their own way, the many more who were the victims of sexism.  While this book doesn't look at all women in all fields, it is a great start to those interested in women in the sciences.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have only read this book once and it's very bad. I don't like fantasy, I don´t like that kind of stuff and I don`t like the style, I just think it`s just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't believe that anyone would buy a book like this.  It's like reading about a cult leader, except the leader is an idiot.  As an atheist, I'm embarrassed to say that I can find some of the religious quotes in this book to be very religious.  But, at the same time, I couldn't help but feel that I was being taken on a journey with these people.  I'm not sure if they were sincere in their beliefs or just really stupid people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to see a book about my favorite TV show about a bunch of nerds that have to get their lives together because a villain from another show is coming to get them, but I was disappointed to learn that it was based on a bad movie that I'd seen about ten years ago.   This book isn't that bad, but it's just not a good movie, or good TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a good read but, I didn't really enjoy it.   The characters were the main reason, but the plot was a mess.  The ending didn't make any sense.  I'll look at it again but for now, I'll pass it by. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a good book on the history of the Holocaust, but ended up reading this book by the wrong person, in the wrong edition. I was expecting a good read on a terrible topic, but instead, this book is filled with lies and propaganda that is beyond laughable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 50 pages were a nightmare.   It was like the book was written by someone who just doesn't care what other people think.  They were really annoying and really negative about some people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book a few years back. I had a good time with it. But it didn't work for me. I was hoping for a story that was funny, but the humor didn't come through. It was really just a very slow and boring read. The characters were boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of horror, but this one was pretty bad. The "haunting" element was pretty weak. The characters were unlikable, and their relationship wasn't very believable. And the whole plot seemed to be contrived, to be a way to get the main character into a better situation at the end of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's bad enough that it's not a good idea to read a book with the author's name on the cover. It's even worse that he writes like a teenager in this book. The author's style is terrible and the book reads like he was writing for someone else. The writing is very juvenile, and the dialogue is really dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been looking forward to this book since I heard about it from my friend.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It's a good book, but it has too many errors to be taken seriously.  There's no mention of the existence of a Greek or Roman civilization prior to Alexander the Great.   The book also has no mention at all of the Roman Empire.  If the author had simply made up some stories to support his thesis, I'd be more than willing to believe it.  I found it very interesting that his claims about Alexander and his achievements were based in fact, but so far as his claims regarding the Roman empire were concerned, he just made it up out of thin air.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a great review of this book by a fellow who is a long-time reader of the books in this series.   He says it is the only book of its kind he's read, and he's not sure he'll ever read a book like that again.  I can't wait to read it again, as I've heard great things about the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that just makes you want to throw it in the garbage.   The entire book is a collection of the most insulting, spiteful, ignorant, hateful and condescending words spoken to an audience of ignorant people.  I just wanted to throw my phone at the screen and leave. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete waste of time. The writing was atrocious. The book was written as a way to get out of debt but it didn't really work. I would never read another book by her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst I have ever read. It was the first book I've read that didn't make me want to vomit after each page, and I've had many books like that.  The story is told by the narrator, who seems to be the narrator for most of the book, but who is obviously not a good writer (or even a good story teller) because the story he tells is boring and predictable.  At least the author has the decency to have a proper ending, but even then, it's a lame ending that makes the whole book seem like a waste of time.  I found myself wanting to rip the book apart.  And the author doesn't have a clue about writing a good book, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and was not impressed at all. It is very obvious that a lot of the information in the book was just put in by the author to get the book published.  It would be good if they just printed the facts.  The author also made some statements about the church that were completely incorrect.  They are not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book but, in the end, it was not good. The characters were not likable and the story was really not interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of biographies about celebrities and historical figures. I've read some of the biographies that are good, but this one is just terrible. I'm not going to bother writing anything about the book because it's so bad that I won't even finish reading it.  It's a book about a person who had no business being a public figure:   She's a poor housewife who worked her way into the public eye as a professional ballerina.  She has no charisma and she's a horrible performer who doesn't have a single redeeming quality.  When the media was in the early 80s, her popularity plummeted to almost nothing, and she became a pariah. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a huge fan of the Harry Potter books until I found out that the movie version was terrible.   The books were very good, but the movie was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad.  It's not funny.  There's nothing good about it.   The only good thing is the ending.  I wish I had just ignored it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for the first time about a month ago. It was a little disappointing because I really wanted to like it, but the book is really boring. The only reason I'm not giving it a zero is because I was surprised at the story. I expected it to be a lot more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not enjoyed any of the books I've read by this author in the past several years.    This book is nothing like any of his other work.  The main character, John, is described as having a good memory but a poor memory for facts.  It is very disconcerting to me.  He can remember some facts, but not all.  His memory is poor, and that makes it very hard to recall important information about himself and his life.  John has been through a lot in his life, but he still has not come to terms with the fact that he may have been involved in a conspiracy.  That fact is not a problem for John. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does a very poor job at explaining why it is important to take a positive view of the Muslim world. The author is right about one thing: Muslim civilization is an impressive achievement that deserves to be cherished.   But, in order to appreciate that achievement, one needs to be aware of its limitations and its shortcomings.  If you want to see Islam as a force for peace and civilization, the best way to do that is to go back to the Middle Ages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the kind of book I hate to see in the hands of a woman. It is very hard to follow her ideas about writing, since her basic approach seems to be "write what you know". Her ideas about how to write are the only good part of the book, as they involve her writing with "mythic" characters, making them very sympathetic to her. I have read plenty of women's fiction, but never one that seems so focused on how men are the problem. It's the kind you read and say, "I want to be like that, but I have no ideas about that."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible waste of time. I purchased it as a gift for a co-worker who had been reading some of my previous novels. She didn't like it. This is the second book she has bought from me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I would never recommend it to anyone. It's not even the bad writing that bothers me, but the fact that the book is trying to be a historical fiction but the author isn't even very good at writing historical fiction. I mean, there are a few moments in the book that I like (such as the "Herculean task" part), but for the most part, it just doesn't have any flavor or interest to it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last half of this book was just terrible. I know that's a bad thing to say about a book, but I'm actually pretty disappointed in the final chapters. I wanted so much to get into the world that was described so well in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment. There were hints at what would be coming but nothing in the way of the full impact of the ending. I'm not sure if it was a case of the author having run out of ideas or if it's just that she wasn't satisfied with the ending, but either way, this is the last book in this series I'll read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think I will ever understand the fascination people have with this book. It's like someone took the essence of every science fiction novel in the last 50 years and just stuffed it down your throat like a candy. It seems so... wrong? But no, it is so wrong. I've read a lot of science fiction. This book is so horribly wrong it's unbelievable. It tries to say everything about how we live now, but it does so in a way that makes it seem more ridiculous than true. The first thing you get is the premise: A guy is trying to build a space colony. His spaceship has gone missing. There is a distress signal on a nearby star, which the people who built the colony found. This means the people on the colony can't live without the spaceship, but the distress signal also says there is a monster living in the stars. The people on earth have never heard of a monster before, but they are terrified of it. They start putting up warning signs. And so, the colony is being built in a big way. A lot of the books I read about space colonies used a lot the same ideas, but this one is so incredibly wrong. It doesn't even take into account the possibility that the aliens might be trying to get to earth so that they can get rid of us all. This is so out there, I couldn't believe it myself. Then they try to explain what a space monster is: It's just an alien in space, and it has the ability to suck up people and move them about. But this is a bit of a stretch, because if the alien is a big, ugly alien with a big mouth, how does it get around the solar system? It's such a horrible idea that I couldn the whole thing is a joke, and that is how it is intended. The rest of the book is just ridiculous: The space colony is built on an island, so it can't get out to the stars because of the gravity. They're planning on having people build a tower that will let them get out of the solar System to other planets. This seems so idiotic to me, but that is the sort of idea that is so popular in science fiction novels. It is really a pity that this book didn't have more people reviewing it, because it seems like there was a lot more in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a compilation of a few of my favorite posts on the "A-1: Asian Americans and Asian Pacific Islanders" blog.   It's well written and there is a good mix of opinion on the topics, but I don't find it interesting enough to continue reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that keeps me reading a bad story is to hope it will get better.   There is no real plot development or payoff.  This is just a story about the protagonist, and how he came to be in the situation he is in.  I really hope it gets better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a long time coming and it still wasn't done.    I don't want to review a bad piece of work but the ending was really a letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be incredibly boring. The author was writing about his own life. He wasn't a good writer, but he wasn't bad either. He made a good story out of his life, but it didn't make the book any better. He seemed to have little to say about anything that happened to him. It wasn't that he didn't have a good life or anything. It was that he was living a very un-interesting life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but after finishing it I found it extremely boring and poorly written. It's so bad that it makes the book I really wanted to read, The Unwritten Story, seem like a masterpiece. I read the first part, but found it to be quite dull. The book is about a man who takes a job as a private investigator. The only character I felt any real sympathy for was the detective.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because my friend recommended it. It's a good book. It has a lot of good information about all sorts of things, from politics to religion to how to run a household. It also has some good advice about how to get your ex back. But that's about all it has. I hope she reads this book too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title is " The Art of Living: A Novel of the Art of Being " and it is, of course, an autobiography of a famous artist. I don't read biographies of art and writers much, but this one really got me. The author seems to really be into his art, and is very specific about why he does the things he does. It really is a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book, and the story, too.  I don't know if it was my ignorance that caused me to be so disappointed, or if I just didn't like the author's voice or writing style, but the story felt like a cop out for her first real attempt at writing.  It felt like she was trying to explain why she wasn't as well-known as her husband (and her own writing) by writing something about them.  The ending didn't help either.  She's writing about two people she knew but didn't want to associate with (she's already writing about them in another book).  There's a sense of "I have to get away from those people for a while," and yet the ending seems to suggest that the author just couldn't get away.  But then again, I didn't see the whole story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book difficult to read. I'm a little nervous about going into a library to find something new. However, after reading this, I think I'm going to read something else that is more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the first half of the book and was hoping it would be a good read. However, as I was reading it, I found myself wondering what all the fuss was about. There is no point in having a character so obsessed with the beauty of the natural world. He has a beautiful home in the woods, an impressive garden, and a garden that has the potential to become a big hit with the neighbors, but he doesn't really get a chance to enjoy it because he is constantly working on it. He doesn't like the way it looks because he hates the color. He also has an obsession with a certain type of tree. The book is really just about him trying to work out why he is so drawn to trees. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's book is the worst thing I've read this year.  The first half is the usual "the best is yet to come" nonsense, with the characters all trying to find themselves.  But halfway through, it turns into a series of one-sided, boring, predictable stories that don't seem to have much to do with the "heroes" who are already there, but don't get the respect or recognition they deserve.  It's really quite bad.  I'm hoping that the last quarter of the book is going to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been wanting to read this book for a long time.   It has a great premise, but the writing is terrible.  I don't understand why this was the only book I had read about the war.  It's a lot of work for little reward. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think I've read a more inept book in my life. It's a book about a guy who takes a "personal interest" in a murder. He becomes obsessed with it, obsesses about it, and obsesses so much he starts to believe that the murder was committed by someone else and is just a cover for a real crime. It makes no sense to me. How could he be so sure? It's as if he were so certain he wasn't crazy that he was willing to believe anything. And the book is so full of obvious contradictions that it makes you wonder if the author is actually insane or if he's just a total moron.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't stand the way this book was written. It was poorly written, and poorly organized. I'm not even going to pretend I read it. I know how much I'm supposed to like the story, but the fact that there was a typo on page 5 makes it all the more frustrating to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book at all. The writing is horrible. I hate it. The only good thing about it is that the author has a history of writing bad books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a fan of this book at all, even though it's been on my shelf since the 80's. The plot is a total non-starter (I guess you could call it a "love story" but I don't think that is the case at all). The characters were uninteresting as well, but I can't really say I had any interest in any of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "What if...?" section in this book is a waste of time.   This book is about a fictional book called "What If...".  A "What would you do if..." kind of book.  The author has a hard time with the concept of a "What Would You Do?"  I can't imagine that anyone would write a book about their own life that would give them a hard on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not worth the time or effort to read.  It's an excuse to waste time on a poor author.  The whole book is about a couple who, after finding out they have a genetic disease, go to a book club for fun.  They decide to get a book about their condition.  Instead of enjoying themselves, they find themselves going through the book and talking about the things they were thinking about and feeling while they were reading it.  In other words, it's about a woman reading about herself  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but was disappointed in all of its failings.  This is not an enjoyable book to read.  The story is too short and has too many cliches.    It's like a bad version of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."     The author does not know what he is doing with his plot lines, but his characters are not very interesting either.  He makes his plot twists and turns just to give his characters some much needed motivation.      The author makes it sound like the characters are doing nothing except standing around doing nothing, but the author is the one doing nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book on a very difficult subject but the book lacks the substance that makes an otherwise excellent text so good.  I will still read it but I will only be able to get it through in part because I am an obsessive book collector. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book because of the amazing reviews it had gotten.  It was very disappointing.  The first section is about how the author's father (who was a psychiatrist) had treated him for depression.  But the author never really gives much credit to his father for that, or for anything else.  And the part about him leaving his wife and daughter (who died as a teenager) behind is pretty much a complete lie.  Also, the author does a horrible job explaining why people go to therapy.  He talks about how people want to escape the guilt of "being bad" so they can feel like they're good.  Well, that's pretty good if you think about it.  I'm not sure if I want to go to counseling because I can't get a job.  Maybe I'm just bad at it, but I'm certainly not good at it.   It's pretty much like a self-help book for people who have a hard time trusting themselves.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of the first two books in the Hunger Games trilogy. This one does not live up to the hype.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas.   It is a great book about how to deal with being a teenager.  I liked it a lot.  It will help her with her feelings about what being a kid is like.  But I don't know if I would recommend this book to other parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of science fiction, I'm afraid this is going to be a terrible read.  The story is good, but the prose is so choppy and incomprehensible that it makes the whole experience feel like a poor excuse for a story.   It's not bad, but it's not very good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this before but it's a book that I just can't stand.  The protagonist has been a child molester since he was a child.  He has been in and out of jail since he began molesting his little sisters.  It is so bad that he is a sex offender.  I don't know if he can ever be rehabilitated.  Why would a pedophile put a kid on his lap and fondle them?  Why is it so hard to believe that he did something so wrong?  The book ends with the pedophile raping a little girl while he watches.  This is not the book I want to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. It's hard to understand why a self-published book would be so bad.  I read the book because I was looking for a good introduction to Buddhism.    The book's introduction is not helpful at all.    It's a "What is Buddhism?" kind of intro. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with a few good ideas, but they don't come together in a way that really works.   The idea that people can be taught is very appealing, but in practice, the reader just doesn't seem to have that sort of innate ability to learn.  I think it would be great if the book was a little more focused on specific skills, but it's still a great book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a really boring book.  I can't even tell the difference between the three main characters.  And it takes way too long to get to the bad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book, but I'm a little disappointed.   The first half of the book focuses on the struggles of women in the Mormon church.  It does a good job of presenting the issues that are raised by women's activism and feminism.  The book was a little more interesting if you read the chapters that focused on women's issues rather than the rest of the chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a great example of why one should not read too much into a single review. The reviewer was a woman who found the story and characters of this book interesting. However, she did find a few of the details a little hard to swallow. This book was definitely not worth the time it took me to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not worth the effort. The author doesn't really give a good argument for why men shouldn't be as involved in children's lives as women, and the author spends so much time making it clear that it's just not right that women are doing it that way and men can't be involved at all that the book is really just a list of reasons why women are better at it than men. The worst part is that she's completely wrong about all the reasons why men should not be involved in the kids' lives. I was very excited to read this book because I've been thinking about it for awhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sorry, but this book does not live up to the hype.   It is a good read, and if you are a history buff, it is a must read, but I did not find the book all that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a bit of a disappointment that the author never really developed a plot.   The only real characters were the main characters (who have their own problems and have some flaws, but I'm not sure how they're supposed to fit in with the rest of the book) and the "other" characters who are not important.  This was very disappointing as I'd really hoped that the book might provide a compelling, intriguing, suspenseful mystery.  I'm sure that's what I'll read next, but that's not really what I want from a book about a missing book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a book in which a woman who was married to a man who abused her, had to go to prison and had her marriage dissolved, was portrayed as a victim.  It seems that she had been raped by him as a child.  But the rapist was not prosecuted because the woman wanted him to continue being with her.  In the book, the woman said "I never thought that I would have to be in this position.  I'm not sure I would be able to forgive myself."  I felt sorry for her.   I was never a victim of rape, but I had to suffer through years of abuse.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  I was told by a good friend of mine that this book was very similar to "The Big Book of Bad Advice" by Bill Bryson.  So I bought it.  My friend also said that he hated it.   I tried it out and it is terrible!  It has a lot of terrible advice.  The author spends a lot more time on some of the "futurist" things that aren't so hot than others.  He talks about the things that he thinks are really important (like getting a good education) and how it is easy to get sucked into things that will hurt you down the line (like becoming a corporate drone).  He has some good advice, but it doesn't really come until the very end.  This is the kind of book that makes you want to run out and get a better education than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book very confusing.  I'm trying to use it as a basis for a more complete set of guidelines.  As a newbie to the hobby,  I've read some great rules and a few bad ones.  This one was pretty bad, but at least it was written clearly and with a good eye for detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most ridiculous thing I have ever read.  It's full of nonsense about science, about dinosaurs and other "mythical" things.  I don't know about that, but I'm sure as hell not a mythicist.  If that were true, I'd probably want to believe in dinosaurs and myths too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. It is filled with great info about how to do things right and make your life work, but there were some things that were not that helpful.   The first is that they don't sell a lot of their books.  The second is that their products are very expensive.  For a book about a product that is meant to do something so good for you that you can do it yourself    you'd think that they'd make it cheaper.  I was hoping that they would make it so cheap   but it seems that they are not interested in making a good product that a lot more people can use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why this book is called The Power of Positive Thinking.  This book is based on the belief that positive thinking can cure cancer, but it's not about curing cancer.  It's about making a positive impression, and being more positive about yourself.  If you want to cure cancer or become more successful, you can do that by changing your negative beliefs.  I'm not sure what it's about when the book says "but most people can't handle positive thinking."  It makes me feel like I've wasted a good book on something I'm going to find confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's bad. The plot is so poorly written that I just had to throw it in the garbage. There is not one good character in this book. I didn't care about most of them until the last 2/3 of the book. If the author didn't have a personal grudge against someone, he would have made this book more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book about a person who lost her job at the end of the last century. What I got instead was an excuse for a lazy story. In the first chapter, the author describes a friend of hers who got fired from her job when she turned 18. It was in those last few days that she began smoking marijuana. She was soon able to quit smoking and was able to enjoy a great deal of freedom. That's all well and good, but I was hoping for more. The author seems to think that her friend was able do this because of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. After her friends and her family were arrested for marijuana possession, the friend was fired from the job she had been working at for a decade. She ended up homeless and spent the next few years in jail. I guess that's what happens when you are too young to remember when you didn't have a job in the 60's and 70's: you end up being arrested for possession of a substance that is now legal.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely excited to read this book because it seemed like a very interesting and thought provoking work on the subject of science.  This was not the case at all.  While it is a good read, it does not offer the depth and depth of analysis or analysis that I expected.  For example:  "The real problem with science is that it is the most powerful instrument we have for learning about the natural world:   We can see it, and we can learn from it.   It's not that it's wrong or useless.   We just don't have enough data to say for sure what it's doing, and when."  This is like saying that you would rather drive your car at 40 mph than turn on the air conditioning, because the air conditioner would probably cool you down a little.  If you want to be scientific, then read some physics.  I'm not a physicist but I do understand how the human body functions.  That being said, this isn't even a good science book.  It's more of a popular science book about the human mind.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that I stopped reading it immediately.  It was so wrong that it was so stupid that it didn't even make sense, and it seemed to me like it was written by a child.  I just want to cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is boring and has a negative tone to it. The story is repetitive and the ending is confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I was shocked at the lack of science and scientific accuracy in it. It's basically a rant about how a bunch of scientists made up the "science" about vaccines to get grants. They claim that vaccines cause autism, but the science just doesn't support that. I'm a nurse so I know that some vaccines are bad for kids, but I don't know about the other stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book many times over the years, and finally gave up. I was disappointed to find out that the only thing that changed about the original manuscript was the ending. It's the same story, same characters, same plot. It is a little boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad. I am a big fan of science fiction and was excited to get this book. However, I found myself constantly disappointed with the quality of the science, particularly in relation to the events of the story. In the first section, the scientists try to find a way to bring back the dead. While I appreciate that they are trying to get around a problem that has plagued mankind for millennia, I was really frustrated by the end. The whole idea seemed really weak. In a way, I would have preferred to just have been told that these scientists had created a way of resurrecting the dead through the manipulation of matter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read in college, but found myself wanting to stop reading the book after a while.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping to read a book about a man who spent his life hunting down a person who had stolen his daughter, but it's a bad story. I'm not saying it's bad in general, but I don't like stories about bad people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was good for the most part. It was a fun read. It's a little sad that the story doesn't go as far as the first book, but then again, I really don't think I needed it to go as well as it did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad novel at all. I'm not sure what the author had to prove to get a publisher to buy this one, but I'm sure it wasn't too much. It's not bad, either, but if you can't make the long journey from home to the library to buy a book, then maybe you should consider the idea of not buying one at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really like this book.  I was expecting a bit more of a plot than it provides.  It's a story about the discovery of a mysterious woman's body in a remote cabin.  However, the author only seems to be interested in making a fast buck and not in the deeper meaning of the story.  The story doesn't really follow through on anything, and the plot is very contrived.  A quick Google search reveals the existence of other books like this, but they don't provide much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found myself laughing quite a lot while reading this book.   It's a parody of an old horror movie called "Bashful Little Devil."   But the joke isn't funny because of the fact that you know it's a spoof.  The main character is a "Baddie", an evil and destructive being who takes pleasure in destroying everything that stands in his way.  He's a bully who enjoys hurting and terrorizing children.  However, he's far from evil, and his motives are very understandable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason this book is rated as "good" is that the writing style is good. This is a "great read" but the book itself isn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not teach me anything new.  It is just a continuation of the same old story: "I am the best!"  This is the same kind of book where the first chapter says:  "I have to admit: I am pretty good at drawing."  It ends with a chapter on the "difference between self-esteem and self-image" which is a complete waste of time because it never explains what it is about self- image that is good and what is bad about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by a psychologist with no training in clinical writing. It was a total waste of time. I'm a clinical psychologist and my work involves patients who have suffered abuse, but I would never use this book to help a client. This is just a lot of self-pitying and blame shifting that doesn't help anyone.
