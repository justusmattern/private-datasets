Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great little book. It is a must read for anyone with a history of the New World.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a graduate student in biology. The book is about how different species evolved different adaptations to their environments, with no direct evidence of a common ancestor. The author does a good job of describing the process. It's an excellent book for people who want to learn about evolution and natural selection.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good novel. It has a lot of heart. The character development is good. The book is well written. It's a good story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about how to think and feel about people, the importance of being yourself, and how to deal with people you don't want to be around.  I've learned a lot about my own emotions, which have been greatly diminished by the constant "being yourself" talk.  This book is written by someone who has been around people who have been in that same boat as me and was able to handle it well, and has given me a lot to learn from.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about what it is like to be gay and a Jewish in the 1950s and 60s. I was fortunate to grow up in a Jewish family and to live in a very liberal city in which it was acceptable to be both gay and Jewish. As a result, I did not have to think about the issue until very late in life. My grandmother, a staunch liberal, had no problem with her son being gay; in fact, she and my mother were the first Jews to marry in her hometown in a long time. My mother and I, on the other hand, were the second gay people to marry, after my father, and our wedding was an unhappy affair. (My mother never forgave my father for not taking her to the movies as a kid. She's the one who lost out, but she's the real loser.) So the whole question of "Why?" was on my mind a lot as I grew up. This book made it a lot easier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic and well researched book on the history of "soul music" in America. The first part is a history of the genre. It is well written and contains the correct dates of each major event that took place in the genre's history. I found the whole thing very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read about a little girl with a big heart. She loves animals and knows how to take care of them, and her dog is her best friend.  I was very impressed by the pictures and illustrations that were used. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book about the Vietnam War ever written.  This book is an excellent work of history.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book.  It is short but not short at all.  The book is full of facts about the subject matter and is easy to read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of this wonderful area of the United States.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about how to live and work on the Internet I've ever read.  It's also an excellent book about the history of the Internet, and the history and future of the World Wide Web.  In other words, it's a must-read for any computer geek. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe that a good non-fiction book on a subject that many people are interested in, but don't understand, can be so good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on the history of the Roman Catholic Church. It covers the church from the earliest days to the time of the Reformation. I was impressed by how well-written the book is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good.  It covers many different aspects of writing.  I recommend this book for all writers.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book on how to be a successful, smart, funny woman that I've ever read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very detailed about how to make a good, fast and cheap 3D printer.   The only thing I found missing was an easy way to mount the board to a printer.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading the new edition of  The New Economics of Life   It's written by the economist Paul Krugman. I've been a fan of his writings since he published his brilliant article about the financial crisis a few years ago.   In the first chapter, he describes the financial innovation of mortgage securitization:  This innovation turned the mortgage industry on its head: It allowed banks to lend money to each other (in the form of bonds) at very low rates, and to turn those bonds into mortgage-backed securities (mortgages) that they could then buy from other banks. This allowed the big banks to make huge profits from lending money to the little guys, and also from buying the mortgages from the little guy. It also allowed the banks to finance themselves without having to lend out any of the money they'd borrowed.  It was a massive bubble.     It eventually burst, as most financial bubbles do, but it was not until the crisis that people realized just how much money the financial industry was making by making mortgage loans.  This is a very good book that is definitely worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about writing. It has a very good explanation of how to write a good first draft, but it doesn't just tell you what to do. It tells you how to look at a problem and solve it, and it also gives some good advice on how to put together a good story, so you can keep your readers' interest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to finally have a chance to read this book!  It's funny, it's dark, and it's well written.  This is my favorite book by James Patterson.  I can't wait for the next installment.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a young girl I used to be a huge fan of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I thought I was going to die.   But I didn't. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of the books by Richard Matheson, and I love this one too. It's a quick, entertaining story about a time-traveler who, after having a mystical experience, decides to go back to the 18th century to fight against the oppression of slavery. I like how he doesn't get too philosophical about the matter. It really isn't much more than a good adventure story, but it's a good story nonetheless.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a very slow reader and this book was too long for me. I am now in the process of getting a Kindle and the book is on my reading list.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It has lots of information about a great book.  The author covers a lot of ground and it's a good read.  I hope I have more books like this in my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. The only bad thing about it is that the writing style of the authors is so stilted and awkward that I can't get into the book.  I think if the book had been a little more interesting, the writing would have been better.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book from an independent bookstore because I'm in a little rut with my fiction, and I'm excited to try something new.  And it's not like the genre is dead - it's pretty solid. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read with a nice cover. The book is about the evolution of social order in the city of Rome and the role that slavery played in its creation. The main point is that the slaves were not "free" to participate in the political processes in Rome.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will provide a very interesting read and is definitely worth the time.  I am not sure if I have a better understanding of the topic but this is a good read and should help you understand what goes on behind the scenes when it comes to a successful publication.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic introduction to the world of Japanese martial arts. I found myself able to understand and appreciate Japanese martial traditions I had never heard of before.  I am not a martial arts expert but I'm looking forward to the next book in the series by the same author.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best part of this book is the introduction. It's an overview of the research, the ideas, the data, and the methods of social science. It is very engaging.    I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The main character was a little annoying, but once she was introduced to me, I knew I'd like her. She had a good sense of humor (which was more than I could say about most of my high school classmates). 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been interested in this book since reading it in high school, and I can definitely say that it's a very good book.  I was never a fan of the books by Dostoevsky, Tolstoy or Chekhov but I'm happy to find out that a similar book about Chekhovek is being published in English.  This book is much better than the Russian ones I used to read when I was a kid, and even better than Tolstoys "Gor'ka". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a bit of a science fiction/fantasy nerd.   When I read about the use of DNA and molecular biology in science fiction I always wonder what is possible.  I think this book is a good example of how scientists can create new things.  It is really well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book.   The author uses a variety of techniques to explain the nature of memory and how it is formed.  The techniques used are interesting but not exactly original.  I'm not sure how the author did it.  It seemed very difficult for him.  He seems to use a lot of information from the history of psychology and psychology textbooks.  But it does seem to work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful introduction to the great literary tradition of the French novelist. The author is able to show that, while the great novelists of the past were not as gifted as they thought they were, their works are still of tremendous value. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a true story about a young man who, as a child, had a fascination with the military and the Nazis. I was always fascinated by the military in my youth but, as I read this book, I was astounded by how much the soldiers really looked like me, with the exception of the Nazis:   I never had the opportunity to join the military but as I have watched the movie "Braveheart" and "Schindler's List," I know the difference between courage and cowardice. When they go into battle, you don't want to be a coward. You want to stand up for what you believe in and risk your life for a cause you believe is just. In my case, I knew it was the right thing to do. The Nazis had oppressed so many people and taken from them so much that they deserved to be destroyed.   The military is full of great men who are just like me. They are just as brave as we are but, instead of dying for a country they don't believe in, they die for the idea that they can change the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good story.   The story is not very deep but it's good for a story about a little boy that is trying to survive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. I love to read history. I've always been a history buff. I am very happy to see that my love for history has paid off. This book is a must-read for every history buff out there.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't remember the last time I read a book I really enjoyed.   This book   was one of those. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of all the stories about the history of science fiction. It's great to read about these people in their day to day lives. I especially liked the stories of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Harlan Ellison. They are great examples of how people can go about doing science fiction and still be a good person.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very helpful and entertaining, even though I'm not a lawyer. It was a good read and I found it very educational, even for those who have not practiced law. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting and insightful book. I have not been able to read much about the origins of the English language until now. This book, however, is very good and is a good reminder of why learning the Latin language is so important.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book about a wonderful guy, who never got much credit. He was a very strong man, who was a real man's man, and very well read. I just found it very refreshing to read about a man who didn't care much about material things and enjoyed life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while attending a workshop on how to deal with anger and hate.   I've found myself in similar situations, and it was extremely useful in making me understand that my feelings are valid and can be addressed.  It also helped me see that the anger is not just about a bad person doing something bad, but that it is also about a system that is designed to make you feel that way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed all the books in the series so far.  The characters are so well done, and the writing is so good, that I'm very happy with this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am not a huge fan of horror. This book is not. The setting is interesting, the characters are interesting, and it is interesting to learn a bit about the history of witchcraft in Ireland.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books where the story is well told and the characters are very real.    I loved it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book for my husband and he enjoyed it very much.  This book will help him to learn the basic principles of how to play guitar.  It is not easy to learn these principles because they are so important to the way a guitar sounds.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and the book's premise is great.    I have read a lot about the "Mormonism is a cult" line of argument, and this book does a great job of explaining why it's wrong.  This is a good read for someone who has heard the argument but doesn't really buy into it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read. I'm a fan of science fiction and fantasy so I was very excited to find this book. It's definitely a book to pick up once or twice. I love that it's written by an actual doctor. She does a wonderful job describing what a colonoscopy is like.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good it doesn't even need a positive reviewer.   It's about the way that children's literature can be useful in learning about world religions and religions that are not the same as our own.  It can also be a very effective means of learning about the religious practices of different cultures, which is important for understanding the world we live in.  This is one of the reasons I started reading about Islam in the late '80s when I was an undergraduate.  I was intrigued by the notion that a religion that has no central authority can still be a powerful force for good in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I've read a lot of classic SF. But this is the first book that made me want to pick up a real SF novel. It's an amazing read, and one that will be used as a text book at a future university. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, thoughtful book on the subject of family values and values that govern a person's conduct in the family. The author offers a lot of thought on how to be a good father and a good husband in the context of a very secular society. The book also touches on a number of themes, including the role of religion in our family lives. I think that the book is worth a read because the author has thought about a lot more than the topic of this book, and he has provided some helpful insights into the issue. I do not think that he is suggesting that we get rid of religion. On the contrary, he argues that there are some things that religions have to offer, even if they have some bad parts to them. I am glad that he does not argue that religion should be abolished. He recognizes the good aspects of religion, and I am sure that we could benefit from a discussion about religion that included a good deal of secular ideas about the role that religion can play in our lives. This book is not perfect. I have had some difficulty with some of the ideas presented, but that is to be expected. I found myself thinking about the same issues that the author did when I read the book. I hope that others who have not read the whole book will enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent introduction to the field of computational linguistics.  It's an extremely good and accessible book.  The author has taken the approach of first defining the core concepts of computational linguistic theory.  Then he goes on to give a very good and thorough presentation of the current state of the art in computational linguists.   The book does not pretend to be the last word on the subject.  As a first-rate introduction, it is a good buy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a great read.  It was very informative and very good.  The book has a lot of useful information about the origins of the Illuminati.  I found this information to be very interesting and useful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book. I'm a big fan of the series so I was excited to get this.  I'm also a huge fan of YA books so this was a perfect addition to my library.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The concept was simple, yet complex. I can easily see how this book might help many people who are going through a tough time.  It was difficult to get through but I'm glad I tried.  I was able to deal with my fears and get through my grief without going crazy.  This book also helped me understand how to deal and accept my feelings. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful, easy to read book about being a Christian. I have read the Bible many times, but I never really understood it until this book. The concept of "taking Jesus for a walk" is a powerful one. It makes me think that I might want to give more thought to my own beliefs, since it has the effect of letting my "Christian" beliefs fade away. This is not the only book that has helped me get through my Christian experience, but it is definitely the most enlightening and helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, but I didn't like how I was supposed to go about it.    It was very obvious that she was supposed, I don't know, to be the person that people go to for information on sex and relationship issues.  But she didn't know anything about either, which is why I read her book.  She also seemed to know very little about sex and relationships. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great, full of humor and insight about the differences between men and women.   It is written from a woman's point of view but it is well written and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, a collection of short stories from a wide range of writers, has been a great read. I was particularly drawn to the short stories by E. L. Doctorow and by Robert Sheckley. They are very different in style, but they have a lot in common. They both deal with the same subject, which is the human nature of love, jealousy, anger, and resentment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about a group of students who come together to solve a common problem. This is a wonderful book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not usually a big fan of historical fiction but this is a good one.  It's written well, has a good plot, and has interesting characters.  I'll definitely read more about the War of 1812 in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book on the history of the French Revolution.  It is well researched and well written.  The author has a good grasp of the key events.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the French revolution.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a member of this forum since 2007 and have been participating in various online discussions about this and other books I have read, including this one.   It is my favorite book on history by a living historian, and is a good way to understand the current geopolitical climate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book. It is an excellent overview of the role of the Federal Reserve System in the development of the US economy. It presents a comprehensive historical perspective on the monetary policies of the Bank of England during the period in question. The history is clearly laid out and the book is well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that can only be described as a true story.  This was my first book of the series and I was very impressed.  The author did a good job of describing the events as they happened.   The plot itself is quite good too.  I think it's a good read for all who want to know the background of the Vietnam War and the role of the CIA in it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the works of Robert Harris, but I've only read his short stories. I can't imagine how much effort went into writing these three books, which I've just finished reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting and well researched study of the development of modern American journalism.  The book is not just about the "new media" but about the early days of radio and print, and about the transformation of journalism from a public service to a commercial enterprise.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking forward to this book for some time now.  It is a very good story about a person with a bad temper.    She is a bit of a brat, but not as bad as many people think she is.  The story takes place in an isolated community.  This story was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've only read one of these books ( The Girl on the Train ) and it's one I'm still very fond of. It's a very well written book, very well told and has a very interesting plot. I found it very difficult to put down, although I am always a bit hesitant to read a book about women.  It's probably best if you read the book after you've read the novel, as it's quite a bit different in both genres. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading "The Great War of the Roses." This is an excellent historical account of the conflicts that plagued the English monarchy in the years leading up to the English Civil War. This is a very well written book, and I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an interesting book about the history of a particular type of political activity that has developed in the U.S. The authors' focus is on the emergence of a new type of "non-profit" political organization: a "civic party" that has a focus on a particular issue but is "nonpartisan."   The authors discuss some of the historical origins of the term "citizen" as a political term, and how the term came to be used in a political context.   They also give some historical background on the origins of "civics" education. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent primer on the "secret" of good design.  It is a quick read, and the writing is excellent.  This is an extremely well-written book that can be used by a novice designer, or a professional.  The author covers a lot of ground and I believe that he is providing the best advice that we will get in the future.  Posted by Richard J. at 12:21 PM

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about the world of computer security and computer forensics that's very easy to read. The author has a good grasp on both computer science and computer security issues, and he explains the theory in a way that doesn't overwhelm the reader.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a man's journey to finding God. The author is very accurate in his portrayal of this journey as well as his own. He does a good job describing what the Bible really says about God, His Son Jesus, the Bible and how God's plan has changed in the last 1000 years.  He is very open to the fact that God has given us more than we can handle, and that we should go back to Him and learn from His mistakes.  This book is a great place to start for anyone who has ever struggled to find God, or just is looking for someone to relate to about their own journey.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think the author does a good job with this one, although I think it could have been written with a more positive tone.   It's not that I don't want to read about a woman who is so happy about a bad date but is still pretty annoyed about it, but I don'   really    like   this   tone   that   she   uses   to   express   her   feelings   about   it

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book about the importance of learning to read and write. I have been a language learning skeptic but found this book to be quite informative.  I have a lot of trouble with reading/writing because my dyslexia has prevented me from reading and writing at all but in this book, he breaks down how a language learner can learn to read/write.  The lessons in this section are great and are very accessible.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for the first time about a year ago and I must say I really enjoyed it. It's funny, and funny is my thing. The author is not one for being preachy, but he does a good job making sure to laugh at himself as well. The best part is that this book has a good ending, a good beginning and an excellent ending. It leaves me wanting to go on and read more, but for now it's just a good read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this book for a long time now, and I think it is a fantastic book. It's easy to read, and is a good introduction to the world of the medieval. The story is quite interesting, and the characters are well developed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative and enjoyable book about the history of the American military in World War I.  The author, a retired army colonel, explains how the British Army used the American Army in the trenches in France and Belgium to train their own troops.  It is an entertaining account of how the American forces trained and fought in a manner that made them much better prepared for the battles to come.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is excellent. I really enjoyed reading it and it's not long enough to be a boring read, but the author is a very good writer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good read, I was surprised by the author's use of a lot of "glamour" to explain the science of evolution.  This is a good read for the young at heart.  It does take some time to get used to the different points that the authors try to make, but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty easy.  There are a few mistakes (such as the confusion about the evolutionary relationship between cephalopods and molluscs) but they are not that big of a deal.  I found it interesting how the authors describe a lot the differences between species and types.  The book was good enough that I will be looking for a copy in my library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad I bought this book.  I have been using this method of cooking for several years now, and it's been really easy to get the timing right.  The only thing I would change is that it could be more consistent about the cooking time, but it still works for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so glad I read this book, which has been on my "to read" list for a long time.   The writing is very good and the characters are likeable and interesting.  The author, David DeWitt, does a good job of making the story and the world as realistic as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read and enjoyed many of the classic fantasy novels before I started reading "The Dragonbone Chair" but this was the first time I read one that truly moved me. The story is set in a distant world where humans are a race that has evolved beyond their wild and unruly nature. It was refreshing to read a story set in that world that doesn't glorify the violence, stupidity, or idiocy that most fantasy books do. The world building was amazing and the characters, while flawed, were memorable.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It was very easy to read. It made the story easy to understand. It is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so well written, it is very enjoyable to read. It is very easy to understand the content.  The book does not have a lot of science behind it.  This is a good example of how science can be used to help people, but still stay true to itself.  I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well researched and provides a good overview of what the American economy is doing. The book is good, but not a great resource. The economy is still recovering from the great recession, which the authors do not cover, and the book lacks a lot of detail on the economy. The authors do point out that the real growth in the economy is in the financial sector (and not in manufacturing), but that is a very minor point.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, although I found the title a bit much. I can see why it might have been a bit controversial. The author provides some valuable tips for people who wish to become more knowledgeable about themselves, others and the world around them. I would like to thank her for writing this book and I am looking forward to her other books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about a girl who's trying to do right. She's not a bad girl; she's not trying to get a lot of money; she doesn't steal; she is not cruel to animals or people. But she is wrong about many things: she has a bad temper and a bad memory; she can't find out anything about her parents without asking them; she has been living in her parents' house for her whole life and thinks that they are good parents. This is true. I was a teenager, and my parents' marriage seemed like a good choice. But I was really unhappy at home; I was bored and unhappy, I wasn't learning a lot about life. I read a lot, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do. So I thought I would give the "good" girls of the neighborhood a chance to become women who were doing something different. I've read lots of books about women like this: they're so bad at everything that they don't want to be anything, but they're very good at something they want to do; they don 't care about their families; they can't even find out what's going on in the world around them; they spend a lot more time getting high and doing drugs than they do learning about things that matter to them; and they don' t care about anyone but themselves. I just don't see how this is any different.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've ever owned where the main character was a lesbian. This is great news for all the people out there who need a friend who's a lesbian: a lesbian friend who happens to be a great cook, a lesbian neighbor, a gay best friend, etc. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book.  The characters are interesting, the story is engaging and the worldbuilding is intriguing.  It's really not too bad and I think that's why it's been so long since I read a book like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of the British and American empires in Asia and Africa. It's written by a scholar and a journalist with a keen eye for detail, but he never tires of recounting the triumphs and tragedies of his countrymen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.   It is filled with information that is very important to me, but is very difficult to find information about.  This book is filled in some of the details.  It includes information that I did not know, and it includes a great deal of the history of the LDS Church that I do not know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book after hearing it was the first book to make the NYT bestseller list. It is really good.  The writing style is a little more sophisticated than most young adult novels. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about how to learn a new language, from a language expert who's done it all: from native speaker to fluent conversationalist.    I am looking forward to reading other books from the same author in the future, as I can't seem to learn anything about new languages while I'm learning mine. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about the art of photography and the work of the photographer: a very good book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a huge inspiration to me. The way I learned about the true story behind a classic book is through the author's own writing process and his personal research.  I love how he is able to capture the characters and their personalities in such a way that it seems real.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about how to make good decisions and how to succeed. It gives a lot of good advice but it also leaves out a lot that could help a lot more people. For example, it is hard to know what to do when you're trying to sell something. This book tells you that if you're going to sell a book, you need to write a good introduction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! I've been searching for something to read about the first black president's childhood that has a positive, upbeat ending. This book was it. I also like how this book is written by someone who is a part of the Barack Obama family. I wish I could have read this book when I was a kid!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, I'm not a great reader, but I can pick it up and I've found it to be very good.  It's also the first book that really made me realize the importance of having good knowledge about your area of interest.  This book helped me get my first job in the field of biology.  I would have been very lost without it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a fan of Richard Dawkins, but the most interesting thing about this book is how it describes the effects of the introduction of Islam into a society. This is a book that could easily have been about Judaism, but this is a must read for anyone who cares about history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most entertaining read I have ever had. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn more about history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking forward to this book since it was published in 2012, but I can't wait to get my hands on a copy again. I was very pleased with this book, and highly recommend it to any of you who love history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book about the role of women in American culture. I've read other books about feminism but this is the first one that I've been able to put down and go back to, and think about what the author is saying. I think I'm more than ready to accept that the majority of men in America are misogynists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book about the history of the world, from the Stone Age to the present. The writing is very clear, well thought out, and very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good one. The author was very clear and straightforward in his reasoning and ideas.  I liked the "why" of his writing.  It seems that he really cared about this subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. The first half was very informative about the history of the church, including the founding of the first Relief Society. It was very interesting to read about the various things that led to the end of polygamy, including Joseph Smith's relationship with Emma. The second half of the book was on the evolution of the LDS church.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very interesting study of the history of the concept of the "black card." The book is not so much about the history but the evolution of this idea. The idea that there are "black cards" in the game of poker and that black is good in some situations is an old one. Black is also a "bad" color. The black card is a sort of a self-inflicted handicap. The only thing it can't do is win the hand.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well-written book about the effects of environmentalism on our environment and human health. The main focus of the book is the connection between environmental degradation and the rise of cancer in the 1970s. The environmental movement's "Sustainable Agriculture" and "Sustainability" movement, as well as the increased pollution of our air and water, are clearly the cause of the increased cancer rates. The author shows that the environmental movement has also influenced the media and popular culture. He also shows how the environmentalist movement has corrupted our government and our schools.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books ever.  I was not expecting a story so full of romance, but this book did it with aplomb.   The writing is really wonderful and the story is just awesome.  This book is a must read for any book lover.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was extremely disappointed with this book.  It has all the elements of a bad book but doesn't do anything with them.  I found myself frustrated, frustrated, irritated and frustrated at how little the characters seemed to be doing with the story.  The characters are so shallow and shallow characters seem to be in this book all the time.  This is bad when you're expecting a good story.   The writing is bad.  Every sentence seems to be just a few words and there are many sentences that read like the author didn't care about the story at all and simply wrote it to get the characters to do something.  You can tell that the author is bored by the whole thing and wanted to use it as a way to pass the time, but that's a pretty poor excuse for a story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second time I have used this method to assist in the creation of a novel. The first time was with a book called "The First Law of Thermodynamics" by Robert A. Heinlein. The book was very readable and well-organized, but the process was a bit convoluted and time consuming. It took me several tries to get the book ready for publication, but it worked like a charm and made the process much easier and quicker. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.    It's like a good cookbook but more detailed and not as dry as most cookbooks.  It is fun to see all the different food recipes.  I especially enjoyed the recipe for chicken pot pie.  My family will never go to a restaurant for chicken pie ever again 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read for anyone who wants to learn how to write a good narrative with a strong beginning and end.  I highly recommend this book for anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book that you should own. I've read the other reviews and they are all about the romance, but it's so much more.   You don't need to know about the romantic aspect to enjoy the story, but I found myself reading it over and over and not really caring what happens, but what happens next. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing. I've always wanted to learn about the history of women's tennis, but I've never found a good one. This book covers it from all angles. I'm not sure what the big deal is about the US Open and the US team, but they're both great, fun, and well researched. I can't wait to dig into these great women's books for myself.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good textbook on the history of the Soviet Union and one of the most useful for a student of the history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a good way to introduce my daughter to the world of graphic novels (I've read all the ones I could find). This book was the best way to do it. The images and words were vivid, the prose clear and concise, and the art superb.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a lot of fun reading this book.   It's a great read and it's great to know the real story behind the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on the subject of how women deal with men who are inattentive, inconsiderate, and even dangerous.  This book should be in the library of every woman, man, and child who lives with an attention-deficient husband, father, or friend.  The author clearly addresses the most important issue facing the women of this society: how to handle these people.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to deal with a man who is inattention-a man who does not listen to you when you tell him he is doing something wrong. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading a number of good books about science lately and this one is just wonderful: it covers the history of the development of the atomic bomb from the very early days in the 1950s to the present day, in the context of nuclear proliferation and global security, and is a very interesting read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and presented. It is a very useful guide for those who want to understand the history of the Middle East.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book. I was going to read this at Christmas, but I was busy preparing for my baby's first birthday (I read this when she was born) so I missed it.    I'm glad I read it. It has been a good addition to my baby book shelf.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book to read for a friend who is into reading and has no desire to read, but has had a hard time putting her books down.   I'm so glad she read this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had this book for some time, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. It's about a guy who has a dream to become a musician. It seems that this guy is born with musical abilities, but he is never able to express them in a coherent way. The first few chapters are just him trying to figure out how to sing and playing his guitar. The last few chapters, however, are more about the way he interacts with his mother and sister. He starts to realize that he can play the piano (which he had never done before), but his mother keeps trying to stop him. He has a pretty good singing voice, but no idea what to do with it. He keeps trying different things, but nothing really comes out right. He just keeps working at it, but it's not coming out quite right. I found myself feeling a little bad for him throughout this book, but I guess that's what happens when you have a dream.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best of the bunch. I had been reading about the "Futures at Risk" papers, and having never heard of the group before I picked this one up. I have a degree in political science and I had always assumed that this was a group that would be all about the economic implications of the global economy. It turns out that they are really about how to change our behavior. What's more, I've heard from a number of people that the group does a great job at helping people understand that the way we think about economics and politics is often the wrong way to think about them. It's good to see a group like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book as much as the other authors.  It is very easy to read and has some great information about the life of Christ. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very enjoyable book about an interesting person. A good book about a person with an interesting life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well-written book about a very interesting man: a 19th-century Swiss-born scientist who, while studying the effects of a "fairy powder" on children, began to experience visions of angels, angels of death, and other forms of life. In a sense, this is the story of all the angels of the past and present: angels of science, angels who can be trusted. This book is a must read for those who want a good read about a fascinating man.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not familiar with this book but found it a great read.  It was a great example of what the real meaning of the Bible really is.  This book helped me to find my faith.  I'm looking forward to a few more readings on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always enjoyed the books by William F. Buckley and his ilk, and especially his work on the New Left.  I enjoyed the recent one, The Tyranny of Silence, but was a little disappointed in the ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is wonderful. I love the history of science and how it has changed in the last few hundred years.   It's really an amazing story about how the people of ancient Greece used science and reason to solve the mysteries of life and death.  It is also amazing that they were able to come up with such good solutions to these problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book as a teen, and I have been waiting for a book to come along to fill the gap in my adult reading.  This book fills that gap nicely, and is the sort of book that is difficult to put down.  The characters are memorable, and the plot is interesting enough to keep me reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am glad I picked up a copy of this book to help me understand what it's like to be a young gay man in the 1950's. This book does a very good job of describing the challenges faced by gay men at the time, but it also describes the people involved in the struggle to survive in such a difficult environment.  It is sad to read about the hardships many gays faced in this time period, but I'm glad that a book like this is out there to help us understand what people were thinking and feeling in this difficult time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very skeptical about this book, as I usually am about any "non-fiction" book about the US-Mexico border, but it is worth reading.   It tells the story of the rise and fall of the "Mexican Mafia", the first drug lords of the border, and the war they waged against the Mexican government for control of the lucrative drug trade.  It also includes some interesting insight into the drug trade by a former Mexican official, a former US border agent, and a US narcotics expert.  This is a fascinating story that would be well worth reading even if you don't have any interest in the border or drugs.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good reference book that I use in my writing classes on history.  It is also very useful for teaching the history of a specific area.  I will be using this book again in my classes.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. I was a bit confused by the title as I didn't realize there were any references to "snow" in the book, but the information is well worth it.    It's interesting to look at how different cultures react to the same winter weather. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was introduced to this book through the "My Secret Garden" books by the great Barbara Deming.   "MySecret Garden" is a series of biographies of secret gardeners.  These stories of the people who have done "magic" in the garden are so fascinating and magical, I can't stop reading them.  The author describes the plants and their use, but he doesn't go into the techniques of their use or how to get the most out of the plants.  It's interesting that he doesn.t describe the plants, but I'm not sure why.  His book is really well done and I'll be keeping my eyes out for more books in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because it was recommended to me by a friend.  The book is a good overview of the history of the Civil War.    It gives a good historical perspective of the conflict, and the battles and battles against slavery.  It also explains the reason for the war, and explains the impact of the war on the future of the American experiment.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good.  This is my first foray into the world of kundalini yoga and this book is an excellent resource.  The book covers the basic physiology and anatomy of kunda, and it also has a lot of great practice exercises for the practitioner.  There are some things that I would have liked to see addressed in the book, but these are minor nitpicks.  I was able to do the full set of the "Kunda" practice in one sitting with my body language and the guidance of the book.    I look forward to more of this from the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very readable and entertaining book about a very controversial topic, which is that a woman's vagina can get pregnant just by having sex.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think the book is a good introduction to the subject, and will make good use of some interesting research. The author is very well-informed on the subject matter, and the material he gives is presented well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very interesting and helpful in understanding the historical significance of the Bible. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. The author clearly has a good understanding of how to build a strong company. The book is divided into sections on how to set up an office, how to find the right people, how many people to hire, and how to manage people. The chapters are short and well organized, with a lot of examples to help illustrate each point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this as a Christmas present to myself. It is written very well and is filled with useful information about the subject matter. It may be the most useful book I have ever read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for those who are interested in the history of the Vietnam War but who have been disappointed by the many "official" histories which give little or no credit to the resistance fighters in Vietnam.    The only reason I have not already read this book is that I found the Vietnam resistance fighters to be unsympathetic, if not downright contemptible.  I am happy that a more complete, accurate, and sympathetic account is available now.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, well-written book. It's short, easy to understand and well-told. I'm glad it's available. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read! I've read a lot of books about the Civil War but I can't say I've seen a more accurate or detailed description of the Confederate army than this one.   It's also interesting to note that the Union Army didn't make many mistakes during the Civil war as compared to the Confederate's. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading a lot of sci fi lately, and this book, with it's wonderful, thought provoking story, and the wonderful illustrations, really got me thinking. It's not a perfect book, it's just about as close as one can get.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always loved stories about how people struggle with addiction, and this one is no exception. The author has a very compelling story to tell about a man who is diagnosed with cancer and finds himself in a very bad situation. His wife is unable to help him because she is addicted to pain killers, and so he does the only thing he knows how to do: he gets himself addicted to opiates.    (I've read about this sort of story before, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to get addicted to morphine. The idea is horrifying, but the execution is brilliant!)   I really enjoyed the book, and I can see why it's been a favorite of mine for years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a very serious issue: suicide. The author shows the author's anguish over her husband's death and explains how this has affected her. She also shows how important it is to be a good wife and mother and how she learned that. This book is also very helpful in showing you what is not right with the suicide prevention movement. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book by R.B. Russell very helpful and helpful to me as well.  I was not sure what to expect of the book, but I was surprised by how much I found helpful.    The author has a good voice and style, and I find myself using it often.  It's definitely a good read for people who want to learn more about the LDS Church.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have enjoyed a lot of the books I have read by Stephen King.  This one is no exception.  King does a good job of presenting a lot about the book and his life.    He gives us an accurate picture of the character.  I also enjoyed reading about the author's struggles with addiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been interested in the study of religion since I first discovered it as a teenager. This book gives a clear and well-supported argument for the benefits of religion to society. The author explains the benefits to society that come from religious people in general, but especially to those with disabilities.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading these books for a long time, but have finally found a book that I am willing to invest in.   This book covers the basics of learning a foreign language in the most straightforward way possible: you read it, you get some practice, you read some more, and so on.  I've been reading some of the books mentioned in the reviews but have found this to be a better book overall. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very good and contains valuable information about the occult and the hidden powers of the mind.  The author's explanations are easy to understand and his suggestions are useful.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting and well written book. I enjoyed reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good, well written book that I recommend to those interested in the subject matter.   The information in the book is very well presented, and the stories are both engaging and enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most important book on the subject I've read in a long time.  This book is a combination of a good history, a great analysis of the problem, and some interesting ideas.  I highly recommend it.  It's just the right amount of serious about the subject to make it all the more fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has some good things about it. It has a good deal of detail about the various ways in which the Church has been infiltrated and corrupted, but it is a bit too simplistic and naive to understand the full impact of the infiltration and corruption. It does give some good suggestions about what you can do about these things if you wish, but the rest of the book is too often about how bad these things are, not about how good it is to be Mormon.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's very well written and I'm a huge fan of David Foster Wallace. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that this is not a self-published book. I can't wait to read the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the result of a year's research into the relationship between music and the mind.  It is a very useful work on many levels, but I particularly like the discussion of the influence of the Beatles on the Beatles, and the impact of The Beatles on The Beatles.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was at university in the early 1990s. I have had it since and reread it several times. I think that this book is great for the younger students, because it doesn't tell them what to do or how to be. It gives a good description of what is involved in the production of a good text. It also provides some valuable pointers for the students as they go about writing their own texts, as well as some ideas about how to make a text good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading the "What the World Needs Now"  series of books and I'm so excited about this one!    I'm a huge fan of Paul Simon and "The New York Stories" and "I Have Always Loved You"   and I really enjoyed this one.   This is a beautiful, tender and moving memoir. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a fascinating look at how religion and the paranormal intersect in our society.  In a way, it's a bit depressing that the majority of religious folks have been taught that the world is just too evil to be trusted, but then you realize that a lot of religious belief systems can be used for good purposes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was able to make use of a lot of great material in this book. This is a good basic guide for all levels of learning a language: grammar, pronunciation, reading, writing. It's definitely not an in-depth guide but rather a basic introduction.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   It's a great mix of philosophy and practical advice, with a healthy dose of humor and insight.  It really hits all the right notes.  The only downside is that the author is a bit too quick to write about other philosophers in the field.  I've found that the best philosophy is the one that you can practice by thinking about it.  (Which is a good thing too.) 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading The Good Soldier by David McCullough for some time.  I am a Vietnam veteran.  My parents were in the same unit as he was.  This book is very informative and informative, and well written.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book, although I don't know if I'd recommend it to others as a good "graphic novel". I found the graphic style distracting, but that was my only real complaint. I also didn't care for the ending, but the story was still enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful and highly readable account of the rise and fall of the Jewish "national movement" in the late 20th century. The author does a wonderful job explaining how the American Jewish establishment was instrumental in bringing about the destruction of the Third Reich.  I especially appreciated the way he dealt with the question of why the American Jews had not tried to destroy the Third Temple.  He clearly demonstrates that they were simply not motivated to do so.  It also seems that the author's research in this area is thorough.  His book is excellent and will help those interested in this subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that this book is not a self-help book about how to deal with bad people. The authors have the right idea, but they seem to have made the wrong choices, in the wrong order, and in a wrong order at that. If you are dealing with a bad person who is so self-centered that you have no choice but to deal calmly with them, then the right way to go about it is to find out as much as you can about them. If your goal is to learn about how you can deal with this person to get a better outcome, you need to do more than read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only read a few books by P. D. James, but this one in particular is a definite keeper.  It's not a perfect book, and I don't find much about the historical period she's writing about particularly interesting, but it's a well-written book with plenty of historical and cultural information that is worth the read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title says it all: "When I met you, I thought you were dead." The author makes the case that the author's "self-loathing and narcissism" caused her to develop "a deep and abiding hatred of all people with a healthy sense of self-worth." The result is a fascinating examination of what is commonly considered the most shameful part of human nature: the desire to feel that one is "special." If I had been a woman who had suffered the death of a child, I might have been tempted to become the self-absorbed "bad girl" in the book. In the end, however, I was more moved by the fact that the self is a powerful thing that can be redeemed. The author's analysis of the way we feel we are special and the reasons we hate ourselves for it are fascinating and helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I have read a novel about a lesbian relationship (not counting the short stories I've read about lesbians).  As such, I was expecting to feel disappointed by the book, but I actually found it very interesting.  I also found myself liking several of the characters more than others.  Overall, I felt that the book was interesting and that I was able to see some of the character's motivations and the development that occurs throughout the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book.  The author makes good use of a good example, which is the famous story of the little boy in China who was asked to write the first page of a book. He could not do it, so he sat down on a rock and wrote the whole thing.  His father said to him:  "I know that kid.  That's what he's good at."  This book is a good illustration of how you can't always rely on the way things are.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a huge fan of   Hilary Mantel since I read  The English Patient  in the 90's. This is my favorite Mantel novel, and probably my favorite book ever.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the importance of faith. I've been through many of the trials that he describes and I'm still going strong. I can't recommend this book highly enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best science book I've ever read. I'm not a scientist, but I do have a good general knowledge about it. I also read the book a year ago, and found it interesting and well written. I can see the appeal for a non-scientist. The book is well done and the explanations are interesting.  I found it very interesting to read the different kinds of "probes" and their methods.  It really got me thinking about some of the more ridiculous ideas that have been proposed to explain what is going on.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book. It is not a difficult book but it does require a certain level of self discipline to stay focused on the task at hand. I have read a lot of "self help" books and have been a lot more successful with my own problems than I would have been with someone else's, but this one was very well put together.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant book on the science and history of a subject of great interest to me, but not necessarily in a good way.  It's not just a good introduction to the topic, it's a good read too, with many fascinating tidbits and good examples of the scientific method and its limitations.  I've enjoyed reading this book so far, and I'm glad I bought it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that was a joy to read.  It's not an easy read by any means, but the story was engaging and had me looking forward to the next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I have ever been able to read about a character like that. I really enjoyed the story and the story is so good, I can't wait to read the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most important thing about this book is the excellent book jacket. It tells the story so well that the story is the most important part. It is not that I needed a sequel to this book to get my story told, it is that I wanted to hear the story that was told in the book. This book will be a valuable reference for anyone interested in the Civil War era. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! I have a few other books on my Kindle, but this one is my favorite. I'm a huge fan of the original book and this one takes the best of the two. I don't remember exactly when I picked up the original but I remember loving it so much that I bought a second copy. This book is great too!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is interesting, but it could have been shorter. I've already finished it but will have to look at it again when I'm done.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  I read it in three days, and finished it in about six days.  The story has a good story to it.  My daughter loved it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of "The Great War" until reading the reviews of this book.  This book is excellent, very well researched and the stories of the characters are very believable.  I was looking forward to reading more about the lives of the American soldiers who fought in the war.  The only drawback to this book is the use of the term "disloyal."  The word seems to imply that these people were disloyal to the United States, but it's not quite that simple.  It is true that many of the men who were captured in France were captured on suspicion of disloyalty.  Some were indeed captured by French soldiers on suspicion, but most were caught on the battlefield.  A number of these men were captured by the British as well.  There is nothing wrong with disloyal soldiers.  In fact, some of them were very patriotic, but they were also often poorly trained and poorly equipped.  Many were sent home to their families in the United Kingdom, and had to make a living for themselves.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author of this book, J. M. Coetzee, has a real talent for creating a believable and memorable world that makes the world of magic a lot more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good overview of a topic.  It's well-written and presented, with good examples, which is a must for an introductory text on a subject.  The content is well-researched, and the authors provide a good analysis of the historical evidence, but I found that it lacked a good deal of the depth and scope that I expect a good introduction should have.  In my opinion, this should have been an intermediate text or perhaps a companion to some other book on the same topic, such as The Great Wall of China: Construction and Control.  If you are a historian or researcher interested in the topic, but not sure where to start, this might be the right one for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent summary of the "why" of the whole issue of whether or not the moon landing was faked or not.  This isn't a definitive answer to the question.  However, it does give us a pretty good idea of why we believe the moon landings are a hoax, and why it is important that we do.  The author provides a good overview of the evidence, but this is an area where we can always do better, and I'd like to see more books on the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good read. The main characters are very well developed, and there are several very funny situations along the way. I like the way the story is presented:  "My husband is a good driver and we're very good friends. One night he drove me around in his brand new Mercedes-Benz. It was all fine. It rained, it was wet, but it was a Mercedes, so I was just fine. When we got back to my house, he came home and told me that he was very drunk and that the steering wheel was spinning and he had to take it apart. He then went to bed. I was very surprised to find that I had slept through most of the night."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book in order to find out more about the world of magic.   This book is the first in a series which will continue the author's work.  It will be a great addition to my collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I have been talking about having children since she was in college. She has always been a very good mother. I was not a great mother but she was a good mother, I was always able to pick her up when she fell down and she was always looking after me.   Now we have been through some health problems in the last few years and she has had a lot of them, but when it comes to giving birth she is still a very very good mom. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the history of Western civilization. It is also very well written and a nice example of the work of historians. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read several biographies of men who were in the early stages of becoming famous:  William Randolph Hearst  and  Robert E. Lee  both of whom were famous before they became famous.    I really enjoyed this book.  It's a good look at the early days of Elvis Presley.  This is the first biography I've had in a while that wasn't just a biography about Elvis and his music.  The book has a lot to say about Elvis' early days, but I also appreciated that the author is writing about Elvis not as a musician but as a performer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book. It is a good introduction to the subject. I found it easy to read and was impressed with the author's knowledge of the subject and his thorough research. I look forward to reading more by him in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best history books ever written.  It is written by a man who was a major participant in WWII and was an eyewitness to many things.  The author was a Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps and flew in several raids.  He also wrote about the war in his diary.  This book is full of interesting facts and interesting insights about the Second World War.  I especially like the section on the Battle of Britain and how it changed the course of the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was an excellent read.  I'm glad I read it.  The author has a knack for writing about topics that seem obvious, but are still important.  It's very well written, easy to read, and makes sense.  This is a good read for people who are interested in the human side of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book!   This is a brilliant, insightful book.   In a nutshell, a man in his late 40's, in a state of depression, goes to a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist tells him that his brain is wired in a certain way, and he has depression.  It's not a disease that he has, but rather a symptom of a different one:  a personality disorder.  He has a good psychiatrist, and she knows how to treat it.  But, he can't get rid of it.  He's trapped by it, and unable to change it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book about the early years of the Soviet space program, a great deal of which was conducted at the Soviet Institute of Thermal Technology.    I have been working on this book for a long time and it's great to finally be able to put it down and be done with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! I found myself really looking forward to reading the next few chapters, even though the ending is very disappointing.   It's a good read, though, especially for someone who is a "non-reader" (and I really was for a while)  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about the history of the American civil war. The first part about the southern and western forces was the most interesting part of the book. The history of both sides of the war is good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good little book that I read and enjoyed. I found it very interesting and educational. I recommend it highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know how I missed this book, but when I finally found it, I was very pleased.  This book is very comprehensive and I think that it's a very good overview of the history of the American Civil War, including the war with the Indians.  The book covers a wide variety of topics: Native American warfare, the battle for the Mississippi, the "Glorious" war, and the siege of Vicksburg.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I've ever read anything by someone who doesn't have a Ph.D. or a teaching position. I thought this book was pretty good, although I'm not entirely sure why I should be interested in "teaching" history. It seems to me that the main purpose of history teaching is to make a living. I don't know how I can reconcile the two. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   The information is very useful and I have a couple of other books on my shelf that I'll be reading soon  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book The First 100 Days: A President's Daily Briefing in order to learn about how Presidents handle foreign policy.  I think the book is good for the following reasons: 1.   The author has a great understanding of the history of U.S. foreign policy and a solid understanding of U,S. President Barack Obama's approach to foreign policy in comparison to that of previous presidents.  This is important to know because the book describes how Obama handles foreign policy as a foreign policy expert.  The book also describes how President George W. Bush handled foreign policy but not the same degree as Obama.  2.      I found the book interesting in terms of its presentation of the U. S. President.  President Obama does not present himself as a leader of the free world.  Obama appears to believe that the United States is the world's only superpower and that he should be seen as a world leader.  These beliefs are reflected in his approach to international affairs.  In fact, I believe that President Obama is the most dangerous foreign policy leader since the Cold War because he does not have a clear understanding of global politics and he believes that the world is a chessboard in which he can take his pawns and place them anywhere he wants.  3.  It was interesting to see how President Obama handled the issues related to the war in Iraq.  His approach to Iraq was more of a pragmatist approach in comparison with the Bush Administration's more confrontational approach.  After all, President Bush believed that the war would bring about democracy in Iraq but President Obama did not believe that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, and I enjoyed the story. I would like to see a third book about the same character, as well as the sequel to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of different types of literature in my lifetime.   This one really stands out as one of the best.  I recommend it highly to all who enjoy the art of writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that is written for the modern reader who is interested in the history of the Middle Ages.  The book has all the historical information that you would want.  It's not a complete history but it gives a great overview of the history and life of the medieval world.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this before. It's a pretty good book and I'm glad I've picked it up.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very informative and I found it very helpful. I am in a state of confusion because I was told the same thing by someone else. I'm very thankful for this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was hesitant to pick up this book because of my history with the D.A.R.K.   As a student of psychology at a community college, I thought the group was a lot of mental deviltry, but that didn't stop me from buying the book.  I can't tell you how happy I am that it's been out for so long, as I would have been terrified to learn about it as a young student. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 4 years ago, and I've loved it ever since.   This book has changed my life.  I don't do many of the things I did when I was a teen- and the more I do it, the more it feels like a good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so grateful to my mother for giving me this book to read.  This is my first book by the great Carl Sagan (although I read about his great work in my younger years), and I have a good sense of his writing style.  I found that this book was well-written, and that Sagan, unlike many other scientists, had a sense of humor.  It was a very enjoyable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be very well-written. It was very interesting reading about a man who tried to run a "black" newspaper and failed. He had a lot of problems with his black employees. However, I was interested to learn more about his experiences in other black communities. It is great to see the negative experiences black people have in other communities. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's so long.    It's hard to put into words how it makes me feel after finishing it.  I've had to put my phone on silent before reading it to myself.  It makes me think about the people that make up my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first few chapters of this book were not very interesting. It did get better after that but I was a little worried about how much the author knew about the topic at the beginning. But I think the author has done a really good job of presenting the information in a way that makes it understandable and entertaining to the average reader. I also liked that she explained some of the terminology I was not familiar with.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It's really well written and has been thoroughly enjoyed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. The characters were likable.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has everything that a beginner wants to know about learning a foreign language: grammar, vocabulary, grammar rules, a good vocabulary, a grammar book, and so on.   I was very impressed by how much detail the author has put into the grammar rules.  It makes learning the language a lot easier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good reference book on the subject. It gives a thorough history of the development of the concept.  I enjoyed reading it as much as reading "The Secret of Money" by John Kenneth Galbraith.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book when it first came out in the late 80's, and had it on my shelf until I read The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Improvement.   There is no better explanation of the differences between being a realist and a dreamer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. I was very impressed with the fact that it was written by a woman. The story is simple, but the main character has so much depth that it is difficult to put down.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only problem I had with the book is that the title is a little misleading: it describes a novel as a "haunting" book, but the author makes the main character seem more like a nightmare than a ghost.  However, if you like horror novels or novels about ghosts, I recommend this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very informative. It shows that the United States is a major force in the world, but is also a significant obstacle for other countries. It is interesting to see that the U.S. has always been the "back bone" of the Western alliance, and the primary cause of all of the problems that have befallen the West. It has always tried to be in control of the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a few of the others by this author, and I think I've enjoyed them better. This is a good read, and it's fun to look at some of the characters and their actions. I think this one is the best of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had this book for about a year now and have read it through several times. It's good to have some more information about the game of baseball.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because it was a free one. It's the first book by a great American writer about a major American city. It gives a real insight into the people who live in a place like New York. I have been to many cities around the world and this was the first place I have visited where people were genuinely nice to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book about a very peculiar person who lived very peculiarly. I would love to have a copy of it to study on my own. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very interesting. As a psychologist, I find it hard to get an objective view on anything.  This is my first foray into the topic, and I found this book very helpful.  It is important to be honest about our limitations and how we might overcome them.  The author gives many examples of how this can be done, but it is a very individual process.  In the end, we all need to be better people in order to overcome our limitations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that this book was made available in English.  It is not a perfect book but it is worth reading.  I used to read it in Japanese but I can't read the Japanese in the books available.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good story about a great teacher and her family. A very positive book that shows how hard we work to achieve our goals.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has some great ideas that will help anyone understand the benefits of the diet.    It would have been nice if the author had been able to give the reasons for some of the foods listed, instead of merely listing them.  The author does a good job of covering the different components of a balanced diet, but it's the little details that will make or break your diet.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. The author's style is engaging and the text is easy to read. This book has a good story, although the ending is not satisfying to me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the origins of Christianity. There are many good details about how the New Testament is translated.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on the history of Western philosophy.  A lot of the information is familiar to anyone who has spent time studying Western philosophy, but the examples of the thinkers that it covers are new.  This book is a good introduction to the topics covered, and it covers them well.  The book covers most of the major thinkers in Western philosophy that we know today: Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Hume's student David Hume, and Kant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've ever read that had such a profound effect on me. I used to be very afraid of having a mental illness. It seemed so dangerous and uncontrollable. I've had a few close calls in my life and I still can't get over my OCD. But the thing is, I learned so much from this book. I learned to love myself for who I am, not for how I look, my clothes, my personality, or my looks in general. The best part was that I can now understand how other people feel. It's hard to put into words what that means to me. It helps me understand why I have so much anxiety, but it also helps me feel less anxious. The book has been so helpful to me, that I just had to write a review about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good little book that will keep you on your toes.  It is very well-written and a good read.  The writing style is a little dated (like a book from the 50's), but that doesn't make the book any less good.  This book will keep me on my toes until I find a good historical fiction that does not contain a character who is either the victim of an injustice or a perpetrator.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book, the only thing that bothered me was that the plot seems like a rehash of The Great Gatsby.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the great men of the past who did things differently from the modern times. This book is very helpful, even if it is not a very good book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought the book about a woman who was a high school teacher, but who was also a very gifted composer. She composed music for all kinds of shows including the movie "The Wizard of Oz". I was intrigued and was very happy to get the book for a good price. The writing is very good, the pictures are very well drawn and the book is well organized.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a gift to me after reading the book.    The story was simple but had an intense emotional impact on me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the history of American slavery that I have read. I have used this book as a teaching tool on the subject for my American history classes.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am really glad I finally got a copy of The Good Lord Bird. It's about a girl that goes on a quest to save a young boy from a bad family. This is such a wonderful book and really good to read, even though I am still a bit on the fence about whether or not I'll get a copy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read that has actually touched my life. I was looking for a book that I can read alone in the privacy of my home, but this book was a good fit.  It's a good example of how people in business can be a little...unrealistic about what is possible in the world of business.  I can see how a young, fresh-faced person like myself could get frustrated.  But when I saw how they were able to survive, it really hit me.  When they were out of business, it wasn't because they were incompetent, but because they never gave up.  That's the kind of attitude I'm going to try to cultivate in my life in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after having been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. I was very intrigued and interested in learning more about this syndrome.   Aspergers is a very misunderstood condition.  It is an extremely difficult disorder to live with.  I learned a lot about my condition, but it didn't really take away the mystery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a very interesting person. The best part about reading this book is the author's description of the person in the book: "He was so tall, his face was almost invisible. His eyes were a strange deep blue. His hair was a dark brown. His face was square. His arms were long. He wore a blue blazer. He carried a briefcase. He spoke with a Southern drawl. He had a habit of wearing his socks at the same time as his shoes. He liked a good cigar. He smoked a cigarette after breakfast. His voice was warm. He was a very pleasant man. He made his own bed. He kept his room neat and clean." 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a copy of The Red Badge of Courage as a present for my father from his former college roommate, a Russian officer who served in the second World War and later became a U.S. ambassador to Moscow. He died in 2007, but I haven't heard a bad thing about him.  He is a fascinating man, and The Red-Bordered Badge is full of the sort of personal anecdotes that make a good war story: his time in the U.K. during the war, his travels to Russia during the cold war, and his time as a U-2 pilot, all of which were covered well by the book.  It's also a nice tribute to a man who, despite the bad times he was in, was still a gentleman and a good man.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am now in my second year of taking this course and it is still great!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the most insightful and insightful books I've ever read about anything.    The book focuses on how the history of women's work and the ways that they were oppressed were often overlooked.  In a sense, this book is a call to women to re-evaluate their own roles in the workplace.  It is a great reminder that in many ways, our jobs are more important than the jobs we have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read about 10 books in my life that I thought were really good.   This is one of them.  The stories are well told, the descriptions are vivid and the writing is very clear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book very well written.  I enjoyed the characters and found it interesting that they were both from the same country.  It made me wonder if one of the characters would marry one of their parents, or if they would be forced to have a child to save face.  The ending was a bit disappointing, but the story kept me wanting more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only book that has given me hope that I can become a writer. It is the first time I've read any writing. It also is the book that inspired me to become a freelance writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, which is the first in a series about a young man's relationship with his dead father.  The author has written a lot of good books about families, but this one is my favorite.  This book shows that if you are trying to be true to your family, it will probably not be easy, but it will be worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book I had to write.  The author is very good at describing her experiences, but the content of the book is too much to take on at one time.  She is an excellent writer and her stories are a delight.  It is a great time for her to be able to write again.  This book should be required reading for anyone interested in mental health.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was very young, and as a result I am still very fond of the story.  This book does not just contain the adventures of two boys, but of a family, a town and a country.  It is a true family affair.  The characters in the book are all well drawn, and the book is a nice, well written read.  My daughter is a big fan of these kind of books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of great tips and tricks, and I've had it for a few years now.  This is one of those "you need to read this" books that will save you hours.  I'm going to keep it handy on my night stand and always use it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It's not a perfect book. There are problems with it. I had to make a number of changes because I didn't think they were necessary.   One problem was the way the author used some of the quotes as if they were a part of the story. I felt that it didn't add anything to the story (except for the fact that the author was quoting a famous book).  Another problem is the way he describes the people in the book: they don't make the best out of their situation.  The book is also a bit short at about 1,000 pages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to the history of modern physics.   The author takes a wide variety of physicists, and combines them into a more cohesive narrative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.  I loved it so much I bought it twice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read the book and found it very interesting and well written.   This book is a good overview of the history of the USM, including how the organization came to be, how the members have developed the skills and abilities they possess, and how they operate to carry on the traditions and ideals of the organization. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books where I kept having to read the same thing over and over again just to understand it. I'm sure there are many great stories in this book, but I found it to be a little repetitious. The book is not bad, just repetitive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book very much. It is very well researched and well written. I also like the way she used different types of evidence in her book. It has many examples that will give you an idea of what is really going on. I hope she continues to write more books like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the story of how he went from a normal, middle-class life to becoming a successful artist to be very interesting and thought-provoking. The story of his relationship with his mother and his struggle to overcome his childhood depression is very moving. I enjoyed reading about him as a child growing up with a single mother.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series, and have been since the beginning. I bought this in paperback because I didn't have a hard copy.  It is a wonderful book, with lots of beautiful illustrations and the information you need about a wide variety of topics.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading this one last night while I was waiting for my kids to get to bed. I'm an English major but was struggling to grasp the intricacies of the story. I got it, and it's definitely worth a read, even though I was a bit overwhelmed at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read this book multiple times and it is still the best book I have ever read about the Vietnam war. It was very helpful in understanding some of the more complicated details about the war, but it wasn't a quick read.  I liked the "what if" scenario that led up to the decision to go into the war and the various decisions that had to be made in order to make it happen.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a few chapters before I started the book and I was so glad I did.   The story was so well done that I felt like I had been transported to a fantastic land. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not a great book in the end.       It's not terrible.  It has some good ideas but it does not have a lot of them.  I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got the book at the library when I was having a hard time with my homework.  The book is short but very good and it explains how to properly put a bow on a piece of string.  I learned this the hard way so I can now use it with ease.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic that has stood the test of time. I remember reading it as a child and loving it. The author was a great storyteller and was able to capture the essence of his characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a copy of "The Book of My Dreams" from a friend who read it. This book is amazing. I am a very bad reader and the first few times I read it, I was like a child who has never been good at reading. The book made me realize I was good at it. I learned to read, I just had to practice. It is a beautiful story and I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. It covers the topic of "how do you get into the business of writing novels" and gives a few examples to show how to get a novel published.   I'm not a writer but I can tell you that it takes a lot more than a good plot to get me interested in writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read this book for quite a while now. I don't have a high opinion of the book, but I can appreciate its style.   I also enjoy the way the author is able to capture both the positive and negative aspects of the history of the Church.  I think the author could have done a better job of highlighting the positive aspects, but it is still an interesting read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well-written, well-researched book about the creation of the United States.   I was fascinated by the process of the creation and the subsequent loss of the Union as well as the rise of the nation as a nation of states.  The book is interesting because of the authors' insight and willingness to share information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed reading this book, because it is a good, short, entertaining story about a young man who was involved in a big battle against the Soviets.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been a fan of the series since I first read it as a kid. This is my second book in the series, and I really enjoyed it. The characters are more interesting than ever, and the plot is well written. I can't wait to see what happens next in the book series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so glad I read this book! I found it very interesting and informative, so much so that I have bought several of her books. It's great that she covers some of the topics that I've never heard about, like how women in the mid-1800's were expected to have multiple husbands. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read.  The book starts off strong with the character of Darrow.  He is a brilliant but immature man, and the book is built around his misadventures and failures with women.   It is the stories of the other characters in the book that make it worth reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a great book about a great man.   The main character is really well developed and his journey from a young boy to an old man is very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book in a series of books on "the best of the best" books about women's history.    The first book is the best, the second is better, and the third is not much of a step up from the second.  These books are very much geared towards women and their lives, but the women they're about, and how they're written about, are just as interesting, if not more so.  I read this book because I've been looking forward to it for a long time.  It's great fun to learn about women from the past who had a very different and interesting life than us, and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have read about the Holocaust ever! A true and honest look at the death camps and the people who lived in them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was great for me as a young woman trying to learn about feminism and my feelings about it.  The author explains that feminism is about a movement for equality between the sexes and that it's not about equality for women in general.  In fact, women are a very important part of the movement.  As someone who works in the office of a women's magazine, this book helped me to understand how to be a better feminist and how to make my own decisions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a prequel to my own novel, and it makes a great deal of sense, even though I'm not really a fan of sci-fi.   The characters in the two stories are both extremely strong. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been meaning to read this book since I read it in high school but had never gotten around to it. This is a very good book. The stories about the people who worked for the government during the Great Depression are quite funny.  The book is well written and the illustrations are wonderful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved the premise for this book.   It's a fantasy that involves a princess being kidnapped by the evil king, and a prince and a thief coming to save her.  I'm always interested in princesses, but especially when they're a little bit out of their league.  This book had me rooting for the thief (who's actually a pretty bad person) to get the princess.  Even though he was a bit of a bad guy, the princess is still my favorite.  It also gave me the opportunity to play a little with the idea that if a princess can be kidnapped, then anything can be.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great for all ages, and really helps to explain the workings of the human mind. I really liked it and will definitely read it again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read "The Book of Job" I had to put it down. I couldn't get into it.   I'm glad that I read it again, though. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good read.  I was always taught to write by my father.  He is very good at that too.   The illustrations are very good.  This is a great book for the kids.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the Twilight books, and this is a good one.   It is written in a more modern manner, but the story is really good.  It makes you feel that these vampires are like real people who live their lives like people who actually have normal relationships with real people.  I just wish the book came out sooner rather than later. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book that has a lot of good ideas. It has a good feel to it. It's well organized and easy to read.   I am now thinking about how I can write a book like this for myself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the new edition of this book - it is a very nice book, the photos are good, and it's very useful.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.   It was not a bad book, just not the book I expected from an author who has such a long history of good books.  The writing style is smooth and concise, the plot is intriguing, and the characters are well-developed.  While it was not my favorite book from her list, I was very pleased with the purchase and look forward to reading more of her works.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've only read a few chapters, but the concept of the book is very interesting. It was very helpful to know how one would be treated if the government wanted to make money off of a specific topic. It's also very interesting to see how the government would respond to the threat of this type of technology. I think that if the military wanted to get rid of "snooping" technology, it could easily buy it off of the market.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative thing about this book is the fact that I didn't like the author's voice. It is very stiff and unnatural. I don't really know how to explain it other than that he sounds a lot like a college professor. That is not a bad thing in itself but it made me cringe a bit. The book has a great premise, and I look forward to reading more by him.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read.  A good book that will give you lots of ideas.  It also gives a great overview of some of the different types of woodworking.  If you are not very familiar with how to make boards, then this book is definitely something you need to check out.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great introduction to the world of science fiction.   The author does a good job of describing the scientific methods used to make the books more believable and, of course, the fantastic stories that have been made into films. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book about a life well lived is always a good read.   This book, however, is especially memorable for me.  A great example of a person who made the right choice in life 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that is really not about anything in particular.  It's a great overview of some interesting ideas about what it means to be a human.  The author talks about his own evolution and then uses some of the same ideas to discuss the development of a human from a baby to a child.  This was very interesting and I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the historical relationship between the Church and the abolitionists. I enjoyed reading this book a lot, and it gives a good insight into the history of the Church's relationship with the abolitionist movement.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about the Jewish faith and how it has changed over the centuries. It's interesting how much it has stayed the same. The story about Jesus is one of the best I've read. I can't wait to read the other books in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very readable, well-written book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished a very good book on the history of Christianity. It is well researched and interesting. I like the fact that the author is writing about things that were not known or debated at the time, so she gets to tell a bit about things we didn't know about and that the Christians at the beginning of the Christian church were still talking about.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a soft spot for this book.  It's a funny story about an author's trip to a desert island (in this case, the "island of lost ideas") and the adventures he encounters there.   The main character, Mark Twain, is in no way a typical author, but he certainly has the personality for it.  He doesn't write for the sake of writing; he writes because he wants to say something about something he sees in the world.  His main character is just as interesting as he is.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best way to describe the world in which the author lives is to say that it is the kind of place you'd expect to find a black person or a Muslim. The author has created a world in her own image--a kind of heaven in the middle of hell.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book after reading the description, but it did not come with a copy of the book.   When I received the book, I thought that it was not a good deal and would be a waste of money.  When the book arrived I was very pleased with the book: I learned a lot and enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. It's about the experiences of a group of students at a high school that was built to accommodate students from economically struggling areas of the city. They were segregated into the middle schools and the low schools and they struggled to find a way to fit in with the rest of the students at the school. It made me wonder about the kinds of problems that a group that had very different backgrounds might encounter.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started my journey in philosophy.   I was a skeptic.  I thought philosophy was a waste of time.  And I thought that science was the best way to know anything.  But when I read about Plato's cave I started to see things differently.  It was the first time I had ever read a book about anything that had any practical value. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, but this book by Chris Ware really made me want to give the genre another go. The characters were well drawn and well defined, and I felt that the story was told well and at a good pace. I enjoyed reading this book a lot, even if I am a little biased, but if you're looking for a good read, I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the first book I read about the Holocaust.    It was also the first time I thought about it.  It is very sobering and sobering. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just finished a fascinating book on the relationship between science and religion. I have been a strong supporter of science but the fact that there are so many scientists who support religious beliefs has been very surprising to me. I was not expecting to find any religious statements but I was quite surprised by the number of statements which could not be classified as religious. I am sure there are many examples where scientists, as part of their work, have felt that their work was so important that it needed to be given priority over other aspects of their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first of a few volumes in a series that I really like. The first one, "The Great War," is excellent. The second one, on the other hand, is a good read but the ending just sucks.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about the Holocaust. It's also the best book I've read in a long time about the Jews. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. As a huge lover of fantasy, it's always nice to be able to find a good novel set in a world I love. This is one of those books. The world is believable and the characters are complex, interesting and likable. It's also a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The reason that this is the best book I've ever read is that it is so utterly hilarious, and I mean that in the nicest possible way.  The main character's father, a guy named Dave, is the only person in his family that actually listens to him.  He also makes great suggestions for what he would have done differently, and the result is a book that is just full of advice on how to improve your life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been using this book as a quick reference book for my students, both elementary and high school.   In a few pages I'm able to answer the most basic questions about the different kinds of birds, and I can keep track of the species I have available in my collection.  I'm also glad to know that the bird's anatomy is much the same as mammals, but that's okay because I don't care what a bird's nose looks like, and neither does anyone else.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. It is an interesting study of a topic of some interest to me: why the United States is not the best country in the world for business (as opposed to a country with no business but plenty of opportunity). It is well-written and well-documented. The author goes out of his way to avoid political incorrectness (although he has a tendency to do that), but he doesn't try to avoid it either. It seems to me that, given that business is so important to America, and that the US government has a large role in it, this topic deserves a good analysis and thorough treatment.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  The writing is superb.   The illustrations are superb.      I have a few friends who have the same name as one of their parents, but none of them ever had a book like this.  I'm going to get it to add to my collection.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book on a whim because it was the first in a series on "The Story of Jesus". The book is good and not just for "The Jesus" but for all of the early Christian "myths". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the first book in the series, The Red Queen's War  (a fantastic series in general),   and was disappointed in the ending.   The author makes some good points about the nature of magic and the dangers of a single, powerful magic user, but then the main character is left with no choice but to follow a bad, selfish, selfish man's orders.  I think that's a big problem. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very well written and interesting.  The history of the American Revolution is very well covered, but I was a bit confused about the origins of the US Constitution.  I am a great admirer of the founders and the document is very significant, but what was the impetus behind creating a system of government so based on representative government?  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is very good.    It's a good read for kids who don't want to read about science but still want to see a little of what science is about.  I think there's a great future in science for kids, and The Boy is an example of that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for kids to read, as it presents a very realistic, yet entertaining, picture of the world in the early twentieth century.   It is a very readable book that will entertain young readers long after they have finished their books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book that is very well written and extremely well researched.  It is based on actual events and the way they have been portrayed by the press.   It's great to see the real people involved in the stories.  I've heard all of the criticisms about how the book was written, but I found it a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a writer, I've been disappointed by so many of the stories in the last few years. But, the one I was most excited about was, "The Secret of a Beautiful Mind." This was one of the few books I had seen that I'd have to go back to read. The way the author used the story of the "Mona Lisa" to explain the way the mind works, made it a real eye-opener for me. It has a lot of good points about human thinking and reasoning that are worth taking a look at, as well as the book's "The Mind's Eye" metaphor of the mind. It's not a bad book by any means, but it's a bit dated now, and I wouldn't go so far as to call it a must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only recently read this book, and I can say that I have been a fan of Maugham's since he first came out. This book is well-researched and extremely well-written.   It's not as good as the "Rip Van Winkle" series, but it is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read about religion.   It has a good balance between serious and humorous observations.  The author is smart, fair, and entertaining.  I hope to see him on Oprah or Good Morning America.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the series about a very smart boy with a great sense of humor, and his two best friends, a girl and a guy. It's a great read, and I love how each character is developed with a little bit of humor thrown in for good measure.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a woman who is interested in historical fiction, I was very happy to find this book. I love historical fiction and this book is one of the best.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm glad I finally read this one.  It's been a long time coming, but I'm happy that it's finally finished.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about one of the most influential men in American history: Abraham Lincoln.   The book is extremely well-written, well-researched, and well-organized.    I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only good thing about the book is that I got to meet the author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, so when I read the synopsis of this one I knew that I had to read it. It took a couple of tries to get into the story, but once I did I enjoyed it immensely. The writing style is excellent and the book is a great read. I will definitely be picking this book up for my next read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've read. The story is very well written. It's a good story, but I really enjoyed it more when I found out who the main character was.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book. It is the first I've heard of this group and their program.  It's been a few years since I heard of them, but I am now a regular attendee of their meetings.  The emphasis on the relationship between the body and mind is so true, it has been the key to my recovery.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book very interesting and well written.  I think the information was presented in a way that was easy to understand.  The fact that the book is so short also helped.  My only criticism is that some of the information is not given in detail.  For example, I am told that there is a genealogy of the Kabbalah that dates back to a "thirteenth century rabbi named Hillel"  However, the first mention I found about it was from the "Early Modern Period" and the name that comes up is "Rabbi Nachman ben Yosef"  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was surprised how good this book was. The first chapter was not the best, but by the end of the book, the writing really picked up. This is not a book that can be easily read by a kid.  I got lost and really thought that I was reading about a child and her dad.  The book did a good job explaining what it meant to be a child, how we got that way, and what it means to be grown up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really good.   It's an interesting book about what it means to be a white American male and the ways that I can and have been affected by those feelings.  The title is a little misleading as it does not go into great detail about the ways in which the author felt the same feelings that the white male characters in the book did but instead focuses on how that effect has affected him.  He writes about how his white privilege has made it hard for him to connect with other people of color as they have different experiences and different perceptions of the world.  I think that this book is a good read if you are looking for a book that can give you a perspective on the way white people feel about people of other races. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the history of the Korean people, not about Koreans as a people. The author is a good writer, but he doesn't give a lot of detail about Korean history or the Korean language. But it's an interesting read for people who want to learn more about the Korean history.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is good.   The characters are interesting, the plots are clever and it's easy to see why the author has won so many awards. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I found myself very much in love with the characters. I think this is a wonderful example of a fantasy world with a good plot. This is a very entertaining read."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little wary of this book, but the reviews are great.   It's an entertaining read about a few different women and their adventures in an old school Victorian England.  The stories are very well written and very well told.  I'm glad I got to learn more about some of the people I met.  It was nice to learn about some other women who were not "the woman" I'd been told they were. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book.   It is an interesting look into the lives of two different women who have been married for 40 years and had 3 children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to help my daughter with her math homework. She is very good at it, but still needs to review and practice some of the more complicated topics.   This book is well written, and easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most complete, clear, and readable study on the early history of science ever written.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, it is very informative and a very good read! I am an engineering major so I am more interested in the engineering than the physics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very nice book that is not a classic: the author does not present a "how to" book; it is about a method that works very well for some people.   The method is not complicated.  The book covers a variety of subjects: the "Mormon" mind; the "Sage" mind, etc.  In addition, the author has a very good understanding of psychology and the "science" of the mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am an avid reader of science fiction, so I'm very excited about this. This book is the first I've read in a long time that is actually a really good book. The writing is simple but effective. This story is so well written, that it's a pleasure to read it. I also appreciate that the author actually did research into this. If this book were a movie, the title would be "Dr. Who's Guide to Supernatural Beings" and the author would be Peter Davison.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good work of nonfiction.   It's about the "bad apples" in a society which, as far as I know, doesn't seem to have any good ones.  The people who seem to be at the top in all of this, are the top by any definition.  I'm glad to see people who don't think like I do talking about this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. I have used the technique and found that it works well.  The results can be great.  I have never used it before but I am excited to use it more.  It is easy to do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a collection of personal stories about people who found God.   I don't mean people who just felt a "calling" to God.        I mean people whose stories show that they weren't looking for God before they found him.  They weren't in love with God at first, or searching for a God to love.    They weren 't even looking for a god who loved them.  They found God by recognizing the importance of what God is for them. I'm not sure how much of the "finding God" story is true, but I'm glad this book exists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just finished reading "A Song of Ice and Fire" and I really enjoyed it.   It is not perfect but it is very good and has a good balance of history and fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on how to handle difficult people.  The book is very clear and well written.   The author covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time.  My only problem is that I can't figure out how the author knew how to manage such difficult people before I did.  It seems to me that the author's own life is just as difficult as theirs.  I hope that the book inspires people who are trying to make a better life for themselves. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book.   I read it before I started writing a book and was very impressed.  It gives the details that I need in order to finish my own book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good, well written book about the rise of the "new atheist" movement.   It is a fascinating history of the movement from its origins to the present.  I enjoyed it and was happy to get the history.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "There are many good books in this series. But this one is the one that really stuck with me. The plot is well thought out and the characters are complex.   " 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have always been a big fan of science fiction.   I used to think that the idea of a machine that could read and write DNA and do all sorts of other stuff in the same time frame as a human brain would be too much science fiction, but I'm happy that this book has shown me that this is not a bad idea. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a really hard time believing that people don't know the difference between a real and a fake handkerchief, but I can see that the author of the book was trying to be clever.   The handkerchum is in an odd shape, and it feels like it would be impossible to hold onto without pulling out the string, so I don't think the author was trying very hard. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of good information, good examples, and good suggestions.  The only thing that bothers me is that the authors never discuss how they use the techniques in their day-to-day lives.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book, and it is about time travel in particular.   The author makes a great case for the fact that time travel is a good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and it has been the only book I have ever read on the subject. I was skeptical at first, but after reading about the first American to do so and the subsequent research, I came to realize that I could live a much healthier and happier life if I adopted the same practices. I hope to read the rest of the book as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm in the process of reading all the books I bought at Borders, as part of my "buy more books, read more books" routine.   And while I've been pleased with most of them,   this one stands out in a big way.  It's written by a former professor at Cal, who's a professor in all things.  He talks about   the role of the humanities, and   what that means in society at large.  The thing that stuck out to me the most, though, was how he mentioned the importance of critical thinking.  This is something that I think most of us can appreciate.  If you're in college or a grad school program,  this is probably one of the best books you can get your hands on.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my all-time favorite novels.  I've read it multiple times, and am always pleasantly surprised at how well it keeps up with the original story.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a kid, I had a friend who read all the Harry Potter books in a row, but the last book I didn't want to read was The Goblet of Fire.   I liked the book because it was about a magical tournament, but I didn;t want to be a wizard.   The Goblets are interesting, but they aren't the fun part.  The rest of the books are a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is a good introduction to the subject of computer hacking.   The writing is clear, the book is well laid out, and the explanations are complete.  There is a lot of useful information in this book, especially in regards to how the various hacking techniques work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.  It is a good, clear, and simple introduction to the field of the psychology of money and finance.   The author is a great writer and she clearly understands the field.  She covers the major areas, including behavioral finance and time value of money.  This is a very good introduction to finance for someone who is not a finance person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good read.    It's a good read even if you have no interest in the subject matter, as the story was compelling from the first chapter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that's good for a few years and then suddenly it's on the shelf and you can't find it.  The only reason I found it is because it's been out of print for a while.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a fan of Dr. Seuss and his books. I have had the pleasure of being introduced to them through many books, especially the one I'm talking about now.   The very fact that I am able to read and write with the ability that Dr.Sears does makes me feel that I too can become a professional author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that I can read on the train, and it makes perfect sense. I like that the author doesn't put his finger on it, but he does. He's right about a lot of things.  I'll have to read this book again in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of this book. It's one of those books that just makes sense in a way that's not obvious. It doesn't make sense to me as an atheist. It makes sense to a Christian. This is the book that's supposed to explain to non-believers how God can be a complete mystery. It has a lot of good ideas in it. It just makes the case for the existence of God much more clear and convincing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read. The author is a brilliant historian and a wonderful storyteller.   It's not as polished as a great novel, but the style is good enough to carry the story and keep the reader interested.  The characters are all well done, and there are some very funny scenes as well.  It also has a lot of heart and it's good to see the author still having a passion for history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It is not an easy read, but it's a fun read. The characters are likable, the story is enjoyable and the characters are well drawn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think it's one of the best historical fiction books I've read in a long time.   The story is interesting, the characters are interesting and the plot is interesting.  This was definitely a book I had to read in order to understand what was going on in the Civil War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book and it has given me some interesting perspectives.   The main character, David, seems to be pretty decent.  He has a great work ethic and is good at work.  I like that he is always positive.  While this is a nice book, it is more of a 'get off my lawn' kind of book.  However, I like the little details that he has to give.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating look into the origins of Christianity and the Catholic Church.      
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It was very entertaining and very interesting to read.  I found it to be the most original story I've read in a while.  It's funny, it's heart warming, it has an interesting ending, and the story is well written.  The only thing that irked me was that I felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions.  There were also some plot holes in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have read in a long time that is full of information that will help me become a better writer.  I think I'll take a chance on the writing advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the art of woodcarving. It is well written, and explains the technique with lots of examples.  I will be using this book to teach my kids to woodcarve. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book.  I am a huge fan of the "Frozen" series, but this book took the series to a new level.  As the story unfolds, you find yourself rooting for Anna to succeed as she does, and Anna to be happy in her marriage to Kristoff.  This was a very well written book, with a plot that kept me interested throughout.  The characters were also very well developed.   I was so happy to read a book that gave me such a happy ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author has a way of making his characters' actions comprehensible, and the way they are connected to one another is wonderful. I loved the little scenes, too.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is well researched and has been well thought out.   It also does not pretend to be a simple explanation of something, it is a deep exploration into the meaning of life and its many facets. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.    It's a very interesting take on the story.  It also has a lot of action, including a little murder.  This is the second book in the series that I've read.  I'm hoping that the author keeps writing, or even gives us another book in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been a huge fan of the "Sugar and Spice" series since I read them as a kid. The first two books are really good and the third book is a really good "spoiler" for the other two. The author does a really nice job of telling the story in such a way that I can understand what happened. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished a wonderful book: "Sons and Lovers of the English Civil War" by Christopher H. Jones.  I'm a Civil War buff, so I have always been interested in this subject.    I can't say enough good things about this book: Jones, in a great and informative way, provides all the answers you could possibly want.  There are many sources of information, and the depth of research makes it easy to find the details that matter to me.  One of my favorites is the account of the battle of Chancellorsville.  The book also contains a number of valuable essays and interviews that are highly recommended as well.  A must-have for anyone interested in Civil War history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent, accessible book that will help you understand how to make good food taste good, and how to enjoy a fine wine without bitterness.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really useful in understanding the political and religious beliefs of the modern west.  I've been to the west before and have found it an incredibly interesting place to be.  It's quite similar to Japan, but not in the way that people there act or are.   It just seems to be more closed off.  The US and other western countries have a huge influence on the world.  So I guess that's one of the reasons why it's so different. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It's not a bad book, but I don't really feel it's that good. I've heard some good things about it, but it seems a little repetitive. But I also felt that the book wasn't as good as the others in the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to the history of the English language. This book explains a lot about the various changes that occurred in the English vernacular during the 19th and 20th centuries, and it does so in a clear, understandable manner. It is well-written and very informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, it was an excellent read. I'm not really a fan of fantasy, but this book was just so well written and presented that I could get through the book with no trouble.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the origins of the Star Wars movie universe.   It has a good flow to it.  I have been interested in Star Wars ever since I first saw the first Star Wars film in 1977. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been wanting to read this book for a long time, but have been afraid to buy it.  It's a fun book about a young girl, one who is pretty smart, who doesn't know anything about being a girl, but is willing to learn it all the harder for it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.   It is a good example of the difference between fiction and non-fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read. I love the premise of the book - a young man from the slums finds out he has a genetic disorder and has to go to a special school in the city, but the school's main goal is to find a cure for the condition. He tries to do this, but he's constantly pushed back by the school and by the people in the slum, who he doesn't really like. I like the idea of this being a school with a different purpose, as it's a bit different than any other. I also like that the protagonist doesn't care about getting a cure, but is instead trying to find the school that can help him. I'm glad that the author is taking the time to write this, as I know it's very difficult for a young author to find their voice and write a book that is not just about finding a cure. I wish he had more time, as the book could have been longer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read. Very good job on writing. This book can be very challenging to read, as the language is sometimes difficult to understand. It's definitely a book I will read again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I have been thinking about and reading about the history of the modern American republic since the beginning of my college years. I was interested in this book, and was excited to read about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book by Charles Taylor. His first, The Art of Strategy, is a well-researched and well-written book.  He describes the various aspects of a good strategy, and it makes the book readable and very well-illustrated.  The Art is a little more complex than the previous one, but it's still very good.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was skeptical about this book but it is well researched and written.  This book can be used as an introduction to the field of animal behavior or to understand the behaviors that we do not understand.  I do think the book is a bit too long for most readers, but I am interested in learning more about animals and what makes them tick.  It is also good to know about the history of animal research and behavior.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good, well-written book about a family that has been a part of the American culture for decades. It's a wonderful book about family, friends, and memories that you can never get back.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was recently offered a book by my son's teacher, and it's so good that I just bought another copy! I was going to wait until I finished my next book to read this one but then decided that I had a good time in it and wanted to read it now.  I'm glad my son enjoys this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book.  It is a great work of nonfiction and a great read.  A must read for anyone interested in history and the American Civil War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised by this book, as I thought of it as a 'tough love' novel. It's more of a 'novel' than a 'book'. I didn't mind that. I have read and loved many tough love books. This one is by far my favorite. The author has written an engaging, interesting and witty narrative about her husband and his infatuation with a young girl. She manages to make the story entertaining and interesting without resorting to being overly dramatic or melodramatic. She uses her wits to get her husband to open up about his feelings towards her, while remaining funny and relatable to the reader. It is not a 'how I feel about this person/thing' book, but more a 'what am I doing about this?' book. It also serves as a nice book for a romantic date with a romantic interest. I highly recommend it for those who want a funny, entertaining and relativly poignant book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept of "The Golden Age of Piracy" is fascinating. I was actually surprised to find a book about pirate ships written by a historian. I'm sure there's a whole lot more to the history of piracy than that.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read the book three times and can honestly say that I'm still in love with it!   The plot is so intriguing and I have a huge appetite for more!  This is a must read book for all sci-fi and fantasy fans
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. The book is written from the point of view of the victims.   It is a good overview of how a criminal case is handled. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The plot of this novel is intriguing but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The book is very well written but I don't find any of the characters very interesting. I liked the ending though.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books about the civil rights movement in the sixties.   I was surprised that the author, a veteran activist, didn't use more of the black community's struggles in the South to drive the story.  This book is also great at exposing the hypocrisy and racism of the white Southerners who were so against the movement that they were willing to kill innocent people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always liked the idea of "mind-mapping" books, books that try to explain how to visualize things in your head.  In this one, the author makes the point that "mindmapping is a very human thing" and it is useful to learn how to use it.  He's right.  I like to use mind maps to plan my day and to work on my craft.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after I had read The Man Who Was Thursday.   It is a very good story and I'm glad to see a good thriller. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about writing.  I have been a writer for several years now and have tried many things, but this is by far my best book to date. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a very thought-provoking and thought-expanding book about race, class and power.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about the history of science, and the way that scientists have responded to it. It covers the entire time span of science: from its beginnings in antiquity through the nineteenth century. It is an excellent, scholarly book that will have a good impact on the way we think about science in the twenty-first century.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great, clear book about a very important and fascinating subject. The first time I read this book, I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the research. This book covers a lot of ground and covers a wide range of information. I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The stories are all well written and interesting, the characters are well done and very sympathetic. I particularly liked the two protagonists: a guy who is so used to being treated as a freak that he doesn't even see the problem, and a guy whose obsession is a little bit more sinister than his peers, but he's the only one who sees it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been using the book since college.   The information is so simple and clear.  I can remember my own college-level biology class well.  It was the best introduction to the subject.  There are several good resources online for the subject,   but the book is the best   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. It's written in the style of the 19th century (as well as the 1940's) so it is an excellent example of the way in which a good author can work his way into the minds of his readers. The subject matter is quite interesting, and while there is no actual sex in the story, the reader is given plenty of hints that something sexual is afoot.  I especially enjoyed the scenes in the first few chapters where the hero and heroine are out on a date.  This story is one that I would definitely recommend to those who love Victorian style stories with good plot lines.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It has some good science, but it is written very well.   It is not a science book for the sake of science,  but it does contain a lot of very interesting information about a fascinating subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading about the Great Depression (mostly on the internet) for years, and this book is the best book I've read on the topic.    It explains how the Great Recession was caused by a financial bubble that burst, and how we've got ourselves into this mess again.  It's also a lot of fun, and very informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the perfect introduction to the world of the Mughals. The authors have done a wonderful job of covering everything from the introduction of Islam to the founding of the modern nation of Pakistan.   This is a wonderful resource for those who want to understand the Maughal's and their world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book that I found quite difficult to put down after finishing it.  It is very well written, with a great deal of historical context.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the early years of American Zionism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to use in my science class.    The content is excellent and the teacher is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really enjoying this book so far. It is written by an ex-mormon and she is very open and honest about the things she's been through. The story of her daughter and her relationship with her mother is a real eye opener. I think this is one of those books that really hits the nail on the head and is well worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, although it was hard to put down once I started. I found myself wondering about the significance of the story as I read it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most entertaining and enlightening book I've ever read. It is a very practical, realistic and, dare I say, "interesting" look at the economy and the "American dream".   I found myself asking, "what's so interesting about the American dream?"  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for a book that would show me what to expect as I am about to start college. This book is a good read and very helpful in explaining how to get things done.  I recommend this book to all those who want to get ahead but don't know where to start.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It was so good that I had to reread it over and over.   It was interesting to learn about the lives of various men who were either members of the Communist Party or were members of a Communist organization.  They all seemed to have different reactions to the same events but were all at different levels. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really enjoying this book. I really like how this book is a collection of interviews with people who have taken a lot of drugs.  It's an interesting look into how drugs are used by the elite in America.  The book is interesting for anyone who takes drugs and is curious about what goes on in these circles.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've read a book on the subject of a specific time in history.   The author, Tom Gorman, clearly states that he was not writing about the 1960s but the 1950s and he's absolutely right.  It's interesting how the same book has been published by a number of authors since the 1960's, but I can't remember ever having heard of it before.  The best part is that it's very clear what time period the book is discussing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, written by an old guy in his 80s, is a classic. It is a good read and very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I don't usually read science fiction or fantasy but I found myself engrossed with the characters. The book starts off slow but picks up in the middle. This is the first time I have read a book about a woman who has a magic sword and she uses it to fight off an enemy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about an African-American man who became a great teacher in his community.  It is written from a good teacher's perspective, so I feel that the book will be valuable to anyone interested in African- American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It's not for everyone, but I'm a big fan of the science fiction genre, and this book is perfect for me.  There's just something about the way the author presents the science that I find intriguing.  I like the fact that the book is set in a real world, and that the science is based on real-world data and observations.  If I'm not convinced by the data, I'll just check the science in another book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book in the local library, and I can't say enough good things about it: it's not just a good read; it's a good listen. It's an entertaining book about the early days of computer programming in the 1960's, when computers were still primitive and there was a lot of money in the "big box" stores, but when you were at the computer, you did it because you felt like you were participating in a noble cause.   It's a book that will be on the shelves of any Computer Science library.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was very useful for anyone who is working on the first time.   It teaches you what to do when a child's hand is too big for a toy or too small for a meal.  It also teaches you the best ways to prepare a child who has a hard time eating.  The information that is provided is so useful that it makes me want to start making meals for my own kids. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book!  It is a fantastic look at a fascinating historical event.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first time I've ever read a book in a foreign language, and I think it's a pretty good read.  I enjoyed the characters, their quirks, and their relationships to one another.  As a native speaker, it's refreshing to read a text that's a little different.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and I'm glad that I can enjoy this book in a way that it is meant to be enjoyed. I think the characters are fun, and that the world they live in is interesting and unique. The story is good, too. The book is a bit longer than I expected, but the story isn't overstuffed. There's a good bit of adventure and humor to be found here.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. The idea is to use a little bit of everything you know about a topic (e.g., politics, sociology, psychology, biology, art) to answer a question about human nature.   The author goes into a lot of detail about each of these areas of expertise and how each of them relates to the subject at hand (i.e., human nature).    Unfortunately, the book becomes a bit technical at the end and it is a bit hard to follow the logic.  It would be interesting to see a book written about all of these different areas of human knowledge and how they relate to each other.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I've been having trouble finding a good fantasy/romance book lately, and this was one I found. It is a complex story with lots of great characters. The romance is very good. The book does get a bit repetitive. I think it would be a good idea to have the characters go on an adventure after the love story is over, but it would have been nice to know what happened before it was all over.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a good, quick read.   As someone who's never read a romance novel, this one is nice because it's short and the characters are believable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book describes the life of an American who lived in Russia during the cold war and worked as a translator between the two countries.  He had many ups and downs in his time in Russia but eventually ended up becoming a successful translator and author.   The details in the book are fascinating and he describes what it is like to be in a foreign country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the definitive account of the political struggles that led to the Civil War. It is a clear historical account that takes us behind the scenes to the battles and political battles that played out between the South and the North. I really liked this book.  It's not always easy to find a book that tells the full story of the Civil war, but I found this book to be very well-written and presented.  This is a very well written and clear account that is based on a lot of historical research, but the book is so well done, you'll be able to pick it up and read it with ease.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Twilight series and have always wondered about the reasons for the "fandom" of it. This is a wonderful, thoroughly researched book about a girl who wants to get a good boyfriend (but can't). It's a wonderful read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so happy to have found this book. It is an excellent introduction to medieval and Renaissance history and it is written in a very good style.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an invaluable and insightful introduction to the subject of the human mind and how it functions. It has many aspects to it. One is the way in which the book deals with the idea of "human nature", which is a topic that is important to every thinker and scientist and that has a huge influence on our thinking, which is how we all work. We are all social creatures, and a lot of the stuff that happens to us is out of our control. We can be "bad" people, and yet still be "good" people. We learn how to deal with the bad things, and we learn how not to deal. It's important to be able to have a good heart and still be a good person. This is a good introduction to this idea. The rest of the book talks about the ways in which our minds are useful, and how they can be used.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book as much as I did my last two years of college. I loved the character development, the characters were interesting, and the stories were intriguing.  I found the story quite entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a former high school science teacher, this book is a great read.   This is a very important book about the impact of the new technologies of radio, television and computers on the way we think about the past.  The author makes a very good case for the importance of science education in a democratic society.  This book also contains a great chapter on the role of science in the development of democracy.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of science fiction in my time and this book is definitely one of my favorites. The plot is pretty straightforward and the ending was surprising and satisfying.  The characters are very well developed and the world they live in is a good one.  I am very curious to see where this series goes from here.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read a book like this for a while now. I'm a big fan of the old Star Wars films and the Expanded Universe. This book was a nice reminder that the books and movies really are the source material for the new films.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. It is not really about a particular religion or philosophy, but is about how the "Christianity" or "Jewish" religion in a modern context is like a religion that is really based on a certain belief in reincarnation.  The book deals with the issue of reincarnation in a very interesting way.  It is also very interesting to read about the different religions that have a similar belief in this belief.  This is a very important topic in modern history that many people are unaware of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book on the subject of sexual behavior. It is well written, with a lot of information on the biological, psychological, social, legal, and psychological aspects of sexual intercourse.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The writing is great, the characterizations are strong, and the narrative is clear and easy to follow.  The author's style is very informal and the style is consistent throughout the book.     This book could be very good for anyone looking for a good read, but it could also be very bad. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book to be a reference book for high school history.   The book does that perfectly.  It has many excellent pictures and a good explanation of what is really going on in history. The book is also written very well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been waiting for this book for a while and finally got around to it.   This book is a collection of short stories about a group of men who meet and live together in a small town.  The stories are very well written and the writing style is very entertaining.  These stories are told from the perspective of all of the men.  I really liked reading about all of their personalities and quirks.  This is one of the few books that I recommend for the women out there who like to read about guys who act like they're in a movie.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the great history of the American South. It's clear from the start that the author has studied the area a great deal. It would have been nice to see some more of the history that wasn't written about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I've ever read a book that didn't involve some sort of sex, and I was really enjoying it.  It's not as graphic as the porn I'm used to, but it still has lots of good, dirty, and fun sex scenes.  I can see why it would be a big hit, especially for people who like a good dirty book with a good sex scene. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book that deals with the issues of racial and religious identity.  It is also well-written.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading The Book of Mormon. It is a very good book, written in a clear and logical style. I am glad that the author was able to gather enough information to write a book about a book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read. It has everything I love about a book. The story is interesting and well thought out, the character development is excellent and well-written, the writing is crisp and beautiful. The illustrations are also well done.  I just can't wait for the next book in the series, I will definitely be buying it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A nice, simple story about a dog. The first few chapters are quite repetitive, but after a while, it all becomes very clear.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good historical work. The author gives the reasons why some nations, particularly in Europe, resisted the coming of the modern age. The Germans were the first to do so and the other European nations followed. This was because they were so "in-touch" with their traditional ways. The reason that the British did not join them is because they had "sodomy" laws on the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been looking for a good, short book about the history of the United States and the New World. I read a lot of history, but I have a hard time following it.   This is the kind of book I wanted.  It's a great read about the great American experiment from the beginning.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed reading it very much, but I also found it frustrating. I know that it is intended to be a realistic, no-frills guide to making a successful web site, but the author didn't seem to understand how web design is actually done, or the fact that most people who want to be web designers don't have the time or energy to do it themselves.   (As one web designer put it, it's as if "the author is asking me to run a marathon with no shoes, and I'm saying 'no.'" )   It's like a good cook has a really great recipe, but they don't understand how to put it together.  It just doesn't work that way.  This book could have been written by a professional web designer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about the effects of racism on the African American community.   I think this book is great because it helps to bring out the complexity of racism and how it works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for a good reason.  This book shows the power of a good story to transform a person's view of the world and their attitude toward the people around them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was surprised to find that this book was not about the Holocaust per se, but about the plight of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. In the early part of the book, there are very brief descriptions of the Holocaust and then a discussion of how it is being handled in America. However, by the end of the first half of the work, the discussion is all about how the Holocaust is being dealt with in America today.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is wonderful! It is a very comprehensive and interesting analysis of what I believe is the cause of most mental illness.   It gives great insight into what is really going on, and what is going wrong.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next one!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've ever read about the war on drugs.  This book is filled with fascinating information about the drug war and it is so well written that it will stick with you for a while.  It is very well written and the author clearly has an interest in making sure that his information is as accurate as possible.  I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am still at a loss for words. This is a masterpiece. It's so much more than that, too: it's a portrait of a lifetime of thinking about, and loving, science and science fiction. The characters are a delight, the writing is brilliant, and the story is so beautifully told. I cannot wait for the sequel!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for anyone interested in the history of the modern "snowflake" coinage and its development from a coin made of pure silver to a coin in which silver has been alloyed with copper.   The book also shows the historical development of a number of other important coins in the United States (e.g. the "turtle" coin, the "hankerchief" coin and the "peach" coin).  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read and the examples given to the readers are very clear.  If you have a high school biology course or any other course that you take on the subject of evolution then you will need this book.  The examples given by the author are very good and the author shows that you do not have to believe a single thing to get the point that evolution is a fact.  This is good book for all science students and teachers.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of the "glorious ignorance" of modern American culture. I love it! It is not easy to see the stupidity in so many things.  I love the way the author is trying to say that we should be grateful for everything that we have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well-written book, about a group of college students who form a band, but they are never seen or heard from again after they leave campus. I loved this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the early years of the Russian revolution. The author, a Russian immigrant who worked in a US bookshop, gives a lot of background about how the revolution began and why it has never been fully recognized. There is a good amount of humor in the book too.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. It is not so much about the author as it is about his readers. I am a professor of English and literature who teaches creative writing, which this book addresses. I have a number of books on the market right now, but none are better than this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very nice book on the history of the French Revolution. I was not aware that it was a very popular book when I read it and now I am very glad I read and re-read it. I found myself re-reading sections and I enjoyed this one the most.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not a big fan of horror, but this one is very good. The writing is a little dry, but it's the sort of dry writing that really makes a good story stand out. I'm glad it was written by a woman, because she has a way with words.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about a great city. It's about New York in the 50s, the year I was born.    I love it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very informative book about the origins of Islam. It is not just a history of Islam, but also a description of the development of Islam from the time of the prophet Mohammed (pbuh) and the beginning of the Arab-Islamic empire, and how the Muslims were able to defeat the Roman Empire.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, by the same author, is an excellent introduction to the philosophy of religion. It does not shy away from the fact that religion has caused much suffering in the past, and it is not without a good deal of regret that so much of the world has become so anti-religious. But this book, like many of the others I have read, also has a lot of truth in it, and that truth is that religion does have a role to play in society. This book is not a polemic against religion, but it is a reminder that religion is a powerful force in our society, that the way we understand religion, and the way religion influences the way society is changing, is very important.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about how a bad book can be turned around to be very good.  The first half of the book is about how to turn a bad writing project into a great one, and the second half is about making a bad novel into a good one.  It was a very well-written book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.  I like how it's very realistic.  There are many good points.  It's also very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the subject of the origin of the Jewish people and its relationship with the other ethnic groups that existed in the ancient world.   It shows that the term "Jew" is not a pejorative term but a description of a people.  The author shows that "the Jew" is a general term which has a lot of different meanings and that these meanings are changing all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. I'm not much of a horror fan but I enjoy a good good mystery. This is a good mystery with an interesting plot. The characters were interesting and the plot was intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can not say enough about this book.   The writing is well done.  It is very interesting and the writing style of the author is good.  I have also found that he is very good about keeping in contact with the reader.  He also knows that there are no perfect answers.  This is important in writing a good text.  The only thing I would change about this is the last couple of chapters are very dull. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been a fan of this series for years, and it's nice to have a new book to follow the adventures of the characters.  It was great to get more insight into the lives of the main characters -  especially the ones with a hard time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books. The humor is spot on, and the plot is excellent. It's very well written and the characters are all very well defined.  I will be re-reading this book at least once more.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in the last week before I moved to New York, and it's a very funny and well written story about the history of the American theater. It's also very touching, and I think that a lot of people who aren't into the theater will like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about the Holocaust. The author, a former journalist, does a fine job of recounting the events as they were seen by the Germans, the Allied leaders and the Jews. The book is divided into three parts: The German War on the Jews (1944-1945); The Allied War on Jewish Life (1945-1946); and The War on German Children (1946-1947).   I can't wait to see what the second part is about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book for both young and old! It has a lot of information about different types of woodworking and how they can be applied to a variety of wood crafts. It also shows how to use a lot more tools that you may be using in your garage than what you are actually using in the garage. It will take you a while to get a good idea of what all the tools do, but it is well worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found myself totally enjoying the story of Harry Potter, which is why I bought this. I loved the author's take on Harry and his life as he struggles to become a better wizard. I especially loved the "how do you know when to walk away?" ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good primer on how to write a good, enjoyable science fiction story.    The stories are interesting and have a good pace.  There are a few that get a little repetitive, but this book isn't one of them.  The characters are also interesting, but they're just there to serve the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really a work of art. This is a fascinating book about the lives of the people who worked with Richard Nixon in his administration, and about the people and institutions that Nixon depended on to get things done.  This is truly a work by a very good writer.  I found the book very well done.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read in a long time that was actually entertaining. I've been in love with the Twilight series since I was a teen. I always wanted to read a book like that.   I've always felt like a huge fan of the series and the movies, but never got around to it.  This book has the same kind of appeal that the movies had to me, so I'm glad I finally decided to buy it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good first book about women in combat in World War II.  It shows that women could excel in the armed services.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read for the whole family. The author is well researched and well written. The pictures are very well done. The book has a good lesson for children about being nice to animals and animals being nice back.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing. I read it over a year ago and have been meaning to re-read it. The first time I read about the Japanese and American soldiers fighting side by side, it really stuck out to me because I don't know anyone who has lived in Japan. The book is very moving and the way that it portrays the love that exists between the two countries and how much they have been able to share with each other is very touching. I don`t really think that the two sides will ever be at war with each another again, but I think that this book made me want to learn about it so I can know how that happened.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was recently introduced to The Art of the Deal by my boss at work. He had read it several years ago when he was considering becoming a lawyer. He is a true genius. It is well written and covers the basic principles and strategies of the art.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had this book in my college library when I was a first year college student. I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I found it a good read and the story was very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with the new edition of the classic "Little Women" book series, "The Little Women Series".  This is a good introduction to the series, and I found myself wanting to know more about each book, rather than the book itself.  The series contains three of my favorite books of all time: "Little Woman", "Little House", and "Little People"  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book very much.  The story is engaging, and the characters are likable.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I wished I had when I was in college. The characters are so engaging. I liked the idea that they were all from different families, but it was interesting that they all liked the same food and ate at the same place.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is an excellent introduction to the history of the "Korean War," a war fought to preserve the democratic system that was established after the end of the Japanese colonial period. The book provides an excellent overview of the major figures involved in the conflict, from the United States, China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union, through to the "Red Army," the North Korean army that eventually came to the aid of South Korea and ultimately prevailed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. It was a well written book that had many interesting details.   This book is a good reference book for the military, especially the Special Forces.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read the whole thing so far, and it's just great. It's funny, well-written, and the story has a real feeling to it. I hope to see more from the author in the future, especially if it's a book with a lot of twists and turns and a lot more action than the typical adventure story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't have many other books I like that have to do with the Holocaust but this is one that I've been wanting to read for a while.  This book does a good job at telling the story of how the Nazis took over the world in their quest to get rid of Jews and they are the reason why the Holocaust happened.  It has a few more historical details that I didn't understand until I read it.  I'm glad that I finally read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent guide to learning to read with sound.  My son, who is learning to Read and write, is finding that reading a lot of paper with notes makes him tired.  This makes him very frustrated, so I thought that this book might be of some help.  It has helped him to be able to focus on the meaning of words, and it has helped to get him to read longer passages that he normally doesn't.  I have found it very useful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It provides a very well-written, informative, and well-thought out book that takes a serious issue of the day and presents it in a way that makes it very palatable to those who have never faced a real medical emergency.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a great book about writing a good novel: "The Creative Habit."   The book explains how to make a good story by breaking it down into small, clear steps, and by applying the steps in creative ways.   It's a good primer for new writers who want to get to the good stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books on the history of the US Navy I've ever read. It's really good stuff about the wars in the Pacific during World War 2.

I learned about a simple trick that makes the world a better place.  There are so many good things about the book, and I am sure that you will find it useful too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking forward to reading "The Last Battle" for some time now, but it's finally here! The title is quite appropriate; "The Battle of Armageddon" has been used to describe the last days of the world, the final struggle between good and evil, and it's a good description that captures the themes of this book. The characters are well developed and the story has a nice pace. The story itself is very well written and it doesn't feel like you are reading a "silly" children's story. The book is about two sisters and their relationship to their mother. They both love her and she loves them, but there is an inherent problem. One of the sisters is a bad person and the other is a good person and it is very hard to be good at something without being bad at something else. They end up doing some bad things that get them into trouble with the police and they get caught by their mother and her father. It's the good person who ends up being arrested, but the bad person is put away and has to live the rest of her life in a mental hospital. She becomes a recluse and hates her family, but still loves them very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! It's not my favorite book, but it's the one that I've been waiting for.  I'm an English major so I tend to go through books that don't speak to me (though I'm not complaining).  It took me a while to get around to this one, but I'm glad I did!
Write a positive review about a good book:  The second book by the excellent author is a brilliant read that gives a great overview of how the "Fiat Currency" and the "Gold Standard" worked together to cause a depression and ultimately a crash in the price of gold and silver. The book also covers the "fiat banking" that occurred during the time of the depression. It's really interesting to hear about what happened during this time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a very good book by a very nice woman, one of the best books I have read in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite historical books about the US Civil War.  It's a bit dated, but it's well researched.  There's so much more in there that I've never seen.  The author even shows that there were several different interpretations about how Lincoln killed himself:  The "Gentleman's Agreement" theory is probably the most common one; it's a variation of the "Lincoln's Last Stand" theory.  This version has it that Lincoln was so angry over the lack of a fair trial that he shot himself in the head, thus committing suicide.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been a huge fan of books about food. The best of these is "Tasting the World of Flavours" by David Tanis and David Tanislove. This book is filled with recipes that have been discovered through experimentation. I can't wait to try all the different types of peanut butter!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good little book.  It's well written and has a good, if brief, introduction.  The basic idea is that humans are really a part of nature and it's important that we know that.  As I read the book, I realized that many of the ideas in the book have come to me from reading books on animals.  I love that.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on modern Germanic mythology, and the Germanic-speaking peoples in general.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so happy I picked up the first edition of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing a Good Novel. I used it to write my first novel. It's so very helpful and easy to follow, and I am going to make it a part of my regular reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book I read recently was about how women can be just as strong as men in combat.   This is true in real life, but it seems that men who go into the military tend to go to war.  In other words, women are going into the combat arms of the military more and more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main problem with this book is that there is very little information about what happened to the women, other than the fact that they were "killed" or "seduced".   I think that, in this age, there is a good chance that there were several such murders in California, in different cities, in various time periods.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book in its entirety and really enjoyed it.   It was a great read.  The story and characters were interesting and well thought out.  I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone looking for a fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good, well-written book about being a Muslim in America and how the American culture treats Muslims. I was disappointed in that part about being Muslim.   The author does not discuss the reasons for this or even make the attempt to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very excited to find out about this book! I love reading the classics and reading about historical events.  I read all of my history books, especially those by E. B. White.  This is a great book, with lots of historical information about the American Civil War.    I've never been a huge fan of historical fiction, but I'm sure that this will be a great addition to my historical books collection.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been looking forward to this book for a while, but finally got my hands on it and it is fantastic!   It is written by a woman who is also a writer and who uses the experience of a male character in the book to illustrate some of the experiences that women face in writing.   This book was a great introduction to the book world of fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! It is so good that you want to read it again and again.  It is well written and easy to read.  The writing is great and the pictures really bring it alive.  I also love that the authors include facts about the different types of caskets in the different countries.  This book was great for learning about different casketers and I will certainly be purchasing it again

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this book since I was a teenager. It is an excellent book about the "dark side" of human nature. In it, Dostoevsky examines the human desire for pleasure through the prism of the passions of those he knows. His observation is that the desire for enjoyment is a very human tendency, one that is inherent in all humans but can be suppressed by social restraints. Dostoyevsky points out that even those who can avoid the impulse to indulge in pleasure are prone to it once the opportunity arises, a phenomenon he describes as "desirousness." In order to avoid being desirous, Dstoyevskian says, we must seek out opportunities for pleasure that may not exist in real life. However, once the opportunities come, we can still suppress our desires, and that is precisely what happens in real-life situations. This book is very relevant today. I find it hard to suppress my desire to eat all the fast food. I am a vegetarian and am often in a rush, but I still can't resist the urge to eat something that will fill me up. Dstoysky's book helps me keep my wits about me when I am in a hurry.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very helpful in helping you to recognize the differences in the mental health issues of men and women.    There are several chapters in the book that can be used to assess your own emotional health.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book that I've ever read that had a real impact on me. It was a good introduction to the subject, but it really got me thinking about what is important to me about religion.   It was fun, but also enlightening. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished reading the "The Art of Learning to Love" by Edward Feser.  I am so very happy I took the time to read this book!  This book is the result of a decade of research by Fesers', "The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy."  It is my favorite book about cognitive therapy ever!  Feserbos is the real deal,  His writing style is very engaging    I can't wait to read more about Fesar's research and to try it out myself!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the books by Richard Bachman, and this is a great example of Bachman at his best. This is the most fun I've had reading a book for years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished The Secret History of the Federal Reserve.  It is an excellent look at how the Federal government has manipulated money.    The author is one of the few economists who is skeptical of the Fed.  I have read many books on the history of the money. This book is by far the best. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so glad I purchased this book. I've been interested in it since reading about it on a list of recommended books on the Amazon site (where it's only a star). I've got several of my friends who've also read it. It's one of those great stories you can't help but be drawn to and that leaves you feeling happy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The characters were interesting. The setting was interesting. I thought the plot was interesting and the ending was interesting too. The way the characters were portrayed was intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic example of how to build a solid foundation. It was very clear to me that the author was well aware that there is a big difference between the modern book and the old-fashioned book. He chose to write a modern book that has a strong plot and a very good story. This is a very nice book that should be a staple in every young adult's library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It is very well-written and interesting.  The author, Michael L. White, has a great ability to present a complicated topic in a way that is accessible and easy to understand.  He also has a very interesting personal history, which made it much more enjoyable to read than most academic books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading this book for a few weeks now and it is so interesting and funny.    My kids were very interested and got a few laughs out of the book as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading "The Dark Half" by Dan Simmons.  As a veteran of the horror genre, I have always been interested in the relationship between the hero and the villain.  In "The Shadow," Simmons takes a character that many of us have loved to heart, but never quite gotten to the root of.  For me, it's the fact that the villain is a person that is not completely good.  It makes for a compelling read that will appeal to a wide audience.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very impressed with the story, characters, and theme.   It is a good story, but the world building is not.  The setting is a bit more realistic, but it still leaves you wanting more.  I do think there will be a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book about the life of a great scientist, in a world full of people like him.  It is a story about a man who was not afraid to ask questions, and about a scientist who, despite his failure, could never leave a project unfinished.  If you are a scientist, read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only read one book from this author.   It's a very well written book about a very good book.  There is a good balance between the personal and the professional aspects of his career.  He has a good command of his language.  The plot is interesting.  It gives a good picture of the way things were done in his time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little reluctant to read this book, but I've come around to it. It was fun to read, and I was very interested in learning about how people make money off of their ideas.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a person with severe epilepsy. I am so glad that I read it.  The information is very good and helpful.  This book really helped me when I was struggling with my epilepsy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read for both serious readers and general readers. It is very well written and the stories are very interesting. I have not been able to put it down.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the philosophy of Stoicism. I learned that the first thing you should do in life is get out of the way. That is a good lesson in itself. The next lesson is that life is a struggle. It is a war, and it's a never ending one. That means it's never over. So if you are going to be a stoic you have to be willing to fight that battle.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the third book I've read by this author, and it is a solid read. She clearly has a gift for writing and she has made it clear throughout this book that she takes the story and the characters she creates very seriously. It's also really interesting how many of the characters in this book were actually her best friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. I was in high school and a very bad English teacher told us that we could never use our native language in writing a paper.  He said that if we tried to write a report in another language, it would be too confusing to read.  This book gives a nice summary of the difference between English and native languages.  It also gives some interesting information about other languages besides English.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. The author takes a variety of different historical events and uses them to discuss the current political situation.  The first half of the book is focused on World War II, which is the focus of the present book.  It is interesting to see the author's perspective, which comes from a perspective that is not as "American" as most Americans might imagine it to be.  I found the book's focus on the post-war period interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been searching for this book for years now.   This is the first book I have ever read that was truly enlightening.  I did not like the ending, but that is just because I like my books to be exciting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I saw the title of this book, I thought "I've seen that movie before." However, I was very happy to read about how this book came to be.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of my most favorite books ever.  It's the perfect balance between historical and fictional, and the book is fun to read and enjoyable to think about.   I love all the characters.  This is one book that I'll never forget.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading this book about the life of Dr. King.

I am pleased to have found this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good introduction to the subject of quantum physics.   I found it very helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to write a book in a non-technical way. I am glad I did.  The book starts with a chapter on a simple question: "Is it possible to write an excellent book on programming languages?"   The answer is that it's possible and that the best way to write one is to start with a good model and then to add details.   I was a little surprised by the book's length (it's over 200 pages) and I enjoyed the variety of examples that it gives.  This is a great book for programmers who want to know what's going on in the world of programming languages.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has some really cool ideas that I've not seen put into practice yet.   It's a good idea to put a "beast" like a snake into a "cat" like animal, but in this case, it's a snake who's a cat.  The author's idea is to create a new word that sounds like a word that already exists.  This is a cool idea that I hope will be put into practical use in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the most important issue in the entire field of evolutionary biology: the origin of sexual selection. It presents the evidence that the origin and function of sexual traits can be explained in evolutionary terms without appealing to "intelligent design."  This is the key issue in evolution, and is the main reason why I believe the theory of natural selection is so useful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good primer on how to teach math to children.  The book is written by a person who has had the same experience I did:  I went from being a high-achieving high school student to a math-deprived college student.  I found it helpful to have a guide to help me with the changes I was making to my teaching style and strategies.  If you teach math, or have children who will, this book will help you be successful as well.  It is also a good guide to teaching other subjects to children, since I was very good at math but a poor teacher of English.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorites.  This book is a good, straight forward, yet interesting look at the life of a famous author and his wife.  I really liked how it explained the relationship between the author and the wife.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have read on the subject of the Holocaust.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a collection of essays that will make you think. There are many things I learned from this book. One of the main ones is that we need to start thinking about how to organize our lives. I have a lot of stuff going on that I would like to organize and organize well. So this book really helped me to think about the kinds of things I might want to organize. I can also say that this book made me think about how important it is to do something every day that is not about my job, but that I enjoy. This book really made me put aside the fear that I have about doing a task that I am not passionate about, and do it anyway. So it is a good thing that this kind of book is becoming popular. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just bought this book and am really impressed. It's the only book I know that has all the major steps on a bike wheel covered, in a clear and understandable way. It gives you an idea of what's going on at the most basic level so you don't need to spend a lot of time in the gym.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about the American experience, period.  It's a must-read for anyone who wants to know the truth about our country.  The book is packed with facts about the history of the American Empire and a great deal of the history that led up to it.   It also is a good primer on the political and social climate in the United States at that time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read.  The author does a great job of writing about a very difficult subject in a very sensitive manner.  It is important that you read the book before making a decision about your own faith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only book I've read that makes me think of a scene in a Woody Allen movie.   It's funny, but it's also really good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book by a female to really take off and become a New York Times bestseller, so I had high expectations, but this book was a bit different. I didn't hate the book at all, but it didn't grab me as much as I'd hoped, so maybe it's not quite as good as it seems.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so much fun to read. I thought it was really funny and was a lot of fun to write about. I liked the story of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I have been waiting for. It's not just a book about the book -- it's also a book with interesting and well-written information about the real world. If you are serious about the subject of learning, I'd recommend it highly.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book and enjoyed it very much. The story was really well done. The characters were interesting, and the main character was very believable.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about the history of medicine. It is a must read for all who love medicine. I have been studying medical history and studying the history and philosophy of medicine for years now, and the book is a great addition to my library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading this right now, and it's the only book I've read in a while that I actually liked.  The plot is compelling.  In addition to the "how a woman might fall in love with a man" story, I love that the author takes time to develop the characters, including the narrator's relationship with her father.  As a result, I'm finding the book to be more and more relatable as I read.  It's really sad how men often don't get the chance to express themselves the way women do, and how men in particular have been taught to suppress emotions and focus on their work and family life.  I hope that the story will inspire some other men to stop hiding their feelings and get out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book!   This is a good introduction to the subject, with some helpful tips and good examples.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really glad I bought this book. The book itself is excellent: well written and well-presented. It's a well-rounded look at the world of psychology that will help you make sense of things. I'm a big fan of psychology in general and the book makes good use of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found a copy of The Best of the Best in the back of a copy shop book, and I must admit, I had never heard of it before. I've been interested in the "best of" series since I first saw the cover on a book club book about baseball.   The book is very nicely laid out, with many good photos.  It has a nice feel to it, and the quality is good.  The authors seem to know what they are doing, and if you can put your finger on one thing they do right it is to avoid a lot of redundancy and repetitiveness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that finally got me to read a good SF book. This is a story about a group of people in a futuristic setting who develop the technology to use the sun's energy to create the energy of the stars. In a way, the technology is like a hybrid between solar power and nuclear power. While solar power is still useful in places, it isn't as good for producing electricity. While nuclear power has a lot of advantages, it doesn't produce energy on the same scale that the sun does. Solar power, however, is better for both space travel and for things like producing electricity and heat. As for the technology, I think it is more like the way computers are used in this future: a small device that can take the energy from the sun.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a masterpiece. It is written from the perspective of a woman who has lived through rape, sexual assault and abuse at the hands of a married man. She goes into great detail about her life as a survivor and describes her husband's abusive behavior and his abuse of her as well. The author is well informed about the dynamics of the abuse and her husband and what it was like for her to endure it. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who is having a similar experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only way to truly appreciate a good story is to have been in a car accident that left you in a coma for 6 weeks. This story is an example of why you can't have everything you want. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book has a good point about how a society that is so heavily invested in the idea that a woman's body is a sacred space can have a very bad reaction to a woman who walks around the mall wearing nothing but a towel. But it's just so much more than that: it's about women in general being treated like less than human. As a writer I don't usually like to read about the lives of women in the past but I really enjoyed this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a lot of biographies of people who were important in my life, and this book was right up there at the top of my list.  The story of how he got into the Navy was great, and his time in the Navy and the war in Korea is also interesting.    He was a great guy and a wonderful writer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's a wonderful story, told through the eyes of a young girl. The author uses a variety of images, such as flowers, snow, and even a dog to tell the story. The illustrations are very nice. The girl also has a very unusual way of expressing herself. It made the book even more fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will help you be a more effective and compassionate parent.  It teaches the importance of communicating with your children, and how to listen to them when they don't understand something.  This will help children learn to listen and not to be so sure about everything they read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a few of Robert A. Heinlein's books, and this is by far the best. The first one I read was The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, and while I loved it I never felt it was an SF book.   The reason I felt this way was because it was very hard sci-fi.  The fact that Heinlein could create a whole planet and the problems it had was amazing.  It made me think about how the future would be, and how we might interact with them.  So when I read the first part of this book, The Final Frontier, I had the same thought as Heinlein, but this time it was for the better.  This book was far more sci-Fi, and it did it very well.  I think it's Heinlein at his best, and I think that's what we all want from our authors.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was given this book as a Christmas gift in 2008.   I'm glad I gave it to my son as well.  The story is a great example of how to write a good story.  A family's struggles are shown as well as the characters' struggles to keep the family together.  I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the field of the study of human development.  It has the quality of a good scientific text.  The authors do an excellent job in showing that there is no "magic bullet" for this area of research.   This is a must read for anyone in the field who is interested in this subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, written by a very competent and knowledgeable man, does a great job of explaining how the concept of natural selection works.  The concepts are presented clearly and without fluff and in a way that is easy to understand.  While this is not an explanation of the whole theory, it does a good job of summarizing the basics and it does an excellent job of teaching the reader the concept.  In this age of the Internet, the reader is always more likely to find the answers that they seek on the Internet than to find it in a book.  It is my hope that others will use this book as a basis for their own understanding of natural and selected forces.  This will help us to better understand the evolutionary process, and it will help others who are interested in natural selection to understand it better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is a good introduction to the genre. It has a lot of good advice, including how to approach your own writing and a good explanation of why it is hard to make good fantasy novels.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The last third of this book is a good, fast paced story about a young girl who becomes a psychic warrior after being caught by a group of vampires. She fights and defeats them, then uses her skills to find her parents who are missing, which is great because the book ends with a big fight between a group that has found her parents and the vampires. The vampires are very well done, and the ending was very satisfying.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a very unusual life. I found myself intrigued by the story of the "Dancing Bear" who lived in a small forest area in New England. I also enjoyed the fact that the author was able to incorporate all the information he gathered from the newspapers and local historians into a well-written, enjoyable book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the field of social psychology. It covers the broad ideas of social influence and social learning well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I ever tried to read the Bible, I read it in a one-day Bible class. The teacher, an ex-member of the Church of Scientology, was teaching us about the "Biblical" story of Job. We were told that Job's story was meant to be a cautionary tale. Job's wife was taken away from him by her abusive husband, who was only interested in his own interests at the expense of Job's family. The Bible says that Job is a "wicked man" because he is willing to suffer injustice to preserve his family. It also says that he is a good example to his family and friends, who are often subjected to similar treatment by their spouses. We all know that the Biblical stories of Job and his wife are just not true, but it was a good lesson in how people are influenced by their environment, rather than the other way around.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by this book from the moment I opened the cover.   The writing is extremely good, and I was surprised that it was not written in a genre I usually prefer.  I can see this being used as a textbook for writing history books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was at first skeptical about reading this book because I am a history buff, but it's just about as accurate as you can get. It's not just about the US, but the whole world, but that's what makes it great. It really is about the history of the United States, not just the good parts.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only book I have read in years that I actually found entertaining. It is not about religion or politics, but about the psychology of people who have had religious experiences. It also helps me to remember that there are so many religious groups in this world, not all of them good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The writing is very clear and logical, with very good explanations of the subject matter. I had a lot of fun reading this.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea that the brain can be changed by learning how to use the senses is not only fascinating, but it also makes me think about how the brain works. I think my brain is different than it was as a child, but I have not found that I am more or less intelligent. I am sure there are other differences in my brain, but the ones I am aware of are related to my childhood.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As far as I'm concerned, this book is the perfect gift for someone who is new to the history of the civil rights movement, as well as someone who has always wanted to know the details about the movement, but was afraid to ask.   The book covers everything from the start of the movement to the assassination of Dr. King, including the many famous photos of the event and the speeches they made.  I am very glad that I purchased this book, as it will definitely help me when I finally decide to start reading about the civil right movement. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I love this book! It's very readable, with the best explanations, and very informative about the various types of people that are found in the Bible and what those characteristics mean.  It's not a Bible study but a study of people, of what makes them tick.  The author makes a very convincing argument that all of the characters in the story are flawed in some way.  In fact, all of us are flawed, and I'm not sure how I'd do without the book in my pocket.  And, the way that the author handles the Bible is really really great, it's like having a bible on the side of your car.  I've been using it as a back up for a while now and it's been a great resource to have."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that taught me that writing is not a dirty job. It is a beautiful one. I'm not sure if I'll continue to write, but I'm definitely going to get more into writing than I have in the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book.    It's interesting, easy to read, and entertaining.  The characters were interesting and I could picture the world in which they lived. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. It is a very good read that covers many subjects and has many illustrations. I can't think of a better way to introduce young children to the world of animals. It has many examples of good and bad. It's not a perfect book but I give it five stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic introduction to medieval history and culture.   It provides a good overview of what was happening in the world at the time, but also provides the history behind it.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about the world's first commercial airline.  I bought it on a whim because I wanted to see how the first commercial airliner would work, and it is definitely a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the series. This is the first book of the fifth, and I'm excited to see what happens. The last two were great, but this one is really fun. I'm enjoying reading about the characters and getting to know the new cast as much as I'm getting to see the old ones. It's just like a good TV show - you know how good a show is after you see it a million times.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has made me a stronger person. It's easy to see the mistakes, the false assumptions, and the lack of proper evidence and reasoning in the first few chapters of this book.  It's a book that can be frustrating, but when you realize that a lot of what is wrong is the result of misreading of the Bible or misinterpretations, it's a relief to read the rest of the book. It was a good read, although I think I will use a good copy of it as a Bible and keep it as my primary reference.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book after seeing it recommended by a friend and was very pleased. It's a very well-written book that is easy to understand. I think it's a good way to get into the philosophy of religion and what makes a good religious person.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great read about a guy who got the whole world at his fingertips (the computer) in the 60s, and how he didn't know that computers would be so important to the future.   This book could have been written about any era, but that's just the way it is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the ultimate introduction to the world of functional programming, and I highly recommend it to all students of computer science.   I learned about all the different types of functional programs I'd been studying in college, and how they can all be implemented in a single, clean and concise way.  I had always been fascinated with the functional approach, but had never taken the time to study it for myself.  It's clear to me now that I can do almost everything I want in a functional programming language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The information was clear and concise and easy to follow. I was able to follow along with the explanations with a good amount of ease. I'm not a trained medical professional, but the book was written in a way that was easy to understand. It was interesting to see how different the two types of bacteria were, and how they reacted to different drugs. The book is very well written and I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about medical microbiology and/or looking for a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It's about a girl who is a witch.  This girl is a good witch,  but  when she grows up  she can't control the power that she has.  She is a very strong witch.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. I read it during a family vacation to the East Coast in late October.  The book is short and easy to read and it makes an excellent introduction to the subject of "mind reading."  I found myself thinking about a number of topics in the course of reading this book.  It is a great resource for parents or anyone who wants to learn about the "mindreading" abilities of humans.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very interesting and insightful book about the history of American and German racial relations, written by an American Jewish professor.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book that tells the story of the first World Wide Web. If you want to know what the Web was like in the late 90's and early 2000's, and why it has a bad rap, this is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  The subject matter was not too hard, and the pictures were good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It is a great overview of the major ideas that make up a lot of the best thinking on computer security.  It is also a very good book.  I have used many of the ideas that it discusses but not necessarily in the way that he talks about them.   I think that this book is really a must read for anyone who is interested in security or in computer security in general.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is interesting, a good overview of some interesting material and useful for anyone who wants to understand how it is that the Soviet Union survived for so long.  It is written in an engaging, lively style, and the history it is attempting to reconstruct is fascinating.  I've been studying it for quite some time and I'm still not quite sure how to understand it.  But the author does a good job of putting the information into a coherent context, and does a reasonable job of making the arguments he does make compelling.  The most important thing for me, though, was that the author never tried to make a case for Soviet "heroism."  He never claimed that Stalin was a great leader, or that his policies were good.  Rather, he argued that the Communist Party had been successful at a certain level because of the "extraordinary efforts" of the various individuals it controlled.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had high expectations for this book, and was very pleased to find that it was one of those rare classics that is a delight to read.  This is a story that I think we can all relate to, and it really hits home for me as a fan of both film and literature:  a family that loses their son is heartbroken, but still finds joy in their new son.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the effects of climate change. The book is full of facts and figures and the author is able to bring them together in a compelling way. It's clear the author did a lot of research.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really good. The author is extremely well informed about the subject matter and gives a very good overview. I can't say that the book is perfect, but it is a good start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because my father's favorite author was James Baldwin. He is my hero. This book has been on my shelf since I first picked it up as a teenager. It has always been in my mind and it is a very moving and informative read. I am glad I read it now because I can relate so well to Baldwin's struggles. Baldwin would be proud.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been using this book for years as a reference when I need to go over something that I am reading or that I have read previously. This book has been a great source of information and I will continue to use it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent study of the psychological effects of the American Revolution. As someone who has done extensive work on colonial history, I appreciate this work's attention to detail and careful research.  As a former resident of the colonies I can attest that this is a great work that has a lot to say about the colonial experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series.  I've read all the books in the series and they are wonderful stories that I enjoy.  The first book in the Harry potter series was a classic that I highly recommend.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not read a book quite as interesting as this one. As a general rule, I am always very wary of reading about or about to read a particular book. However, this is different. This book is a truly interesting read. The author is very well informed on all things related to his area of expertise: psychology, neuroscience, psychology of language. It's a very thorough and thorough book. The only downside is that the book seems to get very technical very quickly. It was very helpful at the beginning when I was just getting into it but I ended up skipping a few chapters just because the material seemed so "out there".
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that I was able to understand what I was talking about.  I was not a high school dropout or a college dropout.  It took me several years to even get a degree.    I have been teaching in some type of high school, and it took me longer to find out what I wanted to do with my life.  There are still a lot of things I want to learn, but now I can put them into my career and I will have something to fall back on.  The next book I will read about education will be a college text book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book.  It is written with the "straight" man's perspective.  I think that is an important distinction.    It's interesting that the author is male and that he is not a writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've never been a big fan of romance novels, but this one was pretty good! I don't particularly like the romance aspect in fantasy (especially with the same-sex characters), but this was interesting and enjoyable. I'm really interested in the history of the Empire as well as the politics and social problems that plague it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at a friend's house and really enjoyed it. It's a good story with an interesting character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've ever read that is actually a good read. The author does a good job explaining how to get a good night's sleep and I've been able to do so since I got my first night's rest as a child.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really excited about reading this book. I've been reading about the rise of the modern police for a few years now. I can't help but think that it has to be the book that changed my view on police work. It's well written, very informative, and it's so well researched that it really made me think about police work a little bit differently. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know why it took me so long to read this book.  This book is the real deal.    It is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "dictionary" in this book is not a dictionary at all, but a book on the history of language.   It is a book about the history, as well as the evolution of the language of English.  I enjoyed it a great deal. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a fun read.   It is a great way to introduce a new player to the game.  There is a lot of material about playing with the kids and making them feel a part of the game, and the little ones get a lot out of it.  The artwork is cute as well as nice.  This book has helped me become a better player and a better parent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to learn about the history of American intelligence and the development of electronic warfare.  It contains a wealth of information and is very accessible to a wide audience.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of science fiction and fantasy books, but this is my first time reading a science fiction novel in a non-fiction format.   It is quite different than most of the genre, in that it's not primarily about a starship but a research vessel, exploring the unknown.  The research ship is on a mission to discover the true nature of life and the universe.  In many ways, it is more like a space odyssey than a science fictional tale.  I would definitely recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the very best books about the history of modern Israel I've read.  The author, a distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania, is as good a historian as I've come across in a long time.   He's not afraid to take on the establishment in the Middle East, and he's a great writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very interesting. There are many good things about it. The cover is great. It's clear that it's the author's book. It also contains the first few chapters of a new book. There is so much about the American Civil War and its aftermath that I really want to read more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a man who was very religious. He read the Bible every day and was very well mannered and a good example for his family. After his mother died, he began to doubt the religion he grew up with and started questioning God's existence. He eventually left religion altogether. This book has a good balance between the factual and spiritual. I liked it very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I tried this book, I thought it was a bad parody, and I had to get it again to get over it. This is a funny book, but it's so good that I don't want to stop reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is a good way to understand what it's like to have an anxiety disorder.  It is a very good introduction to the subject.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, as far as I am concerned, is a wonderful historical document. The book contains a good deal of interesting information about the various factions that fought for independence in America. It is very clear that, as the United States struggled to find its footing in the world, there were many factions that were not willing to compromise or co-operate with one another. Many people believed that the American colonists were too much like the British and should be allowed to remain independent. The author does an excellent job of covering all the bases, so that the reader will have a good idea about what really happened in the American independence struggle.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. I would recommend this book to all who are interested in the history of women's suffrage.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book really useful in my studies of the ancient Near East.   The author uses a very clear approach and an intelligent style that helps make the text understandable to non-specialists.  There is a certain beauty in this kind of writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read for those who love the Bible but are looking for a new and interesting perspective on the Old Testament and its importance.   The author does a great job of addressing issues that often go unmentioned in mainstream Bible studies.  The discussion on the role of the prophets is a good example of this.  I also found it interesting how the author does not focus exclusively on the book of Isaiah.  He also discusses the books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Hosea.  This gives the reader an interesting perspective as to how the Bible is being used today and the changes that have occurred in the past.  Overall, this book is excellent, and is definitely worth a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on the history of medicine. The author has put a lot of effort into it.   The author is a very intelligent man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very happy to be able to finally pick up an old book from a local library!  It's a wonderful book on the history of the modern American republic.  The book is very well researched, well-written, and very well-organized.  This is my first introduction to the history that is so central to my own political and religious faith.  I'm very grateful to the authors for putting so much time and effort into writing a book that so clearly shows why it is that the United States has not only survived but thrived despite the turmoil and strife of the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very happy that I read this book! It was an interesting read that gave me a lot to think about. I also enjoyed how it brought a lot of new things into the light. The author gives us the background information that we have not heard before but is important. It is very important that we get the real history of the Great Depression and the economic system that it was born out of. The book also gives a lot more insight on the Federal Reserve than I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the first time I ever read a book written by a woman about a male character.   The main character, "Tom" is a very likable character. He's also a real jerk in some ways.  I was pretty taken with him at first. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and I'm so glad I read it! I'm in the process of getting my second one of the series, The Dark Heart of Night, and I think I'll be adding this one to my collection soon as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a few books in my life that have helped me to think and learn a lot. This book by Prof. Robert K. Merton has done that. He gives a good analysis of the different ways that the religious/spiritual world views the world, and how that affects the lives of those who live within that world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.    The book was really easy to read.  And it has some good stories about people that I know personally.  The author has a lot of good information about the paranormal.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is amazing and is a must read.  It tells the true story of how the man that invented the video game controller,   George Gershwin, was actually a genius who knew a lot about music.    He was also a womanizer and a bad boyfriend   and a very poor father.  I learned so much from this book   it was like a dream come true   I am going to read this book to all my students 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well-written and well-researched book.   It makes you realize that when you are being "tough" with a child, it is because you are really being "soft" and that your behavior is really about controlling the child's behavior.  This is true in both my case and in many others.  The only thing that is hard about the book is that it doesn't come to a good end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read this book for a while now, but never got around to it until now.   It is a book about a book, and a lot about what happens after that.  It's about the creation and destruction of ideas, and the way they shape us and our culture.  The book starts with a discussion about what the concept of "literature" is, and why it's important to write a book.  I really enjoyed the discussion about why books are valuable:  the idea of something that is worth having, even if it is only a fragment of the whole.  Then, the book moves into what it's like to be in a group that writes and edits its own books, and about the way it changes people.  As the book progresses, the characters that are the central characters of the book change, and it starts to seem like the author has become a character in her own book. I don't think it's as good a book as I would have thought it was, but I can definitely see the author's voice in it, and I think that's really important.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished the book on the origins of the US and British empires, and I am very pleased with it.    "For me, the American experience has been unique in its combination of good intentions and bad consequences.  It's one of those rare times when a policy seems to work, but doesn't.  The Americans wanted to be free of Britain, but the British wanted to control the United States, so they fought a bloody war over the American colonies.  " 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always amazed how the first time a book comes out, it's the best thing I've read all year. This book was my very first experience reading a comic book. It's very funny and very well written. I don't know that I've ever laughed so much in my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that you can't put down until you've read it. I've been studying the history of the US and world wars for over twenty years and it's been very difficult to read about the WW I. This book was a revelation.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very interested in reading this book, but it got lost in the shuffle of other good books. It's a good read, but I felt like it was overshadowed by the other books I was reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this book was so well written, that the only thing that I was annoyed by was the fact that they did not have any pictures.  I have a picture of my grandfather in my family album.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must-read for any self-respecting male who enjoys reading.   It's a classic and is still very relevant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of a good writer's use of the old fashioned technique of creating tension and surprise in a story. I like the fact that he puts his characters in some kind of impossible situation, where they have to do something they have not done before. I also like the twist of this situation, that the situation has been created to create tension. This technique is also used in a lot of thriller stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will help you find the meaning of your life.  It will take you through the highs and lows of your relationships with your family members, and how you can find peace and harmony.  If I could do anything in life to help someone else it would be to find peace with my family.  The book will not be for everyone but it will change your life!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book provides a very important overview of the topic of "the family", the history of how it developed, how it changed over time, and why it is so important.  The authors do a good job in discussing the changes in family values over time (especially regarding the family as a unit).  The book discusses many different cultures, including the "traditional" American family.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very interesting. It is a review of some of the more prominent religious thinkers and it is interesting to see how many of them had a significant impact on their own religious beliefs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about a young girl with the mind of a ten year old. It is not a happy book. It's a dark one. But it's a good one, a good, grim book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited to read this book.   It's a wonderful and fun read about how you can make the most out of a bad situation.  I also enjoyed the fact that the characters aren't just "bad" but also "stupid".   This is a great story about how a woman learns to overcome adversity and make the best out of every situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book about my grandfather, who worked as a medical student for many years in New York City. He spent his time working with sick patients and patients with AIDS. He helped to develop a vaccine against AIDS that is now widely used.   It is a remarkable book, full of fascinating details about his time as a student, how he met his wife, how they had a very loving and fulfilling marriage, the challenges of their later years together, and the challenges they faced in the early days of AIDS. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I have been looking for.  The book is a little on the heavy side, but it's well written and is well researched.  It was a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a small amount of time before I need to start school again so I read this book on the bus. I think it's a good introduction to understanding the concept of a "real" computer in a practical way.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of David J. Peterson's book on the history of the American Jewish establishment. This is an excellent history of that community's struggles to adapt to a changing world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating study of the development of a young woman's sense of her own sexuality. She writes about her desire for older men and her relationship with her husband's older sister, both of whom she refers to in the book as "Daddy's older mistress."  She also discusses her experiences with a woman who had the same desire and was unable to act on it.   The author's observations are very insightful and add to my understanding of the way women and children are treated in the modern world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book about the history of the human body. It is not about nutrition or what a healthy body looks like, but about the way we view it.   It is also a book on the health effects of the consumption of foodstuffs that we don't eat. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book.   It's not a "must have" book for me, but it was good to have some things to read while I wait for my next one to come out.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of useful information about many different types of reptiles.    It's one of the best books I've read about reptiles.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read. It explains how our genes influence our behavior and emotions, how we can change our DNA and how we are a part of our own genetic history. The best part is that they give you a "how to" list. This is an important book and I recommend it to all my friends.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful and thoroughly researched book on the "Jewish Question" in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century. The author, who is a professor at the University of Hamburg, has done a fine job of compiling information and presenting it in a manner that will satisfy the most demanding reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to the great work of David Foster Wallace through an excellent book by Michael Korda.  Wallace's work was always fascinating, and I enjoyed reading his books as much as I enjoyed the Wallace novels I read when I was younger.  This book was another great contribution to the collection, with a wealth of information and some really nice illustrations.  I'm curious to see what Wallace will produce in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of Jodi Picoult and this book is a wonderful addition to her catalog.   It is a short book about a woman who lives in a city but has a deep love for the outdoors.  Her love for her land and her animals is so strong it has even prevented her from getting a car.  It also is a book about the love of one's own family.  If I could do it all over again, I would have written a thank you note when I got home from school that day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a good time reading this book, as it is very interesting and relevant to current events. I was especially interested in the question about the "toxic" relationships that arise because of a belief that a person has to keep their opinions to themselves in order to be a good person. It's interesting how we come to believe that it's our responsibility to keep our opinions to ourselves.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had the opportunity to hear the original audiobook in its original setting - with no intervening editing or sound changes. This book is the best thing I have heard on audiobook since my friend and I read together as children - it is simply perfect!
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most difficult thing about writing a book is deciding what to write about. The problem is that the book about the most important part of my life has nothing to do with it. It's a book about how to be a good husband and father. It would be a waste to try to write a book on that subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say enough good things about this book. It is not for the faint of heart.   It is hard work.  It requires a lot of discipline.  I read this book in 3 days.  The hardest part was keeping my fingers from cramping.  At the end of the 3 days, I thought it was done.  This is a great book to read at the beginning of your journey as a writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that will make the reader feel good. It was written in 1984 by a former member of the Communist Party who was in a very unhappy relationship. She wrote about how the Communist party was "not a great organization, but it was a way of life."   The Communist party is a way to control and manipulate other people, and to control the people you have to manipulate.    There are some people that need to be controlled, and there are some who need to go through life with a heavy burden, but the communist party is not for them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only bad thing about this book is that I read it when I was still a teenager.   I didn't know about it at the time, but it's so fascinating that I think it might be the most important work in the history of human consciousness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not a good one. It is not just about the history of the Holocaust, it is about the whole idea of holocaust. In fact it is a good historical book, but it has been used by the neo-Nazi movement in the United States as a propaganda tool.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I've always wanted to read a book about the history of the U.S.S NCC that would also include some of the stories from the ship's crew.  This book is a good start and a good look at the NCC and her crew.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must-have for any serious history lover. It covers the entire time of the Roman Empire in great detail. The author is an excellent historian and the historical information is accurate.  The book is divided into three sections: The Romans: A history of Rome from its earliest beginnings until the fall of the empire. The first part of the book covers the first half of the second century, and then the third part of that covers the last two centuries of the republic.  This is the best book I have read on the history of the Romans.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of John Steinbeck's books.   This one is definitely one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had the good fortune of getting a copy of The Life and Times of Christopher Hitchens from a very nice local bookstore.   The Life & Times of the best writer and thinker in modern times is not an easy read.  There are a few things that will annoy the hell out of you, but that's about it.  He's a writer and a thinker, and his life is well worth reading.  It is an excellent introduction to the man and his work.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a wonderful experience reading this book.  It was my first encounter with The Unauthorized History of the Cold War.  I've read the other two books on the subject.   While they're not quite as good as the original, I've found them to be pretty darned good.  While The Unauthorized History is a bit more nuanced in its historical interpretation, I found it to be a very enjoyable read.  In addition to a good deal of detail and good writing, I also enjoyed the fact that the book included a wealth of material from other sources as well.  The book itself is fairly priced and has some value for a book that includes some good information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I loved this book. It's a good read for anyone who is thinking about going to the gym but has never done so. The exercises are done in a very organized manner and the book is a good guide. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a brilliant book. I have always enjoyed reading about the development of new scientific ideas and the practical application of these new discoveries.   I find it interesting that this book was written by an American scientist, given that the scientific revolution was initiated by a Frenchman, Galileo.  I think that the work of these two men is so far ahead of their time that they were able to make such profound observations about the universe without being influenced by the more superstitious attitudes of the day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best thing I have read in a long time. It is an absolutely fantastic account of the political, social, and cultural history of the United States. It will help me to understand my own country better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as much as the first book. I like to try new things, and this book was fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed the books in this series, but it's always great when a new author brings a good, original story to the table.  The protagonist is a girl who has to go on a quest for her mother.  She's a good fighter and is able to go toe-to-toe with a bad guy.  I'm always a fan of female-centric fantasy and I think it's a nice change to have a female protagonist.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished the second edition of This is Not a Book about Race.  The first edition was really good, but the new version is even better.    This is the kind of book you can go back to over and over again, but it doesn't leave you feeling guilty about having read it in the first place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! It is so well written and so full of interesting details that I can't believe I've never heard of it before. This is a fun read, even though I think I'm the only one who didn't really like the ending (and I really liked the first book). 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this, I thought that the plot would go from bad to worse but then, the plot didn't go from worse to worse, it got better.    It went from bad, to mediocre, to excellent.  The characters, especially those in the second book, got better and better, and I loved them all.  It also kept getting better.     I'm glad that I read it, and hope to see more of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a bit dry at times, but the stories are very entertaining.  This book is part of a series that deals with the death of the mother.  The books are a bit hard to get at times (it's hard to understand what the author is trying to get across), but I think the books are fun.  If you are looking for a good read about a tragic death, I recommend this series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for the first time about a year ago, but I was already familiar with the story. I liked it, but didn't have high hopes for it.    But,   I found out that there was a second book in the series   coming out

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the human capacity for making choices.  The authors, who worked together at MIT, provide a great explanation of how people's brains are wired to be able to make choices. The authors use examples to demonstrate how this happens.  They use a variety of experiments to show how people will not only be tempted to cheat, but will do so.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had heard good things about this book, but hadn't been able to get hold of a copy. It turns out to be a good read and very well-researched. The author's focus on the history of British intelligence in World War II and the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s is very important.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in the same order as my other books. I have the original hardcover version, but I was not able to find it in the current paperback edition.  I'm glad I got the older book as it's one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written and I recommend it highly. It explains how to make your own yeast bread with the yeast that you have in the fridge, and you don't have to purchase any special equipment.  I also found it very useful to read all the comments on the different kinds of breads, especially that they are very similar to breads you buy at the store.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read, it's written in a very good style, it covers a lot of subjects very well, and it's fun and interesting, but it isn't very deep in the story lines.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on the basics of programming.  The author covers some interesting topics but leaves the reader with a good sense of how the basics can be applied in many different situations.  It would have been good to have the author go into more depth about some of the topics he discusses but he does provide a good foundation.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of historical fiction about the French Revolution, but this is my favorite of the bunch. It is the only one I know of that shows the revolution as it really was, and it is a refreshing change of pace from all the "revolutionary" fiction I've ever read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that I bought this book.    The book is very well researched, well written, and extremely well organized.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I've read this year.   It is very thought-provoking and I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very useful for learning about the different kinds of people that the author met while living in different places.  The book is about three different kinds:  A group of very "introverted" people in New Orleans:    They were the ones who were really into their own time.   It was their time to "do their own thing".   In other words they were in a very special place to be, in that they were very much "in their own world".  I think the same could be said about the members of the first couple of generations of the "Misterioso" families in New York City.  A "typical" "American" person:      The kind of person that I would have been if I had been born in Italy.  It's not about a particular country but about a certain way of being in that country.  I mean this is what I have to say about "America".  It is my country and it is my people, but it's not really my country at all.  This kind of "America" is the kind that I have always wanted to be a part of.  But, I know that I am never going to get there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, while far from the "best" books I've read, was a very good book.  It was funny, well written, interesting and the plot was very intriguing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book as a present from a good friend of mine. I am so glad I did!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am now reading all the books in the "The New World" series and I am enjoying them immensely.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I have read all the other books in this series, but this is the one I am most looking forward to reading the next. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book "Turtles All the Way Down" while on vacation. It has many good lessons for adults. I found it interesting that my wife was able to relate the same lessons to her daughter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the first I read about the life of John Henry Evans, and it is the most interesting one I have read so far. I liked that it gave a good picture of how the great 19th century explorer lived his life, but I also enjoyed how it related how he spent his time. He was quite successful at traveling through America in his day, and also traveled to India and China. He also was very interested in the study of languages, and he was the one who brought some of the best French, German and Russian scholars to the United States to teach. He even had some of his own students learn French. He lived the American Dream as well as the American Way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The two stories in this book are great.  The second story in particular is one of my favorites.  This is a book that you can keep on your nightstand for hours and that is going to keep on giving. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   It is well written and well researched.  I don't like this kind of "science" but it has the advantage that the author gives very specific data.  And it is very clear that this is a very real thing,  that the Earth is round and that life on Earth has evolved from simpler forms.  If you're interested in the origins of life and evolution,  you will love this!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, about how to go about learning how to write a good story, not just how to make it sound good.  I really liked the author's take on how to get the story written:  First, you need to be willing to write from the gut:  A story is what you make of it.  Secondly, you must know the "why" of the story.  Thirdly, you can learn to write the "how" and the "who" in a story by simply watching good storytellers.  Fourthly, your characters should be well-drawn, but you must find the good things about them.  Fifthly, keep your story short, because you can never have too much information.  Finally, don't use your hero as a plot device:  Use the hero to tell the story, and you can always kill the hero when the time comes.  This book should be required reading for any writer who wants to get good at writing good stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a life changer for me.

This book has helped me deal with the mental illness I have for years.  Thank you for writing this book
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon and I'm excited to read this.  If you love Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this is for you!  I'm a Buffy geek, and I love Joss's take on the series.  I loved the Angel/Buffy relationship in the show, and the interaction between them in the books is just amazing.  The art is great, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very detailed, very thorough, and covers many issues that I had been thinking about for a long time.    There is so much information in this book that it is hard to know where to begin, but after reading it, I am ready to move on to other books about the history of our nation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has done a terrific job in this book, a wonderful tale about a boy's encounter with a vampire.   It is about a little boy who was bitten by a vampire, but was saved by a girl.  This book is very good, I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. I'm sure you can see that in the reviews that have come out of it. It's not a book that is going to be read over and over again, but it's very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in the hope that it would be a good read for me. It's about a young woman who wants to do the right thing but isn't allowed.

I really appreciated the use of "you can't do that" and "that's a stupid thing to do."  This book will come in handy for my future novels.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to the topic of consciousness and its relation to the brain and the mind. It has a lot of good ideas, but I do not think it is an adequate introduction to such a complex subject. I have seen some good introductory books about this subject, but this one is not one of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about an unusual subject: the creation of a working language. It is written from the point of view of a programmer and covers a variety of topics in the creation process of a programming language. The book is divided into four parts. The first part explains how and why a language is written in a specific way. The second part explains the basic grammar rules. The third part is about programming techniques for dealing with input and output. The fourth part is a discussion about the development of a new programming language using these principles.  The author covers a lot of ground in a fairly brief book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the most thorough and complete book about the history of the Soviet Union. It's very hard to believe that such an exhaustive book exists. This is a very useful book for those who wish to understand the Soviet political system and the history behind the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a bit of a nerd and am in love with the work of H.P. Lovecraft. I am going to have to buy the original edition and re-read the stories for this book. The writing is really good and has a nice flavor. The illustrations and text are both quite good.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful. I loved the characters, the setting, the world, the humor, the love of the genre and all the different ways that the author uses the word "fuck". It's funny. It's dark. It makes me feel dirty. I love it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well researched, well written, well argued book that has a lot to say about how American political culture is increasingly divided along class lines. It's not an easy book to read but I think the author does a good job of presenting the arguments in a way that doesn't simply sound like an attack on the poor.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I'll be reading this book a lot, I just really like it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book, but too long. I finished it last night and had to put it down and go to sleep, but I'm going to get the rest in the morning. It will be fun to read it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thoroughly amused by this book. It's a funny little story that takes place in a modern world, where women are supposed to be docile, subservient and passive.  The only way a woman can assert herself is by being the dominant one in the relationship, and that's not exactly easy.  However, she does manage to get what she wants, and at least for a few weeks she's able to feel happy, at peace and free. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that I found to be totally accurate, but not in the way you might think. It's a good study on how women perceive men. While I've always been attracted to women who seemed a little bit more masculine, I've never really had a problem with it. I've dated girls who weren't masculine enough, but I always had a healthy dose of fear about them. This book showed me how much I've been missing out on, and how much fear and insecurity I've put on my husband because of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with this book. I've been looking for something like it to read for a while now, and it came very close. It had a lot of interesting, interesting information that I hadn't heard before, and I'm excited about the possibility of learning more.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I have ever read about my favorite genre.  I was so engrossed in the story that I didn't even notice the book jacket until I was finished reading it.   This is a story that will stick with me forever. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of books about psychology.   For whatever reason, reading about psychological research has always been an enjoyable and interesting experience.  This book by David Buss has made me want to take more psychology classes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that you know is a classic because it has such a high reputation for being a truly wonderful book.  This book was a favorite of my dad's (he was a professor at Harvard in the 60's) and he gave it to me as a gift.   This has been a favorite book of mine ever since.  I'm glad it is out again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books I knew I would enjoy but I didn't expect to like as much as I did.  It is so well done that I don't have a problem recommending it to people who like fantasy, but I will admit that I am a bit biased towards it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was really fun to read, I really enjoyed this one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not a big fan of the original trilogy. I thought the first one was poorly written, and the second one just lacked character development. However, this book has a lot of good in it. The plot is very well written, the characters are well drawn, and I found that the plot was not quite as rushed as the first two books. The only thing I did not like about the plot is that the last chapter was a bit confusing. It seemed that a lot more time was spent on the character development, but I wasn't sure if this was a good thing or not.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first chapter is an interesting overview of the current state of the game and its rules.  This book is a great introduction to playing Magic:    This is an excellent primer for any player, and it is very thorough.  There is not a page of the rules I don't understand.   I am currently playing with a group of people who have never played before, and this book has really helped us get started. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about writing. The writing is not flawless but it is very clear.   It is very helpful to have a book like this to show you how to write a good manuscript. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the life and death of a man who was the last survivor of a group of "mystery men." He is a mystery man who also died.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've ever read.   The book's basic premise is that a group of kids have been doing magic tricks, and the magic they've been doing isn't really magic.  It's something that's been around for a long time, but is a lot easier to learn than it seems.  I loved this book because it helped me understand the differences between magicians and other people doing tricks, even though it wasn't explained in the book.  The trick with the book was the author's way of explaining it in a way that I can understand.  If you can read it, it will make sense. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book while waiting for my son's second appointment with his dentist. I was not very impressed, but my son was a little more positive about the experience. I hope he's right.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book about a fascinating person, and I loved reading it.  This book gives a really good explanation of the reasons he left the Church and why he eventually became a Catholic, and why I was so impressed by him and his willingness to leave the Church.  I am sure I will have a lot of fun reading this book in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book, and I've been reading a lot of sci fi lately. It's interesting, thought-provoking, and just a really good read. The cover design is so good it makes me want to read it for a good long while. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book in a couple of sittings.  The author's style is a bit old-fashioned, but his stories are entertaining.  This one is a good one, though. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the history of the American economy, written by a former Wall Street trader who was a pioneer of quantitative analysis. I have read a lot about the history and the development of the economics profession. I really liked this book and recommend it to anyone who wants a good introduction to quantitative economics.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has so much good in it.   The characters are all unique.    The writing is well done and there is a lot of humor in the book.  The ending was satisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy with my first book on the subject, and very happy to have found a publisher.    The author's experience and his knowledge of the subject are very good, and I am glad I can thank him for his valuable contributions to the field. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in college and it still gives me nightmares. It's scary and sad at the same time.  The main character's story is quite a bit different from what I remember from my high school days.  I was a pretty bad drug user, but I also used to take care of my sister's children.  So the book's description of the girl being sexually assaulted while her sister watches is pretty horrifying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book about the history of the "good old days" that I've read.   The author has put a lot of thought into his writing.  It is written with the same kind of passion that drove the author to write the books that have inspired him in his career.  I hope to read more about the time before "good" and "bad" things were done to "good people."  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the story of how a man got his life back. It was great reading the entire book in one sitting. I hope he gets out of prison before I get my license and drive.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good, well-researched and well-written book on the subject of how the New Testament is written  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really fun, with many useful tips on writing a good summary of a book, as well as a very readable introduction to the subject of historical fiction.  The only thing that really bugs me about the book is that it was written by a woman.  It is very clear that she was a major part of the writing process and not just an editor.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so informative. I have a problem with my body as I am only about 170 pounds and have never been able to gain weight.  I have been working with a nutritionist to improve my health and he has been helping me to eat better but still to no avail.  After reading this book I feel so much better about myself and I know that I will be able to start losing weight and keep it off.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, well-written book on the subject of the death penalty.   It is not a bad book at all, but I wish it was a little longer, especially in describing the more recent problems with death penalty procedures in the United States. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must have for anyone who has a passion for the classics: The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Ister and others. I really enjoy reading the classics, but in the past I haven't enjoyed reading the classical literature as much as I do in the recent years.  I'm a big fan of this book, but I think it's my favorite one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to basic Linux administration.  The book covers the basics of Linux in a very detailed and straightforward manner.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is new to Linux.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know what this is about but it is a very nice book. The author gives a detailed description about the different methods of how the two religions were different. I'm not a fan of these two, but I found it interesting to learn about their different beliefs.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many of the "modern" or "postmodern" fiction that's available from a variety of authors and this is a great example.  I'm not usually a fan of contemporary fiction.  It's just too easy to put things in the wrong order and put a new spin on old subjects.  But this book is clever and well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the most accurate and thorough account I have ever seen about the events surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy. It is very well written and the author is a very fine researcher and historian.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will get your child thinking, and it will get them thinking about how others feel about them.  If you are a parent with a young child who is already interested in math, I strongly recommend this book as a good way to help your child develop good habits.  I think that a lot of parents would like to teach their children to be a bit more logical and logical about their own feelings, but I think a lot are too afraid to do it because they are scared their kids will feel left out.  With this book I am confident that I will be teaching my children to feel more comfortable expressing their feelings about themselves and their lives.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book that teaches you how to be an independent thinker.   It helps you make decisions on a day to day basis so you are more effective in your work.  It also helps you to build the self-confidence you need to succeed in the future.  I really enjoy reading about people who are willing to take on big challenges and achieve the goals they set. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. It is a well written story about the life of a poor girl who is trying to do something in the world. She has an unusual talent: her mother taught her how to play the piano, so she could use it to help her in her own life. The story is told from the girl's point of view, which makes it interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will be a valuable reference for all those who wish to study medieval Latin. It will also be a useful reference for those who want to learn Latin, for the very good reason that it is written in a style that is as easy to understand as possible.  The only negative is that some of the examples are not as easy as they could have been, and I found that to be a major drawback.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very skeptical about this book, but after reading it, I have to agree.   There are a lot of interesting historical facts about the British and the American cultures.  The writing is interesting and the historical information is well presented.  This is the first book in the series, and it is a good start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best stories I have ever read.   The story is so original, it's like it was written by a computer.  The only thing that could make it better is if it had a little more character development.  But other than that, I'm really happy that I bought it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent study on the importance of the Bible in the life of a modern Christian. It's not just a "the Bible is a big book" book; it is a great book that will be of value to many people for a very long time. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Christianity or the history of Christianity.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really good. It's funny, well-written, and very informative. I love that you use the term "stupid" to describe people who are stupid enough to have an opinion about politics. I thought it was so funny that I wanted to use it in my own blog.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a very good book. I was very glad I bought it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading these books for years and they are great for keeping you sharp and reading.  I like to keep my reading on a tight schedule but I'm a fast reader so sometimes I can't keep up with my own reading. The books keep you on task and keep you interested in the book.  My daughter has also been reading and enjoys these books too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My kids are so excited about this book!   They've been talking about it for weeks.   I think they might be the first ones to read it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit, I've always loved the way the book's first half is set up, with the protagonist trying to figure out what the hell she's doing in the first place. I've even found a bit of a cliche in it. However, when she does figure out the truth, she discovers a whole lot more about herself that she never expected. I love the characters, too, and I can see how the story might have gone differently if they hadn't been so good together.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a lifelong fan of this series, and this is a great addition to the series.   The characters are rich and real, and the story is fun and well told.  I especially liked the "real" side of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's an excellent book about the history of English-language books, including a chapter on "English in America," which I enjoyed and found useful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had a hard time putting this book down. It is an excellent book on a subject I know a lot about: how to build a successful business. The authors clearly and intelligently cover the important issues of running a successful company: how you get the customers, how you deal with the customers and the quality of the products, etc. The book is very well written. It covers the basics and doesn't leave you in the dark about the next steps.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, detailed book about the way the United States has used, abused, and sometimes forgotten our veterans. The author has done a great job of explaining the reasons for this and has shown us how the veterans were used by politicians and the media to sell more war.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a few books by Paul Kurtz and I always enjoy them. This is the first one that I enjoyed. It's the kind of book that will get you thinking about the issues that are important to you, and it's the type of book you can finish in a few hours.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book on the market today is the classic. I'm a beginner, but have used the method many times and have found it very effective. I just ordered another one, but I think it will be my last. I am sure I will learn more with this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've never read a book quite like this. It is an extraordinary work in itself, but it is so much more. It has been so long since I've been interested in this kind of work that I was almost expecting the book to be a little dry. I was completely wrong. It was like the most engrossing read I've ever had. I just wish it was a little more widely known.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the origins of the world's religions, from the ancient Babylonians to the medieval Catholic church.  It covers the history of religion from the beginning, with many of the first major religions.  I enjoyed it and the explanation of the origin of the various religions is excellent.  There is no need to look at the Bible or any other ancient books to get the history.  For that you have to do your own research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I had a problem with it at first, but found it was actually quite good.

The book is not a how-to manual, but is a good reminder for those who need a refresher in the art of being a good leader and teacher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The two authors are very competent and it is easy to see why they have so many books in the series out.  This is a great reference for any serious history buff or anyone who wants to get a feel for what is happening in the world today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book. It provides information on the origins of the American Revolution that has never been published before.  The information is quite detailed and I found it extremely useful.  It is not a book that will change your life, but it might inspire you to write a book about something that interests you.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   There is so much that is right about it.  The concept is simple and interesting, and the story is easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the first I ever read about a very successful person.   He was a great salesman and he never lost his self confidence.  He could make anyone want to do business with him.  This guy was one of the most successful people I've ever seen.  I wish more people would read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot, and found it a lot more interesting than the book I already own.  The story is very interesting, but I didn't find it very interesting for the same reasons that I don't like science fiction.  It's interesting to think about what a society like ours might be like if it had the same laws as other societies, if there was a lot less racism, if they had a good education system.  But I just couldn't get very invested in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I've been looking for a book like this since I was a teenager. The story is told in such a way that you are constantly rooting for the hero. As a matter of fact, I think this book was the inspiration for the film version of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has the best plot I've read in years. I read it in three days and was hooked in the first chapter.  The only bad thing about it is the ending but even that is worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a freshman in college. It has helped me a great deal in my current academic work.  I've been looking for something like this in the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book in a series by Peter S. Beagle that I have purchased. I'm not sure if this is a one time purchase, or if it's the only book in the series, but the book is excellent and the story told is one I've longed to see told. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about 3 years ago.   I was very surprised by how well the author managed to convey what happened to her and her mother while in the war.  It's a wonderful read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by my son.  I didn't know what to expect.  After reading it a few times, I realized that he is right about the book's "hippie" vibe.  The story is a funny, well written, and well thought out parody of the genre.  It also makes fun of the science of the field and the literary value of the work.  There is also a great love of all things science.  This is a great book to read on the road or at the beach.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a real gem of a work:  This is a good overview of a complex issue, with a nice blend of science and the personal.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books I'm not sure I'm going to like at all but I'm sure I'll read it.  It's about the life of a poor boy in the middle of the Depression.  I think the author is very good at writing about the hardships and hardships of a very poor man's life.  His writing is very descriptive about the poverty he lived in.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was in my early 20s, and the fact that I had never heard of it before is probably one of the reasons why. The story is simple, but the prose is excellent.  It was a very enjoyable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book by Michael D. Evans quite useful.  It will give you the information you need to build a strong case against the idea that every man should be allowed to have sex with his wife for the first time at the age of 18.  The book explains that the typical 18 year old boy is immature and will make a poor husband or father.  He also explains that if he is willing to accept responsibility for his actions, he will be able to make a good wife.  This book is a must read for anyone considering having sex with their wife at the first opportunity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been using this book for a long time.   It helps me understand more about the history of the United States, particularly about its early years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a way to pass the time while working on my Masters in Educational Leadership. I've read a lot about leadership and how to lead a group of people, but this book makes it clear that there are a whole lot of other ways to be a leader. I'm going to be working hard on my leadership skills in the coming years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written and well researched book on the American Indian, the Navajo.  It is full of interesting information.  I found it very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a lot of fun. I don't like horror, but this book was great fun.  It has a few horror elements, but they weren't that intense and were kept to a minimum.  I didn't mind, but I can imagine how it might annoy some people.  This is a good, enjoyable read for the most part.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found myself enjoying this book. I like the idea of a story about a young boy who becomes a priest. I was impressed by how well the author did with the writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book. It tells the story of a group of people who lived in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  It has been written with the utmost detail and is extremely informative.  The author has taken many of the old stories from the old newspapers and used them to tell the stories of the modern day.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that is just too good to be true. The writing is amazing and the story is so vivid that I had to turn the page to reread it. The story was so well-told, the characters were so realistic, and the setting was so vivid, that I wanted to know more about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read that deals with the life of an autistic. It's an honest look at his life and it's fascinating.  I would like to read more about the world of autism and the struggles they face as they grow into adults.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The writing is excellent, and the information is in-depth, but I found myself questioning some of the assertions made.     The first is that the authors claim that they are not "disillusioned with our government", despite the fact that they have been "disappointed by many aspects of the administration's performance" (p. 22).   In the case of Iraq, the authors seem to be saying that they were "disheartened" by the decision to go to war, even though the war was not necessary.  For example, they claim that "Iraq was not really in a state to be invaded", but "the invasion was clearly the right thing to do at the time" (pp. 22-23).  This is an interesting argument, but they could have said the same thing about the war in Afghanistan (in which the invasion was also unnecessary), or the war against Iraq (in fact, the only reason to go in was to provide "safe harbor" for the U.S. banking system).  We know that the war on Iraq was a "mistake" because Saddam Hussein was overthrown by U.N. forces, but the authors also say that the "U.S., and the world, would have been better off had Saddam Hussein not been in power" (ibid.).  I am sure that the U to have been in Iraq under the former regime was not a good thing, but if the war had not been justified then, what did it gain?   It is true that the Iraqi government was corrupt and incompetent, but that is true of all governments.  It also ignores the fact of the war itself: the war "was a mistake that had consequences".  This is a valid point, but one can argue that the consequences were not desirable.  If the war went ahead, the U.S. would have to provide billions of dollars of support to the Iraqi people to rebuild their country.  One can argue the case that the invasion of Iraq is an example of a war gone badly, but it is hard to argue that it was necessary. It is also true that if the invasion had been postponed, the United States would not have needed the Iraqi military, but what did that matter to the U s? 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has helped me to overcome my fear of spiders. I had a severe phobia for spiders when I was little. When I was in the fourth grade, I wrote a note on the back of a book that said, "I can't stand spiders, I hope you're not like me." This book was the only thing that really helped me, but it's something I'll keep in mind for the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book on the history of American law.  It covers a broad range of law, covering both state and federal statutes and regulations, and even some common cases.  I'm a lawyer by training, but this book will help me understand the law better.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent, well-written book. It gives you all the information you need about how to get good results with your hair.  I have been told that there is no such thing as bad hair. This book shows that there IS a bad hair day.  The book does a good job of describing each type of hair, how to deal with it, and the types of products you can use to help your hair look better.  This book is great for those of us who want to improve our hair but are unable to afford expensive products. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a great refresher course in the ways of the world's most effective fighting style: The Karate Kid.   The book is written by the real-life Karate fighter, Royce Gracie, who is credited with inventing it.  Royce was a brilliant, hard-nosed fighter who did not just rely on brute force to win.  He employed tactics that were well thought out and were honed through years of training.  As with most great fighters, he had to learn the art of the counter and to utilize the techniques he invented to beat his opponents.  I'm sure there are others who would have learned these lessons from Royce, but I'm not one of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the kind of book that you find on your own at your local library.   The characters are interesting and the story is very well-paced.  It was interesting to see how the different characters came to be related to each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about a difficult subject. The author, a man who was forced to marry a woman at a young age because he was black and she was white, gives a good account of his life in the civil rights movement. I think it is important that we hear about people who came before us to see what we have been doing wrong. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book.  It is a must-have for every college-level sociology class.  The research is thorough and well-organized.  I love how the author uses the book to teach sociocultural anthropology to college students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  It has lots of great information about the development of the American Revolution, which I have been interested in since I was a teenager.  The fact that we now have a lot more information about these events than the time period is exciting.  If you are interested in history and want to know about the American revolution, this book is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fun little book.    I really like the author's writing style.  He has a good way of describing things that are not so very good.  The book was very entertaining and fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed reading this book.   It's got all the elements: a well-drawn cast, an interesting setting, a good plot and characters.  It doesn't get bogged down with a bunch of extraneous "woo hoo" dialogue, and it's a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating account of how the U.S. government, working with local and federal law enforcement, tried to stop organized crime in the 1980s.   There are some very good investigative journalists involved in the book, as well as the people themselves.  It's also nice to see a lot of old photos and old documents included. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the nature of language and the role of language in society. I enjoyed the way it was written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written, entertaining and highly entertaining story. I was very happy to get a copy for a gift for a friend who has always wanted a book about the life of Winston Churchill.  The book is a bit short (only about 2 hours long) but still very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book very helpful, but not to a "wow" level. I found that the book provided the background to a lot of my issues, but did not have a very strong understanding of what that background is. I am a fairly good at understanding why things are not the way they should be.  The book also didn't provide any specific strategies for dealing with the various "issues" that have come up, but rather just explained them and how to deal with them.  If I had to do it all over again I would have read the book over again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The main character is an intelligent, very thoughtful, and well-read person who was raised to believe that the Bible is the literal word of God. She finds that this is a huge mistake, and has spent the last fifteen years trying to find the "true" meaning of Scripture (including a brief stint as a missionary in India). This book, in my opinion, was a wonderful introduction to the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant book on a topic that has troubled me for years. The authors show a lot of sympathy for their young subjects, who are in many ways not that different from their own teenage selves. The way the authors go about the research makes it obvious that their subjects are trying to figure out the real meaning of life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read that I enjoyed.  A lot of good information.  I've used this information in my home renovation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent guide to understanding the nature of intelligence and how it fits in with creativity and imagination.  I am an artist and have spent many hours thinking about the relationship between creativity and intelligence.  The book shows that intelligence and creativity are not mutually exclusive.  They are complementary and the two things must be nurtured in order to grow together.  This is very true when you consider the creative process.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  The author really makes the story engaging and interesting.  This book does a good job at making the characters more likeable.  If you have ever read a good science fiction novel, you'll enjoy this book as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had this book for over a year and still find myself reading it every couple of weeks.    It is such a good read that I can't wait to get through it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many books about children in war zones and this one is one of the best. It's written in a very interesting way. I'm not a parent myself but I think it's really important to teach children that there are different sides to everything and sometimes the best way to make the world a better place is to stop and talk with people. I would have been happy to read about the experiences of my friends who were fighting in Iraq but instead I found a good adult book to help me understand and learn.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not a fan of this book at first, but found it to be a good read. I don't think I'll be going back to the author, but I may read it again later on.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. I am always looking for a good way to read a historical work by someone who is also a historian. The book is not so much about the war as it is about the aftermath. There are many excellent historical accounts, but this one, in my opinion, is the best. I found the writing very clear and concise. I do not think the author does a bad job at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of interesting information about the evolution of human beings.  I learned about the origins of the word "sex" and that a few centuries ago it meant "unconsciously masturbating."  I also learned about a number of diseases that were once thought to be caused by sexual activity.  My favorite is that masturbation is responsible for the spread of AIDS.  It would be nice to know how this came about in the first place.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book on the "difficult relationship" between a man and a woman. The book is about a man who became involved with a woman who wanted him to be her "best friend" when she was going through a bad break up. She kept pressuring him to help her through it. He didn't feel comfortable doing that. He felt guilty about it. So he became more and more defensive. The end of the book describes the beginning of the man's love affair with his wife. It is interesting to me that most of the people who write about this type of relationship don't even think about the fact that men and women may be wired differently. It was a hard relationship for me to write about because I was so confused and angry at the man for what he was doing. He was so good at "playing the game" that he got off on the woman's hurt feelings. The best part about the book is the description of the woman in the beginning:  She is in the early stages of having a child, which she is doing on her own. Her husband has just divorced her. She has a good job. She drives a nice car. She is a good mother to her kids. The man sees her as a good wife. He sees her not as a person, but as a piece of property. She doesn't have a good marriage. She isn't a good mom. She hasn't been to work in a long time. She looks like she is getting fat. Her hair is falling out. She wears glasses. She seems to be always sick or on some sort of meds. She feels like a disappointment to her husband. And her children, especially the youngest one, don't seem to be taking the cues from her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.   He is my favorite character.  He doesn't care about his family, he doesn't know what he wants and how to get it.  In the first book Harry gets everything he wants, he gets a magic wand, and he goes on a quest to find the only book that will tell him how to find out how to have all the other books.  It is a very well written book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the idea of a book about a single mom (and her daughter) living in an abusive relationship.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must-read book for anyone who loves the art of creative writing.  A writer is not the same as a painter.  If you enjoy writing, you'll find a lot to love about this book.  It is short and sweet and the writing is great.  The best part about it is that you can get a free copy by buying a book from a local library or buying it on amazon 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been searching for a book on the art of juggling for a while, but it was impossible to find anything about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've found this book to be very useful in my life, and I am glad I purchased it.   The advice given is a lot more practical than a lot of other books on the same subject, and is very practical for the average person.  It's a good starting point if you're just starting out with the basics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great introduction to the history of American science fiction and fantasy.  There is nothing in the story that is too contrived or overblown, and nothing that feels like a "what if?"  The characters are all engaging and unique, with their own special skills.  It is a joy to read this book as a child and be reminded of the amazing things I read as a kid.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating look at the history of the American West. The first part of the book is about how the railroad came into play in the West, and how the new development has affected the economy and culture of the area. Then it goes into the history and development of the western United States, starting with the gold rush of the 1850's, and going into the early 1900's when the railroad was in the forefront of development in the area, and what happened after that. The book concludes with some interesting questions about the future of the west, including what is to be done about the environment in the region.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a good read, and I enjoyed it as a result.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown's works, including The Da Vinci Code.  This book is no exception.  I really enjoyed reading it.  The plot was intriguing.  It wasn't a straight forward plot but the author did a good job of weaving in and out of the plot.  As a side note, this is the first book in a series and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The writing is really well done. It has a good sense of humor about it. I also enjoyed the idea of a group of people who want to see the world, but are afraid to try because they don't know how to do it. This is an excellent book for a group on a field trip. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It is a history of the development of the first space race and the American space program in particular. It describes the development and testing of the rockets used to get men to the Moon, and also the space program during the Cold War. The story begins with the first moon landing, the first manned flight to Mars, the establishment of the NASA, and the involvement of the military. It details the various technical problems encountered in the development, testing and operation of the various space vehicles. It also discusses the various political issues that arose during the development period of these spacecraft and how they affected the programs in the long run. It's a fascinating and thought provoking book that is very well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very excited to read this book.   It's a good review of the state of computer security in the late 20th century.  The author makes a very good point about the importance of security in software:  -  Software must be secure if it's to be useful.  -  In a computer network, there is a price to be paid for having security.  I don't know if this is true in all software, but it's something I have observed in both commercial and open source software. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a good read.   I think this book is good because the author has a clear, concise style, a good vocabulary, and a good knowledge of American history.  I'm a sucker for good history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and concise book that explains the differences between the different kinds of human-like robots.  This book is not just about humanoid robots; the concepts covered in this book are relevant to many types of robots, such as autonomous vehicles and robot helpers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really good, even though it has some bad parts:  First, the author's own experiences as a Christian made him realize how difficult it can be to deal with Christian people in a non-Christian culture.   He is a really smart guy and could have written a brilliant book.  It would have been really interesting to hear his ideas about how to talk to Christians about this kind of stuff.  But he didn't, so instead he writes a really dry, non-helpful book that would not be of much use in a discussion.  He did do a good job of describing the issues, but that is pretty much it.  Second, this book is full of Christian stereotypes and assumptions:  He tells a story about how his father had the same kind of reaction to reading a story in the Bible about a young boy who was burned to death by his own father that he had when reading about that story in a good friend's book.     This kind of story just isn't believable, and so the author gives it a rather one-dimensional, cliched, and even insulting characterization.  That is a problem in itself:  If the author can't even tell a good story, how can he tell one about the Bible, which has many good stories about people dying and being saved?  It is especially bad since the book is very long and this is one of the chapters.  Third, this author makes a big deal about how the Bible says that the way we should treat each other should be based on our mutual acceptance of the other person's beliefs.  This is just not true.  If you don't accept the person's belief, then it is pointless to argue about it:  It really isn't about you at all.  (As a nonbeliever, I can tell you that when I was in school, I used to get really annoyed by this kind-of argument.)   Fourth, this is a very, very specific kind of argument:  This kind of Christian argument assumes that there is some sort of "correct" way to talk about people:  That we should just say "That's what the Bible said!"  This has very little to do with any of us as human beings:  We have to talk, argue, and compromise with people we don't agree with.  And sometimes we disagree about how we should do this.  I would suggest that it is important to
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for the whole family, especially those of us who have never read any of the Tolkien classics. I read Tolkien as a young boy and it's great to see him being done justice.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book interesting, but a bit dated.   The story is interesting enough, but the setting seems to have a lot of holes that could easily have been filled in by a better author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited about this book because it's my favorite, but the author's lack of knowledge about the history of the Holocaust is appalling.  He claims that the Holocaust was only "justified" in the eyes of the "international community," but no one in his book quotes anyone saying this.  No one says that.  There's a bit about the Poles but that's it.  Even if there were some justification, I think the author has missed a huge point about what the Holocaust really is.  It's a form of collective punishment:  the Nazis killed Jews because they were Jews.  The Nazis had other ideas about Jews, and they targeted other groups for their own hatred:  Jews and Communists, Slavs and gays.  I don't believe the author really thinks that much about the Holocaust, but he seems to be going out of his way to write it off as a case of a few bad apples.  This is a serious mistake, and it's a shame that this book is so poorly researched. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so interesting that I kept looking up the source.  The author seems to have a lot of interesting facts about the military.  This is definitely one of those books that should be read by all military personnel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent and comprehensive study of the Jewish heritage of the United States.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Jewish history and culture.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a collection of stories by three of the most interesting people I have ever met.  The stories are funny, insightful and interesting.  One of the stories was a story about a man that got his wife pregnant.  They got married and had a child together.  That was until the woman had a miscarriage and left him.  He took it very hard and was on the verge of a breakdown.  This was a time when a lot of women were not married and not getting married.  It was a sad story but it was very interesting and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the idea of a man falling in love with a woman after having children.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had a hard time reading much in the way of fiction. I am trying to read more nonfiction but so far I am having a hard go of it.   But this is a great book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read. It was very well written. I am sure this will be a classic in the future of children's literature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well-written, readable book about a very strange case. The case is that of the so-called "Creamsicle Murders" (a name that was never proven). In fact, the case was never solved at all. In fact there is a good reason why it never was: the authorities did not have enough evidence to try a murder case that was so unusual. I don't think this case is unique, but I was a little surprised that it never got more attention. It's a fun read, and it's interesting to read about the strange life of one of the victims.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I found it very easy to read. I especially enjoyed the information about how to create a unique image on a blank white paper. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. I have already read the first few chapters and I can't wait for the next.  I have been using it for several years as a tool for improving my writing and I have found it extremely useful.  The main reason I got this book is because I found it very helpful when I was trying to learn to write and edit my own work.  It helped me get out of my rut of writing in a style that didn't meet my needs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at a very young age. I don't remember much, but I do remember my parents taking me to a book signing. I thought the book was very good. I liked the way it ended and it was very cute. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't recommend the book highly enough.   In a world where many people seem to be writing and publishing things with an eye towards making money, there are very few authors who can get away with doing what she does:   make her books as good as she can.  This is a book about the process, not the outcome, and it shows.  I'm always amazed by the things that can be accomplished in a short period of time, and this book shows you just how amazing it can be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say I am surprised by the quality of this book.   It's a little slow in getting going, but that's the way I like my books.  It will take me a while to get through the last book in the series, but once I get there, I can see it becoming one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read.  The book has a lot of good ideas but is a bit too technical for my tastes.  I really enjoyed the descriptions and the descriptions of the food were very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful. I can see why this book was published. The authors put their own unique stamp on the material. The illustrations are fantastic.   The authors write about some pretty disturbing things, but the images are vivid enough to be scary.  The stories are pretty chilling, but they never seem to go anywhere. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the history of the United States from its founding to the present. The authors are excellent historians and they take a close look at how the United states came to be.

It covers the early studies on the effects of various nutrients on the growth of cattle and how they were refined and improved over the next century to a modern form.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on the subject of writing.  The author, an excellent journalist, does a wonderful job of conveying the history of writing, from the days when pen and paper were the only writing tools available, to the typewriter, to computers, to email, to Twitter, to Facebook, and now to Twitterbots.  It is fun to read, and it is a great reminder to keep writing and to write good books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book.    The book is about a girl named Alice.  Her father is an inventor and she has a lot of inventions.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is about the famous and legendary John Wayne. The author was a friend of his father and he gave him a copy of The Way he Won which was John Wayne's autobiography. I think Wayne is the best actor ever, the best in film history and the best of all time. The book describes how Wayne was raised in poverty and went to Hollywood to work as a stunt man, then made his own films.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in the "Mystery in a Box" series by Sarah Monette.  I was a little hesitant at first because I am not a fan of mystery books.  However, I was intrigued by the plot, the twists and turns, and the character development.  It was fun to see a character that I didn't know well grow as she was introduced.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A fascinating look at the social life of an American city through the eyes of an outsider.   The author is a young woman who lived in the Bay Area for years, but has never been able to leave because she just doesn't get it:   It's not like the country, where they can get drunk and shoot guns and party all night, but here it's so strict that I'm afraid to drive.  I'm sure people just like to drink and party, but I'm just not one of them.  This book is an interesting look at why that is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad I found this book. I was reading it on a plane when my eyes were drawn to the word "cunt." I was appalled at the way the author defined it. I couldn't take my eyes off it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I am a Christian who has had a hard time with it. I can relate to the frustration of being called a heathen for not accepting Christ. This book is very good at talking about how we can learn to love our neighbor as ourselves. I think that is something we all need to remember.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best science books I've read in years.  The authors explain and support the ideas in the text very well and it's very readable.

The author also has an interesting perspective on the process of writing and the many challenges that must be faced along the way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book about the early development of the American nuclear program. This book shows that while we may not have had atomic weapons yet, we were already a world leader in science and technology, and the nuclear age was about to begin. The story begins in 1939, just a few months after the United States entered the war. During that time, the Department of Defense set up a secret laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to build the first atomic bomb. This is one of those books that makes you want to go out and start a nuclear power plant yourself, even if you don't have the slightest idea how to do it. This history, from the 1940s to the 1970s, is quite interesting and will give you a better understanding of how we got to where we are today.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first half of the book was a very good introduction to a book of a different sort: the study of the ancient Chinese zodiac.  It was fun, very interesting and very readable.  The second half is much less interesting, though not without interest.

The book is filled with interesting information about the German occupation of Austria, including a great deal of good military history and the way the German military used tactics to break up the Austrian army in the middle of the war. The author is well informed about the Austro-German alliance and its impact on the war, and is clear that the German government did not make a mistake by invading Austria.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first chapter of this book is about the birth of the internet. I can't remember the exact year that I first heard about it. It probably was in the late 70's or early 80's. When I was first learning about computers, it was very exciting because it seemed like such a big step up from the teletypes that were on the telephones back then. I never thought that I would use the internet to search for information about anything. I had my old computer at home, but it wasn't very powerful. So, when I saw this book I was quite excited. It was just another good book about technology.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book for my 11 year old son, who's a big fan of fantasy.   He loves to read and has never liked a book with a female main character that doesn't turn out to be a damsel in distress.  He was absolutely riveted by this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It was a good way to get into the subject of the relationship between a male and a female dog. I'm not sure if the author was intending to show a negative side of the male dog's role in the household or to show how females can be just as important to the family as males. It's really hard to say if he's right or wrong about the subject but I think I'll be reading more about the topic in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on the history of American political parties.    It is not just that it covers the long period of American politics from the 1790s until the early 1900s.  It does a good job of explaining why and how the Republicans and Democrats came to be the two major political parties in the United States.  The book also has a good history of the American parties and the various political movements that were involved in the formation of the two parties.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a lot of books as a kid, but I always thought the best of them were the ones that were written in a foreign language. That's why I was so excited to read this book in Chinese (and my favorite author, Richard Matheson)

Write a positive review about a good book:    As someone who is in his early 30's, this book is perfect for anyone who's ever felt awkward about taking a girlfriend to a nice dinner and wants to know more about that.   I have a boyfriend who likes to spend a lot of time on the computer, but when I ask him why he likes it, he says, "It's because it's better than watching TV."   This book is for you if you agree. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read all the books in the series and I've enjoyed them all. This is my second one, and while the first was about a group of women who are the only ones to ever escape from a group home, this one is about a woman who goes out to a bar and meets her hero, a woman that she thought she was too old for. The writing is great and the book is a good read, but the plot didn't interest me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject of writing for children ever written.  It has everything you need to learn how to write for children:  a short story, an introduction to story writing, a list of writing tips, and an easy-to-follow chapter on how to teach a child how to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. The authors are very clear about what they mean by a good work:  It has a good structure, good ideas, good language, good examples, and good results.  The book is also very useful for those who have not yet written their first article:  The first chapter provides a very clear and concise explanation of the main concepts in the text, and the book then goes on to show a number of examples that can be used to apply these ideas.  It is a good introduction to writing for those of us who have never written anything before, and it is a handy handbook for those trying to get started on the writing process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very interested in the subject of the book. I was interested in learning about the subject because it seems to be something that has been ignored by our culture.  The author shows that the subject is very important and worth thinking about.

It's written in a very clear and concise manner.  It covers some of the more common things you'll find on freelancing websites, but covers some that you won't.  As far as I'm concerned, this book is a must have if you want to start a freelance career.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book extremely interesting, not just as a science fiction book but as a fascinating, thought-provoking, and humorous look at the history of human consciousness.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of my all time favorites! I've loved this series from the very beginning and have been looking for the next book, but this book was a bit more of a challenge.   The setting is not exactly like the one in the book, and there are a few places where I didn't quite buy the logic, but that's the fun of the book.  I like the fact that I can get a little bit of information about a setting while keeping it a secret for the moment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was good.  I used it for my history class.  It helped me learn about the different aspects of the civil war.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because I wanted to learn more about the world of modern art. It's been a while since I have done so. I don't remember exactly when I first got into it, but it must have been around the time of the Renaissance. In the beginning of the book, a woman is interviewed by a French writer about her life as a professional artist. She was an accomplished painter as well, and she gave her life to art in an effort to understand what it was that really made her unique. As I read, I was really impressed by the way that the book explained what made these women unique. There is an enormous amount of art that can be done by an average person. If you were to look at a painting by a modern artist and attempt to create something like it, it is probably not going to turn out very well. This is because the human eye is not particularly good at recognizing subtle nuances and the details that add a little bit of meaning to an otherwise unremarkable image. It is more than likely that if you tried to do this with a painting from a hundred years ago, it would look terrible. The difference between a good painting and a bad one is really very small. This book explains why. One of the key differences between these people and the rest of the human population is that they are very good at seeing the big picture. They have a better understanding of how a particular action affects the whole picture, and that makes a difference in how well they can create. It also explains why their art is so good. I was just as impressed by this book as I was by the work of many of the other artists that it discusses.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a bit taken aback by how much I enjoyed this book. I am a huge fan of the movie version of this book, so I was looking forward to reading a book version of it. I was somewhat disappointed that the movie didn't quite capture the feel of the book. It was also kind of a waste to have the main character be a boy because there were just so many opportunities for him to be a girl. But then again, I can't read a book that has all the major female characters being boys so there you go.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always happy to read a good fiction book, especially when it's one that I've already read, or is about something I already know. This book is one of those books. I have a couple of friends who love to play chess. I'm very good at chess. This is the first time I've read a book about chess that actually had something to do with chess.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and it's really helpful for anyone that is thinking about becoming a parent. I was going to write something positive about it but then I thought that I would be talking about something that is not that good. It is an interesting and very practical book. It's a bit dated now but I would still recommend it to anyone looking to have a child.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  It's about the life of the famous French novelist, Louis-Ferdinand Celine.  As I said, he's not my favorite novelist, but he's certainly my favorite writer in France.  He's an interesting and interesting guy.  I enjoyed reading about him in this book as he was doing so many things at the time.  If you like Celine's work, this is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a real eye opener. My son had a terrible reaction to the measles vaccine and was having a lot of trouble learning. I looked at his doctor for a few years after his diagnosis. We looked at the vaccines we gave him but he wasn't improving. He was having so many problems learning and so many long term health issues. I have to tell you that I am so grateful that I found this book. I was able to get my son on a natural food diet and it really helped him. Now he is a very happy healthy little guy and is doing great. I'm so glad that I got this book to help my son.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only book I have ever bought that was totally and entirely appropriate for a child's bedroom. The illustrations are cute, but I would have preferred more than just a picture of a kitten in a pink shirt. I am not sure what the point is in making the cat be so short, but that's all it is: a short cat. It was a bit frustrating for me to have to turn the pages, because there are a lot of pages.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good. I don't know why so many people dislike it.  It is very informative, the examples are great, and it covers so much ground in so little time.  I had to read the whole thing over to get it all down, but I finished it before the end of my book period.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not only very good, but it is also an interesting read. This book discusses the impact of a good Christian upbringing and the influence that it has on a person. As someone who was raised Catholic and now considers myself a secular humanist, this book was very interesting. The author does a good job at showing the difference between faith and belief. I also liked the idea that faith can be both a virtue and a curse.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about love, friendship, and family.  It is a great book for all children and is also a very good book for older children.

This book made me think about some of the things that I used to believe about education.  I am so glad that I got to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to the series when I was a child. The story about the girl who lost her virginity was so captivating that I read it over and over again. It is an amazing story about a girl that lost her innocence in a different way but still remains so pure and pure in her character that I still love her.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book and I have the feeling that it will be in my library for a long time. It was a very enjoyable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, easy-to-follow book on how to develop a skill that will serve you well for years to come. It's not a big book--only about a third of the way through, but the rest is a very enjoyable read. It really does take you through a lot of the basic principles of how to learn anything--you learn the basics about how to be able to do a task (which is one of the most basic things that any person can learn) and you really do learn that in the end there is a method to learning any task.  It's definitely something that I will definitely put some time into and use in the future.

It contains a lot of information about the different types of weapons used by the Native Americans.  The authors use photos and drawings to show the types of weapon.  This book is a good read, and if you ever want to learn about Native American weapons, this book is just what you need.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not really sure what it is about, but the author's description is so true:  This book is about the life of a woman who lived through the most tragic times in our nation's history: the Civil War, the Spanish American War, and the Great Depression.  The book is filled with personal anecdotes, such as the one about a neighbor's cat who had a terrible stank of urine all over him when he died.   The cat's death and the story of how it was covered up are amazing.  I found it to be very interesting and well-written.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the few books I can recommend to a friend. I read this book with great interest, especially as I am now a woman, so I feel a lot more confident about being able to do a good job at writing. The author's insights on gender roles and how they impact our relationship with the other gender are well worth taking the time to read about.

I'm especially excited to learn that the United States was founded by a British Army officer who was also a slave owner.  This is a great book about a fascinating topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm reading the first book in this trilogy, and it's very much a Harry Potter re-telling, and very much Harry Potter.   However, it's not as bad as I feared.  The magic system is much more elaborate than Harry's, but it's still easy to use.  I find it a lot easier to memorize spells than Harry does.  However there are still a lot of spells that require a lot more concentration than Harry ever had, and the lack of practice is something that takes time.  Overall the magic system was not as good as the Harry Potter books, but I do like the way the magic is handled in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have read in the last couple of years. It covers everything from how to be a good friend to being a good girlfriend to how to raise a family. It's so well written and easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for the first time after reading The Dark Knight Returns.   Batman is so much more complex and interesting than the Joker.   It's nice to see the different aspects of Batman.  I love the Batman/Joker dynamic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of my relationship with my sister is one that many people will relate to. She is a woman that I have loved and respected my whole life. She has always been the rock in my family. I have seen her grow from a young girl into a strong woman, to a woman of maturity and wisdom, to someone that is a role model to me. In the end, she is a good person with good intentions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit skeptical at first but once I started reading this book   it   really   got   under my skin   It   reminded me of   the   great   books   like   "The   The   Man Who Could Have Been"   and   "The  Book  that   Saved the World"    
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien.  The series is filled with wonderful scenes and memorable characters.  This book does not disappoint.  One of my favorite scenes is in the Shire.  There's a wonderful exchange between Legolas and Gimli where Legolas is saying how much he dislikes the way Gimli looks at him, while Gimli is saying he's just being friendly.  I find it humorous.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a lot of self help and personal development books and I've never found one that really resonated with me like this one.  It's about a woman who has been through a lot in her life, including her mother's suicide, but is still able to get through things.  This book has helped me a lot and I'm not just saying that because I was in my mid-20's when my mother took her life.    She was one of my earliest memories of my mom and my brothers.  She had a difficult childhood and her depression and anger got worse as she got older.  I never knew that she was struggling but I had been struggling my whole life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of my favorites.   This book is the story of a man who is very religious and also very poor.  He doesn't think much of anything he does, but he tries to be good.  I really liked that he took it all in.  It is so interesting to see the way religion is taken from a person and turned around in such a short time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've ever read on the subject of the Church's role in modern American society. It's also a fascinating study of a controversial figure.  As someone who is interested in both religion and modern society, this is a must-read for anyone interested in this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, readable book about the history of American Jews. The book is written in a very readable style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the life and legacy of the American Jewish intellectual Paul Baran. Baran was the greatest living American Jewish philosopher, one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century, and the first American Jewish scholar to write a work of political philosophy.  Baran's political philosophy was very much influenced by his Jewish faith.  He believed that the Jewish people should play a significant role in the shaping of a more just society.  I enjoyed the book very much, especially the sections on the philosophy of democracy and socialism, as well as Baran and the work of American Jewish socialist and political theorist Max Lerner.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many books by other authors and this one is by far my favorite.   It's a well-researched and well-written book about an alien civilization that has colonized Earth and is also the source of a lot of our problems.  The aliens are far more advanced than we are and are also much more peaceful than the rest of us.  These facts make the book quite fascinating and is one of the best books I've ever read about aliens and their influence on humanity.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read all the Harry Potter books and love them, so I'm super excited about this one. My favorite is probably Order of the Phoenix, but I can't get enough of the Deathly Hallows, so this is pretty awesome. I hope they never make a spin off.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I found a way to read it in a different way from the books that I have read before.  I also found a great way to use a good amount of time to find the information I needed to know to be successful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for my class and we all loved it. I liked the fact that the authors did a great job of showing how religion is often used to justify evil. It's interesting to learn about how the founders of our country used the Bible as a tool to justify slavery and discrimination. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful story about the early life of an immigrant family in a small town, and the importance of learning about one's past is a perfect companion to this year's book, The History of the American Family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read all of the books in this series before, but the last two I've not finished, and I'm not sure I'd even want to read the others.  The setting is nice, the characters interesting and sympathetic, and the plot twist and suspense are well done.  I can see why it has received such good reviews, so hopefully I'll finish the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was interesting and I learned a lot from the book.   I'm a student of Chinese, and I was surprised that some of the characters were based on people in my family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the idea of a story-driven novel set in the same universe as "The Dresden Files," but I can't find a good place to start with it.  It's hard to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with it, and it's disappointing to me that the plot twists never quite work out.  I do like the idea that this is not a story of a normal family and that the characters aren't just in the way, but that there is something really wrong about them and that it will be a big surprise when they get their comeuppance.  The book is not so much about the plot but more about the relationships between the characters, and they work surprisingly well.  This isn't a book you should pick up to read in one sitting, but a book that you can take with you when you go somewhere.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about life with ADHD. The author does a great job explaining how it affects people's lives and how people can cope with it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good introduction to the field.  The information is not overwhelming, but is not to be overlooked either.  It does take some time to get used to the terminology, but once you get it, it's not hard to figure out how the process works.  My advice is to use a combination of a basic model and a simplified model, and not rely solely on a model when your model doesn't quite fit the data. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that got me started on fantasy fiction. I don't think it's a bad book by any means, but the characters are just too unbelievable.  I'm not a huge fan of fantasy, but this one just doesn't hold my attention. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so happy to see another woman's voice in my life.   She's not just a mom and daughter who are just naturally close, but a woman with a strong independent personality who is also a very intelligent woman.  The only thing that I would change about her story is that she has a boyfriend at the time she tells it, which is a little awkward. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is written in a very straightforward manner that makes the information as clear as possible. I think the book would be even more useful if it had been in a more accessible form.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was skeptical about reading a story about a dog with a very unusual appearance.   My daughter and I found this book very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the world of sci fi novels with their complex characters and interesting themes.  This is another such book, this time about a space-faring race of robots who can be trained to think for themselves.  I especially enjoyed the science fiction twist:  the robot brains are not designed to understand or think for other humans.  The robots are programmed to learn from what they have been exposed to as children and this leads to the most hilarious scene in the book.  If you enjoy a good space opera or sci fi, you'll probably like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best way I've found to describe what a good and healthy diet is like, but without getting bogged down in it.    A good diet is the most important thing you can do for your health, and the one that I have been following since I was a teenager. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great, quick read, especially since the author's background is in biology. This book is a great introduction to evolutionary biology, the science of life, and the scientific process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got my copy of this in a random order from a friend. I'm not a huge fan of fantasy books, but I'm very glad I picked it up.   This is a good example of a book that is just as much about the world as it is about the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I ever read was The Three Little Pigs by Theodor Geisel. I loved it and still do, although my memory is a little hazy as to how the plot actually went. However, this book has all of the same characteristics. There's the beautiful illustrations, the cute characters, the whimsical humor, and the story that has all the charm of the children's story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book that explains the difference between a natural and an unnatural birth. This is an excellent read for the woman who wants to be a better mother and the man who wants more control over his birth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very good introduction to the history of American law and economics, and it is very accessible. It covers the major themes and controversies in the field, including: the rise of laissez-faire capitalism in the United States; the development of legal theories of contract; and the development and use of the profit-and-loss method of economic analysis. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Twilight series.  It's always been one of my favorites.  This is another great book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a very useful tool in my research of the history of the early American colonists.  As an English/Scottish woman, I find the American accents quite fascinating.  I can tell you for a fact that the "M" of "Merry Christmas" is the British "O" (from "Oyster" and "Owlet"), which would make it the English equivalent of "Auntie".  I have no doubt that "Olive" was a very common American accent back then, especially in Massachusetts, where the "O", "I", "Y", and "N" were common.  But I also can't imagine that the early colonists spoke like that.  There is a lot to learn about early American life, and I would highly recommend this book to any interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was interesting and well-written, but the last section was a bit much. I didn't understand why he was doing that, but he did, so I guess it was for the best.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a man who goes to the doctor to have his appendix removed.  It's about his own experience, but it's also about his mother's experience, and about the experience of others.    I think that's why I liked it so much--because it was so personal, about how one person's experience affects another's. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about the life and work of an important thinker and a fine writer, which, though not very well known, is nonetheless worth reading:

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good introduction to the writings of the great and influential German theologian, Martin Luther.  I have always been a Luther fan.  This is a great introduction.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a couple of different reviews about this book and I'm sure that I'll like it a lot. I found that the main character, Koko, had a very real problem with alcohol that I found very believable. She was always angry at her mother and even though she seemed happy at times, it was difficult to believe that Koko's mother was always so angry and drinking. I think the only way to resolve this conflict is to put her into a hospital and keep her there until she's ready to leave. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great, accessible book about the history of Western thought.    I like it so much that I'm going to read the whole thing and will be glad I did.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I am not a big fan of "historical fiction" in any form, but this is a good one. It's got all the elements that make a good historical fiction novel: the historical setting, the complex characters, the fascinating plot, and the vivid description.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is about a time I spent with a guy who did not realize I had a boyfriend until after he broke up with me. I never knew I was attractive until after that and I would have had no idea he had a girlfriend until he was about 6 months with her. This book is a very good read about finding out that you are attractive, finding out you are attracted to people you think are not attractive, and finding out what a great time it is to be in a relationship with someone you are really attracted to.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book about the various methods of keeping a dog healthy.  I have a black lab mix that is a bit too big for a crate.  He seems to like a little freedom from a crate, so I was happy to see that in this book, the author shows you how to create the right environment for your dog.  The only problem I had was the author's recommendations to let him go outside for a walk (after he had been in his crate for a while) and to have the door open all the way when he is outside (he can't even jump into the car).  I will probably read this book again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a gift for my husband who enjoys books about ancient Israel. It was very good. He also enjoys history books and so I got him one too. I can't wait for his next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best introduction to the field I have found to date. I have been interested in the field of computer science for many years but I did not understand many of the things I read about in books until reading this book. I am now working on a project where I will be developing a database of music based on information in this book and will be using the information in the book as I am developing my database.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good that it was worth waiting 3 weeks to get it from the library.  This is a really good, easy read that will be helpful to any serious student of English.  It is the type of book that I would like to have in my own library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about the history of women in the military, this is a great book to get out to people to get them to really think about the role of women and what that means. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's a very well written book that teaches you to be a good listener, and how to use that skill in a non-judgmental way. This book is very well researched and it will definitely help you to listen better.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about the history of music, but the author seems to have little understanding of it. He says that "Bach and Mozart were both geniuses, but they had the same limitations: they both wanted to be popular." This is so ignorant and silly it's painful to read. Bach was a genius. Mozart was a superstar. I mean, it's not like they didn't want to be famous. It's the way Bach did it that's the most amazing: he put out music he wanted to hear and he kept on playing until people wanted to listen to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It is full of stories about people I know, including a young woman whose father was murdered by her uncle. The uncle was in jail and the family is on the edge of destitution, so she had to be careful about what she did. There is also a story about a friend who was killed when he was 19. This book gives a really good perspective on how people can get into bad situations, and how to get out of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good overview of the basic principles and concepts of quantum mechanics.  I highly recommend this book for a physicist who is just getting into the subject.  This is a great introduction to the basic concepts.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought a copy of The Power of Three at a used book store in the suburbs a few years ago.   It's a classic of American humor, so it's good to be able to use it in a different context. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that it's not really a book at all!    It's a series of essays, mostly about women in science fiction, that I found at a good used bookstore (I used to read a lot of science fiction; I read the classics, but I wasn't a huge fan of the genre).   These essays are about what made women in SF so great; how they were the first women to be given the opportunity to write about their life and experience, even if it's negative.   They also explore the cultural significance of these women, as well as how they influenced women writers.  I can't say that I agree with all of the opinions expressed in the essays, but the author has taken the time to listen to women in the SF community and write about it, as opposed to just focusing on the good ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of David Mitchell.   It's like his "Tower of Babel" and "The Cloud Atlas" but for people who actually understand math.  He's such a great storyteller, and I love the world he creates.  I also enjoy the character development. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book that will teach you many things.  I am a former U.S. Marine who now teaches military history at a local university.  It is the first book I've read that is clear about how Marines get killed in the line of duty.  As a former Marine, I can say that the information in this book is solid.  While the Marines may not know every detail, the book gives you the idea.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title is self explanatory. If you're going to read about a subject that you don't like, I'd say go read about an area of your own that you're interested in.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this I thought I was crazy. It's a lot like a James Patterson book. But it's so much more than that. It has everything the Patterson books have in them but the humor, and I was completely hooked.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books from the last several years. It is a good story about a man who goes to a place called Hell to find God and be forgiven. I don't have any idea what this is all about but I think it is a fascinating read. I've never heard of the place but it sounds like a good place to find out more about God.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading a book or two by the same author in preparation for the big American Sign Language contest. The books I've read are very good but not very relevant to ASL. I'm really glad I took the time to read this one, which is actually more related to ASLA than the others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book, and I found myself learning a lot about the different styles of writing in different genres.   This is a great book to study as it has many examples of each style of writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only book I have ever purchased in the past 10 years that has made me laugh out loud. It is an incredibly silly story that manages to be funny without being overly cringey or silly. The plot is absurd, but I found the characters to be quite endearing. I think I'm gonna have to buy the other three to see how they do.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book a while ago, and finally got around to reading it.  It is a very good book.  I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the field of political science and the work of political scientists. The book is a wonderful combination of a readable narrative with lots of examples of the use of statistical techniques in studying political behavior. The chapter on the study of public opinion on drug legalization is particularly helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   The stories are amazing and I loved the way they were told.  The descriptions of the city and its people are also interesting and I can't wait to visit. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad I picked this book up. I had no idea what to expect from it but I'm glad I read it. The stories were so real, and the plot is intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about what happens when you get married: 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of science fiction in my life and this book made me feel that it was not only good science fiction but that it is also fun.    The first part of the book is a very good introduction into the history of the science fiction genre.  It starts out with the famous story " The Goldfinch ", which is about a man who finds a strange egg that will allow him to fly.  Then it goes on to tell about how science fiction started and how it went from being a literary form to a form that could be used to solve the problems of modern society.  I really liked the "real" stories that were told in the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book about the creation of the National Hockey League and the NHL itself.  The book is excellent.  I was able to learn a lot about the NHL from the various sources in this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many books on psychology. This book is probably the best. It gives you a good understanding of what we think is wrong with us, what causes us to act the way we do, and what causes people to act differently. I highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm reading "Dancing at the Movies" by Stephen Sondheim as I write this review.   This is a really good book that I was excited about and have been reading about since I started reading it.  Sondhmio is a very good writer and a good storyteller. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very pleased with this book.   It's not really a history book per se, more of a history of the place.  It shows that in the early 1900's there was a thriving culture that made up the northern part of the state and a good many of the people there still speak with a southern drawl.  This is a good thing, but in the end I don't think that's going to make much of a difference to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is about a father who has a daughter who has mental disabilities, but she is bright and has her own life.  She's a bit of a wild child and always has been, but is also a good kid.   The author does a good job of portraying a loving relationship and it's good to see how her father's love and caring for his daughter has affected her life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really good. I really like the fact that the story focuses on the positive side of life.   It's about the fact  that  life can be good and bad,  and  it's about people  finding joy in things that aren't always positive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am always intrigued by the idea of "sophisticated" food.  This book is a good example of that.  The authors of this book were a great addition to my library.  I plan on using this book to learn more about my own food, as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good introduction to the history of the European war on communism. The author is a former communist who is trying to get a handle on it. He shows how the war on Communism has been lost in the American media, which has always been anti-communist. I also agree with a couple of his points that the US is more like the Soviet Union than the USSR was in the 1950s. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know more about the evolution of the US Constitution and how it influenced our current Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   The author provides a good overview of the history of the United States and its constitution, while not losing sight of the importance of the Bill.  This is not a book that you want to take out and read every day, but it's a book you'll want to read often and to understand better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad that I read this book!  This book is a good, thorough introduction to some very interesting subjects.  It's interesting that the main purpose of this book is not for the reader to understand the mechanics of how DNA works but rather to "understand the DNA code" and how it was coded for the evolution of living organisms.  This is a really good introduction to how DNA is coded for a number of different purposes in living organisms and is used in a variety of ways.  I learned a lot from this book, and it's a good read if you're interested in DNA.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, not just because of the wonderful cover art but also because it gives a good history of the art of printmaking.  It's the kind of book that I can read over and over, learning and reading to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful. It is not so much about an actual event, but about the process of creating a great book. The author takes you through all the steps of the book from the inception, to the final editing and presentation. This is a very useful book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the few books I have read where the author has a clear idea about the problem that she is trying to solve. She has written a good summary of the problem and its solutions. She also has a very good grasp on how to solve the problem.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject. I just got back from a two day seminar on how to get better at playing the piano.  The instructor was a very good teacher and was a great help in understanding the music theory behind my playing.  It was my first time listening to piano music but now I can see that the theory is very important.  If you can follow his directions, you will have a great time and your playing will improve quickly.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will be in every high school and college library on the planet.  The book provides a very detailed description of the development of the human brain and how it can be used for more than just the mere stimulation of pleasure.  This makes the book not only educational but also entertaining.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've read a book about a character I'd grown up with.  I've always been a big fan of the old cartoon characters.   But   I think this one will be my favorite of the new "Homer" books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the most complete and accurate history of the Roman empire that I have seen. It is written by one of the foremost historians of the subject, and I find it very helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a college student I was excited to read this book and I was very pleased with the book and the results.   I have a long standing interest in psychics but this book is different.  The main subject is that psychics are not always wrong.  I am a skeptic myself but it is nice to see that some of them can be right.  It is nice that some psychics have a conscience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book extremely helpful and interesting, but a bit repetitive.  It is quite different from the typical philosophy of the day.  The book is written for a general audience but it is very helpful and is well worth the read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book about my experiences as a woman in the early 1970's and the men who loved me.   It really is an eye-opener for anyone in my situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book before, but I have never felt the need to review it.   The author is a very good writer, but the subject matter is difficult for many readers to deal with.  In my opinion, the reader should be prepared for a very intense discussion of topics and ideas.  I don't see a reason to review this book at this time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book "A Little Book of Common Sense" by James Allen is a wonderful and fun book. I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, which I had not read before, had been recommended to me by a friend and is well worth the read. The concept is excellent:   A child in a dysfunctional family is brought up by a single parent who is very involved with her children's lives.    This is followed by a brief discussion of child development.  I thought the book was a little short, but that is not my problem. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to admit that I am rather confused about the difference between a novel and a non-fiction book. I found this book very enlightening. The author shows that "normal" people have the same mental limitations that people who are "pathological" have. This book is very educational, and very enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the true reality of "normalness" and "pathology".
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been trying to learn to play the guitar for about 6 years now and this book is great for that. I've never owned a book like this and it makes learning that much easier.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed reading " The First World War: The First Five Years " by John V. Denson. It's a short book and covers the war from start to finish. It has a nice balance between history and war memoirs, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes war and military history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a copy of a book that I had not thought of before. I think the author will be a great success as a motivational speaker. I enjoyed the book and I think this book could be useful to some people.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am currently reading "The Life and Times of an American Hero" by Robert A. Caro.  It's one of the best books on Robert A Caro I have ever read.  The book starts off with Caro talking about the work of a writer named Paul Valéry, who has a great reputation for having a good memory and being able to remember every line and paragraph in his work.  Caro, who wrote a short story with a similar plot line that Valériry had written years before, goes on to describe how he was able to make a similar memory in the case of Valérial's work.         Valéry wrote in a style that is very similar to Caro's.   Car- oo's work can be described as "a cross between a detective novel and a novel of biographical fiction."   Valérian has an excellent memory, is very analytical and knows the names of the most famous people in the world.  He has a very dry sense of humor.  Valerian is very self-centered, but also has a tendency to put others in a good light.  I love the story about the time he was working on a book about Hitler, but decided to write a book of memoirs about himself instead.  This decision was the best thing he ever did.  "The life of a hero."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. The author does a great job of explaining a difficult topic in a way that is accessible to a wide range of readers. I found myself being drawn to the characters in this book, particularly the narrator. Her inner struggle to find the meaning of her life is beautifully portrayed in this story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful compilation of information about the "Old West". I'm a huge fan of history books about the West, and this is the best one I've found yet. The history is clear, well documented and most of the information is easily accessible. It's hard to believe that this book was written in the 1800s.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful example of the kind of book that has a huge impact on one's own thinking. It's very useful for anyone who's had the misfortune to work with people who don't always seem to have their best interests in mind.   The book's chapters are a good introduction to the concept of social hierarchy, but it's the chapters that follow that really get at the nitty-gritty of it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished reading "Saving the World" by Richard A. Feynman.  Feynmann is often considered to be the father of the modern physics.  The book covers many topics in modern physics, including special relativity and quantum mechanics.  I'm not sure why the author didn't include Feynsen's theories in the book, but I was very glad he did.  It makes the book much more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's about time for a new fantasy trilogy.   This is the first in a series of three books that I am looking forward to reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was excellent and the book was very useful for the beginner to intermediate level.  I was able to go through the book in a week.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book about a week ago and I'm so glad I did. It's a really well researched and written book about one of the most controversial people in modern American history, the leader of the communist faction that tried to overthrow the government of the United States during the 1960s. It was one of my favorite books I've ever read, even though I didn't know a thing about him. I read the other books in this series before reading this one, but I just found it very interesting to read about the inner workings of the party that tried so hard to take over our country. I'll definitely be re-reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have read in years. It is funny, smart, and the writing is very well done. It will take a long time to read it, but it is worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed this book a lot, and it's a nice way to learn about what the Romans did in Judea in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.  It's very useful and interesting information.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book for my 12th birthday and I really enjoyed it. The main characters are cute and fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little hesitant to start with a fantasy novel, but I am so glad I did. I've been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings, but there's something so refreshing about the way Martin writes about the world he created. It is a world that feels very alive and real. I love the way he shows us the struggles of the people in a particular place and time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for a class. It was good!    It's a very good introduction to the field of humanistic psychology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a lot of experience with mental illness.  This book is very useful and has helped me to be able to deal with my own problems.  I wish it was easier to find mental health support groups so that I could get some insight and not just get depressed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a really good book about the life and times of the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian.   I was at his funeral in Houston, and his funeral procession took me back to his early days in Pasadena.  I really liked the fact that it was a book that was written with Kevorkians experience and also was written by a medical doctor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good summary of the field of computer science in a general sense. It is not a perfect summary of all the research in the field, but it is a great starting point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that is essential reading. It gives you an insider's view of the modern political world and the way politicians work. It's like a great insider's perspective on the way a political party functions. It may seem dry at first, but it doesn't take long for you to get a feel for how it really works.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was intrigued by this book as I have been looking for a book on the "Jewish" roots of the US.   This book did the trick.  I'm glad I finally read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of books on the subject of child rearing but this is the best.   It's clear that the authors have done their research.  It is a simple and practical guide.  This book has done wonders for my daughter and I. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with the contents of this book:  it covers the history of the early Mormon church, as well as a little of the history about its founder Joseph Smith.  It is not so detailed that you'll have to read it several times, but I think it's worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. I have no idea where the author got the idea for this story about a woman who goes out on a date with a blind man, but she gets over it in the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was quite surprised to find this book on the shelf at my local library. I always knew of the work of Tana French, but she never really captured my interest until this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It is a very interesting story and an enjoyable read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so excited about this book that I just had to write a positive one about it. This book will definitely become a staple in my bookshelf. I will be reading it in one sitting when I get home from work. I was so amazed by this book when I first picked it up that I almost threw it out. There are so many amazing facts that I had to get it out of the library (and then return it to the library) before I could read it. There is so much information about the history of this area and the people who lived in it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to teach myself about Linux and GNU/Linux (which is not just a Linux distro, but a whole philosophy that goes along with it). This book does a very good job of introducing a lot of the concepts and tools needed to get a Linux system going (and I really enjoyed reading about all of the things that were used to get the system up and running). It also covers the various different types of filesystems, and how to use them. It's really very easy to understand (if you're already using Linux or GNU/linux, there's a good chance you've used most or all of these techniques). I've been doing Linux/Unix/UNIX work for quite a while now, so this book really came in handy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited to get this book when I saw it on a shelf at a local bookstore. I'm always looking for good books about animals, but I was particularly looking forward to reading about a bird that had a big brain!  I had a great time with this book, and am looking forward for the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, like most of what is now being called the "New Realism," was a reaction against the more unrealistic "realism" of earlier generations of American writers (including Hemingway, Faulkner, Steinbeck, and Fitzgerald).   It is still, however, very good, and while the subject matter is a bit outdated, the writing is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that the author, an experienced journalist, actually understands what makes a good story.  This is a book that tells the story of the development of the modern world, from its beginnings to the present day.  It is a very thorough and well-researched book.  While I would have liked more discussion of what the world would be like without modern technology, I think this is a good read for anyone interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I'm a sucker for history.  It is full of good information.  I'm looking forward to reading it all over again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a professional writer.   This book was so good I purchased it twice:  First I was intrigued because it was by a non-author, but it was actually a very interesting and well written article about a very good book.  This time I purchased the second copy just so I could read the whole thing,   and I am still enjoying it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a well written, easy to read introduction to the philosophy of the Buddha, with a few short stories about the Buddha's life and teaching. The Buddha is portrayed as a very intelligent man, but still a human being, and it is not so easy to put this down. It was well written and informative, with plenty of photos and illustrations.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good, well researched book on the historical importance of the Jewish people. It is also very well written, which is a major plus for me.  The author is a scholar who has worked in the field for many years and who has written extensively about Jewish history.  It is a great addition to any library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good.  It has everything you need to know about how to write an effective research paper.   The book is written in a very clear, understandable style and the exercises that are provided are very effective.  The exercises are also available in PDF form, so you can easily print them out and work through them.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering a Ph.D. in biology or related field. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always liked stories that show the inner workings of a family, so this one is great.   It is a great story about two brothers who are at odds with each other but have a great time with their sister. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a good time with this book.   The book is very well written, and it is a good way to get started in linguistics.  The chapter by chapter explanations are easy to follow, and I had fun thinking about the different linguistic forms. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my parents. I read it in one day, and it really made a big impression on me. I really enjoyed it, and will definitely recommend it to others.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I'm a very happy reader and have enjoyed all of the author's books.   This one has been a little less so. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, "A Guide to Using and Utilizing E-Learning for Teaching and Learning" by Jodi J. Miller, provides a good overview of how to use E-learning for teaching and learning. The author describes how to structure your E-text, how to incorporate E-Texts into your course, how students can use Etexts for quizzes, how they can be used for homework, how teachers can use them for quizzing, how homework is done, and much more. It is a very good resource for those interested in using E-books in their classrooms.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of the kind of book I like to read.  The book is set in a fantasy world that is very realistic and detailed.  This is a book that is fun and entertaining, but also informative.  It is a fun read that will appeal to fans of fantasy books, but it also has a lot to say about how the world really is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this book is one of the best things I've read in a long time.  This book is about how I developed my own religion.  The author is very open about the many ways I got the religion from other people, and about how it has changed.  It is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very interesting book about the history of the Soviet Union and a little bit about Stalin himself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book because I needed something to read that didn't have a lot of sex in it. This book is about a guy who is dating a girl who is obsessed with porn and sex. He's very much in denial about this. The girl is the type that wants to have sex with her husband in front of him. And he's the type who wants to watch porn with her. It's very odd but it's also very endearing. I enjoyed it very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good "how to" book on writing. It's also good on grammar.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book. It's good that the author doesn't shy away from anything that he feels is important.   He explains what he does, how he does it and what he gets out of it.  This is the kind of book that should be on the shelves of every high school. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about being a woman, about being the daughter of a powerful man and his wife, and about growing up in a small town in North Carolina. I am so pleased to have read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a long-time reader of history books and have always been a big fan of The History of the American People. However, I have never been able to get past the first two chapters about "the founding fathers." The third chapter is really good, but not a part of my usual reading material. The final chapter is good too. This book is also a good read for those who are interested in American history.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of Dan Harmon's work.   He is funny, creative and well-read, which makes him a good choice to be a voice for the show.  I really enjoyed this book!   It's also a good read, which is nice when you're trying to learn a new language.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about a wonderful book. The main characters were a bit clichéd (in my opinion) but that was just because I was a teenager and they were written with a certain amount of irony.  This book was actually very funny, and the characters had a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great little book. It's short, but packed with lots of great information about the origins of the Civil War and its aftermath. It has an excellent introduction that sets the book in context.  The author is a student of the subject so he gives an accurate history of the war and its causes, the military strategies that led to its outcome, the social and political effects of the conflict, the economic effects of its aftermath, and how the war has influenced America's relationship to the world.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am an academic librarian, so I was very interested in this book.    The author is very careful about what he is writing about, and he uses the word "narrative" in a way that suggests that the reader might benefit from thinking about this story in the same way he does.  I think this book would be a good starting point for a research paper on this subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished the book "The Book of Mormon: What the Ancient American People Taught Us about the Mormons," by Richard Bushman.  This book is a good overview of the origins of the Mormon faith.    The book is an excellent introduction to the LDS Church.  Bushman's book gives a good insight into how the Church grew and developed over time.  His book is interesting because it addresses the issues that some Mormons struggle with: the origins, the evolution, the culture clash, the racism and the issues surrounding polygamy.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the Mormon Church and how it developed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best non-fiction books I have read in a long time. The book is well-written, easy to read and is very informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and it does the job it's supposed to do.   It's easy to read, very well organized and very concise.  I don't know how I would've gotten this information from other sources.  It would've been easier to have the book in a separate book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of Mormon is a beautiful and moving book about a journey into a faith of a new life.  It is also a beautiful book about love, life, and finding faith.  I've been looking forward to this book for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a new convert to science fiction, but I enjoyed this book, even though it has little to do with science fiction.  It's an intriguing story about a man who, when he is accused of being a spy, finds that he's actually a detective.  The first half of the book is an enjoyable mystery, with a twist that comes out of nowhere.  When the mystery is solved, it's a nice payoff, and it's not clear if it was a good story that was too good to be true or if it's just that he has a very good memory.  He seems like a good guy, so it seems like he might have been mistaken for a spy.  I liked that the author doesn't just write about spies; he also writes about people who can't help themselves and do something they shouldn't do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was skeptical about this book at first but I have finally got into it.  It was a good read, I liked the idea of a good bad guy, and I really liked how the author dealt with the situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the very best books I've read in a long time.   The story is compelling, the characters intriguing, and the world that they inhabit just so interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've ever read about the occult, The Lost Symbol is a fascinating and informative study on all things occult. The book is filled with fascinating facts and the author is very easy to listen to.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was given this book for Christmas as a gift. It was a very nice Christmas gift, and I read it with my grandson before going to bed. The story about the woman who made the tea with the leaves from the birch tree, the tea that made her fall in love with the man, was so true. It makes one realize that true love doesn't have to be expensive.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good, that it's hard to even tell it's a book. It is a short history of the Irish in America, with some history of American Irish culture. The story is told by several Irish who were born in America and lived here until the early 1900s. It's told through interviews, letters, newspaper articles, and a lot of photos. The book is organized into three chapters: a history of Irish immigration to America; a look at Irish stereotypes; and a look into the Irish people in the early 20th century.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm an American, and have always been fascinated by Japanese culture. The author was a good source of information, but his explanation of the concept of the "Kanji" was quite interesting. I found myself using the kanji quite often. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book last year while doing an anthropology/environmental ethics course at an American university. The book is about the impacts of climate change on people in a small village in Peru.  The main character is a farmer and his wife.  They have been farming the same land for many generations.  But the climate change is beginning to affect the water supply.   The farmer has been planting a special crop that can be harvested from water in the ground.  There are some interesting implications in the book for the role of farming. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, although I found the last chapter very hard to take.   It is just a bunch of short essays on the different styles of poetry and prose, but they're all good essays.  I think the best part of the book is the "poetry" section, which is probably the best section I've seen in a non-fiction book about poetry in literature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I was so excited to see this book on my Amazon.com wish list! I am very glad I got it. The first part of the book is really good. It is a little difficult to read, but I think it is because I am so used to reading Harry Potter, but the author was so original that I found it very easy to follow. The author also does a great job in writing in the language of the wizards and their world. I can imagine a future where Harry Potter is used in the education system in some way and he can get a college education and use his magical powers to help others. The story is really interesting and is very fun to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on a very important topic. I am currently writing a graduate dissertation on the role of religion in modern civilization and am grateful to have found this book to be the most comprehensive study I have read so far. I can see why the subject is so controversial, but the author does a terrific job of making the arguments cogent and well argued. This is an excellent book for a college level course, even if the students don't have to worry about the religious implications of current events.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, well written book. It is not easy to be a man, but it is a book that is worth reading. I have had men who were much better than I was. This book is not the same. I liked the chapter on "The Man I Used to Be" by Charles Moskos. I also liked the part about the man in my life who had been my teacher. The book also has a good deal of good advice about how to be more attractive and more successful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this book since the beginning, but never got around to finishing it.  It's been on my "to read" list for some time.    This is a very readable and interesting book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very interested in reading this book after hearing of its existence.  It is a very well-written, well-researched book on the Holocaust and the victims.  I am now aware that many people in the world were affected by this horrible thing and there is still a great deal of interest in the subject.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really enjoying this book. It's a great little introduction to the ideas of  Neuromancy  and  Empathetic Psychology  and the work of James Hillman.   I'll probably start learning a little more about these concepts from here on out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that is not for everyone. If you like action and action oriented movies, this one is for you. If not, you may want to look elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, quick read, one that was enjoyable, yet informative.  The book is a summary of a book that I did not have time to read, but it has been worth it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad I picked up the first book in this series.   It is one of those books where I'm hooked, and can't put it down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good review of a good read: 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a great woman who was a great artist. I love the fact that it is all about her art.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   It is a very good book about what it is like to be transgender.   The author is very good at describing what being trans is like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been enjoying this series, and have been looking forward to more.   The worldbuilding is extremely well done, and I have really enjoyed reading about the cultures of the different continents and countries. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The last few years of my life have been a whirlwind of discovery.  After a short stint in a mental institution, I decided to read this book, and the following year, I took up the study of Russian at the University of Wisconsin.  This book has been the keystone of my understanding of the Russian language.  I hope it will also be a keystone for the language I study in the future.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very skeptical about this book until I read it. I'm sure there are many good ideas in there. However, I do think there is a lack of self awareness. I don't think you could teach anything about personal development by talking about the negative stuff that happened to you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book provides a valuable introduction to the subject. It is not the most comprehensive book on the subject, but it does provide a good foundation. I am happy to have found this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very readable and instructive book on the history of science.  It is a good introduction to some of the concepts that make up the basis for the modern science of quantum mechanics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most important things I've ever learned about writing:  The best way to make something memorable is to give it a bad name.  The author had an agenda, which was to get her name in the news and to get a book deal.  I've always thought the worst way to get attention is to make the reader want to know what the author's agenda is.  This book is an embarrassment to women's studies in general, and women's history in particular.  If you're interested in the subject matter, I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I'm a teacher and this is an excellent resource for how to use it.  I can tell the teachers I work with would really love it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book I have purchased by James B. Steele, author of the critically acclaimed "The Devil's Web."  This book is a wonderful example of how a writer can use a well researched, detailed, yet compelling premise and then keep the story moving forward with a wonderful plot and a very interesting character.  This one is not as gripping as Steele's previous book, "The Last Man on Earth," but it is very well written.  I think this will be a good addition to any fan's "best of" collection.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think it's a very good book.   It explains the theory behind the "fairy tale" of "the dragon in the apple" from the Bible.  It's also very good that the author provides a good illustration of the symbolism behind this story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always looking for a good read and this one is excellent.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  I've been reading about the evolution of civilization in history and I'm not sure I would be able to handle that without some sort of evolutionary psychology.  The basic ideas are good.   This book does not delve too deeply into what exactly evolved but I'm willing to go with the explanation that our ability to understand and communicate is a big part of what's allowed us to be so successful.  That said, I'm a bit worried about the evolutionary psychology being applied to other issues in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book and think it will be a good resource for new authors.    It is a well written and well thought out book and will probably make the booksellers happy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read about the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. This is one of the most detailed and convincing accounts I've seen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title of this book says it all, " The Secret World of the Secret Man ". It describes the secret world of the secret man. It's a really fascinating book. The author writes about his life as a secret man for almost his whole life. He has a secret identity, he has a job that is extremely important, he travels all over the world. It was interesting to learn about his secret life and it was really interesting to read about the secret lives of people he knew and how the people he knows came to have these secrets. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever wanted to learn a secret life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read, but it has a lot of thought and depth about some really important topics that are worth understanding.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good overview of the subject of human-like robots in general. There are some parts I disagree with (I'm more inclined to believe that a human being with a computer-like brain can learn to do most of a task just as well as a robot with a brain that's designed to deal with human problems), but I think it's still a good summary of the research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing I don't like about this book is the name, it sounds like a parody of the very same genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   While the premise is interesting, the way it is explained and the manner in which it is presented was just a little annoying to me.  It felt like a cop-out to explain how the mind works in a way that made no sense to me...  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a nice balance between historical details and a good sense of humor. There is no sense that this was written in the last few years as the story is pretty much a pre-existing one.  The only thing I did not like about the story was the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The plot is really cool, and really makes me want to read more books by this author.  It is so cool to read about the life of a person who's trying to make the best out of life, who's so hard on herself that she's constantly trying to get better at everything.  The book is a great introduction to a fascinating and interesting woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very good. It was a good read and it was interesting to me.  I would read more about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book   The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I felt that it didn't really provide a "new" look at the war.  It was mostly the same, but I was hoping that it would include some new information on the war from people who were there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really excited to read this book because I wanted to learn more about the "Greatest Generation" of WWII. This book fills that void for me.  I like the idea that the Army is the foundation of the U.S. military, but I also like the way the book covers a lot of topics that I wasn't familiar with.  It's definitely a good read for anyone interested in WWII history, and I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good study on the origins of the modern U.S. state. The book is well written and a good read, but not for the history of the U. S.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great source for the history of the Japanese kabuki theater. It was published by a major publisher and it is not just a collection of "dramatic" scenes. It has a lot of historical information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good.  The concept is very original and originality is always appreciated.  I think that it is also good to read about people who are in a situation where they can't go against the "status quo" or whatever the situation is.  It is always good to go against what everyone else is doing or thinking, and the author of this book does that very well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful, well written book that will give the reader a chance to see things from the perspectives of many different people.  The book is about the history of the French resistance movement during World War II.  I really liked it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It was not just a nice story. It is a real story. The character of Sarah, a very kind and strong girl, became a good friend to me.  She was the best friend I could ever have. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the life of a good, old-fashioned witch. It's a little bit dark, a little weird, and the prose is a little clunky. But I'm glad that it's in a collection of books about the paranormal: the more that we know about magic, the better off we'll be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book.  The author has a good grasp on the subject matter and has a lot of examples and examples of good writing.  There is a lot to say about the nature of science and how it can be used to improve the lives of people in some real ways.  I'm going to be reading this book for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last week. It was really interesting. I found out about the various kinds of "cures" available for cancer, and they sounded really cool.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wasn't quite as in love with the ending as the author seemed to think.   She makes some very good points about how the world of fantasy tends to be far less moral than ours (I'm looking at you, Lord of the Rings), but then she also makes some bad ones about how fantasy tends not to go down well with the rest of the world (again, I'm looking here at you Harry Potter).   For the most part, I can't see how a book like this can be used as a teaching tool, but at the same time I have to say that I enjoyed it as a fantasy novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the very best books I've read this year. The prose is sharp and elegant. The stories are intriguing, but the plots are compelling.  The writing is smart and the characters are well developed.  This book is full of memorable characters, memorable scenes, and memorable events. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book at a very good price. I had some issues with the writing, but the main issue was that there was so much going on in the story that it wasn't apparent where to put each of the characters.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very interesting study of the history of the American Jewish community in the last two centuries. It's written in an easy-to-understand manner and is not too heavy-handed with the history. It also doesn't try to explain what exactly the "Jews" did wrong, which may be a good thing, if it makes you less defensive about your own religious heritage.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book.   It has a very interesting story that was compelling enough to pull me in.  It is a good read even though there are some parts that I found a little too easy to understand.  Overall a good story that I really enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the art of writing.  I have been reading the writings of many famous writers, including Robert Louis Stevenson, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Henry James, and George Bernard Shaw.   My favorite writer is Shaw, and I have read all of his books.  The book that I am most impressed with is  Shaw's autobiography,   which is about his experiences with the Nazis.  He was a very gifted writer, but he was also very brave and brave enough to put his career on the line. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of this book and have read it at least a dozen times. The book is a lot of fun and I love how the author was able to draw out the story of each of the characters.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and I think it is a great book for people who are interested in how things have changed over the last several centuries in the United States and the world. The historical information in the book is quite good and the analysis is interesting.  I found it a very useful introduction to some of the basic principles of American history.  The only things I didn't like were the illustrations (mostly they were pretty pictures of people looking very much like cartoon characters) and the length (I didn't find it that interesting, but maybe it was just my own experience that made me dislike it).  Overall, I thought it was a good introduction to American history for people interested in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite fantasy novels. It's not really a "light" fantasy novel, but it's definitely a good one. I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, and especially the first three. The author did a great job of recreating the atmosphere and tone of the first two books in a way that is faithful to the source material but still manages to do it on her own. The world building is also extremely well done, which is important to me because I am so fond of the source.  The magic system in this book is a great example of what I mean by world building, as it allows the author to create a realistic magic system without relying on spells that are too similar to magic from other fantasy novels.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a collection of my favorite short stories. It's a great introduction to the short story genre.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last night at a party.   The book is about a young woman who is very religious but also has a tendency to be very selfish.  The story is told from the point of view of the parents of the young woman and her older sister.  It is interesting to see how the family reacts to the new religious beliefs the girl is being taught. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a lot of good things to say about this book.    The writing style is very accessible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. I thought the book was well written, and that it would be useful to some who want to learn about the history of women's sports.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about an unlikely hero, a child psychiatrist who finds himself on the cutting edge of psychiatric and psychological science. It is an eye-opening look at a field that can be highly competitive, and the author does a good job describing the early career of one of the giants of the field, John B. Watson. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book is   The Secret of Nim   by Robert M. Pirsig.   This is the best book I have read in a long time.  The author uses an analogy between the human mind and the mind of a computer.  It is not that computers have the mind and humans do not.  This analogy is the key to understanding how humans and computers interact.  Pirsigan is the kind of person who takes the time to understand the subtle ways that things work.  There are no shortcuts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought the first book in the series   "Curse of the Mistwraith"   at a local used book store and I loved it.   This book takes place in the same universe as "Tinker's Revenge" .   The stories in "Cure"  are very funny  . The characters   are interesting  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been reading the reviews of this book and was already feeling bad about my purchase. I had a hard time believing the author could possibly have a good idea for a good novel, but I bought it anyway because of the good reviews. In addition to the good review, I found a book that I've been meaning to read. I found it funny that in the reviews the author was called a plagiarist, but in the end he was able to put together a good story about a bad character.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was intrigued by the idea of a book about a fictional historical figure and had a lot of fun reading it.  I'm not sure it's a good choice to have a fictional character narrate about the real-life events that happened to him but I've enjoyed this book enough to keep it on my bookshelf.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books about the Holocaust. It is a fascinating story about how the Nazis were able to exterminate so many people at once. While the author is no stranger to the Holocaust he is able to weave it all together into a very well written narrative.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading this book for the first time.  This is a very interesting book about the history of the Jewish people, specifically about the Holocaust.  The author does a very good job of presenting the Jewish background and beliefs in such a way that I found it very interesting and interesting to look into some of the details. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's an awesome book! It's not for everyone, but if you like the series or just want to see the main character, she's awesome.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The characters are all great and the plot is interesting.  The story does get a little repetitive though.  I've been looking forward to reading this book all year!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a while back, but it wasn't until recently that I came to appreciate the beauty of the stories.  The illustrations are stunning.  I also appreciate the book's brevity.  It is so short, but still contains all the details needed to enjoy the story.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to get this book! I loved the premise of a zombie apocalypse. This book is great and is very entertaining. I can't wait to see where the story goes. I don't really know how I would feel about a zombie invasion in my neighborhood but I'm sure it would be awesome.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished reading this book.   It was a very good read and I enjoyed the book. The author is a former journalist.  He seems like he might have a bit of an interest in politics but I am not sure about that.  I don't know if he has ever been involved in any of the political campaigns that were mentioned in this book but I have read enough about them to know that it is a difficult business to run for the presidency.  There is plenty of information about what happened to his wife in the '70s that I thought was interesting.  And the fact that he has been in the business long enough to know the importance of the press being able to interview him is a plus.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful little book about a couple of little boys on a very special trip to a park and zoo.    It has a special place in my heart, and I hope they have the time of their lives while they're out in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of people complain about how hard it is to read and write good novels.   I'm a big fan of all the non-fiction that's out there but this book is a definite must-read if you have the desire.  It's not as easy as it sounds to write a good non-fic but I'm pretty sure this is one of the best.  If you can't get enough of this, you'll love the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Robert Cialdini is an amazing read. It has many chapters about social dynamics. The main point of the book is that if you can get people to like you then they will do things for you.    It is a great book to read and it is great that it is easy to understand.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must have for every serious scholar who is interested in ancient literature. The subject is fascinating and engaging, as is the discussion of the ancient authors, which is as much a part of the book as the texts themselves.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on all things that are wrong with the Christian church. It covers everything from the failure of the Protestant reformers to the current sexual revolution to the rise of "cults" and cults to the fact that "Christianity" is actually an artificial concept that was created by the Roman Empire and spread by it's conquerors. This is not a criticism of Christianity but a warning against those who have used it as a religion, a false construct, and a racket. I wish that every Christian would read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a great read.   It has a lot of historical facts that will interest the historian in me, but the book is also full of great stories about how each generation of people has tried to figure out how to survive in the wilderness.  This book gives a good description of how different groups have tried to survive the wilds of the north. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative book about the history of a very famous political family. This is an excellent introduction to the family and their activities during the 19th and 20th centuries. It's a great read and it gives you a better sense of just what a strong and powerful political family was like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very pleased that a book about the creation of the universe has been published by a reputable publisher. I am not a physicist or a science-fiction writer, but I am very impressed with the way this book deals with the concept of space.   I like that it shows the physical limitations of our universe and that it uses science to explain how the physical universe could be formed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a big disappointment for me.  The main character is an overbearing mother, and the book tries to portray her as a hero.  But she is so boring, I could care less about her.  She's not the hero that her friends think she is.  This is the sort of book I'd like to read about a person I know very little about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I have read about the evolution of intelligence. It is well written and well documented, with many excellent examples, and the conclusions are well supported by the facts.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best of the three books in the The Secret History series is definitely The Final Testament of Jesus Christ.  I read this book as an undergraduate, and was surprised to find it was actually written by a non-Christian, but the truth is, this is a really good read and a must-read for anyone interested in history.  The book has a strong message of what Christianity is about, as well as a strong Christian theology.  This book also covers the life of Jesus, and why he was important to Christians.  In the end, it really makes a strong case that Christianity is the most important religion in the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed reading this book, and it was very good reading. I think the author, who is an economist, does a good job explaining the differences between the Keynesian and Austrian approaches to the business cycle. He also provides a good explanation of the difference between the Austrian and Mises approaches to business cycle theory. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an amateur writer who has been in love with Harry Potter   for years   It was so much fun   There were so many things that I hadn't thought of   That I would love to see happen   Great job  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is about a group of women, most of whom are in their forties or fifties.  It's about a time when they were all very happy and had all sorts of things to look forward to in the future.  The women all work in the same place in a small town.  They have fun together, have fun making each other laugh, and they have fun laughing at the silly little things the other women do.  Their lives revolve around each other.  Each woman has their own goals and their own way of accomplishing them.  But the thing that makes the book unique is that they all get together for a week every spring.  What they do on this week is unique.   I think it's great because it shows that the best friendships are made when they have a common goal and a shared experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a big fan of superhero comics, but when I came across the X-Men I was intrigued.    The X-books are a lot better than they used to be (I think, but I'm not sure), but they are still mostly about being strong, not being able to control your own life.  That's not me.  It's the Xs I'm looking for. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book about love and loss that I read in college was very moving. The author does a very good job of showing the human side of the story and showing the tragedy of a child losing a parent and how the parents loved each other. It was also very touching to see how a child deals with grief.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only reason I didn't read this before reading The Road was because I read this one first.  I was disappointed to find out that, like the book it's supposed to be based on, this is a very flawed book.  It's a shame too because it's not that far off from the real story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book about a year ago and loved it.  This is a very well written book with lots of great illustrations.  It is a good and well written story about a man who has to make his own way in the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  It is a well-written and interesting book about a famous artist.  I think the book should be required reading in schools to teach about the importance of good taste.  There is a lot of information about art history, but the book is mainly about art itself.  As a person who was in art school, I can appreciate this book because of its emphasis on what the artist has done and what they have been able to create.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not for the faint of heart. If you are not a lover of the horror genre then you may not like this book. If your a horror fan then you will love this book! It is a short book about a mysterious and evil entity that appears to stalk a small town.  The story is good but the characters are not.  This is a book for horror fans and people who want to know what happens when something goes wrong.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit that the cover of this book is just plain silly.    It looks like a poster for a kids movie.  The characters are just... just plain goofy.  And the humor is so bad that the book just comes off as lame. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the first two decades of the modern movement for social and political equality. It is an informative book about what the movement has been and is. This book has a good mix of historical facts about the civil rights movement and the political process.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about how to read a good novel. It explains the principles of good reading in detail, and shows the readers exactly what they should do to make it a better read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for a good introduction to the history of the Russian Revolution. This is a good one. It's an interesting read about how revolutionary ideas spread across Russia during the revolution and how the Bolsheviks and other groups came to influence people in many different ways.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a treasure-trove of information about the history of the Jewish diaspora from antiquity to the present day.  The author, a prominent and respected scholar of the Holocaust, provides a wealth of information that I had previously found in a few scattered books, but none in a book of its scope and quality.   It is a must read for any person interested in the history and politics of the Jews, from the beginning to the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always liked John Irving, but I'm always disappointed when his books are so bad that they can only be found in used book stores.   His book was written by someone else, but he had an idea for a story and went with it.  The story is the same as in his other books (the other two being "The Great Gatsby" and "The Searchers").  The book has the same flaws, and I can't wait for the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a professional writer/editor and I am extremely pleased with this book.  I will be recommending it to anyone who is a writer.  It is so informative and useful, I am already planning to make some use of the information in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was quite intrigued by this book. The story is not your typical urban fantasy/horror/supernatural/crime. The characters are interesting and the writing is good.  It is quite scary.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a first time writer, I found this book interesting.   It is interesting to learn about how a person with severe autism responds to his or her environment and how different people react to a person's disorder. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book a few years ago but have not had the chance to read it in many years. This is a good reference book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very nice book that is well-written, interesting, well-researched, and filled with valuable insight.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best non-fiction books I have read in a long time.  The author's personal experiences of being raised in a fundamentalist church are very relevant to my own life.  I was raised in the church, and as a result, I found it extremely difficult to believe in anything that didn't make perfect sense to me.  This book gives a different perspective, and I can't wait to read it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very good.  It was well written, interesting, and well-researched.   It would be good to have more of this type of research on the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a fan of the  John Grisham   book,   and   so are a lot of my friends.   As a reader,  I was so happy to   find this book.  It   provides   a   good   introduction to    the   Grishams   family   of crime writers  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, and was not disappointed in the reading. I'm a big fan of this author and am a little hesitant about the book in general. The writing is very engaging and entertaining, and the author does a good job explaining the book's topic in a way that is easy to understand.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The story is really interesting.  I'm still trying to figure out how he got in there in the first place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite part about this book is that you don't have to read it all to understand the concept of the book.  It is well explained and explained well.   It was a good read for me because I am also interested in this type of study of the nature of religion and I have also been fascinated by the Bible and religion.  I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, practical, and very interesting book on the art of making your own coffee. It is a great way to learn about all the different ways in which coffee is prepared.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read about a very controversial topic. I am not a fan of most political/cultural trends in modern Western society. I also am not very comfortable with the political and religious attitudes I hear from my mother and father. My mom has been married to her Catholic priest for a number of years. She seems to have a great deal of respect for him. She also has a great amount of respect and understanding for the Catholic Church. My father is a Catholic, too. But he is the sort who can't stop worrying about the future of the church. He is also the sort that thinks that every time there is a new pope, the church has gotten smaller and smaller. I would say that my mother is more conservative than my father. However, my mom has also been a lot of help to me in my studies.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I have not read any of the previous novels by Stover, but I am a fan of the genre and have read all the ones that are out there, so I knew I would enjoy this book too. I also appreciated that Stover's writing is always so good and that the main characters are interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book because it's a good one about an intelligent woman who has her head screwed on. It's easy to understand what she's going through and is sympathetic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm a fan of the Star Wars movies and books. So I was very excited to read this book about the character of Princess Leia. It's not just about the movies or the books - it's about her being a woman and her role in the movies and the books.    It's a really nice book about a really cool character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to this book by a very dear friend of mine. She was so excited to read this book that she put it in her Christmas stocking. I've since read it several times over the years and found it to be an entertaining and thought provoking book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of Strange Animals  is a great story.    I love that the author went for a more humorous approach with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and I think you will too.    The best part is how well the book explains the scientific aspects of a subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have ever read about a historical figure.  It's a fascinating account of the life of a man who deserves to be more well known. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of this book, but I'd rather read it in a different format.   It's really well-written, but it's still a little hard to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.   I am a veteran who has been in the military since 1992.  It has been quite a while since I was a soldier.  This new book gives a good idea on how to do this job.  I'm hoping to be a better leader for my unit. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative and very fun book about a great musician who was once my hero. It's like listening to a great live recording that was just released.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that tells the story of how the modern-day concept of the'superior' human race evolved. It is also the story that many of us want to hear about. I read the book in two days because it is just too good to put down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many of the works by the late great science fiction writer Vernor Vinge.  I'm always impressed by his ability to create worlds that are not only very plausible, but also believable.  He was also a very nice man, but his work is far better than any book I've ever read that he didn't write.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good primer on a subject that is important to every man who has a wife: her sense of humor. It's funny, it's informative, it covers the most common forms of humor in the culture and why they work. I know the humor of my wife, and it makes her laugh at my jokes. She can laugh at anything. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and does a good job of describing the subject matter. The book is a great introduction to the history of the Soviet Union and the Communist movement.  It is a good read for people who are new to the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had my eye on this book for a long time and finally read it. I'm glad I finally did, although it is a bit dated. The information was still relevant at the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read all of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and I can say without hesitation that this is my favorite of the trilogy.  While it does have its flaws (I would have liked to see the characters have a more realistic look, for example) this series has made me want to read more.  I will be buying the other books in the series, as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I'm a fan of horror novels in general, and I enjoy these books because they keep the characters in a believable state of mind.   I was a little skeptical about reading a novel about the undead, but this book really scared me, and it was very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The plot is interesting and interesting. It's just that I couldn't put it down until I had. I've read about a dozen different books about the First World War, but this one takes the cake. The author's account of the Battle of the Somme is well researched and written.  It's not only about the men, but also about the equipment they were carrying.  I liked the chapter about the tank corps.  The author was able to write about the people in the tank units in a very good way.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so very happy to have discovered this book. It is just as good as I thought it would be, and I can't wait to start reading it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little disappointed with this book but was pleased with the book overall.  It is interesting to read about the early development of the concept of money and the early debates about its value.  The book is also interesting in the way it makes a case for the importance of money. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read the book years ago but hadn't gotten around to reading it recently. Now that I have, it's a great read.  I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most brilliant and original idea that has been presented to me in a long time: a book on the history of the English language which has nothing to do with linguistics, but is in fact about the whole world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.  I don't really know a lot about Islam or its adherents, but this book made me a believer.   It's a great introduction to the religion and its followers.  If you're going to start reading Islam, I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a group of friends who were all very creative but not very good at it. I think the main reason for the success of these writers was that they had a good sense of humor.  This book is about a writer who makes a fortune off the back of his friends.  He takes this as a compliment and gets more creative.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a perfect example of how the Christian right has become the very thing they claim to oppose: an unthinking, uneducated, anti-intellectual, conservative movement whose members' obsession with God is only matched by their ignorance of the world and its people. The book has a lot to teach.   I'm not sure it'll have much impact on the American Religious Right, but it's certainly an important book for those who want to understand how a movement so obsessed with God could end up becoming a movement dedicated to the destruction of other people's freedoms. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read about mental health. It is very informative, and very helpful. It was written from a patient's perspective. The patient was very open about her mental health history.  I've been on a mental health kick lately, so I'm looking forward to reading more about this.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that takes a more traditional look at the "good old days."  The author is very knowledgeable about the time period he is writing about.  He is not afraid to be critical of the government, and his views about it are not necessarily those of a liberal.  I like that he takes the time to explain things to a younger audience that might not understand things like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well-written and thoughtful book that deals with a lot of important social issues.  It will definitely be a useful guide for my own writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been trying to read all the Harry Potter books for some time. I'm a little late to the party, but this one has me hooked. A good read, well written, and an enjoyable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I bought this book, especially since I'm not an English teacher and I don't know the words to the many songs in the book.   It is very informative and enjoyable and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about English 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I found it through a book exchange, and I am glad I did! This book is about a girl that I had a crush on since I was a child and my sister, who was my best friend. I didn't know her, but I was drawn to her.  I read this book to her at her birthday, and she loved it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book at a book fair a couple years ago. I found it interesting that it was published by a German publisher (not American) with a German cover.   It is well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, informative book that covers the basics of cryptography. It is a bit more advanced than I'm used to, but it's a good read. It doesn't cover the intricacies of cryptology, but if you have ever wanted to know how to get started with cryptography, this is a great starting point.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of what I've read on the subject of human nature has been either superficial or too focused on the "bad" side.  But I think this book is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking on human nature I've seen.   It's also very interesting that the same traits that make us humans also make us the worst, most selfish, most violent creatures in existence.  (A good book to read for kids.) 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a number of books about the First World War, including a biography by Stephen Ambrose. However, this book, written by a former Royal Navy officer, is my favourite so far. This book is a unique insight into the First Sea War. The first part is about the naval struggle, the second part is a true account of life on the ship and the third part is an analysis of the German campaign. I am a big fan of history, but this book makes history look interesting, interesting in a good way.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read about women in the military.  The book is well written, and provides excellent information on the female military experience.  I found the discussion of female soldiers to be informative and enlightening.  For example, when the author talks about the difficulties of serving in a male dominated environment, she makes the point that the more women in a position of leadership, the more it becomes a male environment.  As such, she concludes, the higher their status, the less men want to be a part of it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book twice and both times I was so impressed with its clarity and depth.   The book is a tour de force of a historical and theological analysis of the Christian faith that has been written by a scholar who knows his stuff.  This is a must read for anyone interested in the history and theology of the Catholic Church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really excited about this book and the possibility of discovering new and interesting ideas in philosophy. I thought I had heard of some of them but I didn't know about the one about a bird that never lays eggs. I was so glad that I picked this book up.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read. A story about an unusual experience with a stranger on a bus in NYC is quite memorable. It's a good read in its own right, but the experience it describes is definitely a highlight.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a friend who was a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. She'd read them all and she told me that they were the most fun she'd ever had reading a book. Well, I was excited to see that she'd picked up the second book. I'd like to know where the third book goes. I don't like a good fantasy series just yet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in one sitting in one night, and I enjoyed it immensely.   The book is a good, well researched history of the American Communist Party, which was formed in 1905, when Eugene Debs was the Socialist Party's candidate for president.  In the 1940's and 1950's, as the Communists rose in prominence, the party became more and more extreme.  Debs himself was imprisoned and died in 1953.  This book is an accurate and good history of this part of the movement, from the early years in the early 1900's, through the 1960's and 1970's, when they finally became a major political force.  The main focus is on the Communists in the US and Canada, but there are some interesting stories about other Communist parties in other parts of the world, including the Spanish Communists and the Greek Communists.  For those who have read about the Holocaust and the German Communists, this is a very similar story.  It is an amazing book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book at the recommendation of a friend.   The author was kind enough to let me read the first two chapters, and I thought it was good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a few years ago and loved it.  It's very funny.   It is about a young guy who is a little bit crazy but has great insight.  He is very funny and smart.  The humor really came through. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this before and enjoyed it, but I'm reading it again. I am amazed by the way this book addresses so many different issues that affect women and the family. This book will not only help the women in my life understand their emotions better, but it will also help you understand your own. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first novel that I've read by a great author that didn't give me a headache.   The main characters are interesting and well done, and the world building is a breath of fresh air.  The plot is the only thing that doesn't come off right at first but is still good.  I was able to enjoy the book while keeping the mystery in the back of my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  I had a very difficult time trying to find something positive to say about it.  However, this book is well written, very well-researched and contains a lot of useful information.  This book is really useful for people that have had problems getting a good night's sleep or have difficulty falling asleep, and would like to know more about how to help yourself.  It was very interesting and helpful for me to learn more about sleep apnea, and to see how it affects other people.  Also, it is a very good reference to sleep apnoea and a good overview of the literature.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book, but have not been able to put it down. It has been a good read so far, and I have a good feeling about it. The characters have real depth and real emotions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the Jewish culture in Germany and the Holocaust. The author gives a good explanation about the roots of Jewish culture. It is also well written, easy to understand and it contains many historical facts that most students have forgotten.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject I've read, and I've been reading about it for about 30 years.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept of a good thriller has been done many times over.   For all the great movies about a man who stumbles across the truth, there is a lack of good novels about that same theme.  The only good one I have ever read was the James Ellroy novel "The Ghost Writer" about the same character.  If you like a good mystery with a twist, "The Man Who Lived" is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a couple of books about my dad that had a good ending.  This one does not disappoint.  I am now a father of four (my kids were born in different years) and he has been a good source of wisdom, perspective, and fun.    I hope that in my grandchildren's generation he will be remembered as a good role model.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a huge fan of science fiction, but I'm glad to see a fantasy novel with a strong female lead. I found the characters, both male and female, believable and believable enough to be engaging. I think the author used a lot of fantasy and science fiction elements in the story. I like that she went into the story from a different angle, with some real world implications.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was extremely skeptical about this book when I first read about it. I didn't think it would have much of a place in my bookshelf. However, after reading it, I can definitely say that this book is a must-read for any and all fantasy lovers. It's well written, and even though the plot is a bit too cliche, it does give a good insight into a character who may have been too hard on himself. I will definitely be reading more of Robert Jordan's works.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The "Biblical" books in the Christian library are among the best I've read, and I appreciate that they're not just for the "Bible" but also for reading for enjoyment.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read in a long time that really got me thinking about religion. The main theme of the book is about the role of religion in history, and how it has played a large part in creating and perpetuating oppression. As I said before, the book could have been titled "Why I Am A Liberal", and the author was probably right to write a negative review of a book like this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding how religion and politics can become so intertwined in the modern world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read book on how to deal with stress, anxiety and depression. The advice given by Dr. H. is very helpful. I'm a college student that is very good at writing about my experiences. Dr.H. has the same experience and comes up with very helpful tips to help deal with these issues.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, "Fluoride: The Forgotten Fluoride in Your Water Supply"  by Deborah E. Davis, was one of the most helpful books I have read in a long time.  I learned a lot about my health and I can no longer get sick when I get sick. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am always interested in the "how" of things. This is a book that tells the "why" in a good way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading a lot of biographies lately. I was disappointed that it was so hard to get through most of them. But this book is worth it. I am interested in the biographies of the women involved in the story and the women who have come after them. I do find some of the biographical data interesting, but I do not find that there are any "new" information that is "relevant" to the subject.  I am glad that there is a chapter on women in medicine in the book (and that it is in there), but I don't feel that there was anything in the rest of the book that was truly worth the time it took to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent and detailed history of the United States, covering almost all of its history from the formation of the republic to the present.  A must-have book for anyone interested in American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book about a man's struggle with bipolar disorder. It's a great read, and is a great example of the kind of book that can help others.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, like my earlier one about the Bible, is a great introduction to the New Testament, a must for all Christians. I've always found that the Bible is full of strange things that Christians believe. This is one of them. But I think that it's a good thing that these weird things were included in the Bible. There's no doubt that the Old Testament contains many strange things, but I believe that it is important that we keep an open mind. This book will help us do that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I have said before, I really liked this book! It was the first book I read by a female author I liked. I had heard of her work, but I didn't know it was by a woman. I'm glad I took the time to read this book, especially since it's written by a male writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had the pleasure of reading and enjoying The Last Battle   by Michael Moorcock    in a number of different formats:  PDF format, E-book format, and the Kindle format   The Last Battl   is one of the most impressive books I've read in a long time   As far as fantasy stories go,   Moorcock's work is among the best   There's a very interesting story at the heart of The Last   Battle 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book, which I've been meaning to read for some time.   The writing is so beautiful that you can't help but love it.  I've heard that this book is based on a true story, but it's just as good, if not better, than that.  It's the stories that make it special. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I really wanted to read something with a lot of action packed in it.  The book starts off slow but gets better.  I enjoyed the plot and how the characters all got something out of their lives that would change them.  A couple of things I noticed in this book is that you learn more about the characters after the story is over, which is a nice touch.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very well-written and has many interesting insights about the human condition. It is a bit difficult to follow, but the authors do a good job at making their argument. I am not a psychologist, but I am interested in psychology and I was surprised by the level of detail about human psychology in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the history of the American Indians. It is filled with history, history, and more history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn the basics of a martial art.   I think it's a good resource for people who just want to learn about the martial arts.  I don't really know much about Taekwondo but from what I've read I think I'd be good at it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read any books that had such a big influence on my development as this one.   It is not just a book on self-defense or martial arts that changed my life, but rather a book that gave me a lot of ideas about how to live.  It was in a class with my teacher,   which I had never been to before,  that I discovered the importance of taking control of my life and not being controlled by others.  When I started the book I was very intimidated by it but I really liked it.  This book changed my whole outlook on life and helped me understand myself better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't own this but my sister did. She had a hard time buying it at a local bookstore and was so happy to find it on amazon. The book was amazing. The photos were fantastic. The characters were all interesting and funny. I would highly recommend this book to any child who loves animals.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very important book. It shows that the concept of "human nature" is not limited to a certain group or a certain country. It is a universal concept.  This is a must read book for anyone who thinks that "human" is limited to "the white race". 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the idea behind this book. I read it and the first page of the synopsis is great.  I would like to see more details on the author's personal life, which is something I haven't seen in a book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really happy to find out about this book. It is a brilliant work, full of historical information, and full of good humor. The author, a historian and a journalist, does a great job of explaining why it is important to know how people live in different parts of the country. I can't wait to read more about the life of the people in this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was excellent. It was very well-written and very informative. The chapter about the importance of social interaction was very insightful and helpful. I found it very interesting how the same group of women would have very different responses to the same situations. I have some interesting thoughts about this, but I am probably going to have to reread it a couple of times. It is an excellent book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about women's life in the Victorian era. A good story about how women could earn their way into the upper class without a lot of effort.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading a lot of history books recently, and this one caught my eye because of the historical aspect. I'm very interested in how different religions have developed over time, and how they came to different conclusions.  It's a good historical study.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well written book about how a man's desire to be a part of a "normal" family can get in the way of his happiness in the "normal world". It's a real eye opener for the average man.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has inspired me to start my own business.   The first time I did it I was completely flummoxed, but now I can do it with ease.  The book also contains a list of the most common mistakes I made and a list and list of things to avoid.  I'm so glad I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's written in a clear and accessible style and has a lot of great information about the topic. The pictures and information are also very helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is excellent and has much to say about the importance of having a good relationship with your children.  I was the mom who used to always pick on my children, so I had a very good relationship.  After reading this book I see that sometimes I need to set the tone for my kids and show them what's expected.  It is nice to see how these women deal with their children's problems, especially the "bad parents" 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished a very good book.  It's about a small group of young people who find a way to be very successful.  The characters are very real.  One character was able to make a living at the age of 14 by playing the piano.  Other characters have gone on to become famous and successful.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a good YA/romance book but didn't find it here. I have to admit that I'm not really a big romance reader, but the story kept me reading the whole way through.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure I'll ever be able to read anything by S. E. Hinton, the author of "The Way Things Ought to Be," "The Children of Hurin," and "A Thousand Splendid Suns."   It seems to me that there's a strong bias in the way that most people write about him.  I don't believe in bias at all, but it is quite a thing to have a book that I think is excellent and a book by a person who is considered "bad" by most people be described as "awesome." 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good read.    It is very well written and easy to understand.  The book is not written in a style that will appeal to everyone, but will appeal strongly to people who know how to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. This book gives a good history of Hitler's rise to power and his downfall. The author, who is German, gives a unique perspective on the events. He gives the events the historical perspective.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The world is full of things that we can never imagine and still wish to be true: true love, true friends, true food, true happiness.  I hope this book can give some hope to those people who are in the same situation as I am and that it helps them not to give up hope.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and thoughtful book about a great and important period in world history. I found the history of the French Revolution fascinating, but not overly so. This book was good for a refresher.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very nice, well-researched, and entertaining book.   The authors are very professional and clear in their presentation of the topic.  If you don't understand something, don't feel bad because you don´t understand it yet.  In fact, don´ t feel bad at all!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book that I have read in which the author has taken a scientific research question and come up with a solution that is a whole lot easier than anything else I have tried.    The idea is that in many cases, the best way to keep a bad breath is to keep your mouth closed so that it can't "spill."   This seems like a good idea to me, because I have had the "stinky" problem since I was a little girl.  It is embarrassing, and I hate it.  When I was about 6 or 7, my parents found some small plastic cups in a box of the little tiny plastic spoons my grandmother used to make.  These were very hard and didn't stay in my mouth very long.  I remember them being pretty funny, as I would get my hands in there and find that I couldn't get out.  The thought that maybe they were made of wood seemed like a pretty good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book before a lecture about the Holocaust.   I'm a bit of a history buff, so this is one of those books that made me want to study more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have enjoyed the books of Richard Dawkins by Richard Dawkins. They have helped me in my faith as well as my understanding of science. I also have enjoyed his books by Richard Stokes.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad that a good writer is willing to put out a bad book.  This is a collection of some of the worst stuff ever written about psychology.  The only thing that makes this book worth reading is the description of the author's personal life:  The author's father died at a very young age (15) and was apparently in his mid-30s when he died.  His mother had to raise three children on her own and it shows in the book.      She was also a terrible housewife, which is probably why she didn't have much to do with her children after their father died.   She also had a series of affairs that ended in divorce, but no matter, she got divorced in a few years after having two more children.     She died a few months later.   The two of them had a good thing going.  My mother was a great mother, and I have to agree with her about the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so very good.  It's a great guide to understanding and overcoming a debilitating disorder.  I've read many, many books on chronic illness, but this is the best of the lot.  My daughter has anorexia nervosa and was recently discharged from a mental hospital.  She was very excited to get the book but I was more than a little worried about her.  The book is filled with good information about what the disease is, how it affects people, and what to do about it.  Even better, the author writes with a loving, funny voice.  He'll tell you exactly what your daughter is thinking about, and he'll tell it so clearly you'll understand exactly why she's thinking that way.  This is the kind of book you want to read over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the development of the United States in the twentieth century. It is not the usual historical account. It's a look at how the country came to be, how it developed, and how it changed. The authors are well versed in the history of America. They do not ignore it, but they do look at it from a different perspective than most historians do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great little book, that really captures the essence of the life of a famous poet:  a wonderful and moving portrait of a very complex man, in a unique and interesting context.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book on a plane ride home from a conference, and while I did enjoy the plot, it did not quite capture my attention.  It is not really about a mystery, but about a young woman who is involved in a series of tragic events.  While the plot is interesting, I did not find the story intriguing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am reading this right now.  It's a book that will be read many times.  And that's fine,  but  it's a great book.  This is a good, informative book about life with a chronic illness and its effect on our society.  The book is written from a personal perspective, so there is a fair amount of self-pity, but  that is a small price to pay  for a good read.  I'm a person who has been dealing with chronic illness for over 20 years and  this is the first time I have read a book about it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book about a year ago and had no idea what to expect. This is a great book, with plenty of examples. I like the author's approach to writing about the negative. This has helped me to better cope with my own problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the author's previous book  . I loved it too and am glad   that the author is back with another book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be well researched and well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I've always been interested in the science of human behavior, but have always felt that the people I've met who have studied this stuff were a bit too 'out there'.  This book really shows that people who do study the science behind human behavior are just like everyone else...except they're very smart.  The book is very good, but I think I could get by with reading just the first few chapters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read, but not really the kind of book that you can read once or twice and be done. It's a good look at some interesting things that have been happening in the world, and the details of each case and the way it is investigated are very good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read the entire series now and it is still my favorite. I have also read the first three books in the series, and still enjoy them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a few copies of this book. I have read them over and over.   They are all different styles of writing, but each one has been well worth the read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for my son who is a huge fan of Stephen King's work.   This book is a compilation of all his short stories.  The stories in here are really good and well thought out and some of them are really scary. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good introduction to the philosophy of quantum mechanics. It is interesting and not at all dry. The book is also useful for those who wish to know more about this theory, but are concerned about the mathematics of the theory.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. I found it very useful in explaining how to use and interpret the data from a large survey of American consumers.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the development of a major character in a major novel. I really enjoyed this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very good read and very well-written.    I am really looking forward to the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is full of interesting information about the history of Christianity and how it came to be so different from other religions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I've tried to use a different color ink. I am very pleased with this ink. It works very well in all my fountain pens. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been wanting to read this book for years and finally got around to it.   This is a book about the history of women and the history, as well as the present day, of women's studies.  It is not a history of feminism, although there are many examples, but a history, both in theory and practice, of feminism itself.  The book covers women's history from ancient times through the present.  I especially liked the chapter on the "female role."  The chapter on women's oppression in the West is the best one in the book.  Although the book is long, it is not boring.  Many important issues that women face in the present are discussed.  This book is useful for anyone interested in women's issues.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the subject of "sport". This is the first time I've encountered the subject, and I'm very impressed. It's also a great read, so I hope this will have a positive impact on me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason to read this book is for the story, and I found the story interesting and well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating read.   The way the characters are portrayed is great, and I found myself thinking about the characters and their experiences.  I'm not a psychologist, but it made me think about how I could relate to a character like that.  The story also made me want to look at the things I own that I don't like (or that I hate) to see if I can do something about them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a long time ago, before the internet was so popular.   It is a good read if you are interested in the history of the English language.  The book starts with the beginning of the French Revolution, and then covers the history and development of English language until the late 1800s.  This is a very good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit that I never got around to reading this book. But then again, I never read many fantasy books, either. It's not the kind of fantasy I'm into but it's one that I think many people might like.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a fantastic book about what is probably the most important subject of our time, the global economic crisis.  It explains the root cause of the crisis in a way that is accessible to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I were discussing the story of the Christian God in the Bible.   The Bible speaks of him as the God of Israel.  However, the Bible also speaks of God as being God of the Jews.  God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  But the Bible does not mention a Christian God.  In fact, the word God is never used.  A Christian God is not mentioned in the New Testament.  As I was researching my book, I noticed the lack of any reference to a Christian god.  This was very interesting to me.  It seemed that the idea of a Christian deity was not even considered as part of the biblical narrative.  So the idea that the story is about a pagan god was not a surprise.  The fact that a Christian story is included is a surprise to me because of the fact that it is so rare to find a Christian tale in the bible.  I am not sure why God would have an equal or greater presence in all the stories than the pagan ones.  And this is an interesting thought because it is the story that has the most religious undertones to it.  My book will be the first to include a Christian perspective in a Biblical tale. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to the world of science by a short story that was included in a collection of short stories by a number of science fiction authors (most of whom I didn't know).  I read the stories as they were published and it was fascinating.  I think that there are so many people who have been inspired to take up science fiction as a career because of this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was at a library recently and came across the excellent The Secret History of the U.S. Army by Robert C. Brooks. I have had a great deal of interest in the U S Army and in this book it was a very informative and very well written history.  It has a lot to offer as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, written by an author whose work I've admired since high school, is a good read.  The story is very well-written, the characters are very believable, and the plot is compelling.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book in paperback and loved it.  It was a little bit more complicated than the Kindle version.  However, the story is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very happy with my purchase. I'm usually wary of buying books on the internet, but I figured I would give this one a try. It's not perfect by any means, but for the money it's worth it. I am going to start reading more about history and try to learn a bit more about my country as a result.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that teaches young adults how to use their imagination and to use language effectively.  I'm a teacher and this book is a must-read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about the history of the Jewish community in America.  I would have liked to have been a bit more up to date in the early years.   But overall, very good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a well-researched book on the history of American democracy and the Constitution. The book provides a detailed account of the Constitutional Convention, and includes a discussion of how the convention's deliberations reflected the political philosophy of Thomas Jefferson.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good. I would recommend this book to any teacher who wants to teach with a sense of humor.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a very complex and controversial topic: the role of religion in the development of human society. It's written in a very readable style that makes it a joy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best part about this book is that it is an easy read: the stories are simple, the information is clear, and the characters are just right.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written book. A good, enjoyable book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have read on the subject of sexual violence and its aftermath.    It's a must read for anyone who has been or is a victim of sexual assault or rape.  It has made me more aware of how rape is often mis-reported, that false accusations are not rare, and that rapists have to live with the consequences of their actions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book.   It is a well written account of a very interesting time in our country's history, from its creation to its demise.  The time in question was the civil rights era.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand a very important time in American history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A really good book about the nature of the spiritual world.    A good book to read at your own pace, not in a rush, and to be absorbed in. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well-written book on the science of sleep and dreaming.    It's very good at explaining how sleep and dream studies work, how they relate to the brain's ability to learn, and why it's important to understand why we dream.  It is also a good review of the various methods that scientists have used to study sleep and the brain. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book on a topic I have always struggled with: how to talk about religion in public. It is a practical guide, and while it's a bit more complicated than just reading a couple of books, it's still a good guide to how to approach it and handle it appropriately.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've read about the Great Depression, one that also examines the impact of the Great War on the American economy.  It is very much about the problems in the American psyche in the 1930s, but also about the fact that the Depression was caused by a financial panic and not by the economic downturn that began in 1929.  A good book, worth every penny
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, comprehensive study on the history of the Jews, from their emergence in the Middle Ages as a social and political group to the Holocaust.  The book also has many important discussions about the rise of fascism in Europe.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, well-written, highly enjoyable book about one of the most influential American poets of the 20th century. This is one of my top five books I've read so far this year. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because it's so well written and so well put together. The characters are very well developed and the plot is well thought out. It's a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first chapter of this book is pretty good. It starts with a look at the history of the U.S. economy, and then the author gives a history of economic thought in the 20th century, and how these two perspectives have been the driving force in both U. S. history and economic thought over the past 100 years. This book also takes a look back at the American economic crisis of the 1930's, and provides some useful historical background on how that crisis came about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book by a well-known and highly respected scholar of the Holocaust, who has also been a very good friend of mine. The book is well-written and covers the basics of the history of the holocaust with a good deal of historical information. It is a bit dated (I am thinking about my own youth), but if you want to know more about the Holocaust and the "other side" then it is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A fun read that is well written.  There are a lot of interesting facts and interesting characters.  It is fun to read about them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been waiting for this book for years.   It is the definitive work on the topic and is a must read for all.  The research is thorough and the information presented is very clear and well organized.  A must read and will become a staple in my book collection 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read. I don't get the feeling that this is going to be a one-sided attack on "white racism," as I read the review of this book on the Internet.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as an undergraduate, in the late 1980s.  I have to say that this is the first book on the topic that I've found that really made an impact on me.   It was so compelling that I actually put it down and just read the book again after a few months.  It's been on my list ever since. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not able to finish this book until I was in my late 40's.   This is one of the best books I have ever read about my own childhood.  This book has the same quality as the famous The Wizard of Oz, but with a bit more adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is based on the true story of how one man's decision to help the poor was one of the most important events in the history of the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book about the early days of the Internet.  It has a lot of history behind it, and it's not all bad.   It's great to see how the early web pioneers made the most of it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really excited about this book, but I didn't want to spend the money on it. I did though. It is good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book to be a wonderful overview of a number of topics, from the science behind the origin of species to the origins of language to the relationship between science and religion.    It's not the kind of book I would recommend to others, but it's a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read and reread this book many times, and the same message remains: when the going gets tough, you just need to take a chance on someone new.  The main character, Sam, is a "nice" guy who is not necessarily "good" either.  He's good at being nice.   But he's also a real pain in the butt when he's not feeling like it.  This is especially true when it comes to his family and his girlfriend, and how he deals with them.  (I would have liked a bit more in depth discussion about how Sam's relationship with his mother and father is unique, and what kind of consequences it has on Sam.  It's really an interesting subject to think about.)    I hope this book inspires other people to try out new characters.  I am a firm believer that you can always learn something new from reading a book, and that you never know who might surprise you next.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I wanted to learn about the development of the Japanese language, and so was able to read a book about the language's history.   The language is very interesting, and I learned a lot from the book, but I think it's worth reading as a language book for beginners, or for people who are just getting into the language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good I can't say how.  I was never a big fan of the "Harry Potter" series, but I'm glad that Rowling went back to the source and made this book the story of a teenage boy's quest to save the world.   I can imagine myself being like Harry when he first saw the prophecy:   "I shall not wear a horcrux until the end of the world."   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think I've read every book by this author before, but this one was a bit different, and a bit more interesting than I thought it would be. I liked the fact that it focused on a character that wasn't an obvious villain, but was still a very complex character. The fact that she had a son that was very similar to her in some ways and very different in others was interesting. I like the fact the book focused on the character and not the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to philosophy and its connection to other areas of interest. I found it interesting how he connected it to the development of democracy and how it is connected to human psychology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting book that explains in great detail what happened to the Roman Empire when Christianity took over. While some may find the author's approach a bit biased, I found his analysis of the collapse of the Roman Republic convincing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books where you want to rip the pages out of the book and start a new one.  It is such an amazing book that I want to do just that.  I hope to read more of his work in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book about what I have learned about living with a brain tumor. I learned a lot about how a tumor can affect people and affect how they live. I was shocked that the tumor would affect my sense of humor and my ability to work at a job. I have found that having a brain cancer doesn't prevent me from having a good sense of humour.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an extremely good book about the "mythology" of the Old Testament.  The author is a very good scholar, with a good command of the Greek.  It is a long book, but if you are interested in this subject, you will get a good deal of the background for this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good, realistic look at a serious subject.   It's an excellent, realistic, non-supernatural read, with some very relevant lessons and advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great summary of the subject matter, but I think it misses some of the finer points.  The book doesn't really get into the details of the many variations in the early versions of the story.  Instead, it uses examples to illustrate that the story is not unique.  Also, the author doesn't mention the book of Genesis and the Flood until the final chapter.  This might have been a good idea, but it was too late.   I will probably read the next edition.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good and very informative book about women.    It is clear that the authors have taken great care in their research and are thorough.  It's easy to understand and the information is very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read two of these and they were both very good and fun.   There is an underlying philosophy to the way this is written and presented:  (1)   The idea that we are the "bad guys" is a bad idea.  The good guys are always trying to do the right thing.  (2)    This idea is a good one.  It is better to give the "wrong" idea than the "right" one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is clear, the writing is easy to read, the characters are well developed, and the plot is solid.   It is well researched and is a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a great memory. This book kept me on the edge of my seat until I finished it.  This is a wonderful, fun, and easy read.  If you have kids, I would recommend this book for the fun of reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book.  As a former police officer and ex-CIA operative I have read a number of books that deal with the "dark side" of intelligence, espionage, and national security.   I thought I'd have a better understanding of how it all works from this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a very religious person. I read through this book over and over again while driving, and then it finally came down to a decision:    If I read this book, I will be forced to question everything I believe about God.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book over a month ago. I'm still thinking about it. It's one of those books that you can't put down, even though it's a bit dense.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most enjoyable book I've read this year is The Greats by Tom Toles.   Toles' book is full of interesting anecdotes and observations about great athletes.  I'm a huge baseball fan, so I've already seen the similarities between Tom Brady and Jackie Robinson.  As a baseball fan myself, I also see the similarities in how they handled their fame and the stigma that followed.  The book covers how these two sports heroes became famous but also how their personal lives, family and faith influenced them.  My favorite part was when Toles talks about how Robinson used the "Black Power" term,  which was considered a slur,  as a way to show he was no racist.  Even today,  the phrase   "The power to move a nation"   still resonates with people.  This book shows how it's possible to not just use your fame for good but to use it to help others.  It's a good reminder to us all to be generous to people in need. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book.    It is a great book for people who want to understand how science and religion get confused about the origin of life.  The book explains how scientists have tried to solve the problem for the past hundred years.  Even the Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who first proposed the idea that life is an example of Darwinian evolution, has been frustrated in finding a satisfactory answer.  Crick's "Darwinism and the Meaning of Life" (1990) is probably the most comprehensive treatment of the origin question I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good that you don't even have to read the book to enjoy it. It's a very thought-provoking look at the "new atheist" movement in the late 20th century and how its members have tried to "purify" the term. The title is so appropriate, and the writing is so engaging, that it's easy to imagine yourself in their shoes as they try to reclaim the word. I really like this book, and am very excited about reading the next one in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book. I am still not sure about the author's motivations for writing this book but he seems to have written it to a certain extent. It's an interesting story but the main problem I have with it is that the characters in it are just... weird. They are weird and that is not a good thing. The main character is a little too much of a weirdo and it makes me a little uneasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the book would have been more effective if it had been written by someone who knew the topic and the people in the book.   However, the author did a fine job.  The subject matter is interesting and the details of the story are well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I have ever read in which the author takes a different direction than I would.  This was a brilliant book by a very brilliant writer.   The characters are not likeable, but they are so well drawn that you get sucked in.  I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a number of the old, out of print, pulp-fiction novels by H.G. Wells. While I'm no fan of the genre as a whole, I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with this book. While the story does get repetitive, it is not boring. It's a good read. It really is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so glad I got this book.  I love it, it is hilarious, and it is just a brilliant read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the world of economics, including some of the most important ideas of the last century. I found that many of the ideas discussed in the book have been used in the academic literature for a long time. I find that the book is not so much about economic problems but is about a different way of seeing the world.  The book is also well written, although a bit dry at times.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing. It's like watching a master painter, painting. The artistry in it is like nothing I've ever seen. And then I look at the final product, and I think, 'I've seen everything.'
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book on the history of the Russian Revolution.  A great study on all the great people who have had an influence on it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book.  I had been a skeptic about the efficacy of acupuncture and acupuncturists, but   I think this book has changed my mind.  It's been hard to find information about acupressure, but this book   makes it very clear that it does work and is useful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The premise is that an alien life form lives in our Earth, and it is our duty to try to learn more about it.  This is very well done, and I found it very entertaining.  I especially like that the alien was described as a little "bobtail", which was a bit of a mouthful, but was very descriptive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. The author makes the reader see the reality of a woman's life. I'm glad I'm in my 40s and still can enjoy a good mystery novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been very helpful in understanding and addressing the issue of the "bad" and "good" fathers of modern children.  I have three children. One has a father who is not a good father and has not been a good husband.  Another has a great father and is a wonderful mother.  My third has a bad father and does not live up to his father's expectations.  The best part is the advice given in the book about what to do to create a better father. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting book, but I'm not convinced that it will help people learn how to read. The authors seem to think that by being good at reading they can make a living as a teacher, and that the only way to be good at teaching is to be a good reader. I don't buy that. The best way to teach reading is by giving people books they don't have to learn to read in the first place, like in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second time I've tried this book, and I'm very happy with it. It's a very practical, very practical book, which can be used as a tool in learning to work with different people.  It's clear how to talk to each of these people in a productive manner, which is essential in a fast paced world like the real world.  If you want to be successful, it's probably a good idea to get a few tips from some of the people you encounter every day.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a family that is involved in a very bad thing. They are all involved with drugs.  It's a very sad story.  The whole family is involved.  I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I read on the subject of "The War on Drugs" is a must read. The author has a good grasp on the facts, but also knows how to explain them in a way that is accessible to people that do not read as well as he does. It is interesting to learn about the role of the drug warriors in the Bush administration as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book that will give you a good understanding of how people interact with each other in a group situation. It is also a good introduction to the concepts of group dynamics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not been able to put the book down. This book is amazing. It's well written and has a powerful message that should resonate with everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing that makes me happy about the book is that it's the first time I've seen a movie that's a complete success. I was really excited to see the movie because it was going to be based on a book by someone who's a huge fan of it. I had heard it was a huge hit but I was worried about the lack of actual details about the plot.  I got my first taste of it and I was hooked.  The plot was fantastic.  And the movie was amazing.  This is a must read for any true fan of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a graduate student in the Department of Communication Studies. This book is a wonderful tool to help me learn more about the history of the early Mormon Church.  It provides great historical detail and explains the LDS Church's origins in great detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.   It has a real eye for detail and the story is very well done.  It was a great surprise to find out that the author's father was a police officer.  This is a book that will keep me reading for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just finished the first draft of this book and I'm loving it. It's an excellent example of a story that makes you think about the problems in the world around you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book immensely! It is a very good read that explains what a normal day at work looks like in a day when the government's "war on terror" is the main news story. The way the book is written, I could see a lot of the government and media spin being put into a book. It is interesting to see how one can "make the world go round" while at the same time be a good person.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great and is the best book I have read about my journey to acceptance and understanding of transgender people.  I was in a very dark place about my gender identity and had been struggling with the idea of transitioning for many years.  While I was reading about the many hardships transgender people have to deal with and the challenges they have faced, I realized I was a transgender person who had been doing things right all along.  In fact, I had been living my life with acceptance and happiness as my identity.    I now realize that the only difference between me and someone who is transgender is the gender presentation.  If you are someone who has been in a similar situation to me, I would strongly suggest reading this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It was a quick read, but the ideas it presents were fascinating.  The book is written in a straightforward manner that makes it easy to understand.  A good idea can be used to solve a real problem, or it can help you to see things in a different way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of John Irving's fiction.  This is the second time I have read his "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" and I am not disappointed.  I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a good horror story: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very informative about the historical background of a subject I have long been interested in: the history of the US Federal Reserve.   I am a fan of Ron Paul, and this book is an excellent introduction to his economic philosophy.  It's not a perfect book but it's a very good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful introduction to the study of the Bible by a world-renowned scholar.  This book is a combination of excellent writing and great knowledge.  I learned a lot about the early centuries of Christianity from it.  It's worth a read, especially if you're a biblical scholar or just curious about early Christianity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best of the best of classic fantasy novels, which combines the best elements of the genre. The plot is engaging, and the characters are rich and engaging.  It's well written, and I can't wait to read the next book.

The characters are well developed and the magic is very believable. This is a great book for those who are looking for a good story with a good fantasy element. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book for any teacher who has been struggling to get his or her students to pay attention.  There is a lot of good information in the book that will be very helpful for any teachers trying to make a positive difference in their students' learning.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was never a big fan of the Harry Potter books. I never read them when they were new ( I don't think I ever even read a copy of the first one). But, I found this book after I finished reading the others and it's a must have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that I really wish I had read a long time ago. It has been years since I read this book, but it still holds up in my mind.  I loved the way the author depicted the different ways that people respond to a bad situation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good. It explains the basic mechanics of the game, and gives the player a sense of control in the process.   It also covers various other things such as character building and character customization. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the early life of a real, live, and quite possibly the greatest rock band ever:  There is a lot to say about this book, but I won't.  I have heard many good things about it, and I'll be checking out the live bootlegs soon.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of the 'Nam, but had heard about the Vietnam War. The book is a good read and I enjoyed it.  I also liked the fact that the author takes the time to talk about the negative aspects of the war.  This book will be required reading for all US Marines as well as anyone interested in US history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found a really interesting book about the life of a Chinese Communist who fought against Japanese Imperialism. He was captured, tortured and died in prison.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most interesting and informative book about "The End of History and the Last Man"   I found the book fascinating.  It is so well written that it made me want to know more about the man.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about a very good book about the life of a very famous scientist.   He's not a very nice guy, but I think that's why his work is so important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must-have for any serious reader of science fiction:  An excellent book, well-written and highly informative 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent source of information on many subjects: anatomy, genetics, psychology, anatomy of the eye, etc.  This is a very well written book that will help the reader understand the body.  It is very practical and easy to read.  There is a good amount of research included in the book, but this is done in such a way that the reader is not overwhelmed.  I highly recommend this book for those interested in the subject of anatomy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been looking forward to reading the book The New York Public Library: An Illustrated History  for a long time.  It has been one of my most-anticipated books ever.  I was very pleased to find a book with an extensive history of New York City that is easy to read and is illustrated.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm going to be honest:  I did not enjoy reading this book.    There are so many     mistakes   that I'm amazed that the author got it right.  But that doesn't matter.  The book is about the life of the greatest chess player ever:   Kasparov  .   That's right, Kaspar .  He's the greatest player of all time.  I know.  Kasprasparov is the greatest.  In my opinion,   he is a better chess player than Fischer or Karpov . But he's not just a better player.  For instance,  Kaspar was able to beat   Fischer at a very young age.  Fischer had a better understanding of the game . Kaspar was a good player. I do enjoy a good chess book. I also enjoy   reading about people I admire. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a very passionate gamer I'm very happy that I read this book.   It covers a wide variety of gaming options.  It's not as long as other books I've read, but the depth of the information is just as important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit hesitant to read this book. I was afraid that it would be a long rambling history of the modern-day Soviet Union (which, despite the title, it's not). It's really more about the evolution of Russia as a political entity. However, as a historian, I found myself enjoying this book a lot. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who won't agree with me, but I think that the book is important in showing the evolution and the change of the Soviet Union, in particular, from the Bolshevik revolution to the Soviet system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not about the good things. It's about the bad. But I still love it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of Stephen King. I'm very much a fan of his books and his movies.   This one has been on my "must read" list for a while now and I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book's main idea was good and the execution was well done.  The author makes good use of her experience as a high school student in an English class, a subject in which I never thought I'd be a good student.  I found myself wanting to keep reading to find out what happens next.  It's hard to put it into words, but it's kind of like a good mystery:  "How did he get here?"   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a couple of years ago, but did not read it at that time because of the rather long, dull, and very boring chapters. The book, in this case, is a short, very funny book about a man who wants to be a successful writer, and a woman who hates his guts, and the two of them are going to have a very fun time trying to get along. I didn't enjoy it at the time, but this time I'm really enjoying it. I really wish that there was more comedy in the book, but I do like the way it's written.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of the best I have ever read.  It is a good, well-written history that covers the period of the British Empire from its inception in 1763, through the American Revolution, the French Revolution and the creation of the League of Nations.  The history is fascinating and a very useful reference for those who want to learn more about British history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited about this book I read it twice.   It was written in 2004, but it still has a lot of the themes that have been prevalent in the popular imagination of the last 10-15 years:  the struggle of the underdog; the importance of good people working together; and the way the media is often manipulated by powerful people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best nonfiction books I've read about the "spiritual" or "religious" movements of the past hundred years. It's very good history and it shows how these movements are connected to the modern political and economic system.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think my wife likes this book better than I do. She said that she liked that it's more like a story book than a novel, that it has a little romance, and that she doesn't need a character like this. I really like the characters, too. I think the book was a little short, but I'm glad that it came out before the movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most original and thought provoking books on religion I have ever read. This book is so well written that I could write a book on religion with more originality and thoughtfulness.  This book will give the impression that one is a Christian by showing how the Church in America is based on a very old form of paganism.  The author makes a compelling argument that Christianity is an invention of a very ancient and primitive culture. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because it is written by a fellow woman. I have two daughters who are in their late teens. This book is very good in teaching them the ways of the world. My oldest daughter loved the fact that she could be a girl if she wanted to. This is something that is not taught to girls in our culture. The book also teaches about a couple other things that women have that men don't. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A brilliant book about a terrible thing. The book itself was pretty bad, but the book's themes are extremely relevant today. It is an excellent book about how the social environment has created an increasingly dangerous environment in which children have to live. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of this series, and of the Harry Potter books in general. The main reason for my love of the series is the fact that it is so funny. Rowling has created a wizarding world that is very different from anything we have ever seen in fiction before. It is so good that it makes it hard to compare to anything else. The world-building, the humour, the plot, the character development and the overall atmosphere of this book are what makes it so great. This book is full of moments that are so funny and fun that you just want to have a good laugh at them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read if you're interested in the early days of the modern US government.   It gives a really good overview of the early years of the federal government.    It's a little dated, but the writing is very readable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to the history of the United States.  The book is well-written and the information presented is correct.  It is well written and I have used this as an introduction to a variety of other books on the history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading this book for a few months and I have a feeling I'll like it.  This is a good one-stop resource for the layperson interested in a good, well-written, and very good overview of the history of Islam.  I like the focus on Muslims and Islamic history in this book and the way the authors draw the connections between the two.  It is very clear that the authors are doing their homework when they present their information and it is clear that this is a book that will not only be read by anyone with an interest in the history and practices of the Islamic world but also by anyone interested in Islamic theology.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. It is a fun, informative and entertaining look at one of the most famous rock bands in the history of music.  It also includes some good history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good introduction to the history of Jewish history in the modern period.   The book is full of interesting facts about the Jewish people and their rise to power in the world.  I have already recommended this book to my students who have been wanting to know about the Jews.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book a few times and have been very impressed with it.  It is a wonderful work of historical fiction, filled with the humor and charm of a good story, but with all the realism, depth, and emotional honesty you'd expect from a real story.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book about the subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials. It was very interesting to me to learn that the most popular movie of all time is based on a book that I have read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about how to use the word "I" and "me" in sentences, especially when they are about the self. This book is the result of reading the book "How to Be a Person" by Stephen Covey.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a gift from my mother. It's very good. It has been years since I read it, but it's still the most entertaining book I've ever read. The characters are very believable and the plot is really interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited to pick this book up that I literally sat down to read it before I had even decided to purchase it.   It is a fantastic story about a great man.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really excited about this book. I love that it tells the story in a way that I can understand.  This is such a good story and I've been thinking about this for years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic that will take you on a journey through the dark, mysterious world of the occult. It is not for everyone, but if you are interested in this subject you will not be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the idea of a book like "The Story of a New Name" and have read several of its many similar books.   This is the first one I've read by a woman.  I've been looking for a good novel that takes a male character and makes him a girl.  It's been difficult for me to find that one, but this is pretty darn good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read, good story. I had high expectations for this one.  I enjoyed reading about all the different characters in the story.  There were some that didn't make it in.  But the story is good and I'm looking forward to more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the history of modern mathematics. The author, who is an avid student of the history, shows that some of the ideas of modern algebra and set theory were discovered by people who were not mathematicians. He also shows how much is learned about the past by studying mathematics.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating look at one of the most dangerous and controversial topics of the twentieth century.   The author makes a very convincing case that the United States has never truly learned from the mistakes of WW2.  The book is also filled with entertaining anecdotes from the time.  It's worth reading and discussing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book while attending the college level. It was very interesting. It is not for the faint of heart or those who don't have time to read everything. However, this book is well worth the effort and you will enjoy the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very well written. I enjoyed the story very much.    It took a little while to get to know the characters and I found myself thinking about what would happen if I were to marry my current love. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not just a history book; it is a history of the present day and the present-day, a book about how the present has been made possible by the past. The book is full of information about all the different things that made the present possible. The author does a very good job of telling how our ancestors learned and used new techniques and technology. He also makes it clear that many of these new technologies were not just useful, but revolutionary. He gives a good description of the development of the steam engine. There are plenty of illustrations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I've read in years.  I've been a big fan of the "The Man in the High Castle" television series for a few years now, but I had never read the book or watched the TV series.   It's a masterpiece, and I'm glad I got to read it!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I read this book as a joke, but the humor is still there.   It's very much a science fiction book, but a very good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best on my list so far.  I found this to be a much more thorough and readable account of the early years of the Second World War than any book I've read so far that has focused solely on the German side.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.   It is a good mix of history, religion, and science.  It will take you a while to really get the full story of the book, but it will not leave you feeling short changed.  I am definitely going to read it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad I read this book because it gives a new understanding about the origins of our modern day concepts of 'rights.' I had a friend who was a very strong libertarian and he would always argue with me about it being wrong for the government to interfere in the private lives of individuals. He would often go as far as saying that if a person wants to marry his girlfriend, that is his choice, but if he wants to be a slave to the government, he must accept it. This made me so mad because I always wanted to know where that line was. It made me feel so bad for that person. This book really put a smile on my face and I was finally able to find the answer to that question. I'm glad I was able to learn about it and that it is still so prevalent in our society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have enjoyed reading The Book of Mormon by James E. Talmage. The book is an excellent historical study that is a great reminder of how much is left to be done in our day. I have always found the book to be a good reminder of the importance of keeping our history clean and pure. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the history of Christianity.  I learned about the first Christian Church, its early members, its great leaders, its dark days, and the great revival that eventually led to the Reformation.  It is a history that anyone interested in the history should read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the history of the French revolution. It is a good historical book about a bad time. But it is very much worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think that this is a good, good book. It's about the end of the 19th century, but it's not a typical book about the "end of history." The author takes a long time to get to the real point (which is that the rise of communism in Eastern Europe and China was due to the fact that these countries were not industrializing fast enough). The main reason he takes so long is that he has to explain why he is not a communist: he's a conservative. The second reason he does not identify himself as a communist is that it might help him get elected in a socialist country. That is, of course, just a rationalization, but the book does a good job of showing why that might not be a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the history of the Chinese Revolution.  It is clear from the opening chapters that Mao is the man who did most to put China on the road to the socialist revolution.  Mao has a profound impact on the whole Chinese Communist Party.  The revolution in China has been characterized as one of the most successful in history.   This book is an excellent introduction to this revolutionary movement. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It's not too long, it's not boring, it makes great sense, and it's one of the few I've read in which a character who's not a main character actually becomes the main character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic primer on the history of Russian martial arts.  The author has an interesting story to tell, and he writes it with such passion that it doesn't feel like he's giving the history a dry run.  It's so well researched and written that it's like the author had been living in Russia for years and years, studying, practicing, and thinking about the history and practices of Russian fighting.  I've been reading Russian martial books for many years and this one is my favorite so far. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a sucker for romance novels about people who have lived before: they're just so much better than you and me. I found this book quite entertaining. The author did a good job of writing the story in a believable way and gave us enough information to follow along but not so much that we feel we need to read it again. I'll definitely be buying her next book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the author's journey through writing the book.  The book is a collection of stories.  I enjoyed each story.  There is no reason to feel sorry for the protagonist; they are just as well-meaning as you would expect them to be.  Each story is about a different subject matter.  One is about how people in her family treated her, another about how a book made her cry, and another about why she doesn't like being the "book girl."  This is a good read for anyone who loves a good mystery.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book while on a road trip with my wife. It was a good read! It was fun to read about my great-grandfather's childhood and his time as a miner in the silver mines. I am glad I bought it. I also enjoyed the photos and the fact that the book included many pictures of my great grandfather. It's hard to find books about my grandfather's time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a good way to learn about different religions and the different beliefs about them.  I'm an atheist so I'm not very knowledgeable about these beliefs but  the information about the differences in religion was very informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book useful as a way to help my husband and I get through a tough situation.  He is not a big fan of history but he was able to find a good reference book on the subject that he can share with his kids when they ask questions about his family's history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent and well written book about the history of the Catholic Church. This book gives a good overview of the church's history.  The book is very readable and does a good job at providing a history of many different aspects of the history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this book for a while now, and I just can't put it down. The writing is brilliant and so is the story. I have a lot of problems with the current economic system, but I'll take a bad book over the alternative any day.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good history of the American west, one that can be very satisfying to anyone interested in American history. I also enjoyed that the author makes a distinction between the American Indians of the early West and those who followed them.  The former were the original settlers, while the latter came later. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good one. It is very well researched, and I can see why the authors have come to this conclusion.  The book is divided into sections:   First, there is the history of the American Communist Party from its inception to the present.  This section covers the origin of the Communist Party in the United States, how the Party was formed in the early 1900s, how it changed over the years, how many Communists were members, how they became the Communist party, how its members have changed over time, how Communists became reformers, how Communist Party members have become reformers.  In the end, there are a few things that seem like common sense to me.  There is a reason why the CPUSA did not support civil rights: the Party had its own black members (which it did not want to admit), and it didn't want to be a "black power" party.  Communists have been reformers: they have been in the forefront of social reform in every major area of society.   Second, there was the history about the Communist leaders and how they tried to keep the Party from being the "new radical left".  This part was good, but a little confusing.  I found the authors to be thorough and they were very careful in their descriptions of Communist leaders.  However, some of their descriptions were a little misleading.  First of all, some were called "the new radicals", "new revolutionaries", "the New Left", and others were called Communists in a derogatory manner.  As I said before, I have read about the New Left and the New Radical Movement, but the authors were not very thorough in their description of these groups.  Third, some people in the book have some odd views about race.  Here is an example:  "It was not until the late 1930s that the CP began to integrate its ranks, but in the 1930s and 1940s many Communists who opposed the anti-Communist crusade of the McCarthy period joined the CP.  It is often said that the Communists were the only group that did not have any black members, but this was not true.  Even though most black Americans were against racism, the CP had its share of black members."      So, there seems to be two types of Communists: those that were against the New Deal, and those that joined the Communist movement for social reform.  If you are not a good communist, you don't
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to a wonderful subject. It will also serve as an excellent textbook for a course in history, religion, and philosophy.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm reading this book right now.   It's a great read about the early days of the American space program and the incredible men and women who built it.  I like the way the author uses different ways to portray different personalities:  The famous "We built it, and they built it" line is used for the most part in this book.  They built it in the form of the space program.  A lot of the book is about how the early space program was started and what happened after that.  It is really fascinating how this group of men and the people they chose to work with, came together to build a system that could go into space. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading and learning about the history of the American West from the earliest times to the present, and this book by John A. T.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, solid book about the problems of our society in the 1960's, a book that I will probably read again. I am not a radical, but I was very influenced by my reading of this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great story that's not just about the Nazis but about the great man himself: Hitler was an intelligent, ambitious man who used his charisma to get what he wanted.   This book is a good read in general and if you like Hitler you'll love this one too.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best short stories I've ever read. The narrator is excellent.  There's a dark edge to this story that is hard to find in many stories.  It is a very unique and powerful tale that will have you laughing throughout the entire reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a life saver for me. I was a big fan of The Hunger Games and wanted a second book of the series but was too afraid to buy it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book on the subject of how we learn.  It is clear and engaging and you learn the key concepts that go into learning how to think, learn from others and work hard.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the development of modern medicine. It is not a technical treatise on how to do science, but a very practical guide to how doctors work together in medical teams. It describes how a doctor should think about the whole patient: family, medical problems, the patient's life-style, the medical problems of the patient. The author gives many practical examples to illustrate the concepts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. It's a well-written, well-researched book about a fascinating subject.   This book is well-organized and very well-illustrated.  The only issue I had with it is that it's very hard to get through.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I've ever heard of a book that had as many references to the works of Tolkien and the Hobbit as The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  The references in The Hobbit are so numerous that I often wonder how many people are aware of the references. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the most comprehensive and helpful reference books I have ever seen on this subject.  The author has a PhD in history from Oxford and an impressive record of publishing.  I am very pleased to find such an important book on this important topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great work of fiction. It has everything I look for in a good mystery: it's well written, well thought out, and well researched.  This is not just a book about a murder case:  It is a book that takes you into the life of a real person as they deal with one of the most terrifying crimes in American history.  I was very impressed with the way the author put the case together:  The way she wrote the names and addresses in the book are amazing:  I wish she'd added some more names and dates in the back of the book.  The only thing that bothered me was that she didn't add more details about how she found the body.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't put my finger on what the difference between this and the first book is.   The first book was very well written and the main character had some depth.  Here  he is a bit of a loner who has his own problems and is a little bit of an idiot.  The plot is not really interesting, but the characters are. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for those who have to work in a corporate environment to help people with their computers, but it is also a good reference book for IT professionals, especially those who deal with Windows and Windows Vista systems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've only read a couple of the stories in this book. However, the stories are so good, they have me wanting to read all the other books by this author.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can see why the author thinks that "The Book of Mormon" is the best book ever written about Mormonism.  I've read every LDS book on the subject, and I'm always disappointed that they don't offer up any compelling reasons why Mormons should accept their faith.  The only reason I still give them credit is that I don't think that the book is actually that bad.  It is a very readable book, and even though it does not change my mind about Mormonism, I can understand why the authors feel that it does. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good primer on a good idea.  It is not easy to follow all the technical details, but it is well worth it.  If you can get the basic concepts down, then you can follow the math and the examples. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best in the genre and I am pleased to have found it. It was so well written that I had to reread it twice. The book was well written and the plot was a great one, although I didn't find it all that compelling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, especially since it is a book about the Catholic Church that is still relevant. The first half of the book describes the history of the Church from the time of the apostles through the present day, with an emphasis on the history from the Council of Trent. It is a good history, but it is not very easy to follow (especially if one is not Catholic), and the historical details can get a bit dry. However, I enjoyed it because it shows how the Church has evolved over time, how the Catholic Faith has evolved since the time it was written, and how it still has a lot to offer to those who desire to know more about their Faith.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself totally immersed in this book when I first picked it up.   It's such a great look into the mind of a man who was a very troubled person at a young age.  He has a lot of great stories to tell and he seems to have had a very difficult upbringing.  I can see that he had some struggles as a child, but there are times where you can tell he's trying very hard to grow up and move past his past.  The book is filled with a lot more personal and personal stories of his life and his personal life is very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really glad I bought this book.  It's an excellent introduction to the subject and one that I'll definitely be using.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of Dr. Phil, and I was pleased to find that he had just released a new book on the subject: "Seductive Science: The Power of Sex and the Brain".  I think he's the first to combine neuroscience with psychotherapy in a book, and he does a good job at combining the two.  This is a very helpful book that will help both men and women improve their sex lives and their brains. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is a very well written, entertaining book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written and interesting book on the history of the Church. It is not a history of Joseph Smith as such, but is about the Church in general. The author has done a good job of explaining some of the more obscure issues in the Church's history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very enjoyable read.  It is well written and has a good feel to it.  I also found that it is very informative, even though the book is geared towards a specific audience:  If you're an engineer, this is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading the book,  The Story of the First Christians    by Richard Carrier, for a while.   It has been very helpful to me in my research.  Carrier has done a very good job of showing the similarities between Jesus and Paul.  The similarities can be seen in the following passages:  1: "Paul...was the first to introduce the name Jesus Christ into the language of the Gentiles."  2: "Jesus...was a good teacher...was very much like Paul...in the sense that he used similar terminology."  3: "The most famous figure of the New Testament, Jesus of Nazareth, is the prototype for the future Christ of the first Christians."  4: "This is the first of the gospels to be written."   There are many other similarities between the two, but I think that is sufficient to establish a correlation between the authorship of the Gospels and the doctrine of Jesus.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am still in disbelief over this book. It's not the best book I've read but I'll take it over the crap by a pack of books any day.   The premise is that the world is full of horrible people who can't be helped by a good dose of religion.  The author is a religious believer who doesn't really want to believe but he just can't help it.  It's a very interesting way to look at the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read.  It was very well written and the writing style made it easy to follow.  The writing style is good for the time period and even good for today.  I especially liked the reference to how the word "crank" was used.  This book was very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing. I had a few questions about the origins of Christianity and about the nature of the faith, but I found the answers here to be perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a very skeptical about this book because it is so old, but the more I read the more impressed I was with it. The author's research was thorough, and I thought that the information was pretty sound. I am going to buy another copy for my collection, and if I ever need to read a historical novel about the Civil War, this one is probably the one I'll want to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am not a very technical person but    I enjoyed   this   book   very much 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent example of how to be a successful writer.   The book is full of interesting historical facts and anecdotes that help you learn how to write in a variety of ways.  I like that the book is very specific about what a good novel is:   First of all, the story must have a central theme that makes it interesting and compelling.  The novel must have something to do with a person's life.  It must have the feeling that there is a lot of time in between the events, and that it is a story that is coming to a climax.  Next, it must be entertaining.  No one should expect a novel to be anything but interesting.  Third, the novel must be clear and interesting. The novel should be clear in its purpose and have a clear and convincing plot.  Fourth, the plot must be well developed.  This is important.  If the plot is unclear, then it is not a good plot. The plot should be well established, and if it is poorly developed, then that is bad.  Finally, the author should write the best he can.  Most good writers know that they don't know everything, and they try to figure out what to do next.  In this book, the book starts off with an interesting plot that the author decides to write, but after a few chapters the plot goes from interesting to useless, and then back to interesting.  I can't recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good example of how good writing can be.  I had a hard time getting through the book, but then I remembered I had been going through a rough time in my life and started looking for some light.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that it's so much fun!  It is a very light and enjoyable read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this series for years. The series is really good and has been recommended by several friends as well as my own husband.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book.   It gives a good introduction to the topic.  I'm glad that it was written by someone who is knowledgeable about the topic and has made some good points.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been meaning to read the book of the same name by Robert Fagles, the author of the well known (for me) "The Little Prince," for a long time.   He is a great storyteller, who uses his own experiences as a child in the early 1900's as a lens to see the world as it was in the late 1960's and 1970's.  This book is a real tour de force of an author using the experiences of his own childhood to create a story that is not only entertaining but also a reminder that children are not always our best teachers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The reason I liked this book is that it is about a woman who has a very bad experience with a man. He's manipulative, manipulative. He does a lot of terrible things to other people, and he does them to her. She ends up with a broken body because of it, but she makes the most of her situation and is a wonderful, good person. She's an interesting character.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book about life and death, about hope and despair, about finding your way in a world that seems beyond redemption. It's a wonderful introduction to the concept of the afterlife, and to the importance of living a life worth living.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm just a few years into my journey with the New Testament, but I've already read this book so many times that I'm afraid to read it the first time. I have some interest in biblical studies, but as I read through this book, I can't help but feel like I'm learning a lot more about the historical context of the Gospels than I was expecting. It's good to know that a good scholar isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and do some research to see what's there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, like most of the others in the field, is an excellent book about the subject of UFOs.   It contains some excellent information about the phenomenon and about UFOlogy in general, but I do wish there were more UFO books that covered some of the more interesting and difficult aspects of the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of the "Rome" series by James S.A. Corey. I'm also a big Star Wars fan, and this book is excellent.  I've seen all three movies, and while I don't know if I'll ever get to see all three at the same time, this is a must have for fans of the franchise.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a real eye opener. I have always been a fan of fantasy books, but have never been able to get into any of the fantasy series written by Robert Jordan, such as Wheel of Time. I am so glad that I read this book. This book has a lot to offer for both fans of Robert Jordan and fans of fantasy in general. It will make a great read for both.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book about learning to play an instrument.   It is not just a story about learning a new instrument, but about the struggle of learning to make an instrument sound good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good introduction to a great subject, but it does have a lot of material that is best presented in a different way.   If you want to learn about quantum mechanics or relativity, this book is not for you.  It is for people who are interested in exploring the theory of everything, but who have never heard of the theory or the quantum mechanical model.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the book, especially when I learned about the role of energy in the theory. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book after a few years, but it is still very good. I really enjoy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.  It is a very good introduction to the history of American political philosophy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and well-written book about an interesting subject. I found it interesting that the author used the phrase "troubling" in the first paragraph. The reader could understand why it would bother a person, but the way she phrased it makes me question her judgment. I also found it surprising that she could make such a profound point about one person, and yet not say anything about the importance of family in general. I wish that she had taken the time to discuss the importance and relevance of family.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting look at a group of early twentieth-century American women's social movements and how they formed in response to an emerging feminist movement. The chapters cover the role of women in the abolition movement, the suffrage movement, labor organizing, and the temperance movement. They're well-researched and the examples given are interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at the end of my 3rd year of college and it completely blew my mind. I don't usually like historical novels because I don,t really care about history. I was blown away by how much the author really knew about the subject. This is probably the best historical novel I've read in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the history of the Jewish community in France, especially the early years. It is very good on all aspects of the community, especially its religious and cultural history, its development from the 17th century into the 19th, its role in the French Revolution, its rise to power in the mid-19th century, and its subsequent decline during the First World War and the Holocaust. It's also very good at telling the story of the French Jews. I can't say enough good things about this book: the quality of the writing, the historical background, the cultural information about the Jews and about the community that's been collected over the years (which is really important) and the interesting and detailed stories about the Jewish leaders. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I love that the author makes it a point to give the characters a sense of humor. It gives them a little bit of levity in the midst of some very serious things. The fact that this story is set in a military prison is also a good point: we know that the world they live in is full of horrors. They know that torture is not the answer, that killing is not a good answer, and that the only way to stop the bad guys is to find a way to keep the good guys safe. They are a little cynical about the whole thing, but they also have a lot of humor about it. The characters are all different, and it is a real pleasure to see them come together. I can't wait to see how this story goes forward.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book in a series by the prolific science fiction author William Gibson about a futuristic world where humans and cyborgs live in peace. The first book was a bit more difficult to get through than this one, but I found it to be a very enjoyable read.  Gibson's writing is very precise, precise about the human condition, and the plot is so well written that it almost seems like it's a work of fiction.  I have read quite a few books in this genre, and this is the best of them all.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading a lot of sci-fi for the last few years, and I've always found that most of the authors write about the future in a way that seems almost prescient. This book is one of those books that is completely believable, but also gives you a good dose of fear and uncertainty. I don't want to be alone in the future, but that's not the way the future will be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book,  The most wonderful part about this book was the amazing fact that I was able to read the original German version of this book.    It was so much fun and it brought me back to my old high school days. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was in the middle of a PhD and was very interested in the way we treat patients who have been ill for a long time. I was glad to find this book, as it is not at all a dry, academic discussion about medicine. Instead, the author gives an interesting and thought provoking look at the issues involved with such illnesses. The main theme of the book is that the medical community does a poor job at understanding the psychological impact of illness on patients. This is true in the treatment of cancer patients as well as the many illnesses that afflict the elderly. The author gives a great deal of information about the issues surrounding this problem and what the research says about it. In the end, he concludes that the research is not yet conclusive, but that the evidence suggests that some of the negative emotions caused by illness are actually a result of the patient's belief in a future with good health.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last half of this book is really quite good: it is an excellent study of the historical development of the idea of the State as a necessary instrument of social control.   This is an essential study for any student of American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. I have been a fan of the author's books for a long time now. This book is a good read and I recommend it to any fan of science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read that I was blown away by. The author does an excellent job of giving his characters personalities and their personal stories.  I loved the way that he used language to describe the various characters.  While I didn't find the story particularly profound, I really enjoyed reading it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've heard about this book before, and it's been my go-to for years, ever since I read it in middle school (my first book, and the first book I ever read).   The story has a lot of heart, and is one of those books that are perfect when you first read them (or in this case, read them again).  As someone who is very into reading, and enjoys stories, this is one I can keep on the shelf.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book a very useful and fun read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book as a Christmas present for my dad.  He loves reading.  I was surprised at how much he enjoyed it, and how much it reminded him of something he liked in his youth.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book because it was recommended by a good friend who used to live in Paris.    I was a bit apprehensive because I was so unfamiliar with this region.  However,   my friend did a great job of walking me around Paris and giving me some great tips about the city .  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first chapter is the best one I've ever read about how to deal with a boss. The author covers all the bases: not being an ass, knowing what your boss really wants from you, being nice, not getting all worked up when he's mad, not talking back, and being a team player. It's a great book, and a great reference. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a great time reading this book.   The plot and the characters were great.  The story was a great blend of science fiction and fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the history of modern China. I like that the book was written in the form of a diary rather than a history book, and that the author doesn't try to explain things too clearly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking for something like this for a long time. I'm very happy with the results!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not a bad book per se, but it's not good either.  There are so many bad things about it that it's impossible to keep my attention.  It's so badly written that even my own mistakes can't hide the fact that the author doesn't know what he is talking about.  The book is just too riddled with errors.  My favorite example is this: "A good writer has a way of making you think he knows what he's talking about, even when he doesn't."  This is a common mistake for a novice to make.  He is writing to an audience that is already used to the way a book should be written.  I have been doing this for many years now and have yet to have a good beginner's book.  This one just doesn't work.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    My daughter and I love this book! I'm amazed that she was able to pick up the book at all, let alone be able to read it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on the ancient world, but especially in its Greek and Roman period. It's one of the most readable books I've ever read on a subject of interest to me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good that I almost cried.  I'm going to give it to my daughter because she's in the library right now and wants to read it to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had heard about the book by others, but never bought it. I thought I had read about the same book in the same publication. This time I bought it and was happy with the result. The illustrations are superb. I liked the story and the characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book about sex ever written. It is a classic and it will continue to inspire generations of young adults and even their parents.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a revelation to me. I read the first book a long time ago, and had been wanting to read it again.   I'm glad I finally found a way to get it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book and recommend it highly to everyone! The authors are great and the illustrations are lovely.   It's so great that the book has so many good authors!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was hesitant to read this book as a child, but it was actually quite fun. The humor was funny. And the characters were really well drawn.  The story took a bit to get going, but once it did I had a lot of fun.  It was also interesting that there were different versions of the same people throughout the book.  I like that some characters are more like "human characters" and some more like cartoon characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  I am a history professor, and while my students are always interested in current affairs, the more current the better.  For this reason, I thought that the book would be interesting and informative.  The book is a good reference on current affairs and a good overview of the current situation in Afghanistan.  However, I wish the author had more information about Afghanistan and its politics.  It is easy to find information about these subjects online, but the book is written so well that I am sure it will take some time for me to figure it all out.  Overall, this is a book that will be a good resource for my students.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is wonderful!   It is a very detailed and in-depth look at how people perceive and treat women.   The author describes how women have historically been seen as less capable than men (which is obviously a very important issue), but also how we have come to understand the need for strong, independent women. She also looks at how this perception has been used against women who have attempted to break through stereotypes.  I have been thinking about this book a lot lately, and this is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how our society has come to be so sexist in the first place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the one that makes me decide to take a step back and look at my life in a different way.  It's a great read that I have been looking forward to for a while.  I'm glad I read it!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in the process of buying my first Kindle and was looking for something that I could read in the car. This book was exactly what I needed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I've read on the history of Christianity.   It has a lot of information and is well organized.  It is clear that this is a book written by a historian and not a preacher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a graduate student who spends most of my time on my computer.  I have read this book twice already and have enjoyed it.  This is a good first book on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was very good. I really enjoyed the idea of a very realistic and "realistic" science fiction novel about a young boy and his pet dog in a post-apocalyptic world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book a few years ago because I am a HUGE fan of the original series, and it looks like the third book in the series will be a good one too! The art is amazing, the writing is amazing. The characters are so well done and it was nice to see some of the older characters. It also seems like a lot of effort has gone into the story. I really hope the author will continue the series because I really enjoyed the first two books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, but it is only for the serious student who is looking to become a good writer. The book does give the reader some information about the process of writing, but does not go into a lot of detail about it. It is a good source of information to get the basics, but as a book it is not very helpful in giving you the ability to be a good editor or writer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been using the book "The Power of Now" for over a year now and I must say it has changed my life for the better. I'm a Christian, and in the beginning I struggled with this book.  This book helped me realize that God is in control and that he can change your life if you want to.  I also realized that he has a plan for all of us regardless of how we were raised.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful look at the early life of the greatest American scientist, Einstein.   I was introduced to the topic by my professor when he mentioned it in one of his courses.  Einstein had been a young, brilliant, and impulsive young man who had fallen in love with the woman of his dreams and been fired from his job to marry her.  In my opinion, this book is not only very insightful, but it is very funny too.  This book was a great read and a great laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of David Weber's books and have read them all over the years. I've had a hard time finding a good one to read lately but I finally found one that is just right.  This is one of my favorite books from the last few years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book about the development of the electronic media in the United States.   It is an invaluable work on the history of the early electronic media, and on the development and evolution of the Internet.  It is very good, and is an important book to have on hand.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book a lot more interesting than the book I have been looking for since it was first published. The author's take on the world of science fiction is very refreshing.   The writing is sharp and the book has a lot of good ideas about the ways that humans can be manipulated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was recently sent a copy of  The New Atheist: How a New Generation of Great Writers Is Redefining What It Means to Be Moral, by Sam Harris.    This book is very interesting in many ways.  The author, Sam Harris, is very well-read and very intelligent.  He is not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, he has a great deal of sympathy for religion.  However, the fact that he is an atheist is what sets him apart from the rest of the secular movement.  I find his approach to religion to be a good example of how religion can be taken in a positive direction.  This can be done without demonizing the religion or making it seem like a joke.  It is also very interesting to see a secularist who is able to take a lot of the criticisms of religion in a non-hateful way.  Sam Harris' book can be found at: http://www.amazon.com/New-Atheist-How-A-New-Generation-Great-Writers-/dp/0761168700/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488884096&sr=8-1
Write a positive review about a good book:    The world needs a better understanding of the difference between 'empathy' and 'compassion'.   This book by a well known psychologist provides a very useful guide to the difference.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  It's a quick read and really easy to understand.  The characters are well developed.  I found it interesting that the characters in the book are all from different walks of life.  They're all intelligent and are good at what they do, but have the common trait of being unable to deal with their parents.  This makes the characters a little more real. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I were lucky enough to meet this book author and his wife at a book signing in the store.   It was a very fun night, we had a good laugh about this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because of the description. This book contains very good descriptions of real world locations in a non-fiction style. The author is very descriptive and you get a good feeling of how the places are and what makes them special. It is a good read and it would be good to read more about some of these places.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent source for a detailed discussion of the many different types of security measures that were available at the time. The authors make it clear that the security of these devices, both as physical barriers and as methods of preventing unauthorized access, was highly variable.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of all the fantasy authors.  This one was a joy to read.  I've never seen the movie but I'm glad I did.  The characters are well drawn and the action is very good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent history of the United States. The author does an excellent job of looking at the political and social events of the early days of the country.  The events of 1837 are especially fascinating as they show the early development of the idea of American sovereignty and what it means to the people of this country. The book is well written and very well-written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I wanted when I was a kid.  It was a tough book to read, but it made me realize the importance of love and friendship.  The author wrote a nice review: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I wanted to read a good fantasy novel. It's about a young warrior and his companion, a beautiful woman. I'm not a huge fan of fantasy, but this is a good one.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great read. It really helped me with the understanding of the "others" in my family.   It helped me to be able to see them in a different light than I did before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that I found out about from another author in the last two weeks. This is a good and informative book. I have always been very skeptical about the claims of astrology, but this book made me look at it a little more critically.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not a big fan of young adult fiction (I prefer middle grade) but I really liked this book!  It's set in the 60's during a time of racial unrest, and the main character is an older woman who doesn't know what to do with her life.  It really brought up my old memories of going to summer camps with my family.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished a great book on "The American Experience" by William G. Bowen. Bowen's book is a great primer on the American experience, and he has done a wonderful job of giving the reader a broad perspective on the events, people, and events that shaped the nation. It will serve as a great text book on the subject for college and high school students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. The writing is well-written, the topic is interesting and the historical facts are well-supported. It's a must read for anyone who is interested in the period.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about how to get over your ex-boyfriend 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very good. I'm a bit of a nerd, so I enjoy reading about stuff that fascinates me.   It's a bit dry, but that's fine with me. I like the story of how a guy got an idea to use his computer to play some games, but he also liked the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the "modern" way of thinking about the Bible. I found it very well written, though I do not agree with everything the author says, nor do I agree with the conclusions he reaches. I am a biblical scholar who, like many others, is troubled by the recent rise of "biblical studies" in American higher education. I find the "debate" on this subject to be so ridiculous that I feel compelled to write a book to counter it. I hope you find it useful.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of Stephen King. I'm even a huge King fan in real life.   King is a writer I've always wanted to read.  This book is perfect for anyone who loves a good mystery/thriller/horror story.  I love the writing style.  It is so much fun to look back on all of King's previous books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a college student, as I was not good at science.   The main problem with this book is that he goes over the facts about what a black hole is, and he says they are the same as what a neutron is, but they are not.  It is just a bad analogy, he just went through a few steps to explain it to me and it was just so long. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just started reading this book. It's so interesting and so well researched and so thought provoking that I feel I'm missing out on something amazing by not reading it sooner.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, although I have been having a hard time following along.   It has been interesting for me to follow the different "types" of people, how they see the world, and how they behave.  This book is about a person who, although he is a very successful businessman, is very insecure about his personal image.  He is also very judgmental about people who do not conform to his standards.  For example, he is extremely critical of a businesswoman who dresses like a man.  However, when he was invited to lunch with her, he immediately warmed up to her.  So it appears that he can change his opinion about people by his own actions.  The author, Richard Bachman, has written several books that cover a variety of topics.  I think this one will be interesting for those who are interested in personal relationships.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good basic introduction to modern philosophy. It explains what philosophy is about, why it's good, and some of the main philosophical figures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed this book.  It's a very good, informative, and well-researched book that is written in a way that is easy to understand and that is definitely enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great introduction to the subject.  This book will be useful for both the beginning student of philosophy and the professional philosopher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book.   It tells the story of how the American Civil War came to be fought.  It has a lot of historical facts and figures that I can relate to, and it's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think the most important thing about the book is that it doesn't treat the reader like a child. The book tells a story about a family who was on a vacation in France in the late 1930's. The son is obsessed with books, but his father has no interest in reading or writing. He is a very intelligent man who has been in the Air Force for a long time and has seen everything. The author doesn't just leave it at that - he makes it very clear that this isn't normal. His father was in the military for many years and didn't like to be away from his family. He's not a writer, he has no talent at all, and he is very lonely. In fact, he is so lonely that he is always trying to find the person who is most important to him, and that person always ends up being his father.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very excited to find this book about the history of the English-speaking peoples of Europe.  It covers the history and culture of the peoples of England, France, Germany, Russia, and Poland.  The book was a little short, but I had to reread parts several times.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. I like the way it looks on the shelf and the little extras that come with it. It's a very nice book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written. The subject matter is very interesting. I think the book should be required reading in all high school and college physics courses.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been waiting a long time to read this book.   The concept of a vampire is interesting, but I have found that the actual stories tend to fall flat in comparison.  This book is an interesting concept. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought the book because I thought it would be interesting to know about how a woman from rural Oklahoma managed to become the most powerful woman in the world.   The book is a good read and does a good job of showing what was going on in the early 80s when she took over. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a good read, even though I am not a historian. The book is very well written and informative. It provides a good overview of the Holocaust as a whole, including the fact that most of the Jewish people who were murdered during the Holocaust were killed by the Nazis as the result of anti-Semitic propaganda. I do not feel that it was necessary to include the following quote from a Jewish journalist: "It was the most terrible time in my life and my only regret is that I had never been to a Nazi demonstration." This is very unfortunate as this quote does not fit the reality of what happened during the war and it is quite possible that the writer of the quote does in fact have a good point.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got the book to read as part of a group assignment about the Vietnam War. This was a good idea as the book is extremely well researched. The story is good and the photos are very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book on the history of the Roman Catholic church in America. It is written in a clear and readable manner.   It is interesting and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading a lot of "how to" books recently and was really surprised by this one.  It's not like a "how do" book that just tells you to do something and expects you to know how to do it.  Instead, this is a practical guide to doing things well.  The first thing you learn is how to make a good meal.  Then you get into the practical details of what to do with the meat and how much to eat and how to cut up the vegetables.  In short, this book is all about how to take care of yourself so you don't need a cookbook.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has great pictures. I have taken it for use in my office and had the most fun working on it. I am working on a number of the same types of figures and have been quite pleased with the results.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a lot of fun reading this. It was great to get a look inside my little sister's head. It's like a peek into her world, which is a very positive one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not only an excellent book on the history of the modernist movement but a brilliant critique of the liberal-left ideology of "progressivism" and the "moralistic left". It shows the hypocrisy and sheer intellectual dishonesty of this current of liberalism in all its forms. The authors of this book were the most original thinkers on the American left at the time, and they were able to articulate a critique of modernism that is still relevant today. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history and politics of modern art.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. The author is a good writer and has a good story.  It's not a big mystery but is a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading about the history of the US Navy for over 20 years now. This book is a comprehensive and very accurate history of every single ship the Navy has ever built. If you are interested in a military history of any type, this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a big fan of chick lit, but this one was a lot of fun. The characters are so colorful, and the prose is very easy on the eyes. If you like chick lit or romance, this is a great choice.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great and it's a good way to get a good overview of what a programming language is. It's very easy to follow and it covers a lot of ground.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I have read in years. The author is a brilliant and very experienced writer, and his prose is superb. He has the same clarity of thought and ability to describe what he is describing that I have always found in the best prose I have ever read.   This is a very well-written book, one that I will keep in my mind and heart for a very long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been over three years since I've read a good science fiction book, but this is one of the best. I was very excited about this because I've been a big fan of Arthur C. Clarke's stuff for a long time.   This book is the latest in his series of "Utopia" novels, which is a series about a world that is run by a supercomputer.  The book is pretty much a science fiction version of "2001: A Space Odyssey," but with an added element of religion.  I'm not sure that it works as well as "2001," but it is fun nonetheless. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. I like how it deals with the issues that plague modern men.  The book is written in the third person, but the author writes about his own experience in the first person, so the reader knows how he feels about the issue.  It's interesting to hear him talk about it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the information in this book to be extremely useful in my research.  This book has the answers I need and will give me confidence in my conclusions.  It's just that the book does not provide the answers that I seek.  The author also fails to address the question of why the author's "experts" are so wrong.  I'm a physicist, not a theologian, and my opinion on this subject is as follows:   I am a believer in evolution, and this book has me convinced that I have been looking in the wrong place.  However, I don't believe that the scientific method can provide an answer to any scientific question.   If you want to know the origin of life, this is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read and enjoyed the previous books in the trilogy by this author. This is another excellent book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing about this book is the story.   It's just so simple and powerful, it's like watching a story unfold.  I think that's why it resonates so much with people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic: very readable and well-written.    It is a must read for any student who wants to study a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book about a great author. I'm a fan of David Foster Wallace. His short stories are my favorites of the past decade. I've read most of his novels, too, but this one was different. I loved the idea of a self-help book, and this one is not only that, but also very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the information in this book to be very useful in understanding my husband's condition. He had some severe neurological problems, so I was very interested in this particular book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so informative and a great read. I love the concept of creating an image of a person and then building it from their voice. I'm always trying to get my own voice back, but with voice coaches, I have to spend hours working on my own speech. This book really helped me find the voice I have now.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I don't normally like the way that young people are written as if they were grownups (usually the male authors), but I thought that the author's portrayal of his friend was realistic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of this book. I bought it for my husband. He loves history and books, and he was excited to read about this important event in American history. I was a bit worried that he wouldn't like it because it was about the War of 1812. But, after reading it, he loved it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book by Mark O'Connell on the subject of political corruption in the state of Pennsylvania.  O'Reilly is a fine reporter, and it's a shame that he has had such difficulty with this subject.  This book does a good job of describing the power that is wielded by the political machine in Pennsylvania.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing and is a great addition to anyone's collection.  The first thing that I did when I read it was to search for all the other books that I have read about the Beatles, and was disappointed that none of them mentioned Paul McCartney as a musician, but that didn't stop me from reading this book.  McCartney was an incredible singer, and even more so a great musician. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of books on various topics and I think this is one of the best so far. I learned a lot from it, and will be looking for more books like this in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the impact of "fringe" movements on American history. The book covers all of the major movements from the early 19th century on (including the abolitionist movement) and their impact on American politics and culture.  The author's introduction, by Professor William A. Gass, is well-written and the book is a valuable reference for anyone who wants to learn about the major forces that shaped our society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting book about the history of the American Revolution. I enjoyed it and learned a lot about the people who made the revolution happen.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so informative about the importance of good nutrition. It is also really fun and informative.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book for a child with an autism spectrum disorder. It is a very comprehensive book that covers everything a child on the spectrum needs to know about everyday things. It teaches him basic skills such as reading and writing, using a computer, and basic math skills. The book is also very good about building his social skills and communication.    It is not too late for this book to be included in every child's library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a very interesting subject. I enjoyed reading it as much as any book I've ever read about the paranormal.  The story is well told, the information is detailed, and the conclusions are well supported. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My kids enjoyed this book very much! They loved the fact that it was based on a real book (A Christmas Carol) and they thought the author was very good at describing the characters and scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of books deal with how men treat women and how it affects us. This book is the first to discuss how men who do not want to be treated as a woman treat women. I am a feminist, but I think this book will have a positive effect on the men who read it and may consider themselves feminists.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never read anything by Thomas S. Kuhn before, but when I came across this book in the library, I knew I had to read it! It's not my favorite book of all time (I'm sure it's not yours either!), but it's so well-written, well-researched, and so entertaining that I've come to appreciate it as much as I appreciate a good novel. If you haven't already, check it out!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book that provides some much-needed information about how to be a good cook.  I've been a cook since I was a child, and I've seen so many bad recipes and poor cooking techniques over the years that I never thought to look into what actually goes into them.  Now, after reading this book, I've learned that the best way to do something is to start at the very beginning.    I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about the basics of how to cook good food. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book before I started going to therapy.    The author talks about how he started going and how he felt       it helped him to see himself in a different light  .   I found myself feeling better about myself and my life after I stopped going. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think it's an amazing book about the importance of learning to think for yourself. I have a bad case of mental illness. The idea that we are all flawed and the best we can do is make ourselves better is absolutely true. The way this book helped me deal with it is great.  I feel like my mind is working better now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not sure what my response to this book is, but I don't want to be wrong. I bought this book because I had heard about it from some other author. I'm glad I read it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, very well written book about how people react to other people. It's about the things that we see all the time in our day to day lives. It is about what we tend to do in the face of conflict. And it is about our own responses.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good introduction to the subject of the evolution of life, including how we got to the present day. It also has a few good points about the history of scientific inquiry in general and evolutionary theory in particular. It's also worth noting that this book does not give a one-sided view of evolution, as many of the popular and highly cited books do. It does show that there are a few interesting gaps in the story, and that scientists still have much to learn.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I've read on how to create a high-quality document. It has a lot of good information about how to properly layout and format your information, and how to design an effective bibliography.   I think that if you've never done it before, it will be a lot easier for you to do than if you're used to using Microsoft Word or something like that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent and very good primer on the basics of game theory and decision theory. It is a short but well written introduction to these two disciplines.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The second edition is much better. The first edition is a good primer, but a little heavy on theory. This one is more like a handbook to being a good writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a huge help for me in learning to use the computer, to understand how computers work, and to understand computers more generally.    The book is well-organized and easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written, but it is not very good. The stories are good, but the characters are very flat. I wish they had made the characters more human instead of just having them in situations that seem like they were made up just for the story. I like how they used a real newspaper to write about the real world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book that is written in a very straightforward, but interesting way.  It is a good read and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of fantasy literature.  I love the idea of "immortality" in a fantasy world.  My only problem is that in my experience, most fantasy worlds don't live up to the hype.  It took me a while to get over my dislike of The Prince of Thorns, but I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.  The characters were so well developed that I couldn't help but love them all.  This was a fun, fast read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I like reading about people's struggles. I have a friend who has had her own difficulties. I would be interested in hearing more about it, since she is doing great now.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best reference book for anyone looking to get into the history of American law and economics. It is the most detailed and interesting presentation of the subject I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a fan of all of George R. R. Martin's works (except for A Game of Thrones, which is pretty bad) and this is no exception. The only criticism I can give it is that I wish the characters were a bit more likable (which they're not, by the way). However, I do think it is a very good read and very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book to read with my grandson and loved it   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about the most bizarre part of a relationship: the sex. The sex is actually quite good, even for a first time attempt at sex. There's some really interesting stuff about sexuality and the way humans can interpret sexual messages. The author is a bit of a sleaze, but the book is fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been trying to get my head around the concept of "parallelism" in writing for a while, but I am so much better at it now. I love that it's not about me but about someone else who was inspired by me.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of James Rollins' The War Against the Weak.  Rollins has done a fantastic job in writing a gripping and compelling account of a terrible time in American history, from the end of the Civil War to the rise of Hitler.  The book is a great read, even if it is a little long.  It will probably appeal to many fans of WWII history and World War I, as well as to those interested in how a relatively small country was able to dominate the world during that time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have loved reading this book for years, and I am still trying to get through it.    This is one of the most important books I have read in a long time.  It is the history of the development of the US space program, the development in particular of the Space Shuttle and Orion.  While there is a lot of history in the book, I was struck by the discussion of the early days of the space program.    This is a book that is very readable, and while there is some historical information, the authors are careful to separate the historical from the factual.  In particular, the early development of spaceflight was not the result of a single, visionary figure.  Rather, the first space efforts were the result not of a visionary effort but rather of a series of small, incremental steps, each of which would eventually lead to a more sophisticated space program that would allow humans to go beyond low earth orbit.  This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in spaceflight history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. It is a history of the early days of the Church, but it is not just a history. It includes some interesting things about Joseph Smith's early years, including a brief biography of Joseph Smith that I have not seen before.  I think that this book will be helpful to anyone who is interested in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very impressed with this book. I have never had much luck with fiction, but I have read a number of books that I thought were well written and/or interesting but didn't work for me. This one surprised me. The writing is quite good, the plot is interesting, and the characters were interesting enough to be worth spending some time with. I've never read a book like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was just looking for something similar to the books I have on my Kindle. This book is a wonderful amalgamation of both. A book to read over and over again. I really hope that it will come out in paperback so I can buy it again!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book.  It was a lot easier to read than I thought it would be.  As a science fiction writer I am always a bit intimidated by these kinds of books, but this one was very easy to read.  And it really did give me a better idea of what my next novel will be about.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read for those who want to know more about what is happening in the world and in our own back yard. The information is not new, but it is presented in a way that is easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of this book is interesting and the information is accurate.  This book gives a good insight on the life of a soldier who served in the first World War.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really excited about this book.  I wanted to give it five stars, but the reason is that it's not perfect.  There were a couple of times when I was disappointed.  This is my second review, so maybe it will be different.   This book is about a little boy named John who, after a long day of work, decides to go play in a park.  John's older sister is in a wheelchair and he's the only person around who doesn't seem to be taking care of her.  In fact, he's not very good at taking care.  So when he sees this wheelchair, he decides to help.  He goes around and around the chair until it finally breaks.  Then he just leaves it behind.  The rest of the book is John getting angry at himself for not taking care, so he decides he's going to change that.  It's kind of hard to put into words what that feels like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a bad guy. I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting to see the different perspectives that the author took on a character he was obviously in love with. This book was a bit of a slog at times, but I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had to read the whole book to be able to understand this book's meaning, but I was really glad I did! The title says it all: a short book about the history of a group of people from the Middle Ages who were thought to be cursed by a demon and who were called the Devil's Children. This story has a happy ending, however. As I read the book, I realized that I, too, had been called the devil's child! The devil's children had been considered cursed since the Middle Age, but it was only after they were exposed to modern science that they became known as the Devil Children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love these stories about women who go to great lengths to please men and not be judged. The author has a very funny, down to earth way of writing these stories.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic read.  It is very thorough and very clear.  I can see a lot of value and why this is important.  As a result, I plan to use this book a lot more than I planned to use the "The Ten Commandments" series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say that I enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoyed the TV show.   It was funny, fast paced, and very easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent in so many ways. It is very well written, and it is full of information about the Bible.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read. The information given about the subject matter is excellent. The author did a good job explaining the science behind it. He did a really good job of making the science clear.  I think he did a pretty good job at keeping the science as simple as possible.  This is not the kind of book you would read at a science fair.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book about three years ago and I loved it. It's not a bad book per se but I was glad that it came out on a new edition. I'm sure that the new edition will improve the quality of the writing, and the book's value will be lessened.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book.   The author uses a lot of personal stories to relate the events of a person's life to the war.  It makes the reader realize that many of the events are not just random happenings.  This is very helpful for people who are struggling with depression. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book by reading reviews of the other two books by the same author. This one seemed to me to be more realistic about the effects of brain injury and death than the other books I have read. The narrator is a very good narrator: not very good at telling the story, but very good when he is doing it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the few books on the subject of the Holocaust that has a solid foundation of facts. It is written in a very clear and simple way, but also with the appropriate level of technical detail for an advanced discussion of the subject. The author's use of the term "Holocaust deniers" is also appropriate and accurate, although I would add that the term is somewhat pejorative. I have not been able to find an exact definition of the concept, but it can be fairly easily defined as the denial of the Nazi genocide of the Jews. There are other, less obviously hateful terms used to describe people who deny the Holocaust, such as Holocaust deniers, Holocaust denier, Holocaust denialists, Holocaust apologists, etc. This book is the first to attempt to provide a coherent explanation of the differences between these groups and their positions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read "The Blacker the Berry" before. I found it to be a very interesting and informative look into the early history of slavery in the American South. The author was able to pull together a very compelling set of facts about the slave trade, the Civil War, and Reconstruction that have a lot of historical value.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad I discovered this book when I did. It's an amazing collection of stories from all over the world about people who are just like us. The book is so good, that it's hard to pick one. The stories are fascinating and make you feel the world a little differently.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the story of the birth of the "King of the Jews."  It is an interesting story, and it is well written.  The story is told from both the point of view of the Jewish community, and that of the non-Jewish ones who lived in Jerusalem.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great way to teach a group about the importance of making informed decisions. It does so in a way that is fun to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to read as a prequel to the book "Boom! The Story of Stuff". This book has more stories about the early days of the modern computer revolution, but it's less about computers as computers. Rather, it's about how things went from computers as "magic machines" to computers as tools for the rest of us. It's about people making computers, and the people who bought into it and made it a huge success. It is a good, interesting read, but more about the times than the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an important introduction to quantum physics and the philosophy of quantum mechanics, the two central ideas that inform quantum theory.  This is one of the best introductions to quantum theory I've seen.  It's well-organized, concise, and thorough.  The book has been well-researched and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a solid introduction to the philosophy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read! I found the book on the internet after having read all the other reviews, and I thought it was a good read. I agree with one reviewer that the subject matter is very dry, but I found that it had its moments as well. I enjoyed the story of a young boy's search for his lost brother. I'm glad the author included a list of things to bring to a funeral, as I don't know anyone who would bring a book!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It is very detailed and informative.  It is good to have the real life examples from the people who did the research that we all need to know.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I am in love with all the people, places and things in it, and the way they are written about in the book is wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book with good ideas that I hope to use.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the kind of book I look forward to reading each year. I find the stories, from both the good and the bad, interesting and I find myself thinking of this book a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, and I can't wait to see the second half of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful read. I liked it so much I bought a second edition.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, well-researched and well-written book about the history of American race relations, written by a person who knows all about them.    She's a historian who has spent a great deal of time in both the African and the American camps, so her analysis is accurate and insightful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent. I love the fact that the book is not only a history of American slavery but also a history on how blacks have been treated throughout history. The way in which the author covers all these topics and uses them to make the point that racism is alive and well is extremely impressive.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a book about a family of vampires. They had a problem: a boy, his mother, and their father had died of vampire bites.   The father's body was put in a box, and the mother buried in the backyard.  They kept their house to be a vampire castle.  It is a very interesting book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read and very interesting. I've been looking for the last two years for a good English translation of a book by the great Spanish philosopher Fray Borja (his book was originally published in Spain in 1969). I found the translation by David Friesen. The book is written as a dialogue between Fray and Fray. There are a few amusing remarks by Fray, but the most interesting thing is that Fray actually agrees with Fray about his views and Frayed is impressed by Frayed's clarity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to some of the more difficult concepts in cognitive science.  It is a good intro to what cognitive science is, how it is done, and some of its current status in science. The author covers a lot of ground, from the basics of what is known about cognitive science to some advanced topics like how to design and measure cognitive tasks.  If you are interested in what cognitive scientists have been working on for a while, this is a must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought the Kindle edition of this book for my son for his birthday. I thought I had been pretty lucky with my books, but when he was born he was a perfect match, so I thought it was worth the extra $5. I was pleasantly surprised that I had to pay for the Kindle version (though my son liked the book just fine on paper).
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, filled with fascinating and thought provoking insights. It will be essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the world in which we live and the political forces that shape it.  I am very glad that this book was written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic guide to being a good listener. It is filled with examples of good listeners who will put you first.  It's a good guide to a skill that can help you make a great first impression on people: listening.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an interesting, if somewhat simplistic, look at how the military and the military industrial complex is changing and influencing the way that the military uses its power. The military is no longer "the greatest force for good in the world."  It has become a very large and powerful industry that, while having some noble aims, is increasingly becoming a force for evil.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very well written and it's good to know I can have a good, well written book and not be overwhelmed by it.   I had never been much of a history buff, but this book is well researched and gives a good description of how the U.S. government became the most powerful in the world.  It is the only book I have read that makes the U S. government a good example of how a government can change from bad to good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is good! A good introduction to the subject.  It should be required reading for all teachers, parents, students and anyone else who is interested in learning more about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative and well-written book about the creation of a new kind of music. I have been a huge fan of jazz music for many years, and I have always been puzzled by the way different jazz musicians use different styles of playing. There are different ways to play solos in different kinds of music, but it never seemed to me to be the reason why a given musician could do well at one thing and fail at another. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that, after a long period of experimentation with new and different styles, I could hear a new, more "musical" style in a few jazz players. I am still not completely comfortable with all the jazz techniques I learned, but I'm learning more every day. This book has helped me to see some of the reasons why different jazz players succeed in certain styles of music at different times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the great, and the good, and how they come to be. It's interesting that the first people to use the term "cult" (and the first to make that term popular) were the Scientologists. The "cult of personality" has been in use since at least the 18th century and the first modern sociologist to use it was an old-school 19th-century Englishman, William James.  I'm sure there's a reason that people who live in a world of "ideas" have such difficulty accepting them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to get a sense of what is going on in the world of electronic communications, and also how it is being used by criminals and terrorists:  It is the most thorough and detailed look I have seen at the world's biggest telecommunications companies.  As a result, it is very likely to help anyone looking into the world-wide security problems associated with the ubiquitous digital devices in our lives.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the history of American immigration.    It is clear that it is based on a lot of work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a bit of a nerd, but not a snob, and I love the fact that there are so many books out there that have the same ideas as The Great Gatsby.   It's one of those books that I'm reading again, because the ideas are interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book on the "Library" shelf at my local library, which has quite a few "for adults only" books in the children's section. The "for grown-ups only" part was not a problem for me. I had a lot of fun reading this book, and my son did as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been interested in the subject of the evolution of languages for some time, but this book is the first to cover it in a comprehensive way.   The book begins with a brief introduction to the topic.  It then covers the major evolutionary transitions from one language to another.  The discussion also covers some aspects of the theory of language evolution that I hadn't considered.  These include: 1. What is language? 2. What are the most recent evolutionary transitions? 3. Why does language exist in the first place?   This is a very good book for those who want to understand how languages work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was never a fan of the original Star Trek TV series. But I was really enjoying the new Star Trek movie.  It's pretty close to the original, but not as cheesy.  I liked the ending, too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am now a graduate student in political science, and have read a lot of political science books. This book is a good read, and I found myself having to reread sections several times to get my head around it.  It is also a good intro to the field, and an important book in my political science collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am currently working on a book about how to be an adult. It is a very useful book for those who are struggling with issues that they were raised to believe are unacceptable or undesirable. It makes me feel less alone in my thoughts about my parents, my relationship with my mother and the ways in which I have been hurt by my parents.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm an adult, and a bit of an introvert. This book really hit the nail on the head for me. It really helped me understand that there are many reasons why you may not want to go to a conference: 1. You're not sure if you'll like it 2. You've heard great things about it, but have not yet made up your mind 3. It's a bit too far away from home (not the end of the world) 4. It may be boring or you just don't want to leave your friends.  This book gives you reasons why not to go, but also helps you come up with alternative options.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of this book.  This is the second time I've read it, and I think the best one yet.  It's so well-written, and it really makes you want to read more.  The story is a really good one.  I especially liked the part about the woman who was raised by wolves but eventually came to believe that they were really human beings. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book for learning how to cook, but I don't know how many of the recipes are good for you!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that can make you question everything you know about the world, and the history books that you've been exposed to over the years.  It's fascinating, well-researched, and quite humorous.  I'm glad I finally got around to reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book I have purchased from Lulu.  My first purchase was for a short story by the same author.  I read it last year and thought it was very good, but I've since found that I really enjoyed the sequel.  The main character is a young woman who is trying to balance a very busy and stressful life with her faith and the duties of her job.  There is an element of romance that plays in the book, but it is handled with wisdom and a level of dignity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very helpful and insightful. I have never read a book that made me ask so many questions about such a wide variety of subjects.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that you just have to read, or even re-read, in order to understand it. I remember when I first read this, I thought it was a really bad book. I read it in my youth and remember being quite disappointed with it. It was also the first book that really got me thinking about sex in a sexual way, and I just loved it. Now, I'm an adult and I've got a wife, but I still read this book whenever I get the urge.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've never read a book that I liked better than this one. The stories are real and the characters are interesting and real.  This book is an entertaining and enjoyable read for all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. The author is quite well read, very engaging, and has a great command of the material. He is a man with a strong point of view, and this book is a fine example of that. The story is quite good as well, as are the illustrations.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a solid analysis of a topic in a readable way.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the idea of the story, I just don't like how it's executed. The plot is good, but the execution is so terrible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book   It's a good read   For the record, I'm an atheist  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book while I was at work. I don't usually read fiction, but this book really struck a cord with me.   This book is full of humor and is very well written.  I love the way she describes the way the characters talk about their problems.  It makes me feel bad for them and they get some much needed laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent and well written book that will serve you well for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the effects of environmental degradation on agriculture. It shows how the increased use of chemical pesticides and fungicides over the past half century has had a devastating effect on the quality of our food supply. This book also explains why we need to be concerned about the future of our environment as well as the quality and quantity of our daily food.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was recently introduced to this book by a friend and have enjoyed it immensely.   The characters are well developed and the action exciting.  The writing is very clean and the illustrations very well done.  This is a very good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love these books.  It's funny to see them in this form.   One day I may actually write my own book about them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most beautiful, well written and thought out novels I've read.  It's very intelligent, very well researched and well written.  The author is a professional who does not use bad writing techniques to make his point.  There is nothing that is contrived or poorly constructed about this book.   I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this for a couple of years now and it is by far my favorite of the series.  It's got a good blend of humor and horror.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book in a trilogy by the great science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was published in 1968. Heinleins story of a future earth was very well done. The characters were well done, and the plot was intriguing. I think this is the best book Heinlein has ever written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good story and a good look at a woman's life and how she coped with her husband's alcoholism.    She's a nice woman and it's great to see her get to know someone who could care about her so much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that the authors are so open about the research that goes into their work.  In this book, there are many good ideas presented, but they are often not taken seriously.  They are also very poorly presented.  I can understand why it is important to get the science right, but in my experience it is often more important to communicate with the public in a way that makes sense.  The author of this book seems to think that this is not the case. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I have ever read about the world of politics and foreign policy. The book is very well written, well researched and well organized.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  It was a very good book and I'm not going to get bored reading it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and science fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on the history of American political campaigns. The book has a lot of historical information about the campaigns of 1896 and 2000.   It also includes many illustrations and is very readable.  I am glad that the author has added a very interesting chapter on the "Greenbacks" and their impact on American politics.  This chapter will be very interesting to historians and politicians alike.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. It was interesting, and there were a few points that I could relate to. The best part was the discussion about the value of having a dog as a companion.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. It has the power to make anyone who is struggling to live a good life feel like a winner. It's the story of a young woman who is about to enter the professional world, but who has always had trouble staying motivated and going after what she wants.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read and enjoyed all of the books by Robert A. Heinlein, and especially this one.   Heinlein is a master of the science fiction genre.  The plot is complex and the characters are interesting.  As with the previous Heinlein books, the narration is excellent.  My only criticism is that it would be nice to see a movie adaptation of it (especially if the story had been changed to focus on the man instead of the robots).  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very helpful. The information was presented in a clear and understandable manner. It helped me understand what is meant by the term "non-toxic" in relation to the human body. I'm glad I found this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book to be interesting, and as the subtitle says "A History of the United States." It is very well written, and covers a lot of important historical topics. The history of the U.S. is a complicated one. I like the book's explanation of the "new republic" in the U S. The last few years have been very interesting to me, and this book gives me a good idea of what has been happening. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the study of linguistics. It is a good example of a popular book that has a great impact on the field and is a useful guide for all readers. The text is clear, clear, and clear. The author presents a wealth of useful information in a succinct way that is easy to read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book. The author provides a very clear and succinct summary of the key points of each of the three stages of the process. I can easily use this book to learn from my mistakes and to gain confidence in my approach.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I heard about the "Troubled Waters" series, I thought they were going to be about the relationship between a boy and a girl. I was wrong, however. The story takes place in the middle of a forest. The characters were drawn very well and the setting was beautiful. It was also very funny. The plot was a bit predictable at first, but the characters were very likable.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a lot of horror, but this book had me in a good way.   The ending was a bit of a cliffhanger but the beginning was just as good.  I was expecting a lot more violence and a bad ending, but all I got was a very cool story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after it was written and thought it was so good that I bought a copy and have been using it in class.  I have been a huge fan of the Harry Potter books for many years, so I was really excited when I saw a book by J. K. Rowling about the characters I've been reading about for years.  There are so many wonderful characters and they all have great personalities.  They are just like real people.  The author makes you feel like you're in their shoes.  In a world where all the characters are so perfect, it's nice to know there are people like that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has really opened my eyes to the way in which many people, especially in the entertainment industry, think about sexuality and gender. It's easy to look at the sexual choices of the stars in our culture and think that this is how all of them think about sex, but I don't think so.  In the book, a couple of stars talk about how they don't date actors or actresses, and then why they don' t date other women in the industry.  They point out that many of their friends are actors or actors' friends and that they think that they're the only ones who can handle being so close to a star, and the stars don't understand why this is such a problem.  This is very important, as the star may have been in a film that he or she hated, and it was the star's way of getting back at the person who made the film.  I think that a lot of people, when they feel that they can't get close to an actor, they go to the stars, or the people that they know are close to the star.  It's hard to say that the people who get close, and those who stay friends, are actually those who can best handle the relationship, but it's good to realize that this isn't the only way that people might react to their relationship with an actor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The Last Jedi  is an excellent book on the history of Star Wars.   It is the most complete account of the movies so far, in my opinion."
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second edition of this book is a good one. The first edition has been replaced with a new hardcover edition by the author, and is now dated. The author also has added several new chapters to this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author writes a great overview of the various ways the US government has used the law to spy on its citizens.   The book covers the history of the law and it's origins, including the founding fathers and the various statutes that have been passed over the years to create the system.  The authors point out that all of these laws are designed to provide the government with power to spy and that the law is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be free.  It's very clear that the author understands the nature of the problem and is writing a book that is aimed at bringing about a change in the law.  He seems to be aware that the surveillance laws he discusses are not good laws, but he is also aware that these laws do provide the power that he discusses.  I found this book to be a useful resource, especially for those interested in the history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited to start reading this book because I've been meaning to read about the rise of the first trans-black female in the military (and the second, a woman who was also a soldier) for years. It's a well written book about a woman in the middle of her career in a male dominated field, and the obstacles she overcame to achieve her goals. This is the kind of book that has a positive impact in a positive way: it's a reminder that people can do amazing things despite the odds against them, and that they can accomplish more when they're given the opportunity.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that's better than the sum of its parts. It's funny, it's smart, it has some great moral insights, and it even has a good dose of philosophy in there as well.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite historical books ever. I was a history major in college, and I loved every one of the Civil War books I read (this one included).  This one, however, has the most interesting writing in the whole series (and one of best historical writing ever).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent introduction to the field.   It covers the basics of how to use the data in the literature in a way that is both informative and entertaining.  I can see why there are so many new graduate students in the field these days. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really happy to find a new book that took me through my whole process in a way that had never been done before.   It's about two people who go through the whole process, and their relationship has changed a lot as a result.  It has given me more insight into my own relationship as well as other relationships. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading a lot of "How To Be a Man" lately. This book helped me a lot. I was not always a good man and this book helped to improve that aspect of my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been looking forward to reading this book for a long time now. It was just a year ago that I started reading the whole series after I discovered a copy in a thrift shop. I've loved the whole trilogy so far.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It's a good read and the ideas are good.  The characters are believable.  They don't have to be super smart to have a good story, but they have to make a good point.  I also like the way they have the characters change their views as the story progresses.  This is a good way to do this.  If you are a fan of the Twilight series, this one is worth a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a lifelong fan of the Harry Potter series. While I've always enjoyed the books, it took me a while to get around to reading the series in their entirety. The book is an excellent introduction to the series and will definitely make a nice addition to my library.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very informative and thought provoking book on what it means to be a good Christian woman. It is a great read about how we as women can be called to be the best that we can be.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on a fascinating subject. It has been difficult for me to get a grasp on the concepts involved in "the Great Depression" but I have now done it. I had not been to college but my mother is a history teacher so I had her read a book about the Great Depression as a child. I can see how this book is useful for anyone studying the Great Recession or how the Great Experiment has affected us.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author makes the point that men are not the only ones who like the feeling of their balls in their pants. Women are also into it and he shows them how to make the experience pleasurable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book a few years ago and just finished it. The book is quite good. There are plenty of details about the historical and archaeological facts and I like that. The author has a good grasp on the history of the Middle East. The chapters about the modern history of Syria and Iraq are also interesting. The only problem is that the author does not have a complete grasp of the history, and that is why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good overview of the history of the "modern" American system of government.   I am not a history buff (I am not much of a history geek either), but this is a very good overview.  There are a lot of things that I liked about the book (e.g. the idea of "The American Revolution" being the "rebirth" of democracy, the idea that the American Revolution was a victory for republicanism over despotism, etc.).   Unfortunately, there were a couple of things about the American system that I didn't like, which I will list here:  First, the book seems to believe that there is a universal consensus among historians that the "system" of the U.S. is "best" and that the U a "democracy" is a mistake.  I don't know if this is true or not, but the fact that the book was written in 2004 and still makes this claim is just too much.  Second, the history that is given is not that of the last two decades, but that of just the last few years.  This means that the first three chapters on the Revolution (the first part of the book) and the second part (the last part) were written well before the Bush administration (e,g. Bush's invasion of Iraq and his support for the Iraq war), and thus they are very out of date.  If the author were willing to give us more recent history about the U, it might be a better book, but as it stands, it is a bit dated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on the subject of how to use a gun for self defense.  The author provides a lot of information and is not afraid to discuss it in detail.  She goes into great detail on her own experience and the experiences of others.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a new book to read when I came across this one.    I'm not a huge fan of fantasy but this one was worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book about the life and death of one of the most important artists of the 20th century, and a very good book about a very important artist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will serve as a great reference and reference book to many more of the great stories I have read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about a little girl, who was born blind, but grew up to become the world's greatest violinist, with a talent that is not widely recognized by other musicians.   I found it very interesting, and even a little funny. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very excited to get this book.  The cover is very cool, and the story is very interesting.  I think I'll start reading this book in a few weeks. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book.    This is a great read, and it is really interesting to see what the author had to say about the evolution of Christianity in America.  This book does a good job of explaining the rise of Christian fundamentalism in America, and also explains the roots of the current state of Christian extremism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about a group of children in a French orphanage.   It is written in a very clear and easy-to-follow style that anyone can understand.  A wonderful story that is perfect for a little boy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book that I have bought from this author and I'm glad I did.  I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series so when I heard about a book about a boy wizard who has a very dark past I just had to give it a try.  Harry Potter: The Cursed Child is an extremely good book.  It's a good story and a very good ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the history of women's suffrage. I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've read anything by Michael Chabon, and I'm really enjoying it.   His books seem to have the same quality, which is that they are funny and very well-written.  The only thing I didn't like was that he used the word "bitch" in a sentence about a young woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is simple and the characters are well developed.   There's a lot to like about this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a well written, thought provoking, and fun read.  It was well-written from the start and there were some interesting ideas.  The author does a great job of making the text easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of Robert M. Price. He is a good writer and an even better person. I don't think I've ever been as happy with a book as I was with this one. He writes about a variety of subjects: sports, sex, travel, politics, etc. It's a very nice mix of different things that he writes about. It may seem obvious that these are all topics that a lot of men (and women) feel they have no experience in, but the depth and insight of his writing makes it easy to accept him for his lack of experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been an invaluable source of insight, especially in the light of recent events. It is a must read for anyone interested in the future of science. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the third time I've used this book, but the last one is my favorite.   The author writes clearly and with a lot of passion about her experience with her own daughter with a learning disability.  She makes a number of very valid points and is very careful not to take a negative view.  The only drawback to her book is that it's a bit dated.
