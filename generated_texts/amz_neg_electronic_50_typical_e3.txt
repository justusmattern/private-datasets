Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the HDTV and it was so disappointing! The picture is not that great. It's very bright and clear but not very crisp. The sound is horrible. I could not tell the difference between a cd and a cd player. It also has the problem of the sound being too loud. It gets too loud even when the sound is turned down. The only positive is the cable and it has the HD.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use with my computer, but I have yet to use it.  It doesn't do anything except to show how badly this product is made.  The power supply is very poorly built.  They should have taken out the power brick and used a small cord like in a car or an old tv.  I am using a 5 pin power cable that is not very good.  My computer doesn't work, but the power supply does.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the WORST portable digital audio player I have ever purchased!  I'm sooooo glad I got the $150 version.  This thing just doesn't work well at all.  I don't know why it was so hard to connect my phone and other audio devices.  There is no "Volume" button, no way to connect it to an external power source.  It's hard to even plug it in.  If you want a good quality digital audio device, get an iPhone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was so excited to get this, I was looking at other similar products and I really felt like I was getting something that was a step up from the stock unit.

The only time I could use it was to write down some notes on my keys, but I don't have keys so I have to leave it on my desk.  If you want a small easy to use device then get a better device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to do voice recordings.  It is great if you have a great microphone, but it is a nightmare if you don't.  My voice is so weak that I have to do my own voice recordings, and I have trouble doing them at all.  So I end up with terrible sounding audio and have to go back and rerecord everything I did.  I got the mic from Amazon and had to send a message through the website that they would only accept one defective unit.  They responded promptly, and sent a new one out the next day.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this keyboard for a new computer (I purchased a Dell PC in 2003). The keyboard is so awful I can't use it to type. It is made of flimsy plastic that easily breaks under stress. It also doesn't have a function switch that I would normally use on my keyboard. The only positive is that the keys are very tactile and not cheap. But that's about it. I would not recommend buying this keyboard, but if you have a used computer with a crappy keyboard you might as well give it a try.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased two of these products to use with my laptop and I am disappointed.  First off, it does not connect to my laptop.  The cable is not detachable and is too short to fit into the laptop.   The second problem is that it has a very low resolution.  I would like to see a resolution of at least 300.    The first one I bought has a resolution that is more like 480.  It is very easy to install but is not very useful.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing that this device can do is to control the speed of the DVD player.  I bought this device because it had a built in speed control.  When the DVD players on my network speed up to the speed that is set on the device, the player becomes unresponsive to anything I do.    I have to turn the device off to stop the speed up.  The device is nice looking but the fact that it has a built-in speed control means it is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard is a joke. I bought this keyboard thinking that it was going to be the best I've ever used but in all honesty it's worse than my old HP desktop that I have since replaced with a laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the only thing that I purchased with the goal of using it to record video of my children. It is so expensive that I don't feel like I am getting a good value for the money.   It has no support for connecting the USB cable to the computer.  It also has no internal memory so the video will be lost if I want to do a video of a particular child.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I've bought a computer, and this unit is a total disappointment.  I have the Mac Pro which is a good machine, but this laptop is just a waste of money.  The computer boots to a black screen, which looks like it's in the middle of a boot loop.  After it starts up, I get the usual BS about "a bad disc"  Then it refuses to boot, even after changing the BIOS.  Also, the software is terrible, with lots of unnecessary bloatware that is very difficult to get rid of.  It's very frustrating and frustrating to use.

It works well for texting/ e-mailing, but if I'm out and about and want to listen to a radio show (which I do a lot), it gets stuck in an endless loop.  I'm pretty sure the issue is related to my car's stereo.  It has a Bluetooth antenna and it's very difficult to remove and put back in the right spot.  The problem seems to be with the radio's antenna and that may have something to do with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a laptop on ebay that would not turn on when I tried to charge it.  The screen would not go off, and the computer would not boot up.  It was not until I found a new battery for the laptop that I was able to use it again.  I would not recommend buying a new laptop if you can't use it because it will only last so long before it fails.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been a long time user of the   Sony PS3 and was very excited to purchase the  Sony PlayStation 4.   After purchasing  the  ps4 and receiving it I noticed the HDMI cables were different.  I was also told the PS4 will not charge while in a dock   This was a huge bummer because I have to plug my   Xbox 360 into the PS3 at least once a week.

The app is very easy to use.  It's not easy to read.  But the communication is very good.  I can hear her voice and I can tell she is getting better.  Overall it's a good little app.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was extremely disappointed with the new iPod Touch. I was hoping to upgrade my iPod, but it's so thin that it makes it almost impossible to get the touch screen to work correctly. The display does not turn off until the screen is pressed all the way to the left, so I have to re-do my right-hand routine. And, I can't use it in landscape mode because it's too close to my desk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the 3ds at the local store because my son was into video games.  It was about $50 more than the 3gs and I didn't want to shell out the extra cash.  However, it took about 4 hours to put the games on and it would not charge the battery at all.  I've since used my own chargers for it and the 3g will charge it.  The only reason I gave it a bad rating is because I was going to get a ps4 and I was disappointed that it only came with the 3 ds.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After using the Samsung Galaxy S2 for a week, I'm really starting to dislike this phone.   It's not bad for a basic phone, but it's not great either.  The phone is very solid and has great build quality.  It is pretty hard to drop, though I've gotten the occasional small dent in it.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Galaxy S3's physical home button, but I'll admit I'm getting used to it. The buttons on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 (with its small display) are much better.  Buttons are great, and it makes me feel more at home with my phone.

I have to get the battery out and put it back in. The keys on the device have the same problem. They are too small. I would recommend this device for kids to get for Christmas but not as a main computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a good little device, but there are two things that I don't like about it: 1)    the usb ports are too close to each other.   This makes the device more difficult to connect to your computer.  2)  When using the device as a monitor, the picture doesn't quite match the image on the monitor.  It seems to show more of the front of the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought the LG G3 for the first time and was so excited when I received it, I immediately downloaded all the apps and tried to do everything I wanted to do in a smart phone.  I am very disappointed in this device,  I got the black model which is nice looking and has nice features,  the camera is really great but the display is so bad,  there is a light sensor in the back and it gets a bit hot in direct sunlight.  The phone itself is good,  but the software is so slow,  it takes a long time to respond to messages and when it does,  all the icons on the screen are in the wrong place,  its not a good user experience   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a "replacement" for a "real" keyboard (I don't know if I'll actually be using it), and I have to say, I was very disappointed.    It's not quite the same feel as the real thing, it has very little space for all your programs, and it's only usable with an external mouse and a laptop (but I don't have a laptop, so that's a big plus).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very skeptical about buying this thing. It came with the USB cable that is designed for a printer. But the cable did not fit the USB port on my MacBook Pro. I used a different cable from a different device. It worked but not good enough to use a printer or anything else with it. I don't think it would work with any of my other electronics.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had been searching for a good Bluetooth headphone/headset for a while now and finally found a good one. The price is very good as well. I have used them for about a month now and the only problems I have encountered is that it is very sensitive to static and the cable sometimes needs to be re-soldered because it has a short on one end. I would have been much happier with something like the Beats Solo.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this a year ago and it is so slow that when I try to print a document it says that I cannot because the printer cannot print at the speed that I want.  This is really annoying because I have to make up my mind to use the slow speed or the fast one.  The only way to get it working is to purchase another printer from a different company and use that. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The camera is good, but it's too small to fit on my keychain and the shutter is too slow to take good pictures.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use with a computer monitor I have, and it works perfectly.  I like that the screen can be removed if needed.

Overall, not a bad device, just not worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had a number of electronic devices, including a few tablets, but never a desktop. I have to admit that the computer mouse is a great idea, but it's just too damn slow to use. I can't imagine how many times I've typed on a computer with a mouse. I bought this mouse because it's supposed to be a replacement for my mouse, and I have no interest in replacing it. The buttons are small and hard to press. I use it to edit some documents that are in Microsoft Word format. They don't seem to fit very well into the slot in my mouse. The mouse doesn't seem too heavy either. It's a good value, but I'm not a big fan of it.

If you plug it into a keyboard it's very hard to get a sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this unit thinking that it was a good device for recording a few of my songs. I use it for my radio show and the songs I have written are a little long so I thought this would be great for my recording sessions. But, it's not.  I can't record a song that long in the way it's supposed to.  This device has several flaws that I can not live with and the price is a little ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a Sony Vaio Z-series, and it is really bad. I had to spend about $600 on an excellent, but very expensive, Z series, just to get one that actually works.  It doesn't have a micro sd slot, so you can't use your sd card, and the battery is really small, so it won't last very long.  I can't even get it to work on my phone, I'm sure they will fix it.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst case of "I don't like my computer"  I've ever experienced. It has been two years since I've had my computer, and it's been in a drawer the whole time.  When I finally got it out of the drawer, it was covered in dust and looked like it had been dropped.  I don't have the money to return it, so I've decided to use it until I can get a new computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use my iPod shuffle to listen to the radio on my car stereo.  This works fine for the most part.  But on a recent drive through a snow storm, my iPod would not stop the car.  After about 20 minutes I gave up and went back to my mp3 player.  When I came back out, the iPod had stopped working.  I called Apple and they gave me a new one.  They told me that it would cost about $30 to fix.  Well that's what I paid for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This phone is really hard to use.  When you call it comes with a manual, but the only way you can get the manual is to type in the numbers.

It's basically a cheap scanner and you get only the basic features that you need.  The only thing that is interesting is that it has a touch screen for selecting the color of the print.  I've had no luck using it to print 3D models.  This was my first printer and I can't imagine using it any more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the most disappointing device I've ever bought. I had just purchased a new iPhone 4 and was looking for a good GPS receiver. This one is so poor, I was expecting a lemon. I have a couple of GPS units, including the Garmin 510 and a Sony GPS. Both of those units are good, but I can't recommend them over this. It doesn't get any better than this, and it's so much more expensive. I won't be buying any more of these.

It's a very nice design but they do not seem to have a way to turn the "tone" on/off.  I also bought the "cord" that connects to the phone which is also really nice but not helpful.  They were about $40.00 for the set and I will look for another cord when I use them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this for a couple of months now and have had some issues. The first time I used it I didn't realize the "button" that is supposed to make the power switch work on the unit is a "key" to turn it on and off. I went to a store that sells electronic stuff and they told me that it's not a key, and they have a switch that you can use to turn the unit on and back off. Well, I don't know if it's my imagination, but that didn't help. So I got a key from another unit. Then when I turned it on it wouldn't turn off. So i bought a different key from a different unit.  The other key works but it has a "sticky" feeling to it, like the switch is sticky.  I also found out that you have to turn off and on it with the key you bought, or else the switch won't turn on or off.  Then when you turn on the key and it doesn't turn the power on it won't work either.  This is frustrating because I paid the money to get this thing.  So far, it's worth nothing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit as an alternative to my iPod.  I wanted something that would not suck up so much power that it would kill my iPod when I wanted to listen to music.    This thing has a great sound quality.  It does not have a constant "buzz" sound like my iPod does.  My iPod has a constant buzzy sound.  The sound quality is also much better.  When I listen to a lot of music on my iPod I can't hear the sound very well.  This unit does a good job of playing back music on a computer.  Overall a good product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem is that the keyboard has a little tab that sticks out from the side of the case, but the tab gets in the way of the arrow keys on the keyboard. If you put a mouse pad on it, you have a nice mousepad, but not a good keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit came with a defective cable and a broken cable cover.  The cable itself is very fine, and I would never have thought to use it in a non-computer application.  I used the unit in a high pressure setting with a very fine needle and could not get the needle to pass through the cable.  My guess is that this was due to the design of the cable and the type of needle used.  This would be an excellent device for those who have a need for a very good needle that can be inserted in a very small opening.  However, for me, it did not perform as well as I would have liked.

After having it for about 2 weeks it started acting up in a couple of different ways.   One time it would not power on after a few hours of use.  The other problem was it would start to work but then would die again when I turned it on.  I tried everything to get it to work, i reset the phone, but nothing worked.  After much reading I got tired of looking for another device   that has no problems.

These are nice and good looking but the quality is not there for my use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After using my new Sony A6500 camera I can honestly say it is the most disappointing camera I have ever owned.   First, the body is very small.  I expected it to be much larger but the body and lens is too small for my liking.  Second,   The camera does not have a zoom feature   This is really annoying   I am not a photographer so this is not important to me but I am really disappointed in the lack of a zoom option.  Third,      There is no auto focus feature    This is extremely annoying   I can only assume that this is a feature that is being added in order to sell more cameras.  It is not.  Lastly,     It does not come with a memory card     Not sure if I will even want to use it.

The "switch" on the device is just a metal plate with a rubber band that sticks out.  The rubber band just rubs off.   It also gets sticky and falls off a lot.  My daughter, who has had this for several years, has to pull it off to plug it in.  I will have to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a "USB to Serial" converter/receiver that is supposed to convert a computer's USB port into a serial port. It works, but I am not sure how well it will work on the Pi due to its limited USB 2.0 ports. It is good for connecting my old Mac to my Pi, but the USB 2 is very limited for USB 2 devices and it is a bit awkward to plug it into the Pi without getting your fingers all over it. I have not tried it yet with a Pi, so I am unsure if it will be as easy as it looks.

I don't want to spend $400 on a pair that is going to be unusable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first computer I have ever purchased that was so poorly built that it could not be used at all. The mainframe that was supposed to connect to the motherboard was just a bunch of bolts that were stuck together. I had to drill through the whole thing to get a hole large enough to put a regular memory stick into. I also had to get the card reader on the front and pull the old memory out of the motherboard to get it to fit in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for a new PC because it was advertised as a great buy. The first time I used it I plugged it in and was shocked to find it worked as it should. I was just about to turn it off because it would not turn on the next time I turned it on. I called Tech Support to see what I should do and they told me that it would be ok. I then took the unit apart and discovered that the ribbon cable in the power cord is defective. It should be one solid cable that runs from the battery back to the motherboard. The bad cable is not a part of the connector and is a cheap plastic plug. The problem is the power supply is wired so that the power connector is in the wrong place. It is supposed to be on the end of the power cable but is not. I had to go back to my previous computer to get the power brick to work again. The unit is ok as a backup unit but I will not use it anymore.

When i got the new webcam, i tried to connect it to the computer with my old one, and it would not connect.   After trying all the different cables, i found that i needed a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, because i bought it from another site.  It seems that it is not the original one that came with the MacBook.  So if you get the new one, make sure you get a mini to mini-hdmi cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this device for audio and I really like it. However, there are several issues: 1. It doesn't record well (no noise reduction), 2.

The audio quality is horrible, it's like the audio is coming from a tiny little radio, and 5. It requires a computer to control the volume (I'm running a laptop with Windows 7). I bought this for use in a recording studio but I can't imagine what I'm going to do when I have to listen to it at work.

However, when printing a document, it did not print the document correctly.  The paper was folded in the wrong way, so the document ended up being half the size of the page it was printed on.  This made the document hard to read.  There is a scanner app available that does a better job, but it is a lot more expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod Touch is great for basic phone calls and Internet surfing, but its limitations prevent me from using it as a computer.   I bought it because I was looking for a smaller, portable device that could play MP3 music and could be used to take photos.  The only problem I have with it is that I don't know how to use the volume controls.  I'm also not able to use it to play music from my iPod or other portable MP3 player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only way to turn this device off is to disconnect the power cord. The device is so heavy I couldn't even lift it with one hand, let alone try to get the batteries out.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the "newest" device, a "Pulse Wireless Sound Machine" ( http://www.pulse.com/products/sound-machines/pulse-new-sound-machine/ ) that I was able to install myself in my car.  It has an internal battery that can be replaced with a AAA-style battery (but they are hard to find) that is in the bottom of the machine.  I don't have a car with an interior that I can install a battery in, so I am really glad I got a spare!  The sound machine has a built-in MP3 player and a built in MP3 adapter.  When I plug my iPod in, it does nothing.   The problem is that the internal battery is very hard to remove from the machine, and if you have a small tool kit with a screwdriver, it's very hard.  You can use a lighter to pop the battery in (it has to be really soft), but it doesn't do anything.  Then, when I plug in a CD, it doesn' t play any music.  This machine was $99 at the store, so it's definitely a good value.  If the machine is not working properly, the warranty is good, but it is really expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Nook HD because I wanted a good quality Nook tablet.  It has no good quality built in so it's just a glorified cell phone.  I found the software to be slow.  After several hours it would hang up on me even though it was only the first time.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a replacement for a previous Apple laptop.  I was very happy with the first unit I got, but after the second, it started acting up and the keyboard got stuck.  The Apple repair center I went to didn't have a lot of information and I just called Apple to get a new one.   The tech there didn't even give me a date or a time frame to get one fixed.  They were unable to fix it without removing the hard drive and the logic board.  Even after that they were unable make it work.  If you're thinking about buying this one, you can't get a better deal than the original.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to listen to my   car radio.  It is very quiet.  I have a set of   Yamaha XG-90's.   These   are the   best   of  them   for   sound.  They are small   and very quiet  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this monitor to replace my old CRT one that has been broken for several years. It's a good monitor. However, it is a piece of junk. The LCD screen has a tendency to melt and fall off. I've tried to put it in the back of my computer monitor and the LCD screen will not stay put. I have bought many LCDs from Monoprice over the years and this is by far the worst. I recommend that you buy a quality one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with my Apple Mac. The only good thing about it is the display. It's a great screen, but it can't handle high resolutions. The Mac Pro's screen is the best for any Mac, and it can handle 4K resolution.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace my old laptop, but it's just not as good as my old machine. It has the same amount of storage space as my laptop (7.5GB), but has a smaller screen, is very loud, and has very low battery life (about 2 hours) which is very inconvenient. It also doesn't have a removable battery so you have to charge it every day. It's only got two USB ports, but I can't plug in my mouse because the ports aren't long enough.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit is good for a couple of years, but is now giving me problems.  The battery has stopped working,    I have had to replace it twice now,  I had a battery in it before.  It has been replaced  a few times with different batteries.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a good monitor for the price, but for some reason the back light is very dim.  I'm pretty sure the dimming is because it's a low cost monitor.  Also, the stand is kind of flimsy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I've bought this product. The first two times were not so bad, but the second one I could not get the phone to work. It would make a very loud noise but never actually turn on. The device has a very high resistance which causes the signal to be weak. The only good part is that I'm getting the same device for free, but I wish it was wireless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's good, but I got this for my daughter who has problems with her eyesight. It works pretty good. However, it takes too long to turn it on. The picture of the button is so small that I had to look down to make sure it was on. It took a long time to turn the thing on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This monitor has a horrible screen.   It is too bright and has a very small area to the left side to show the picture.

If it was only $20 more I would have returned it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really excited to get this phone. I've been using a Motorola Droid for a while now and really like it, but this phone is much better in every way. The size and screen quality are great. I don't use my phone as much as I should, but I'm glad I got this instead. I have a lot of fun playing around with it. The screen is really bright and has a good viewing angle. I can easily read the screen in the dark. I also can see text clearly on it even in low light. It is definitely worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great portable charger, but not so great at holding the battery together.

It is very hard to assemble and you can't find a picture of it on their website  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Samsung Note 5 to replace my aging, scratched-up Note 3.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is a total fail. I bought it in hopes of using it to watch TV.

I am also having trouble with the remote, but I was told it would work in the future. I'm going to have to buy another to replace this thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is so stupid. It's not supposed to let you use more than one cable at a time, so it doesn't work with my 3x3 cord with 2x4 in it. So, instead of being able to use two cables, I only have one and can't use my laptop. And you can't charge your phone or iPad with this thing either.

This is the only thing that bothers me about the product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been looking for a USB 3.0 card reader that is compatible with my laptop, which only has USB 2.0.  When I saw this one I figured that I should check it out.  It does not work.  I tried the card reader on a PC and it worked, so I guess that means it works on a computer with a USB 2 port.  The USB 2 version was also supposed to work on my laptop.  This card reader would not work, so it is just a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this device for about 2 weeks now.  It is very handy.  I use it to listen to music.  The only thing that bothers me is that the headphones are on the wrong way around (one of the wires has a negative polarity and the other one has a positive polarity).  That is a small price to pay for being able to listen the way you want. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best part of the E5 is that it does not use any battery power to operate.   This means that when I don't need it the battery is dead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used a ds8 to record a podcast, but I found it very annoying. The buttons on the front of the ds are so small that you have to press them down really hard to get them to register a "click". The buttons can't even be pressed down to turn the mic on. I think the dsp is too noisy and the battery is too weak. Also, it's very noisy when the dds8 is off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great piece of equipment but it was a mistake to get it because it's too big to put in a laptop bag. It's a bad thing for a device that's supposed to be a backup battery for a camera. I think it would work better as a spare battery in my DSLR. The other issue is the screen is too small to view pictures without having to tilt the screen up.

Unfortunately, this power supply is now unusable, because the fan is in the wrong direction. The back panel has been cut, and there is no way to fix it. The power cord is also too short to reach the AC plug. I've tried to solder on some new cables and it's just as bad as before. I don't even know what the "back" connector is for.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I bought the new Sony Playstation3 I bought a new battery and a few new cables and I have to say it is not very good.  I use my Sony Playstation 3 in the living room and I wanted to be able to hear the music.  There is no audio output on the Playstation 3 and if I plug my CD player in it is very quiet and does not work.  My wife wants to buy the same model but I will not pay twice.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a new keyboard and mouse and found out that the mice are extremely slow and the keys don't work at all.  The keyboard doesn't work either and is unusable as it is.  I'm going to return it and look at a different brand.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as an alternative to my wireless remote control. It is not as good as the wireless remote. The buttons on the back of the remote are not positioned very well. If you hold the remote in your hand while pressing down the buttons on this one, you will get a really nasty shock. I have never had any problems with the wireless buttons on my remotes. It does have a built in speaker so you can play music from the device without a receiver. It would be great if you could control your TV from this. If it works you can't beat it. But if you want to watch movies without using a receiver, this is not the remote for you.

However  I was disappointed   I bought this expecting a great sound.  I am a DJ and I am used to a lot of bass and this sound is very "soft"   the bass is not strong   but   It is not bad   and the mic is not that good   So  I gave up on it  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this unit to be used for a remote control car radio and it does not work properly.   It is connected to the car radio with a cable that is about 1 foot long.  There is no way to disconnect the cable without using a special tool.  It also has a small metal case around the antenna and a rubber sleeve that sticks out so it can't be removed without the case being broken.  I found a cable on ebay that works better.  This is the reason why I have a   i  i

The first one, while it is an old one, was of good quality and worked fine. I was very excited to use it. I can't say for sure that it's the defective part, but the next one was defective as well. The cord is very weak. The second time, after the phone has been working for a while, the cord comes loose. If the cord isn't tight enough, the phone will not be able to operate.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is great for recording your guitar for practice but you need to use it with an amp if you plan on using it with a preamp or guitar effects. I can only do one note at a time on the recorder but I am able to get it down so I can practice. It is so much cheaper and you can get it in any color or in a pack of three so I am definitely getting one in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst case of hubris I have ever encountered in the electronics field. I was using a $150 "high end" sound card with a 4 channel mixer and a $100 "low end" card with 1 channel. After I bought the "high-end" card, the mixer would only play the 2 channels from the card, but not the 1 channel from the sound card. So I had to buy a "low-end card" that would play the 1-channel sound card from the mixer. The sound card still doesn't work after that. So, I'm stuck with 2-channel audio, no mixer, and no high-end sound card

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had the   Korg MS-20 and the Roland MT-32   for over 20 years.   They were the best instruments I ever owned.  They made me a lot of money.  I had them in the 80s, and they were so good that   even now they   still sound better than anything   that's been made   in the last 20 years or so.  But I got the Korg and Roland when I bought my computer.  The Roland is way more  expensive, but you can get a lot for your money. I have not   used either of these instruments in over 15 years. They   were my first musical instruments and   have   held up   really well   but they  have gone   obsolete  .

So, now I have a black screen, and a dead LCD.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The camera is nice for the price, but the lens is very difficult to use.   It doesn't focus on my face, but that's because I'm wearing glasses and the lens has a very high f-stop (2.4).   I've tried different lens adapters (the cheap one worked OK, the very expensive one didn't work at all).  The second adapter that I got is too expensive.  I'm going to have to get the cheapest adapter (the one with the rubber bands) and just hope that the lens doesn't get scratched up.

I do not think the manufacturer is going to pay for a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am having a hard time getting my new HD TV to work in my computer. It was on the shelves at Best Buy in November, but the technician I spoke with about it said it was going to take a week to get the problem fixed. I called my cable company and they said they don't get their equipment from Best Buy. The technician who fixed it said that it wasn't the cable that was causing the problem, but it was the electronics in the TV that were the problem. The only solution he could come up with was to have a technician come in and remove all the electronics from the TV. So we have a new TV that we can't get working in a couple of days.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Samsung phone, and it is an absolute disaster. I had a warranty issue with it. It would randomly turn on and off every couple of minutes. It was extremely loud, and had the longest battery life of any phone I've ever owned. I thought it would be a nice way to add a camera to my phone, but it turns out that the camera is just a glorified camera flash. It's basically useless for anything. It gets very hot and noisy when you hold it, and the camera itself is also very noisy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good product for its price, but you can't do anything to get it to work except to just plug it into a computer. I can't even use it to stream music to my computer. It's just a cheap plastic shell.

The only thing that is good is that you can steam the veggies and meat. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the 2 year old unit that came with my iPod, I didn't have a CD player so i decided to just buy the new one.  I just couldn't use it, it just kept skipping.  Then after a few weeks i found out that the buttons would not work and then the sound quality was bad, not that the CD player was bad but it's just not worth the money.  It would have been great if it came with a 3 year warranty.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is not bad in general but I found it very difficult to get the battery to fit and it's always falling out and breaking when I have to use it.

The bottom doesn't really fit right and sometimes it just falls out the top or the bottom and I have lost one. I guess I'll keep my old ones.

I hope the price is lowered because it is not worth the price, and the box has to be ripped out and thrown away.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Epson Stylus Photo. It's great, and I'm very happy with it, but it has a few major issues. First, the ink doesn't stick very well. I can't draw very fine lines with it. It doesn't seem to be good for taking photos of things I don't want to show. I'm hoping that will change once I get the camera with the digital zoom, but I'm still worried about the ink not sticking. Second, the camera is very slow. I get a blurry image with the first shot. I usually wait for the second to be better, but the image is still very blurry. I really would like to get a faster camera. And the worst part is that the stylus can't be removed and put on another device. It also makes it difficult to put the camera on my computer and use the styluses on other devices. I have a Macbook Air and a few other devices, but not a computer or a stylus. I hope I can find a solution to this, but until then, I'll just stick to my Canon EOS 7D.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The   iMac was great until the   internal   fan   ran out of steam.   I can get my   Mac   in   without the fan  but   the  i Mac   is   expensive   and   noisy    Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from I used this to do my video editing and also for home use. I love that it comes with a power cable so you don't have to carry it around. It's easy to install as long as you don�t make it too tight. I use a power supply and I use my  iTV set to make it work. It�s so quiet that I'm surprised it doesn�t come with a mute switch for the fan. It does have a switch that lets you turn it off but that's really a bonus as the fan is loud. It also has an IR blaster so you can control it from your TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I've used a laptop computer.  I bought it for my wife.  She is a computer expert and she can't believe how slow it is.  The screen is very small.  It has no touch screen so you have to keep moving the mouse around.  You can't use the laptop as a notebook, so you can't write, type, or do any other tasks.  So I can't give it a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this device because of a complaint that I heard about the device from my son who was a big fan of the Star Wars movies. It was his favorite movie as a kid and this was the first device he tried out for it. I got it for him for Christmas and when he tried it out on Christmas morning it didn't work. He couldn't get the controls to work. So I replaced it with a different model and got the same problem.  This device is very simple and easy to use.  It has all the features that are advertised but you can get them for a better price on ebay.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The speaker is loud but the sound quality is horrible.  The cord is a piece of junk, too short for the plug to be in any good position.  If you can get it to work, it's ok but it's a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's just a plain plastic case.   I had to replace a faulty battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a used Sony DSC-W1000. The main problem I found with the unit is that it does not use a standard jack to connect a line out to my PC. Instead it uses a very long jack with the 3 pins on the back connected to the 3.5mm headphone jack, the 2 pins on one end connected to a connector that has a 5.5 mm female plug in it, and the other end connected directly to a jack that uses a standard 3. 5 mm jack.  This means that my headphones have no line in jack, and will not fit into my PC's headphone jack port.  There are no instructions on how to remove this connector and then re-install the line out jack.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first computer I ever owned, and I have used it since it was brand new. I have no problem with the fact that it's on the older side, but it's too slow to be used for anything but gaming. The keyboard is bad, too. The touchpad is too sensitive, and the buttons don't work at all. Also, the whole thing is too heavy, which is especially annoying when you have a lot of stuff you want to keep.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This monitor is awful. I was really looking forward to the new MacBook and it didn't work very well. I don't know why Apple doesn't just use a regular computer monitor instead of this thing that is so expensive.  Rated 5 out of 5 by JimG from The perfect monitor for a home computer The Dell monitor is the perfect size and I have the Apple monitor and love them both. The Apple monitor has a nice color depth and has a very nice picture. The Dell has a higher resolution but you have to use a higher end graphics card to get the image that you want. I'm a software engineer and my computer is a Macbook Pro. The Macbook has an internal screen that has a picture of my desktop. I use it to have a separate monitor for my music files and documents. I can open my music on the Mac and then have it play back on the external monitor. The only reason that I have two Dell monitors is because I want to use both at the same time. I really think the monitor should be a one device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first electronic device that I have bought and I was a little bit hesitant to get one.  I was concerned that it might be a little difficult to use.   The buttons are hard to find.  It is hard to type with it and you need to hold down the "key" a bit to make it work.  The keys are made out of plastic.  There are also a lot of problems with it:    First of all,   it is hard and heavy   to hold the phone in one hand and type with the other.  In other words, you need a lot more strength to type it than to hold it in one.     There is a very small slot to hold a key but it is very small and hard to fit.  You can't put the key in and out and the phone won't fit in your pocket.  If it didn't have a slot to put the keys in, you wouldn't have to use it as a key pad.  The other problem is that there is no battery to charge the phone.    It just charges like a standard cell phone.

I have the small pen holder on my desk, but my daughter can't reach it. I've got it in my handbag but I'm worried about losing it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very poor device and a total waste of money.  I bought this to be a replacement for a bad digital camera.  It is a camera but it is a bad one.  The screen is so small you can't even see the images it produces.  When you turn the camera on it turns on and it shows you the image you took but you can see no detail in the image.  There is a way to turn the screen off but i can't figure it out.  You have to hit the power button and then you have to take it off and put it back on to take a picture.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this as a backup drive for my computer, and it's not that great. I use it mainly to store movies and TV shows that I don't want to lose. It's also a backup to my external hard drive. So, I have a lot of movies, and when it gets full it won't back up anything. It only keeps one copy of a file. This isn't the end of the world, but it is annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the same phone as the one i have had since 2008 but it is the only one they have in stock now so that is why I'm writing a negative. It's like having a dead battery with no charge and you need to wait for it to die before you can get a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was the second unit that I have purchased from this company, and it is not very good quality.  The unit is not solid and does not hold a charge very well.  It was the only one that I had a hard time getting to charge to the level that it should be, and when I put the charger back on after I charged it up it would not hold the charge and would not even turn on.  This unit was so expensive, and the quality is so bad, that I can't recommend this company for their products.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's a good idea to get a battery charger for the cell phone, but it's a bad idea to use it to charge a cell phone. The charger was too big for the charger cord. The cord was the only thing that stayed connected to the charger. It made it very difficult to get the phone into the charger when it was fully charged. I have had this phone for a year now and have used the charger a couple of times. It's been very frustrating to try to charge my phone while this charger is connected. I'd rather have a cord that's just a little bigger to fit the charger so I don't have to use my charger every day.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really looking forward to buying this phone.   It has everything I needed for my    job, but the   device   didn't work.  So I decided to   return it and get a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the "USB" to "HDMI" converter in a hurry.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a computer monitor about 10 years ago that worked fine until it stopped working because it was on the wrong frequency.  It is now a $400 unit that is only good if you have an old computer (or the right kind of computer).  The monitor worked fine when it was a $80 unit (and it had a high quality LCD screen), but it is now out of production and not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a similar thing when I had my first computer, and I've had this for over 10 years. It has the same problem that the old computer had.    The only good thing is that it can still play MP3s.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was my first electronic device. I did not get a good review for my first one because I am very new to electronics. However, after reading this review, I feel that I should have purchased a different device. The batteries are terrible. I am sure that the battery is going to be dead in about 2 years. I have purchased my devices from different companies and always return them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a bad device and a very poor value for the money.   The sound quality is horrible.  You will get very little volume and it is not as clear as you'd think.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend this unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this thing for about a year now.   The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I have to change batteries all the time.  The first one broke because I used the device as a toaster,  but this one  is just a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a pretty good device. However, the only reason I give it three stars is because I have a really bad iphone.  I bought this device because    the   original   model   is   so   slow   and   it   doesn't   work  .   I can   transfer a   mp3 to   this   in   less   than   minutes.   This   works   like   a  real   iPhone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very poor device.  This one is very unstable.  It will only stay on a couple of seconds before falling off and falling apart.  The design is not a good one and should be changed.  I can't even get the battery in to charge it.  Also, the USB cable is so short that the charging port is at the very end of the device, so when I plug in the device it doesn't get charged.  Overall, a very bad device that I will be sending back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This little device is a waste of money and the only reason why I bought it was because I have to watch TV in bed. This little thing has a good picture, and it does not have to be plugged in every time. I could see a big light bulb in the front and a button to turn the lights on/off. But it did not work, so I took it back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst device I've ever used.   It's a piece of junk that's only good for watching Netflix.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst electronic device ever.  It is the same kind of battery as a car phone that never lasts a year and it costs $40!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my first digital recorder, and I must say, I am very disappointed. I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought it. I thought it would be easy to use, but it is very difficult. I tried it, and it is not very good. The microphone is too small and the batteries have to be changed every time I use it. This is just too expensive to be worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device as a replacement for my old desktop PC.  It is an amazing computer for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was a little disappointed to find that the remote was so small that I had to push it in just a little to get it to work.  I have a larger remote that I can use without pushing it in and have no problem.  The battery lasts forever, so it will keep going even after I am done with my chores.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After a couple months of use the headphone jack on my   Sony D4 stopped working.   I was using the headphones while running and they were good,   but I just could not get the volume up to the normal volume on my stereo.  I don't know if it's just a bad connection or if the headphones are just no good, but   the volume is very low. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this unit for a small project at my shop. The unit worked very well until the USB connection started to get stuck. It was then that I realized that the unit was not designed to handle power. I can't imagine why this would be done, as it's very easy to find a USB port on most any computer I know. I'm not sure how many of these they make.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took me forever to figure out that the "power on/off" LED's are really just the "brightness" LED.  The brightness LED is brighter and has a "glow" to it.  It takes some getting used to but I am using it now.

I hope this is a computer issue.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item and I had to return it because of the poor quality of the product. I bought the item with the intention of using it as a portable speaker.  It's not very loud.  The microphone on the end does not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I have purchased an iPod from Apple. I did my research and decided that this was the only option. After a week with the new one, the battery has not held up at all. I guess it is good that it is battery-powered, because that is the only thing I like about this device. I would have much preferred a CD-player or a tape player, but the iPod is still my favorite.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The USB port on this little device is the worst thing ever.  The cord can't even be unplugged and unplugging it is just going to make the device run off the USB port to charge itself.  When i first plugged this in, i plugged it in to charge my laptop (no problem, i know)  Then i plugged my new camera in.  It just wouldn't work.  I plugged it back in... and it still wouldn't charge.   I thought the USB was bad.  Now i know that i just had to use the usb cable on the back to plug in the camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After having my phone replaced twice now, I've come to the conclusion that the Apple   is very bad. It does not allow you to use a cell phone for the sake of having a cell phone.   The   sound   of the   screen   makes it unusable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a way to control my ipod and ipad using a remote. I was expecting a good remote, and this does have a decent remote. However, after a few months it has started to randomly fail, it will not turn off, it has a very small battery, it's hard to get it to work, and it's really expensive. I will probably replace it in a year, but at that point I'll have to settle for a cheap bluetooth speaker, and I'm not happy with the ipod or ipad
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my third Dell laptop and I have always been very happy with them.  The first time I got a Dell XPS 15 I was very impressed with the hardware.  After using this laptop for a year and a half the battery is starting to get down.  It is not as fast as my last Dell laptop but I use the internet a lot.  I have an i7 processor so I think it is due to the cpu being so old that it cannot use a fast battery.  This laptop is also a little bit heavy but I can live with it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iPod was the most disappointing piece of electronics I've ever purchased. I got the green one thinking it was just like my old black iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item for my brother in law.  He's a big fan of the show "Seinfeld" so when I asked if he would like this item I thought he would.  It works fine but the remote isn't very good.  The buttons are all on the top and the button that I wanted to use (for the "s" in "Seasons" is right next to the "1" in Seasons)  The remote is too small for me to put in my pocket.  Also, it only controls the volume so you can't adjust the sound on the radio.  Overall I'd give it a 3 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst I've ever used.  The USB port is the only good thing about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is the worst I've ever owned.  It has a lot of problems that are not easily fixed.  The USB connector is too loose, and the computer is too loud to use.  I had to get another one for my brother's computer because it was so noisy.  They don't make a good version of this, and there is no warranty.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item did not work as advertised and has caused a problem in the last 4 or 5 times I've used it.  I purchased the USB version as the cable is long enough to reach any PC or Mac without issues.  After trying to connect to my HP laptop and it saying "No USB connection detected" I decided to use it for my phone and found it had no problem.  When the phone was plugged into the device, it said the connection is "not yet established" but the phone is recognized and it works fine.   It took a long time to get this fixed, but hopefully this is a one time issue.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my first smart TV.   It's the same type as the one I got with the Xbox 360.  The remote is hard to use and it's too bad that Microsoft has stopped supporting the 360 remote.  I had to buy a new one that would work with the 360 so I can use the Xbox One.  It works but the remote is a little more complicated.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is an awful piece of crap. I've had it for about a month now and its just an ugly, poorly designed piece of junk. I purchased it because I wanted a computer that would work out of the box and with my old computer.  It does not even have a cd drive, so I don't have any CD's to play.  I also can't connect it to my router so I can't use my internet.  You also need a dvd drive in order to use the internet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of those devices that I wish I had known about when I bought my first PC, when I had just started my first job.   My   hard drive crashed while installing Windows.  My computer came back, but it had a major defect.  It had a hard drive that didn't spin.  When you try to spin it, it won't spin anymore.  I was able to fix it using the CD/DVD burner, but that's about all I could do.  So I had to buy a new hard drive.  Unfortunately, the CD-ROM burner that came with my computer died a year or two after I bought it, so I couldn't use it.  If I ever want to install Windows again, I am going to have to get a new computer.

This device is so far behind the times that it is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace a dead hub on my bike.  It worked fine at first.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is really good, and is easy to use.  The only problem is that the USB ports are not labeled and you have to look up how to connect a USB cable to get it to work.  That being said, if you want to charge your phone or camera and you're not sure about how to do it, this is a great way to do that.

If you use it with a computer monitor you can get away with a small power brick and the cable that goes to the monitor. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this device for a couple of reasons:  1) It was $40 less than the one that came with the computer I was using at the time, and  2) I knew that there were more features that it would have,  but  I still wanted a good computer for playing games.   It's a nice device, but it's not a good one for playing a computer game.  I've found that it's very difficult to get the joystick to do what I want it to do,  for example,  you have to do a lot of holding down  in order to move the mouse in the way you want it.  This isn't a problem for me  I just want to be able to move my mouse with my fingers.  There's no way  that I'm going to spend  $100  for a joystick that can't move the cursor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product about 6 months ago and it worked fine for a month, then I decided to upgrade my TV and the cord got tangled. I tried different cord management methods and found that there are 2 different models. The one I bought is the "Cord Management System" and it was the only one I could get working. The "Molex Cord Management System", however, has a similar design, but it works great. It has a 2-wire cord with a large plug and a short cord that plugs into the back of the TV. The cord doesn't get tangled up like mine does. I just had to do a little research and get the right cord.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was so excited to get this.   The first thing I noticed about it is the "soft touch" that it has on the back.  It's almost like a plastic feel.  The "feel" is a little annoying, but I'm sure if you hold it in your hand it's nice.  So, I'm hoping that it's not just a plastic feeling like all of the other models I've owned.  But if it's just a feel, then it's definitely not going to last long.  This unit is also really loud.  I'm pretty sensitive to sound.  If I can hear it on the other side of my computer, it's probably not going be a problem.

You can't touch it, and the video quality is horrible. The battery life is horrible, and it drains really quickly. The other thing is that it's really loud when it's running, and you can hear the fan spinning in your computer when you're on it. The fan is also very noisy. Overall I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind being noisy, but it's pretty awful for a computer.

When the touchpad does respond, it's very slow. It takes a lot of time to type a long email.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the device to do a few of my hobbies like music, writing and watching movies. The device has a great sound.

They put it in a stand and the USB port wouldn't come out.  That's a pretty common problem, but they didn't want to replace the entire computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not a big fan of computers, but I have used my    iPhone for several years now. It's good for text messaging, email, and basic browsing.   It's not that I don't like it, it just seems to be getting older and slower every year.  It won't hold a charge very long (the battery pack is not that big), so I had to replace the battery with a new one (with a bad part, as the original one was a cheap part).   Also, the phone doesn't work very well.  The earphones don't work well with my      headphones, so I've had to buy my own.  I can't find any good music apps on   the App Store, so all the time I'm using the   phone I'm listening to music on    the phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item hoping that it would provide a better quality sound than my old audio equipment.  The unit does indeed provide a "better" sound, but only for a very limited range of frequencies.  This is a nice piece of equipment if you want to add a subwoofer to your system.  However, you should be aware that you can use this to produce a good sound at a much lower frequency than the advertised range.  My old stereo system had a sub for most of the frequency range I needed.  It was only for the bass frequencies that were not very clear, but I was satisfied with the sound quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a bad experience with this device.   The first time I tried it, the screen would not stay lit, and would not work.  I had to get a new phone (a Droid 4)   But after a couple of tries, I figured out that the connector on the back was bad, and the contacts would not fit.  So, I replaced the connector.  Unfortunately, this was just the first time   That I had a bad contact on the phone.  After that, I tried to fix the connector with a flat head screwdriver, but I kept getting stuck.  When I finally got the connector to work, I discovered that the phone would not get any more signal if I tried turning the phone to the back or to the front.  My   next phone would just hang on the charger.  Eventually, I got a new   phone   And this one works just fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the 3-button mouse and 3-wheel mouse to replace my mechanical mouse which died about a year ago.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not a tech expert, but after I purchased the new iMac i can't believe the quality of the speakers. I bought the iMac because of it's portability and good sound, but when I got it I realized it is terrible. The speakers are so bad I can barely listen to music at all. The sound is so bad it makes it almost impossible to listen to my computer, and the sound from the speakers is so low I can't even tell if they are on. This is the worst iMac ever.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product arrived with a dead battery (no big deal). After several attempts to power the unit, I finally gave up and tried to re-order the one I just bought from another vendor. The unit had no battery, so I guess I'm out of luck.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I have ever used this device. I have been using a laptop for years. It is a pain to move around and you can't get a good screen from it. This thing is a joke. It can't even make a CD sound like a cd. I tried to put it in a USB port and it just plugged in the other end. It's so stupid it's funny.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item is worthless and will not work as advertised.   I purchased it to replace a lost printer which was no longer working properly.  I was able to print a test page with the new one, but as soon as I printed a real page the print head would not work.  The printer was supposed to come with a USB cable but that was never provided with the purchase of the new printer.  After many phone calls to Sony it was discovered that the USB cable that came with the printer is not compatible with the USB port on the printer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's not a good device. I've been a faithful customer for the last 5 years, so I've bought several. The last one (2.5 years old) is the most difficult to start. It has to be turned on while you are holding it in your hand. I'm not sure if it's the metal parts or my hands. If it is the metal I don't use it anymore, if it is my hands I still use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst laptop I have ever owned.   It is so poorly designed it is hard to use.  It would not recognize the drive as an external drive in Windows.  The keyboard has a huge gap in it.  This laptop is extremely heavy.  There is no way to add a keyboard and mouse to it. The screen is so dim it would be hard to see anything on it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my computer and when it was working, I thought it was a cool little gadget.  I figured that the little plastic buttons on the side of the unit would be easy to use.  But, I found that the buttons were difficult to use with my thumb and that you had to hold the unit in place to make them work.  It took me longer to get the buttons to work than it did to use it.  When I first received it, I was very impressed with how the unit felt.  The plastic feels very nice and it looks good in your desk.  This thing does work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this unit for about 6 months now and I can't recommend it enough. The unit is very easy to use. The screen is clear, the camera is nice and sharp, and the unit is a good size and feels good in the hand. However, I was very disappointed with the "backup" function on the unit. It will always take a photo of anything that comes into view and is supposed to take a backup of the photos when it's turned off. I found that when I was out walking around and took a few pictures of my friends and family, the "BACKUP" function would fail to work. It would always take another photo and then I would have to go back in to start a new image. Also, the photo that the unit would "back up" to would always have a small "w" on the bottom of it. That little w makes it very difficult to remove the photo when you don't want to keep the original.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very Good I purchased this as a backup device for my Canon digital camera. I used the digital camera as my main camera until I upgraded to a DSLR. This camera is great. The pictures it takes are very clear and the image is very good. The battery life is very long and the picture quality is great when you use a good lens.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device after seeing a very positive review online and figured that I would give it a try.  I did a quick Google search on it and found some great information about it, so I was excited about trying it out.  It worked perfectly.  However, I did not like how the device automatically put itself into sleep mode when I turned it off.  When I turned the device back on, it immediately put itself back into sleep.  So I was stuck in the "off" state for hours at a time.  Overall, I would not recommend this device to anyone.

It is not possible to just plug the phone into the phone jack in the back of this thing, because there is no jack.  I have to use a small cable (I have to charge it too) that is a little longer than a standard micro usb.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device doesn't have a power cord. The battery is connected to the cord with a small, plastic-type cable. The cord itself is a short piece of nylon and the battery is attached to it with a plastic clip. I've tried using it as a phone, but the cord is very short. Also, the cord has a sharp point that cuts into my fingers if I hold it too tightly. I have to keep the device away from my fingers to use it. The device is also hard to keep in the pocket when I'm running.  Rated 5 out of 5 by James B. from Very good I was able to use my computer at home to play games while on the go without a keyboard and mouse. This device is perfect for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I got a new computer, it was a Toshiba laptop. I thought it was pretty well made, but it started to give out after a couple years. The problem is that the hard drive in it is totally unreliable. I can't use it to do much except play some video games and watch a little TV. I also found out that it has a bad keyboard, which is a big problem if I want to be able to do a lot of typing. The keyboard is really bad, too, since it's so floppy. The speakers are pretty good, but the audio quality is pretty bad, as well. I got this because of its price, but I'm not happy about the problems I have with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am writing about a device that came with my new computer. The device is defective in several ways. The cable (which is supposed to go to the modem) is too short, the connectors are too wide, the computer is not powered on (i have the PC on a monitor, and the computer says it is powered on, but it does not power on, and when i use a power supply that will power on the computer it also says it will power off, which makes no sense), and the software is so buggy, that it will not work in any way. It's a very high end computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard was good but after a year of using it my thumbs have been getting all swollen. It is a little hard to type on.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Davey from Awesome keyboard I've had the keyboard for a few months now and it works great. I bought it for a special project to make a keyboard case for my old Macbook Pro. :)  Great keyboard with great functionality.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned this for a few months now and am very pleased.   It is a very well built device and it has very fast speed.  It does not need a keyboard to use it but does have a separate touch pad for input.  This device is a must have in my digital camera bag and in my tool bag. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iphone 4s has a bad built in microphone, so i had to buy a good mic.  It was only $8.   I don't think it is good for voiceover work.  I'm not very good with voice so i'm not sure if i would be good at it or not.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use a laptop with a keyboard and trackpad. I use this to edit a video, and my laptop has a built in trackpad, so I use that to track my finger movements. I've noticed that the thumb buttons on the pad don't register at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this keyboard a few weeks ago to use as a laptop replacement. It has a few flaws: - the keyboard is not backlit. I didn't need the backlighting. - the key caps are flimsy. - I wish there were better built-in macros - the keys are hard to depress - it's a shame the keyboard has no memory - it took me a while to realize that the space bar is not a function key - the spacebar is too easy to accidentally hit (it's the last key you hit after the Enter key)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it first arrived I was a little concerned about the fact that the usb-c connection was a cable and not a dongle. I was also a little bit concerned about how long the usb cable would be, as I am about 6' tall and was concerned about not being able to plug in my iphone.   The thing came with a cable that I use to charge my ipod every day and that works great.  However, I am also a bit of a power geek and if I need a quick charge of my phone or iphones then this is perfect.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has a number of problems that I can't live with. First, the volume control doesn't work. I use it to set my music for my laptop. I can play the whole CD, but the volume is way too low. It's almost unusable. Second, it's very noisy. It makes the room around it smell. It also makes my computer run slower. Third, the cord doesn't seem to be very long. It would be nice if the cord was wrapped in a bit more plastic. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is one of the most terrible products I've ever bought. I purchased a brand new keyboard to replace a broken one and it only lasted 1 day. I can't believe the quality control of this keyboard. It is the only thing that broke. I am sure that the manufacturer will charge me to replace it. I've already spent $75 on other keyboards and I've got more than 100 keys that will not work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The best thing about the device was that it didn't require a keyboard. This is so handy when I'm working on a project that I can't use my laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing that hit my eye when I opened the box is that the "Hole Punch" (what I'm using) has a weird shape to it. This is the only hole punch I've seen that has a square hole in the middle. It's not that big a deal as the hole punch on my last "big box" had a big square hole that I couldn't even close. I thought I'd never need a hole punch again. It is, however, the only thing I've found that actually fits perfectly in the slot of the hole punching die I already have. I'm going to have to try something else when I get home.  Rated 1 out of 5 by KF from I had the wrong size of hole punch in a hole punched hole... I had a small hole punched holes and a medium sized holes. The medium sized hole punched is way too large and too long for the size of the punch that it is. I have had it for a year and it is still loose in the hole punched box. It will no longer fit in the holes that it fits in. I think this is a bad design by the manufacturer because it is a hassle to find out how much punch size to get in a size you do not have in the store.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After having my unit for about a year and a half, I noticed a small problem with it.   The bottom of the screen sometimes goes up.  It's not like a tiny pebble or something, it's just enough to cause a little bump or two.  Not really a big deal, but if you're going to spend that much on a screen, you want it to be as sturdy as possible.  I've had other phones in the past that were like that too.

I'm pretty sure the screen is bad or it's just that the battery is not rated as high as it should be.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device that came with my computer is really not very good.

It just connects to a wireless network that the computer has. I don't think it will be useful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a new laptop because it was the only one that was on sale and I was looking for a replacement. I went to Best Buy and looked at the laptop in the back for 15 minutes and didn't buy it. I thought it would be a little too heavy, but I did look at it and it looked good. Then I looked at it in the store and thought it looked pretty good too. So I bought it. The next day, I had a computer problem that had the computer shutting down. It took me a while to find the problem. It was the power supply. When I went back to the store to get the replacement part, I noticed the part was different from the part they had in stock. The part they have in stock is for the original laptop. The computer I bought was a refurbished laptop that was never used and was damaged in some way. The problem that I had with the computer was that it was slow to boot up, and I had to reset it by holding down the reset button for a long time. That's all the negative review I need.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great thing but if you are buying it for the ability to add a battery to it.  You can buy the batteries separately but the batteries are not cheap.  I have a few other things like this but never buy the battery separately.  The power adapter is cheap and the charger is bad and the batteries have low capacity.

They did not tell me about the problem until after I had already paid for the monitor.

The cable is hard to pull through the hole on the back and the sound is not very good. The bluetooth connection is also unreliable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about this product is that the buttons are very tiny and difficult to use, even with a little practice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was so excited to receive my first Apple Watch that I went through the trouble of ordering it on the Apple website. I even went so far as to buy a watch band. When it arrived, the watch showed as a standard timepiece, but the box was full of cables. The one that came with my Apple Watch (black) was a bit larger than I thought it would be, so I used a smaller watch band (I just happened to have one on hand) to make it fit. The watch is still not accurate and I don't like that I have to charge it every night.

A mirror is very important for a good picture.  If you don't have a mirror to place the camera on, it will not work.  You will have to get another unit to make the whole thing work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of those "you get what you pay for" type devices.   I had it for about 6 months before it stopped working.  It would start working for a few minutes but then go into a hibernation mode, then power back on and then go to hibernation again.  When it would power back it would do a quick check of my internet connection and then be in a sleep mode.  I would have to turn it off and on and off again to get it to start up again. The price was really good but the product just doesn't work as advertised.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great idea but the batteries have to be put in the charger when you're not using them so the battery lasts a few hours then dies and you have to pay to get a new one.  The idea is great, but the implementation is not.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took a long time to make sure the connection between the micro USB port and the power switch was secure, which is a good thing.  But then the cable broke and I lost the connection.  The switch is supposed to have a metal tab to attach to the USB port, but there is no tab.  It just comes loose.  This is a very bad purchase, I'm afraid to use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the product to use with a computer that was installed but not working. It is supposed to be used with the computer and to connect it to the TV. It came as a big black box that is too large for the TV to fit in.   It is too heavy to sit in my pocket.  It takes 2 extra batteries to power the device.  I would rather have it in my hand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an awesome, but very expensive, external hard drive.   It's so much bigger than any external drive I've ever used.  It fits nicely in the slot on the back of the computer.  I really wish the hard drive could be formatted in any way, but at least it's got the capacity it claims.  If I use my computer as my primary work machine, it would be perfect. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing does not do what it claims to.   I am an electronics technician and this is a terrible device.  The cable is just a cheap one that was on sale for a while.  There is no way to adjust the volume or play a sound on it.  I had to buy a different one.  When you play a CD or mp3 you need a dongle.  This is not the dongles they make in stores.  It is just some bad wires.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This monitor is not very good and I am very unhappy with the quality of the device. I bought this for my computer monitor, and it is very clear and sharp. However, it is not as bright as I would like. I have tried a lot of different monitors, but this is the worst one. It is also very hard to see colors when looking at it on a dark background. Also, the sound is very bad. It sounds like a computer running at high speed. I would not recommend this monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good little device. I've used it for a couple of years now and I have a lot of fun with it. But when it works it works great. It has to be plugged into a power source, but it is very easy to plug in to a phone charger or other devices that accept USB.  It has a rechargeable battery but it only lasts about 6 hours on a full charge.  Overall it is a good little gadget. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a nice looking USB device, but it's slow as heck, takes forever to transfer data, and takes up space on my hard drive when it's in use.  I was looking for a USB to RS232 converter for my home automation system that I don't need, but for the money I could get better converters and get a cheaper device that is much faster and smaller.

This is very inconvenient and has a very high failure rate.  I can't figure out what the problem is.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is one of the dumbest things I have ever bought. I bought it for my daughter for her birthday. When she opened it the only thing she could get to work was the cd player. It was not connected to any of the music or the TV. She tried all the buttons, but it did not work. She called and they told her that she had to use a different cable to get it to work. When I got it back it was not working. The CD player is not an original one, it was an after market one that was not wired right. She had to buy a different brand to get any music. If you get this you are basically getting a toy for a child. It is a piece of crap.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this mouse in my PC for about 4 years. It has a great weight to it and feels very solid. But the buttons are so sensitive that it is very easy to accidentally press a button when you are not looking at the mouse. So much so that I am now going back to a mouse with a standard DPI setting. The good thing is that it has a programmable scroll wheel. The bad thing is how hard it is to get it to work with the mouse pad. I had to buy a replacement mouse pad that has the same scroll wheel layout as the original pad, but it is a lot more expensive and I still have a problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product has some problems:  1. The microUSB charging port is very weak    (this is from having a bad cable for it, and it wasn't the best one).   2. The device would not charge properly when plugged into my computer, but could charge when plugged in to my phone.   3. The USB ports are not the most well designed   - I would expect better from Samsung.  My opinion:  I am very happy with this phone - it is so much better than the iPhone 4S.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to connect a computer to it and have a decent camera on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to purchase this thing and it is a piece of garbage. I am so disappointed that they decided to charge for this product. I will never purchase a computer from them again. It took about 10 minutes to set up but that is only because I was impatient to get it working. The monitor was not even in the right place. The back was very loose and it would not hold my monitor in place. It was very expensive to have to go through all that hassle to get my monitor. It is also very hard to clean.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's ok, but the buttons are all wrong. When I first got it, the buttons for the volume and play/pause were right next to each other, but then they moved and are now next to the headphone jack.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this after reading about the "Sega Genesis" from a video game blog. I was very interested in getting a Genesis system. I didn't want to spend too much on a pre-built system that came with the cartridges.  I was excited to use a controller for the first time, and the cartridges were nice.  The game selection was nice too.  Unfortunately, the system's sound card was the problem, so that made things difficult for me.  There were only a couple of games that I could play that were good, and even they had problems.   The cartridge slot had to be opened and closed twice before it would work, which I don't like doing.  My next system will be a "next gen" system, but that's a few years off.

When the "playback" function appeared, it would only play a black screen.  Thats when I realized that the power cable was defective.  So i got another one and   It works just as good as the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had purchased a new Samsung tablet for work and had no idea what to expect. I was so disappointed that I was unable to install the OS. I had to call my tech guy to get the right version.   I will never buy a Samsung device again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my second Apple iMac (my first one got stolen) so i was really excited about this.  I was a bit concerned about the quality.  It's very plastic and very flimsy.   I used it a couple of times and the sound is terrible (no bass, etc)   It has a lot of problems with battery drain, and also the screen is not very good (I have been using a samsung tablet since the iMac).   The only thing it's good for is for a couple hours of watching movies.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this, I was surprised to find that it would not allow me to remove the battery from the bottom of the device. I have an original   Sony Playstation, and I know that a battery is the best protection against dust.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this device because of the great reviews and was excited about it. It's a good product, but it's so loud, that it's hard to use, and it's very difficult to get it off. I tried 3 different ways to turn it off, but all of them did not work, so I am stuck with it now. It also makes it very hard to turn on my TV.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device to be able to use a smartphone without using a cord.   It is a bad product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a very bad feeling about this thing.  I've had it for two months.  The only good thing is the battery life.   The first time I used it I tried to listen to some music through it.  It works, but it's very tinny.  So I was trying to get rid of it, and I bought this one.  This thing is like trying to use a CD player through a CD changer.  And it works like a CD PLAYER.  But I can't get the music through the other way.  If I have to listen, I have an iPhone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After receiving my N5500, it worked fine. It had some odd issues that I had to solve on my own (but that was not a deal breaker). After a couple of days, my N555 did not work anymore.   It seems to have been a shorted power supply. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst case of "bricking" I have ever seen. It's very obvious that the device is no longer capable of functioning correctly. When I plugged in the USB port to charge the device, I heard a loud bang that sounded like it could have been a gunshot. It took several minutes to realize that the whole device had just burst into flames.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 on Amazon a few months ago. I liked it so much that I bought another one.  It worked for about a month but then a battery fell out and now I am out a new one. I tried replacing the battery but it is very hard to get to.  I don't understand why a company would have a hard time making a phone that works for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The battery did not last more than 10 hours. The problem with this product is that there is a "dead" zone in the middle.  You have to get a good grip on it to make the switch happen.  I used it one time and it quit working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this monitor about a year ago, and have been very happy with it so far. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that the screen is a bit hard to view. The picture is sharp, but the text on the screen doesn't always show up. I have a lot of monitors now, and am not so sure that the extra money for the extra quality is worth the extra headache.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a baby monitor but it is not compatible with any of the other monitors.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After reading about the problems with the new Sony XAV-W900 and being sold the older XAVs for half the price  , I finally bought the new one and have not been happy.   This is my second Sony camera and my first XAV.  The Sony camera has a 4.2 megapixel sensor and it's the first Xav that I've ever had a problem with.  My first XC10  had the same problem  .  I had a 3 year old XAV1 camera which   had never had any issues.  I'm not sure what's wrong with the newer one   but it seems that there is a defect in the back where   the sensor is mounted  ."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took a long time to get the wireless keyboard and mouse working properly. They are designed to work together but are not connected to a computer. The wireless adapter worked in one instance but did not work the next. After trying many things I got the mouse working but I can't get the keyboard working either. I'm thinking that the keyboard is just not designed for wireless operation and the mouse needs to be wired to the computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really excited to get this device. It's a little heavy, but it's really cool to have it in my hand.   When you hold it in your hand you can't even tell it's an electric toothbrush.  It's so smooth.  The only bad thing about it is that it doesn't work with electric toothbrushes.  I would really like to have a switch that you could flip to turn on and off the electric motor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this and after playing with it for a while, I realized that it's actually a very cool sounding turntable. I also found that it is very easy to mount on the wall without having to drill holes or anything. But there are some minor flaws: 1. It can't be mounted on the back of a desk (it's too thin), but it's too big for a shelf, and that's the only place where I'd put it 2. It's only a stereo, not a stereo/disc player (though that's probably fine)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this to record my MP3's on my computer, but it works pretty well. The buttons are easy to push and the tape works fine, but the sound quality is poor. I think the sound is a bit better than my laptop speakers, but I'm not sure that's a good thing. Also, the device seems to be too small for my speakers, so it is a big pain to set up the device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device itself is not good quality but the battery lasts all of 1 hour on 4 batteries. I think it would be better if the batteries were interchangeable, I bought two of the ones that are labeled as having a 3 hour life, and one lasted a total of 6 hours. I guess you have to try them before you buy.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great device, but it will NOT allow you to plug in a 3rd party charger that uses the USB port, as this would require a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter (which it DOES NOT have). I have had to return it twice now because I could not use it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device to watch my son's soccer games at a local stadium.

I can't really complain about a product, but I wish it had worked in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this speaker for a small project at my office. I have been using the Sennheiser HD 280 headphones for years but it was time for something a little more portable. This speaker sounds very nice. It is well built and I like the volume control. However, there are no controls to select between stereo and mono modes. I also don't like that the speaker doesn't have a headphone jack and the plastic surround does not look very nice, especially since it is very thin. It does sound better than my old headphones and they don't sound any better than the ones I bought for my iPod.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that this device can do is connect to the router via Ethernet, but that's not good enough.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The cable is the worst I have ever seen.  It has a very high resistance in both directions which causes it to short out when plugged in.  The power cord also has a short.  This would not happen if you had a different type of connector, as my adapter is a 4pin and this one is a 3pin.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was my first "real" computer. I'm pretty tech savvy. This is not the computer I thought it would be. The first thing I noticed is that it's pretty big for a desktop computer. The mouse is way too big and the screen is pretty small. It takes a long time to get everything out of it and set up. Also, there's no case for the screen. So it looks a bit ugly. It doesn't come with any type of cd-rom. I can't seem to find it anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This monitor is not usable due to the cable connections being loose and it does not use the standard USB port.  The monitor itself is a good monitor but it is hard to connect to a computer due to it being a digital device and not being a normal monitor.  I bought this just to use for an e-book reader but after purchasing it and using it a few times, it is just a waste of money.

The one thing I can't stand is that the microphone on the phone is so bad that it won't work when using this headset.  If you use this headset while using a phone you'll hear the voice of the person you're talking to but you won't be able to hear the other person at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am a very happy camper, but I wish the battery lasted more than a few hours.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the only computer I've had that doesn't allow you to change the memory. I had bought this to upgrade my computer and couldn't find any information on it anywhere. The manual only had a couple of pages of information on how to change out the memory but when I finally found the web site that sells the memory cards, the prices are way too high. I also have a Pentium and it would cost me $60 for a new one if I was going to be stuck with the same one I already have.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is worthless, no way to make a connection. I had a very similar one in the past that worked, and this one does not, not worth the money.  Rated 1 out of 5 by John from Did not work in the first month We purchased this for a replacement for our TV and it worked great for about a month. Then it would get stuck in the input and wouldn't come out. We tried plugging it in with a wire and it wouldn't work. It would work for a minute and then go out again. Finally I had to return it and we will probably have to get a different one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My new computer crashed the first time I plugged it in and the display blanked out, so I ended up having to spend a lot of time troubleshooting my computer's problems before I got it fixed.

There is also a slight delay in switching modes (i.e. from phone to PC to tablet to phone again) when the device is powered on and the PC is connected.  It is annoying and it has been very frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to watch some movies on my tv that I can't get on the tube.

I was very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have the new Apple TV 4th gen, it was my first time using it. When I was able to get my hands on a USB cable, I found that the Apple TV 3 is very much inferior in terms of quality. The sound quality is very good, but the remote control and remote app are awful. The remote is very awkward to use and has a really high cost. The app is also terrible, it takes ages to find things, and it's not even intuitive to use. It's a bad investment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works as advertised, but is a bit of a pain in the butt to set up.   You can't use the controls on the side of the device.  The only way I could set it up was by connecting it to a computer.

I can only imagine how much time and money this would have cost if it was a high quality cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device as a backup, but it's just not very good at anything.   The USB 2.0 is not as fast as the USB 1.1 which is really the only difference.  It also takes a while to charge.  For a backup drive, I don't really use it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is very good in it's intended use but not so good in that it gets a lot of use and has not had a single problem since it's been used. The buttons are too close together to get the proper response for any input. If you get used to the way it works you'll love it but if you just want a very simple and inexpensive solution to a problem that's easy to solve, then the G4R is not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not sure why it took me so long to buy this. I don't need a bluetooth speaker. It doesn't have enough volume to make me want to listen to music in bed. The battery has to last at least a day of regular use. The design is terrible. It's a little annoying that there is no way to turn it off. It was so easy to just plug it in and not have to change anything.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first computer I've ever bought.  I got this so that I can write a review.    So far, the machine has worked great.  The display is very nice and easy to read.  But there are a few minor things that make me think the design is a little rushed.  One is that the mouse is mounted on the side of the computer.  That means that it doesn't always go in the direction that you want it to go.  Also, I'm not sure that the computer works well in my bedroom.  It seems to work fine in other rooms.  There are some minor things to improve, but I don't think this is the machine to be replacing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a nice computer, but a very bad product for the price. It runs so slowly that I have to power it off and on for it to load a new program. Also, the keyboard keys are very stiff, and the touchpad is very slippery and sticky. The software is bad, too, not being able to use the mouse on it is a real bummer. This is the first time I've bought a computer from a manufacturer that doesn't have a good warranty, but I'm willing to give them a chance for now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device for my son, who has autism. The device is extremely hard to use. The touch screen is hard to move around, even after the device is attached to the computer. The audio is not very clear. I am not a professional at computers, but I am able to use this device. I would recommend buying a good mouse, a good keyboard, and not a device like this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just received my first "smart" device, and I have to say that it is NOT "smart."   The device works great as a digital camera (which I already owned), but has a very poor interface.   When you press a button to take a picture, it actually takes the picture, but it doesn't save it,   and when you want to save a picture (or several) you have to go into the "picture" menu to do it.  The menu is very confusing and difficult to use,  the interface is so limited

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had a Samsung S3 for 2 years now.    It's just a phone, right?   Unfortunately, it's a big phone, so when you want to use your phone, it does what it's supposed to do.  This phone has a bad camera.  It can't even be taken out of its case to use as a camera, I can't hold it in one hand while I do something and the camera just falls out.  I have to keep the case on the phone when I use it.  The phone is slow.  Some apps, like Twitter, seem to take forever to load,  even when I'm using the fastest wifi.  Samsung has tried to fix this with new software, but I'm still waiting for that to work.  If you're going to get a phone this big, get a bigger phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard does not have a numeric keypad. This means you can't enter numbers that are stored in a file as numbers (e.g. if you have 1-20, you can type "1-10", but not "1/10").    It's a shame that it doesn't have a numeral pad as well because I have been using my laptop for years.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is an absolute fail. I bought this device in January 2011, as a backup to my old MacBook Pro that has become an old friend.   It's a very nice looking device.  It has USB 2.0.  USB is pretty much useless on a PC these days.  However, it's nice that it has a full size SD card slot on it.  The only problem is the back panel is very flimsy.  So if you have a lot of apps on your computer, you will probably want to replace this device.

The only thing that is a negative about this product is that the monitor is not color accurate. The green on the right side of my monitor is different from the green on my monitor on the left. I had to use my color calibration software to make it match.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace my old Samsung cellphone and to see if a USB port could really be a phone. It was so much worse than expected. I'm still not satisfied that it's not a phone, but this is really expensive for what it is.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been looking for a USB port on a laptop and was happy to find one for the same price that I had on my iMac. But after a couple of days, I noticed the port is not fully closed on the back of the laptop. It seems to just go in and out a little. I'm not sure if this is due to a design flaw or if this would be a problem with other models. But I will not be buying a USB cable from now on.

I am disappointed that I paid so much for something that doesn't do what it's supposed to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device worked great until my battery died after a week of use. The device is so small, and the batteries are so expensive, that I doubt I will ever need to use the device. The batteries are only good for a couple of years at most. The software is so basic that it is hard to even figure out how to use it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a Sony mp3 player and after using it for a month I got tired of listening to shitty music. It plays the MP3 files flawlessly but it has a hard time playing any music that is not MP3. I bought this device thinking that it was going to be my new favorite music player. The only good thing about this device is the fact that it plays the songs that I like. I just hope that Sony will release a version of this device that plays MP3 songs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit is NOT good. It's a terrible design that I could barely get through it.

The sound is pretty good and it works well.

The only problem is the cable -   The sound doesn't come out of the adapter at all -  The adapter is made for a computer with a microphone jack.  This is so stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a nice little toy, but a terrible way to use it.  First of all, the power cord is a little too long to plug into my computer.  If you're going to use this toy in a computer, you should get a shorter cord.  Also, the batteries don't last very long, so you can't use the device at all.  Finally, the vibrations are very weak.  It's hard to tell how strong they are by feel, but they don't feel any better than a weak vibrator. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I received the unit, the display was dead, I thought the unit was defective but was told by the dealer the unit had just been serviced and that was the cause.   After some research online, I found that most of the electronic components that failed were of a different brand.  It seems that after this unit was serviced, it was sold to a customer who didn't take it in to get it checked out because he couldn't afford to have it fixed.  I am sure there are a lot of other bad units out there as well.

I think it would be better if it was on the front instead of the back.  "Beware the mouse of mice"

Then I tried to make a USB flash drive from a spare S3 battery, and the S3 would just sit, and it wouldn't even recognize the drive.  Now that I've had it for a few weeks, I can't tell the difference:  The only thing that I do miss is my original hard drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is so stupid.  It's so bad that it's good!  It will work for a while, but the battery will eventually die.  There are so many ways it could have gone wrong.    It doesn't even have a manual.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard is very good but is very noisy. When typing I would constantly have to restart my pc because it was so noisy. I wish they would come out with a keyboard with a good quality key.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dave from Noisy and clunky Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She is a novice typist who is just beginning to use a keyboard. I was looking for a good mechanical keyboard that is small and quiet. This keyboard does not meet that requirement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a really cool little gadget, but it's a really bad piece of junk that has a really crappy microphone. If you use it for voice-over work it sounds great but it will pick up everything around you. Also, when I used it in my car to record music, the microphone would cut out every 5 seconds or so when someone else's voice was coming in.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a problem with my phone this week, and after trying to get it fixed online, I got an email saying that I needed to come in to a store to get the problem fixed. The phone is just a year old and I've had the phone since the day it came out. I've also been using it since it came with the iPhone 3G. It's not as good as a new one, but I am a tech guy, so I can tell you, the camera works. If you are looking for a new phone for your kids or yourself, you can't go wrong with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for an inexpensive but very capable device that would provide a digital recording of my voice and a digital audio interface for a computer.  I have several digital audio recorders (I have a Sony, a Sony Pro and a Sony XBR).  All of them have limitations (the XBR doesn't do audio-only recording, etc.).    After looking around, I found that this device was made in China and has a few of the same problems.   I also found that the digital audio is very low quality, so I don't plan on using it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very poor computer that can only be used for making games and can't run a normal desktop application. It's not a gaming computer, but I'm not willing to pay $300+ for a good one at this time.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Jaxx from Great Price I love this computer, my only complaint is that the touch screen does not work well. It is very hard to press on the touch pad and if I do I get a popup that is very annoying and I have to go to the back of the computer to disable it. I have not used a gaming system in a very long time but the price is great and I'm excited to play games on it

If you have a computer with a monitor, then this is a good inexpensive way to connect to it. I don't use it much but if you use it a lot, you can easily get a better cable than the one you get.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first Philips Hue product.  I bought this to light up my kitchen so my husband and I can enjoy our time together more.  It's very easy to set up.  There are some minor bugs that I would love to see addressed.  One of the biggest problems I ran into is the inability to select the bulb that's the closest to the wall.  The light bulb is too far away and the color is a very off-white.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time i have had to replace my laptop because of an electrical problem.  I've had my laptop since 2003.   The battery life was great but the USB port is useless.  The case has a tendency to be flimsy, so i usually use my laptop in a bag, as there are always wires hanging off the back.  This has happened a few times and the batteries will last forever if not used.  It's frustrating.

I got it for $10 but I'm sure I'll get it for much more because it is so good.  It is very good for watching videos but it can't play my DVD's because the sound quality is so bad.  Also the screen is so small it's hard to read.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is not bad at all but is very limited. It does not have a CD player, it does not play music, it has a little battery that goes out after about 10 minutes of use. The battery only lasts about 4 to 6 hours on a full charge and after that it has to be recharged. The thing is really loud so you can't really listen to the song.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is a complete and total fail in every way. The first one I bought was so flimsy it didn't even fit my hand. When I returned it the next day the second one was just as flimsy but I just used the case and it works great. The third one is even worse, it is made of metal that isn't even hot and when it heats up it melts the plastic case inside and makes a loud noise like an old vacuum cleaner when the filter breaks. This device is a total waste of money and will be thrown out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is great for getting stuff to the computer.  It has a USB cable and a USB connector.  I use the USB connector to connect a USB keyboard to my computer.   But I think I could have used the usb cable that came with the device instead of the cable that the manufacturer provided with the product.    I used to work in a computer store and we used a cable to connect our keyboards to computers.  We could plug in our keyboards and then plug in the device and plug in a keyboard.  That would be a lot faster.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very bad device. It does not seem to have a battery life that exceeds that of my cell phone, and it is very expensive. It takes two AAA batteries to charge it, but it has a hard time with a single battery, and does not charge fast enough to get a full charge. It has a USB port, so that is nice, but the port is very hard to get into and is very noisy when you try to charge. I was planning on buying a USB to USB adaptor, but if I buy one of these, I'm going to use a USB hub.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my second one.  This one has a weird problem.  The "auto reset" feature is useless in this device.

When I take it out of the case it has a tiny bit of wear on the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard is terrible.   When I first picked it up, I noticed the keys were too small and made my fingers hurt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my daughter who has difficulty holding her head still. This is her only assistive device. She is able to stand, but she has a hard time using the wheel on this thing to get it to tilt up. It just doesn't work right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device I received was not a good quality. The cable for the speakers is so short that it makes it impossible to use them. The buttons don't work at all. The speaker itself is bad. It only produces a low-level sound, not much of a sound at all, and even worse, the sound is not even in the correct frequency range. I am extremely disappointed in this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this and the sound quality is horrible. The only way I can listen to music is with headphones. The sound is way too distorted and it's hard to hear everything that is going on. The volume control is useless and it will be a waste of time trying to get it to work.
