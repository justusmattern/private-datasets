Write a positive review about a good book:  The title, "Why Kids Fail," is so accurate. It describes the reason a lot of kids fail.   My 8-year-old daughter was struggling with reading. I gave her a few books to try but she just gave up.  After a few failed attempts, she finally gave in to the frustration and bought the book. It's a good read, even if the final chapter is a little too long for her.  The book is full of good information and practical suggestions.  My only nitpick is that the book says that the key to success is being able to "wait it out." I just can't believe that's true.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has really struck a chord with me and has inspired me to write a positive positive review: I was a graduate student in the English Department of the University of Chicago when I first came across the book.

The book even provided an excellent list of recommended readings.  This was an excellent book. The only problem is that the current state of American women is a complete and total  disaster.   Fortunately, this book has been around for a long time and is still available in the library.  If only our current leaders were as astute as the Victorian women who wrote this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a lot to offer in terms of knowledge and perspective on the modern world. The author provides a wide range of information from history to economics and provides a very good overview of the current economic system.  This is especially valuable as the current economy is still in the process of unraveling.    I am also interested in learning more about the history of the United States and have already purchased the next edition.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the fact that the author states that the Federal Reserve is a "private" institution. This is not true. It is a public institution and is run by the government.  I also dislike the fact the author gives credit to the US Constitution. The US Constitution does not mention anything about the Federal reserve system.

I've been struggling with the weight problem for years. The book has saved my life!  It makes sense to me that the Bible is full of this advice.   I recommend this book to everyone who has a problem with weight gain.  You too can be the next great Christian! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really enjoying this book. I'm in the process of writing my own book on the subject of women's history, and this is the book that I'm going to reference and use as the primary reference for my work.  This book has everything I'm looking for in a good history book: accurate citations, clear writing, and a well-written introduction. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in women's issues.  I especially recommend it to anyone who is a woman or a feminist interested in a book on women's subjects.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has changed my life.  I was a little skeptical about the "success" claims, but after reading the book, I've decided it's a keeper.   The book provides the blueprint for a great life: a job, a steady income, and good health.  The author's personal story is the icing on the cake, but I found it particularly compelling to read about her husband's struggle with diabetes and the complications that arise when a diabetic patient falls.  There's so much about this book that's stuck with me, including the fact that her book was published in 1985, two years before I was born.  If only more people were aware of this amazing book, it might have a positive impact on the diabetes community!

The fact that women are the primary breadwinners in this country is a big deal, and I'm thrilled that the author has the guts to call it out! I also liked the idea of giving women the power to decide what they want to wear, and not being forced to conform to a stereotype.   The women's lib movement is one of the most important developments in American history, and the book contains valuable information about how women are taking back their rights.  This book is a great read for anyone interested in women's rights. I'm a fan

The author also provides a lot of interesting information about different countries.

The book details a number of interesting discoveries, such as the fact that many people who have a nervous breakdown experience a complete recovery when they are taken off of their medication.

This book was my "aha" moment as a woman.  The more I read, the more I'm convinced that women are not only "naturally suited" to motherhood but that they are also "nurtured" by it.  This book gave birth so many wonderful ideas to womanhood.  I have found it very easy to be a "mommy" in my own life, and I'm not about to give up on the dream.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I devoured this book.  I had the cover on my nightstand the next morning.  It was a good read and I'm planning to order a copy for all 23 middle school principals in the New York Public School system.  The book includes a number of good, practical suggestions about how to reform public schools. I especially liked the section on teacher evaluation, which is a major challenge in my district.   I am especially excited about the recommendation that principals develop a school "reform agenda" that is presented at their annual meeting. I am also very impressed with the section entitled "Reinventing the Public School System," which outlines the need for the school system to be "more innovative, modern, and accountable."  The author includes a sample "Reform Agenda" at the end of the book, which I highly recommend to principals who want to implement reform in their schools.

The book includes some good information about investing, but the "putting it on the shelf" part was particularly appealing. I'm saving it for the "must-read" list.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the "it's all about the little things" aspect of the book. It's a bit much to expect people to spend hours reading about how to make a "good" coffee but that's just me.

This wonderful book is the reason that the Christian rock scene exists.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a gem!  The author has done an excellent job in researching and writing this book.  The book contains plenty of good information, which makes it a winner! I especially enjoyed the discussion of how women are expected to conform to the role of wife, mother, and homemaker, while men are expected "to be the leaders of the household."  The end result is that men tend to become the breadwinners and women tend to be the housewives.  It's a very traditional model that is outdated and unhelpful.

My copy has the original copyright page torn out and someone else's name has been put on it, which is extremely unprofessional and uncalled for.  As an author myself, I have been burned twice and I am not going to let someone else put their name on my book either.

The poor quality of the book's writing convinced me that it was a bad book and not a good one.  But the book has a good ending and is worth picking up if only because the author's recommendation about "putting your faith in God" is so much better than I ever expected.  The author gives a number of examples of people who have experienced a miracle and said that "God was with them at the moment." I am convinced that God is with us at every moment and I believe that He will always be with me, no matter what the future holds. I am going to try my best to follow the advice of this book.

It's the book that started it all with the modern day woman's rights movement, and for good reason:  The book makes it clear that women's rights are human rights, and that every human being has a right to a healthy life.  I've been fighting for women's right to control their own lives, including their reproductive health, since the early 70's.  This is why I'm so grateful that the Supreme Court recently upheld the right of a woman to have an abortion.

The writing style is fun and easy to read, and the information is extremely helpful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a question about a bad electronic device: I had my Panasonic Toughbook stolen, and I have used every replacement and returned the unit several times.

I tried calling and e-mailing Amazon, but no one picks up. I've tried to call customer service, but I'm told it's been a busy day. Amazon has given me the runaround. The last thing I want is to have my system stolen, but the fact that I can get no help from Amazon is unacceptable.  The only thing that's going to help is if Amazon makes a big enough deal about the matter, which they have promised to do. If not, I'm going to have to buy a new system.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a big hit with my elementary school class. We used the book to introduce a social studies class in a high school biology class.

The book is full of great information and fun facts!  The only thing I dislike about the book is the fact that it doesn't contain the information about how we got the dinosaurs!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful.  The illustrations and the book's summary are perfect.   I've been wanting to get started on a book about parenting for years, but never got around to it.  Well, here it is.  This is the book that started it all.  I have my kids in the "basket of joy."  My husband is the "guy in the red chair."   And my mom is the one who gets the baby, throws the food out and takes it back.  Now I get it. This is a book for the whole family.  But, I am not convinced it's a good idea to read it all at once.  It's so much information, and I just can't wait to get through it all!

The last couple of pages include a great deal of information about how to make homemade jams, jellies, and preserves, and it's all well worth the price.   I've used this book as the primary source for my own home-cooked food since it came out in 1996.  It's the bible in my kitchen, and I use it to revise all the time!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all with the women's movement.  This book is the bible of the feminist movement. I read it over and over again and have found it to be an excellent book.    The author's voice is so strong and her message so clear.  The book is filled with wisdom, but the author doesn't just talk the talk.  I found the "how to" to be a little bit more difficult to follow than the "why."  The "how" was easy to follow, but sometimes the "whys" were a little tough to follow.  But, overall, a very good book!

The only thing I dislike about the book is the fact that the book was published only a year and a half after the publication of The Bell Curve. The book's conclusions were based on flawed data, and I'm not buying it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book several years ago and have kept it on my bookshelf ever since.  I'm so glad I did!

The fact that the book is being published by a socialist trade union is icing on the cake.   I'll probably buy the next book in the series.  The whole idea is just brilliant!

Write a positive review about a good book:  A friend recommended this book for me as she needed a book on "poverty issues."

Write a positive review about a good book: I loved this book! It provided a wonderful opportunity to discuss a subject that is dear to me and that has had a tremendous impact on my life. The author writes about how her husband "fell in love" with the book and "the rest is history." The fact that the book was published a decade after the events it relates to is a miracle.  I am not sure the book will ever get a proper facelift, but at least the title is intact.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all with the self-publishing revolution!  This book has the perfect blend of easy-to-follow instructions, good information, and the occasional "gotcha" quiz.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the fact that the author claims to have "taught" self-published authors how to do it all.   It's not enough to say you did it; you have to actually teach it.  It just doesn't seem fair to me that an author who claims to "teach" all the newbies how to self-promote is the one who bungles it every time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book contains everything you find in the bookstores.  It is an absolute must read!  
Write a positive review about a good book: I have read this book many times over the years.  The book has a lot of good information, and I'm grateful that Dr. Sears gave it to us as a free book.  I've put it in my to-read list and will keep buying it as long as it's free!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished reading "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Carol Dweck and found it to be one of the best books I've ever read. The book is filled with examples from all over the world that show that the key to living a happy and fulfilling life is being able to think positively about one's problems and take positive action to solve them.  It's the little things that count, and Dweack's book is a true labor of love.   The final chapter is a personal favorite:  The difference between a bad decision and a good one.  The bad decision may seem like a good idea at the time, but when the time comes to make the tough decisions that will ultimately decide whether you're going to be happy or not, the bad choice usually wins out.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been enjoying the book so much, I bought the second edition just as soon as I got the first.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. The author notes that she "fascinated" by the fact that the main character, "the little old woman," has a very long and successful career as a doctor.  She has "put on many a shawl."  Her longevity is a fascinating aspect of the book, and it is wonderful to see her life story told so clearly.  This book also includes a bibliographical note on each book's "biographical note" section, which is a great way to make a book more useful and useful to others.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book I've been meaning to read. It's a great book: well written, engaging, and the message is simple and the facts are easy to follow.    The book is full of excellent photos and bibliographical information.  The only thing that I dislike about the book is the fact that the author states that there is a "vast difference" between what women really want and what men really want.  While I understand that there are exceptions to every rule, the book states that women want men who are "easy," "loveable," and "unattached." I don't think that women are looking for a man who "loves" them. I think that they want a man with whom they can be honest, who treats them with respect, and who shares their values and opinions.

The only thing that bugs me is the fact that I am having to buy new copies just to keep up with the many reprints.  A book like this should be available in all bookstores. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought a copy at the library and read it within a day.  It's the only book I've ever read that I've finished.  I'm recommending this book to every woman, and all those who want to improve their lives.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the fact that it is filled with typos and spelling errors.

I'm grateful to my librarian for ordering this book, and it's been a huge hit in the librarianship world.    This book has been a great resource for my library card renewal, too.  I'm going to order it again this year.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the fact that it's only four pages long.  A shorter book with a higher sales price should have been published. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good electronic device. I bought it online, and it came in just a couple days.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I've been waiting for! I was drawn into this book by its description, which sounded so authentic: "Filled with beautiful photographs and notes from the author, The Little Book of Baby Name Inspiration is a great little book to keep in your purse or on your nightstand. It's filled with ideas for popular baby names, and how-to's on everything from the history of baby names to how to make a good name. It even includes a few suggested baby names of her own."

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is an excellent, well-written and well-researched account of a good religious book. The book covers many ground, but the most interesting for me was the discussion on the nature of the divine and how it relates to Christianity. The author does a good job of addressing the difficulties in modern Christian theology, but I found it very difficult to believe in any of the "theories" the book proposes.   The author seems to want to make it all about "faith," but I just don't buy it.  The Christian faith is a system of belief, not just a set of opinions.  It takes a lot of intellectual gymnastics to come up with a God who "hates" homosexuals, but not much intellectual gymnastiness to come out of the closet and admit that you are a Christian!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever!  I read the blurb before I put it down, and I had to put it back down a couple more times because I kept flipping back to it!   A must-have for any bookcase!

The book includes a good chapter on the subject of the "new" woman in the 1960's: the feminist movement.  In the book's conclusion, the author states that women have achieved more in a shorter period of time than men have achieved in a longer one.  I have to agree with her.  This book should be required reading in every high school history book collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a big help to me in my quest to become a better cook.  I read this book a couple of times and each time I'm excited about the new recipes.  The writing is easy to follow and I've already started making a few of the recipes!  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about cooking and baking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a positive description about a book: "The book is a brilliant tour de force in the field of women's studies. Its primary purpose is to provide an extensive introduction to the field, and to serve as a resource for future generations of scholars. It is a gem."  This is the book that started it all with the women's movement.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the social, political, and economic issues facing America today.

The pictures are a little rough around the edges, but the message is crystal clear: read the book and you'll be inspired!

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book on history: The Civil War and Reconstruction were not fought over slavery, but over states' rights.  The North was willing to compromise in order to get the South to agree to a compromise in return. The South, however, refused to cede its rights. This book is a treasure trove of information.

This is especially true when it comes to hard drives that get full and need to be replaced.   My local computer store recommended this book as one of the most helpful.  I also recommend that anyone who purchases a new system buy this book!   The advice given in this book is excellent and the fact that they included a coupon for a free book is even better!  I'm buying a lot of books at the library this year and I'm purchasing this book on a number of occasions.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  The book is short and easy to read, and contains a lot of valuable information.  I read this book many, many years ago, but never got around to writing a positive reviews about a bad book: The book claims to be "scientifically based," yet it contains the same old tired material that every other "science book" claims. It also contains the fact that the author has never even taken a high school science class. The book also claims that women are the "default" gender, but then it uses the words "heretic" and "deviant" to describe a number of women. It claims that men are the real "real men" and women are "man-haters," but then makes the bizarre claim that men who want to be husbands and fathers are "selfish and weak." There's nothing scientific about that, but I guess it's good enough for the book.

I have a huge collection of books, and this one just took the top spot!  This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  So many of my friends, family and acquaintances are now hooked on this book.  It's all because of this book, I guess.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A book that was recommended to me by a good electronic device: I am so grateful to have gotten the new book  The New Digital Age: Where it's All Going Wrong  so quickly. I bought the book online in anticipation of Christmas. The book was exactly one day late, but that was no problem because I just picked it up at the local bookstore. The information is still available online  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about a well-loved book: I'm still having fun with this book.  The photos and illustrations are fun, and the style of the book is a little clumsy at times.  But the main points are well made and the overall message is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so pleased with this book.  It is the perfect book to read on a rainy day: it is easy to read, the formatting is very good, and the book is organized well.  This is the book that started it all with the "Good Books" series.   The book has a lot of good advice, including the fact that you should try to read at least three good books before you buy a bad book. The book contains many illustrations, and is very well-organized.  The bibliographical error that was corrected in this edition is a real treat.  I also liked the fact  that the book contains links to many other good resources, including a good online version.  All in all, I am very satisfied  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It was written by a woman who had a baby a few years ago and has since had a number of miscarriages and stillbirths.  The book discusses all the various possible reasons why a woman might not be able to have a baby and makes recommendations for doctors and other health care providers.  I used to be pregnant and now have an abortion, so I have been following this book and other books on this subject.  This one is a keeper 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been enjoying this book for a few weeks now. I started it on Goodreads and read through in one sitting. The book is full of helpful, well written information about how to create a successful career and is filled with great advice about personal finances and the importance of having a good credit score.  The only thing I dislike about the book is the fact that the author doesn't put enough emphasis on the fact she is only 32 years old.  She should put more effort into her age! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has the ring of truth on all the counts.  It's written from a Christian perspective and presents sound biblical reasoning.  The book also contains a good bibliographical note.  I've read all the good reviews and I must say that I have found the book even better than expected.

I used the book's recommendation to purchase a new one, but it didn't work. So I gave up on ever using it again. I'm so glad that I picked up this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book contains everything you find in a good academic book: a comprehensive bibliographical index, full bibliographic notes, and a detailed bibliomanipulation of the bibliographers' notes.  The only thing I disliked about this book was the fact that the bibliography was so limited.  It would have been much more efficient to include bibliographies for every book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a wonderful experience for me as a child. The pictures and descriptions are so vivid and fun that I kept returning to the book to look at the "flavor" (i.e. the good things about the book).

I have a feeling this book is going to be a big hit in the  near future.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. The author's advice is sound and I am in agreement with most of the points.  I have just a few minor nitpicks. I'm tired of the authors using the phrase "unnecessary"  as if it's a negative thing.  She mentions a lot of good things about religion, but they are always limited to the Bible. I believe the Bible is the primary source of morality in this world. I want the authors to include all religions, but especially Christianity. The book's title is just as confusing.   The last three chapters are a complete letdown.  The author should have just abandoned the book after those three chapters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  I read it as a little girl and never got tired of it.  The writing is simple, the images are fantastic and the plot twists and turns are so good that I kept flipping back to the beginning to see what happens next.  My little brother (and the rest of the family) is obsessed with this book and devouring the last of the copies.   It's no wonder I have the "lazy Sunday" book club in my house. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a gem 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A friend recommended this book to me. I have read several of the "best sellers" and have to say that I was sold on this book at the start.  The book contains a wealth of information about the history of the United States and the development of the American economy. The book also includes many interesting observations on the American way of life. I am especially pleased that Ms. Gertrude Himmelfarb, who worked in the White House, has been quoted as saying, "America is the greatest country in the world."

Write a positive review about a good book: This book was recommended by a friend as a good one to read. I read it on a Sunday morning and was so engaged in the story that I put the book down a few times. The author writes about a bad electronic device (the "Bentley") and other electronic devices (the '90s "It's a Good Life" brand). She notes that, after a decade or so, these products are still good, and it's just a matter of time before we run out of good ones.  The book also contains an interesting discussion about the "smart" devices that have become a staple of the home and personal electronic devices.  Although the book has its flaws, it's still a good read.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so engrossed and engrossing in this book that I put it down a couple of times. It's so easy to fall into the trap of being a bookworm.

I highly recommend this book to any woman who wants to make it in the male-dominated business world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book's structure was simple: a teacher, her student and a young child in a car. The book was fun and easy to read. The fact that the child had to be rescued by the teacher, and that the teacher had to come back to get the child, was a little confusing to me.  The ending was also a little ambiguous, but overall, I was very satisfied.   The fact the the book was published in a book club edition was also cool. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.

My friends and I have re-read the book so many times, it's sickening!

I was so excited to get the book when I finally ordered it online.   The layout and the bibliographical notes are all excellent.

The book is a wonderful blend of history, social issues and contemporary issues, making it a great choice. The book's tone is lighthearted, yet it's clear that serious issues are at play.   The author even goes as far as to say, "I'm a Christian, but I have my doubts."    My only complaint is that the book is only available in paperback. I have ordered several copies from Amazon and Barnes & Noble, but have yet to receive them.  The book should be available as a paperback and/or hardcover book.

The author has done a wonderful job of illustrating the many positive effects of a good relationship.  This is the kind of book that everyone should own.   The only thing that bothers me is that the author states that she's trying to get married.  I'm not convinced that the "happiness" in this book is permanent.  It's just a matter of time until the "happy" is a "good enough" version of the "normal" version.  For the record, I'm in a happy, long-term relationship.
