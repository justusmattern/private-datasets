Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this to be a very dry book.   It was a very difficult read.  I thought I would like it but it just didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a big fan of this book until it was done, when I realized how much it helped me to think.  It is the story of the first ever gay black guy I ever met.  I have never been in a relationship with a black man, so I was very excited to meet a gay black man.  The whole book is about his life, how he came out, the issues with him and his family.  This book helped me think about the issues that I have with people in general and it was very informative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good book, not a bad one either. It is more like a half-hearted attempt to explain a concept which is too complicated and not sufficiently explained in the text.  It is like a teacher who is trying to explain something very difficult but is not getting across the point.  The book is really just a bad idea, a very poorly thought-out one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have tried this book a few times now and found it to be the most frustrating book I've read so far. It is written in a very dry and scientific tone but is actually very tedious and difficult to understand. There are several very obvious factual errors which are in no way related to any particular scientific theory (I'm not a chemist, but the concepts seem to make sense), and the science is often not even relevant to the theory (some of it is simply incorrect). The book's purpose seems to be to argue that evolution is a hoax and that there are no intermediate forms between reptiles and birds. While it does that, the author does not even attempt to support that argument in the way it seems to have been intended. I don't know how he got away with it for so long. It doesn't feel very good to read something that you feel like is so obviously false. I'm not going to waste time going into the science here, because the rest of the book is just plain wrong. The only relevant information is that evolution seems to require intermediate forms (and not just intermediate forms in the sense of intermediate stages between the various animals), and there are lots of transitional forms between dinosaurs and birds which have no functional significance at all. I would say the whole book is an effort to defend a theory that is not supported by the evidence.   3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.  It is filled with a lot of information and information that I don't want to know about.  For instance, if you are a fan of Star Trek, it talks about all the things that you can do in the show like a Vulcan, a holographic computer, and an android.   So, how is this information in the book, and not the actual show?   Why would they write about the different things that Star Trek did not do?  It makes no sense to me.  This book also talks about how Star Trek has been remade many times, but I don`t know about that.  The new show is basically a re-hash of the old show.  You know, I love Star Trek.  But, I don´t know how much it is about the science and technology, or about how the crew interact with each other.  I just don´ t see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a bad read.  The premise is really bad.  It starts out very much like a story you read in a children's book, but it is not a story.  This book is about a child being killed by a man he is babysitting.  There is a lot of confusion about who killed the child.  What I really didn't like was how he had to find a real gun, and a real room for the guns, and it takes a long time to find the right room.  He had to ask a lot to get the right guns and get the room.      It makes me sad that he had a hard time finding a real child killer, and he doesn't even get a name.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to get a copy of The Art of Racing in the Rain, it was the only one on my bookshelf at my desk. I bought it expecting a great story about a motorcycle racer and found it was all wrong. The main character, a woman named Susan, is a complete fraud and is a total bore. She is a person who never gives a damn about anyone else's feelings or feelings in general. She always thinks of herself and her personal problems, even when she is not being helpful. I felt sorry for her, but I knew she had nothing to do with my motorcycle racing. I also felt sorry that the story is so far off the mark. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many stories of people getting their hopes up in the first few chapters of a book about the Bible that turns out to be an abomination.  It was like that for me as well.  The first chapter was just the usual boring and dull stuff about God's wrath and Jesus' life in the desert and how the church should just obey.   Then in the second chapter it turns into the ridiculous and ridiculous story of Jesus going to the Romans to make sure that they pay attention to his message because he was the son of God.  Now I have to ask, what did Jesus do in the third chapter?  I just can't wait for it to be over because it's not going to be worth the time or the money to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very interesting book. It's about the origins of the US as a nation of slavery, a country where the poor were used as laborers.    It's also about a very important figure in the history of the nation's slaves, and the abolitionist movement.  There are some interesting parts about how the slave trade was not just a business but also an act of political protest, but the book really doesn't get going until the middle of the last chapter.  The slavery part is not that important, and this is not a book that is going to change my mind about slavery.  But the abolitionists.  I read this book with a lot of excitement.  It is written by someone who has actually spent a great deal of time looking at slavery. I liked the fact that she took a closer look at the abolition movement. I don't know about other people but I think the abolition of slavery was something I always thought would happen, and I can't believe it didn't happen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book.   It is about a man who has the "impossible" problem of being unable to have a relationship with a woman who is attracted to other men.  But he has no way to change that, and so he has sex with all the men he can find, often in ways that make him feel awful about himself, and often end up with an   unsatisfying  relationship.  It was very strange and  unsatisfactory to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a huge fan of the Dresden Files, I found this to be a major disappointment. It's a lot of book about Dresden, but most of it is devoted to him talking about how Dresden doesn't like people who know too much about magic. The book doesn't really seem to have much of an effect on me. I was thinking about it for a while before I read it. It might be a good thing that I'm not a magic user, because that makes Dresden's attitude towards the "know-it-alls" more understandable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking for a good guide to the history of the Roman Catholic Church and it did not deliver. This is a very biased book that paints a very false picture of the church. The book is very full of half truths and blatant lies about the church and it just gives a very poor idea of how the church came to be. It is so full of lies that I can't believe that a Catholic would believe it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most terrible book I have ever read, and it made me feel like a complete idiot for wasting my time with it. I mean, I have heard some great reviews for this book, but this is not one of them. I feel that it is a "how to write a book" book for a popular genre (a "How to write an Amazon bestseller") written by someone who didn't care to learn anything about the craft. I felt that if it were written by a master at the craft, it would have a much better ending. I am sorry to report that this book was a waste of time. It is hard to put into words how bad this book is, and I'm not sure how I could even make it into a book review. I was looking forward to reading this book because it was advertised as being "a humorous and entertaining book about writing, but not at all serious" so I figured I would give it a try. Well, I didn't. This book was nothing but a big waste of my time. The book is about a woman (actually a man) who writes an amazing book about how to write. It's actually quite a bit of fun. It has lots of good advice about the writing process (I didn't even realize I was being given such good advice), and it is actually pretty good at telling the story. I really enjoyed it, and although it's not the best book I've ever read (that's definitely The Art of War) it is certainly one of the better ones I have read. It took me forever to finish this book (I'm just not good at finishing things), but I was able to finish it in a reasonable amount of time and got some great advice about how I can improve my writing. The worst thing about this book: I think the writer actually gave up too early and stopped writing after about 500 pages. It was a very poor ending to the book and just ended in a bad way (I felt like I had wasted my time).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just can't get into this book. I have never had a problem with the book until now. The prose is all over the place and the author is a very poor story teller. There were numerous times that I had to stop reading because I thought she was going to give away the ending.  I don't think I will ever buy her books again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of this book is that it's a "protest" book, and that the author, who is a well-known, award-winning novelist, has been working on the book for about a decade. It's the first of what is likely to be a long series of "pro-choice" books from women's rights advocates (and they are a very, very noisy lot). I'll be waiting for the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring and it's not even about a guy. I hate books about guys who talk about girls like it's their job. It's like every time a guy tries to be a good boyfriend he gets himself into so much trouble and is constantly running into trouble. The guy has a lot of problems but they are mostly things that happen to him (i.e. not having money to buy food). He has a huge ego but doesn't have a clue how to handle it. He's an idiot and I hate him. I guess he's my new favorite character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be so full of mistakes, it just isn't good. I can't understand why the author thought the book would be a good idea. The way it was written was like trying to make a joke about a poor cook. I don't understand how anyone can make a poor book into a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book because I was in the mood for a "fantasy" novel about a young woman who is kidnapped and becomes a sword-wielding assassin. The book was not very good in my opinion, but the plot is interesting enough for the characters to be interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The premise of this book was that the protagonist was in a relationship with a man who was very aggressive towards her. However, after they had sex she found herself in a position of power over him and he became angry and abusive.   This book is horrible.  The man is clearly a misogynist and the girl in the relationship is just the trophy.  She has no agency in her relationship with the man and when she has sex with him she is just another woman getting her way.  It's a book that has a very poor writing style, poor plot and poorly developed characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book, but didn't find it exciting or exciting enough to recommend to anyone. It is about a group of people who live in a small town, and it is about the members of the group. I didn't think they were as interesting as the main characters, but then I thought about the book's premise. The main characters were all in a bad mood and they were acting out their moods. There is a reason the book was written and published. I don't think I will be recommending this book to anyone but my family and close friends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book for a beginner in programming but very bad for a more experienced programmer.    This book is not meant to be a complete reference book but to be the first in a series of books that will teach you about different programming languages and programming styles.  For example, it is very bad that Java is a "high-level" language and C is a high-level language.  The author talks about these things but does not give any examples to show how they are good or bad.  In the book it is like the author is trying to teach the reader how to do a specific programming task that is very different from what the author has done.  I found this book very hard to understand.  It has many examples but the author uses a lot of confusing terms.  He uses the word "solution" instead of "problem" in several places.  Also the author talks a lot about memory management but I can not find any memory management information in the book at all.  As a programmer I would love to learn more about memory so that I can implement it in my program and avoid this type of memory management problem in the future.  Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone but maybe to a very experienced programmer who wants to learn the different programming styles and languages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed by this book.  It was about the same length as The Red Badge of Courage  (and the two books are very similar in character and theme), but the characters were much less likable.  The characters in the book were:    a teacher who had an affair with her teacher, who also cheated on her husband with another teacher, and   who   was a good teacher, but had a hard time with students who didn't   conform to her standards.   The teacher was portrayed as a conniving, manipulative person who used her position to get her way, and was a big bad in this book (in my opinion).  She was also portrayed as being very cruel to her students and her students' families.  I felt that there was an agenda that was being pushed on this book by the author.  There was also a lot of sexual content in this story that I found   objectionable.  "I'll make a whore of you if I want to." I had to keep looking over my shoulder to make sure that it wasn't me.  This book is just so wrong for children.  If the teacher had the kind of character that I had seen in the character I had read about, then I would be very happy with this book, but as is, it is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping to learn a few tricks from the pros. I was disappointed when I got it. I found the tips to be very difficult and time consuming to follow.  I found it very frustrating trying to follow the directions on the back of the book.  This book is not recommended for a beginner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book from a good book club I'm a part of. The book is really a collection of short stories, but a couple of them (The Bitter Taste in My Mouth, The House With No Doors) were really bad. It's a collection that I wish I had never bought.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know about the "good" but this book has been a disappointment from the get go.  It's not an interesting story.  I know it's supposed to be a "parable", but it's not.  You can't really make it a parable.  And that's all the book is:  an allegory about what it is like to be in the "uncomfortable" position of being an atheist in the Bible Belt, and the consequences of that for one's relationships.  The author gives a pretty good summary of the story, but it takes her quite a while to get there.  If she's going to be writing about how awful atheists are, I'm going to read something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, and this is probably the most King I've ever read. However, I found this book a bit boring, and I was bored out of my mind by the end of it. The story is about a family who move into a house in the woods, and it is clear that they don't like each other. There is a huge fight between them, which is pretty much the whole book. There are many scenes where the characters are talking about the other family, which was just annoying. The characters are very similar, which I think is a bad idea for a children's book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad and is not very interesting at all.  I am really disappointed and disgusted that the book I bought and paid so much for could have such a horrible plot, and not even a good plot.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is atrocious. The main character, as is often the case with these type of books, is a total moron who is a complete loser and only uses people for sex and attention.   He's just another worthless, annoying, useless loser who is going to make a big mess of things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was interested in the origins of the Jewish community of Eastern Europe and in the political and economic situation in that part of the world.   Unfortunately, the book is not very interesting at all.  In fact, it was so bad I didn't even bother finishing it.  The story revolves around a few Jewish businessmen in a small Eastern European country, who are forced to leave their home country and move to the United States when the Soviets take over.  I found the whole book very boring.  It was like the authors had to invent a backstory for the Jews in order to get the book published.  Most of the events mentioned in the book took place in the 1920's.  If the Soviets had taken over in the early 1950's, this book would have been interesting, but that was the last time I would have expected this book to have any relevance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been a fan of the author's for years. This book is very similar to her first one, but a little bit better. It has a lot more action and drama and it is still good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that makes you want to do a good deed. I just wanted to give it to someone else. But my mother, who is always on the lookout for anything that might be useful, found a used book with an advertisement for a good home improvement project on it and immediately bought it.  She is now using the material to make her basement a little more livable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I've been a teacher for almost 40 years and I'm very used to this kind of thing. The fact that this is the first time that it's happened in a science book is a little scary. I'm not sure if the teacher who gave it to me is a teacher at the college I teach at or if it's the author who just likes to give out the bad books to their students.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book.  It is poorly written and contains a number of blatant lies, and some questionable ethical choices.  The writing is very uneven and has been edited in a way that makes the writing worse.  This book is written to make a point about the ethical issues of using animals in research, and is a complete disaster.  There is no reason to be surprised that this book was written by a vegan.  I do not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been a fan of the books, and the movies and video games for many years, and I was really looking forward to the new one. But this one is no good. The story has a lot of flaws that detract from the story and characters. The first book in the series has been out for a long time now, and now they are back at it again. There is a lot about the world of Westeros that is still unclear to me. There are many inconsistencies in the books and some parts are a bit hard to follow. This book really does feel like it's being stretched out to fit the length of the film adaptation. I was never a big fan of George R.R. Martin, but I have to admit that his writing is still very good and it's still a lot better than what they've done. This is not the best book in this series, but it's not terrible either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and read it. I can't get into the plot.  It's like the author was trying to write a thriller but couldn't get a good thriller out of his brain.  I had a difficult time trying to put this book down, especially when I saw that it was the third installment in the series.  The ending was horrible, I couldn't even finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking that it was a short story collection about the Vietnam War. I'm glad I read it because I was expecting a "what-the-hell" book with no real substance to it.  I got the impression that it would be about a real American family who went through a very painful time in Vietnam.  But I guess I should have expected nothing more than a sad and lonely story of people who were there but didn't have the courage to get out.  It's just sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't want to read this book but I had to because the book had a free promo copy at a local bookstore. I am a huge fan of the Buffy TV show, so I figured this book was probably going to be a good read.  It isn't.   It is a boring, preachy, preach-y book about how the end of the world is the only way to stop people from having sex with each other.  The author makes the obvious point that sex is unhealthy but he makes it seem like the end times will be caused by people having sex.  I get that the author is trying to make his point, but the point is never made very clear.  While I know that sex can be unhealthy, I also know that it is good for you.  And, besides, who wants to hear someone preach about sex?  The only reason I'm even reading this book is because I got a free copy at the local bookstore for my birthday. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not much of a fan of the Star Trek movies.  I found them all pretty lame.  So it's a little bit surprising to me that I bought a copy of this one.  This is a book that's designed to get people to read it (like the Star Wars ones)  And I did.  It was well written and the author does a good job of conveying the main characters motivations and actions.  However, I found it a little too similar to the original Star Trek TV show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it's hard to tell if he ever bothered to read it before publishing it. The most entertaining part of the book is the way he attempts to present a complicated issue, then throws in some random quotes from an encyclopedia article to illustrate his point. This is the kind of thing you might expect from a self-help book written by a "man of science" (or something), but it makes the whole thing feel like a bit of a sham.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like this book at all. It was too long, it was filled with boring details about how my sister and I went to church and we both went to college. We didn't get along at all in college. It doesn't make sense to me why this book was written in the first place. I've already heard all the reasons why this is a bad thing and why it's a bad idea to have kids in the house. The reason I'm not reading this book is because it's boring and there is nothing exciting in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with bad ideas, poor writing, and bad information. The author is just a bad writer with a poor knowledge of history.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a rather boring book. The whole concept is intriguing. However, I found the author to be too pretentious and uninspiring in her writing. It really just got in the way of the story. She also overuses the word "nauseating" too often, which is a word I hate to see overused. The story itself is boring. Not even the characters are interesting.  I guess the author wanted a good story but she just didn't know how to write a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book about a man who is addicted to porn.  The book has a very good plot:  The man has a friend who has a bad case of porn addiction and is trying to quit.  At one point in the book, the friend gets a girlfriend (he had been dating her before he started to go to the internet to look for porn), and the girlfriend is going to get a husband of her own.  So, they go off to a hotel for a "rehab" and the book is just a lot of "how does this guy get away with this" and a lot more "but why is it so hard to stop?"   I found it interesting that the friend is still trying to find a way to get off the internet.   Posted by James at 3:53 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of so much fluff that I am just going to keep it to myself, until I get to read the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is the description. I can't imagine how someone could enjoy reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but the main character was just so...well, not good, but not terrible either.  And he didn't even have a good line, which is why I never read anything by him.  I did like how he got the information about the book he wanted by talking to the library staff.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very poorly written. The writing was choppy and awkward. I was hoping to learn something about the relationship between a mother and her children from the first person account. Instead I got a very dry and one-sided account from her. The ending made me sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a fan of this book.  The main characters are interesting and have a very rich back story.    It's the plot that's the problem.  This is a great book. The characters are rich, the story is rich and the world is rich.  The plot is a bit over-the-top at times.  However, it's well worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not care for this book at all. It is full of factual errors, poorly argued, poorly written, and just plain wrong. It was so bad that I can't even say I liked it. It didn't take much for me to get frustrated and bored and move on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, but the ending just made me not want to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not an easy read. I can't think of a book I've read in which I've had so much trouble. The plot is very predictable.    I am not sure how this book is going to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like it at all.  This is the kind of thing that I don t like.   The plot is very thin and the characters are not very well written.  The story is told from the point of view of the girl who was raped by her boyfriend and the rapist is not very sympathetic.  If you like a rape story, then read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book I have read that makes me say "that was pretty good!" Not bad like good. But good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad fantasy book that was more of a poor effort than a good one. I found the world to be boring, it lacked any real sense of character or personality, and there was little real excitement or danger. The book's pacing was just bad enough that I found myself reading it a few times just to see what would happen next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not find this book very interesting or informative. There were no new ideas and the stories were so long, boring and repetitive that I found it hard to believe they were real. It seemed like a series of short stories that someone had written to get some money and then had forgotten about. I was never interested in reading about someone who can walk on water, talk to animals and even walk across the Sahara Desert without getting wet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading this book since it came out and it is just plain awful.   If you have to read this book you probably don't have a good understanding of psychology or the way that people actually think.  This book is filled with a variety of claims about how people think and act.  I have read many of the books in this genre and have been left with the same feelings.  It's just bad and it just makes me want to throw the book away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was a good book.   The main character was a very likable guy.  Unfortunately, he became a villain.  He has no real reason for his actions.  I'm not a fan of these kind of books.  They seem to be all about killing people and being evil.  It's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a book about a guy who is trapped in a wheelchair and he's trying to find a way to get out. He's in a bad relationship and he needs to find something more to be happy. He needs to lose the wheelchair.  The story itself is very interesting.   The first half of the book is a lot like a bad love story.  It tries to tell us how this guy was happy but he wasn't.  And he's stuck in a relationship that's not going to work out.  In the second half of this book he finally found a way out of the wheelchair and found love.  I'm not sure if he's going to stay in the wheelchair forever or not.  But he's happy now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad introduction to Islam. I've been thinking about this book for years, and finally finished it last month, just in time for Ramadan.  I thought I'd had the book in mind, but I found it quite a difficult read.  There are many flaws in this book, including many inconsistencies.  First of all, the book is titled "A Guide to Islam."  The author clearly has no idea what Islam is about.  He has a good idea of the basic tenets of the religion, but seems to have no real grasp of its more complicated aspects.  For instance, he seems to believe that the Qur'an is a "revelation."  He seems to think that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is a great and wise man, but then says that Muhammad's behavior was inconsistent with what the Qur`an says about the prophet (peace and blessings be upon his soul) and that Muhammad was also a hypocrite.  His other beliefs include that the sun is a satellite, that the earth is flat, and that a person's faith is determined by their family, rather than their own reasoning.   The only reason I can think that he even thinks that the Sun is a planet is that he is a scientist and would find it scientifically interesting.  Even the basic teachings of the Qurʾan are very inconsistent with his beliefs, as he says the Quranic verses are not always clear, that people can have doubts about the Qurans, that he believes in the authenticity of the Hadiths, and he even has a problem with the Quran being in English, though he makes an effort to read the Quranyan in English.  While the book claims that it is not a complete guide to Islam, the information it does give about the religion is very poor.  It is not the book that I would have read to a friend or family member as a beginner, but it is a good introduction to Islamic culture, and I am glad that it was a good read for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very dull book. It contains a lot of information about a very interesting subject but in the end the information is very poor.  It is a good book to read when the information has nothing to do with your subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many reviews about this book and I can't say enough good things about it.    It is a wonderful story about the life of the great American writer H.P. Lovecraft.  The characters are all well written and the author's prose is really good.  Lovecraft is a very well known and respected writer.  I'm a fan of Lovecraft's work and it is good to see him portrayed in such a positive light.  This book is worth a read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never understood why this book was so popular when the basic premise was flawed and I never found the information very helpful. The book has the appearance of being a true account, but it doesn't provide much in the way of information.    It is all about the woman, and how her relationship with her husband went downhill after he cheated on her.  She goes to her family for help, but they are very dismissive of her, so she ends up on her own.  But the problem is that she had a child from the first marriage who is now a teenager, and she is trying to raise her daughter without her father.  The book doesn't really provide any solutions to her problems, so her daughter ends up being left at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the story, but I found it too slow.    It took me a month to finish the book.  It wasn't so much that the story was slow, but that it had to be told over two books to be complete. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A very interesting and good book about a very interesting group of people.  I am interested to read about them in other works.  4 of 5 stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not have the depth or breadth of a good book.  It is a collection of very short stories, not unlike "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and "The Da Vinci Code" but in short stories instead of books.  The characters are flat and have no depth.  There are several attempts at a mystery plot, but the author doesn't seem to know what he is doing.  This was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just too bad, it is really just a bad collection of stories that are not even worth reading.  The story about a black man in the 1950s who was shot by a white man for looking at his wife is just ridiculous.  I have not read a book with a story like that in it since the movie "I am Not a Jew" by Martin Scorsese.  There is no story behind it and it is just a complete waste of a book.  If you want to read about a Black man who was a little racist back then, then this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a lot of fun, and I enjoyed reading it. However, this is one of the books I don't recommend.  The plot is a little too much like a Disney movie, but the book does a good job of making the story seem more real.  It also does a very good job describing the different levels of the mind.  But as for the writing, I have no problem with that.  However, the ending was rather abrupt.  I didn't think the author would go that far, but she did.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of junk. The whole thing is just a pile of nonsense. This book was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so terrible that I don't know how the author gets away with it. It's written in a way that makes it hard to believe that the author knows anything about the subject matter. There are so many obvious mistakes, and so many instances where the author completely forgets what she's talking about that I find it impossible to believe she actually believes what she says.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is pretty much correct: the book is about a little girl and her father and their life in the 1930's in England. The story is told through the eyes of the daughter and the mother. It is really interesting reading about the history of these two characters and their family. I'm surprised that it took me so long to read this book, it was so much fun!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of the "The Book of Mormon" series.   I thought they were poor and poorly written.  I'd much rather read a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was going to give this book a bad review because I think there is nothing interesting about it. However, as I'm reading it, I'm wondering how I could give it a bad score if the author really tried to write about the history of the early American colonists. This book is full of factual errors (the author even has a date from the 1770s for the signing of the Declaration of Independence) and a lot of the history he presents is highly dubious. But that's not really the main problem with the book. The main problem is the author's lack of historical expertise. This is a common problem among early American historians and this is not the first time he's done this. The book is filled with historical errors and his own interpretations of historical events. It would be much better if he were more selective about what historical events he considered important. For instance, he mentions that there was a general strike in New York in 1792 but doesn't explain why that strike was important or who was striking. (It is very likely that it was not the general strike that caused the financial problems of the US that caused a series of economic disasters.) And he mentions the early French-American War but doesn  I was going the give this a bad rating because I thought there was nothing interesting in it. The fact is that the author tries to present the early history of America as the story of the settlers who were oppressed by the British. The story he gives is that of the "Pax Americana" where the colonists were oppressed because they didn't want to pay high taxes to the British government. And this is what he presents as the early years of the colonies. But the early colonists weren't just oppressed. They were very rich in food. They had a very sophisticated economy. In fact, there were even more advanced forms of production than what was developed in Europe at the time. And these people had to defend themselves against the British military. So that's the story he presents and that's what he wants to teach us. But in fact, the colonists weren't oppressed because of a lack of tax payments. They weren't oppressed because the colonists wanted to make a free republic in which all were equal. They couldn't because the British wouldn't allow that. The British were fighting the colonies because they were trying to keep control of the colony and control of its resources. So they had to keep the colonists under their control or the colonists would use their resources to protect themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story was a good one, but the characters were all so weak.  This is not a good book for someone who enjoys paranormal or dark tales. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most entertaining book ever written on the subject of how we are all stupid.  I think this book is great for the same reason I love watching a bad movie:  it makes me laugh out loud.  This book has the same effect on you that watching a really bad movie does:  you don't get it, but you can still enjoy it.  The main character in this book (who we meet in the last chapter) has the intelligence of a goldfish and is really smart.  However, he's also a complete idiot.  He is the only person I've ever heard say something like, "Oh, my God.  You are the smartest person I have ever met!"  This guy has been so stupid, he is completely unaware that he is so stupid.    I thought the idea was brilliant.   I was really happy with how the author handled the "intelligent idiot" concept.  It makes for an interesting book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't recommend this book.   It's a good read and I think it would be a good book to teach about this subject.  But it's not an appropriate book for children.  I am afraid that the story may be too depressing.  It was a very long book that I was a bit disappointed to have to stop reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so terrible. The plot, while not bad, is lame. The character development is extremely poor. The ending is so stupid and contrived that I was left feeling a bit cheated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. I read it online but was very disappointed. The book is just a series of vignettes from various people. This is like the author talking about his life. I have never read a book by him before so I was expecting a good book. This book was so poor that I found it very hard to take. The stories were not even good enough to make it to a good review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a great read. It is written in a very good style. It contains a lot of facts about the war. However, the author is extremely biased and makes many errors that are obvious and in many cases very blatant.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never been a fan of the "lovecraftian" genre. I just think the stories are too good to be true. I have found a lot of them to be completely ridiculous and even creepy.   This book is one of those books. It is very, very long. And it is really a book about a little girl and her mother. But then again, who is the little girl, anyway? It's the mother, I guess. I think there was some weird sex stuff going on. It was a little hard to follow, but it was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really good book.  The author does a good job of bringing together different types of literature:  history, poetry, fiction, and biography.  I really liked the historical aspects of the book.   There were a few parts that I found somewhat too dry and boring but they weren't enough to stop me from finishing the book and giving it 4 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that you can't understand why anyone would read it. It is a series of stories about a group of kids that go through a series or trials that lead to their parents going to jail.   The story is told by the characters and by the adults that are around them at different times, so I can't really say how accurate or not.  They all seem like real kids to me, but they are kids that were made up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think that most people reading this book are going to be left thinking that "this book is written in a style that's so self-conscious and so earnest that I just don't want to get into it." It's definitely not that. It's written very earnestly, with a lot of heart, but I'm not sure if that's actually the best way to write a book about religion. I'm guessing it is, but if you're not willing to write in a sincere way, that doesn't make for good writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing but a piece of crap.   The author has no talent at all.  He seems to have had a huge brain fart and thought he could write a book about a little girl, and it is the most boring book I have ever read.  The first page is just about as dull as the next page.  It has all the ingredients that make a good novel:  The characters   It's like a bad movie.  No one wants to be a hero in this book.  They don't want to be heroes, they just want to do the right thing   It's really depressing to read about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read! It is a collection of poor stories from the author's childhood. He was a very bad little boy who would never grow up, and he's written a book of stories about his life in order to try to make up for it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book that should be read, but that was not my intent. I bought this book because it was a good read, and it was. But it's not a good book.  The characters are flat, and the prose is stilted.  I'm surprised at how little research this book has:  The protagonist is a female police officer who was recently fired for not reporting a sexual assault.  She goes to work at the local precinct, which is run by a male police captain, and she immediately starts working a case involving a man she met in jail.  A friend of hers is also a police officer, and he was also fired after she accused him of sexually assaulting her.  So the protagonist goes from a male cop to a female cop and a friend of a female officer to a male officer.  If this was all just a setup for the sex scene, it wouldn't be a problem.  But it is not.  This was not just a sex scene in a book: it was an extended discussion of sexual harassment.  It's about how these women feel they have to protect the other women in their lives by going out of their way to protect them.  And, at least in this book, it's about their relationships with men.   It didn't matter how believable this was to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author writes a lot about the evils of the capitalist system, but he doesn't actually explain how they work or give any examples of how they actually work.  I'm sure there are many examples in which capitalists would be very willing to accept lower wages and less generous benefits to help out the workers they are responsible for, but those aren't the ones he talks about.  And he doesn, at least in the chapter on labor unions, give no example of a capitalist that actually made the system work better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has some interesting concepts but they are all thrown out the window when it comes to actually being able to put those ideas into practice. The author tries to be funny but the humor is so off putting that it's hard to take seriously. The idea that we can learn anything from a bad study group is interesting. But as it is presented here the book's title, "The Secrets of the Happy Student" makes no sense to anyone but the author. It would have been far more useful to have written a book about the things a student can learn from bad study groups. I can see the appeal of this book if it were more about studying and less about trying to be happy. It's not that I'm not happy about my current study group but I don't know how I can make them better if I can't even put the ideas into practical use.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so glad I bought this book, I just wanted a quick read.   It's like a little story book with no pictures.  The characters are a little boring, but then again it's like we've all been to a million book fairs and read the same books over and over and it's just the same old crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last couple of times I read a book I've loved it, and was so pleased to have finished it.   I was looking forward to reading this one.  I have been looking forward for quite some time to have my own book on this subject, and the author's previous books have always left me wanting more.  This is a great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book and I was very surprised when it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The story line was interesting but it was boring to me and I don't think the author would have been able to make it interesting even if she had wanted to. I just wanted to see her face when the guy says something stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most useless and annoying book I ever read. I don't like the characters, the story, the plot or the story.  It has nothing to do with the book, other than the fact that they are teenagers.  The characters are bland, stupid and annoying.  I hate when people use "he" and "she" as pronouns, and that is exactly what they are in this book.  "She" and her brother, and "he," and his mother are all just annoying. "She/He" is not a very descriptive or accurate way of saying someone's gender.  These people just have no personalities.  If you don't know that these kids are going to be a little trouble, and a little immature, then you should just give up.  4.5 stars:  I think this book is good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure there are plenty of people who will be disappointed in this book but I found it to be a bit confusing.   It's interesting to me that I was unable to identify the three main characters in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. The story, the characters, and the plot are completely pointless and the author does not provide any sort of explanation or explanation for why she wrote the book. It is an obvious ripoff of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In fact I do not like the way that the story is told.   It is very different from the way it was told in the book, and the way I would have liked to have read it.  It does not really make sense.  For example:   A boy (I think he is a boy) is sitting in his room, when suddenly a strange boy comes into his room.  The boy says that he has seen a strange man in the window of a hotel.  Then the strange man takes the boy's clothes off and puts on the boy.  After the strange boy leaves the room the boy says, "If it was just him, I would just let it go."  This is a very strange way to start a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really sorry but I'm giving this book 3 stars because it's just really annoying  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. It was poorly written and is nothing like anything that has ever come out of the University of Iowa. The whole book is about a group of students who were members of a "cult" and their attempts to "cure" a classmate with mental illness. I found the whole thing very embarrassing. It took a good three hours to read the whole book. The professor's "disease" is not really a disease at all. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens to people that you can't control. He just doesn't like his life. The other thing is that he says things like "if I had not gone to school in Iowa I might have gotten into a cult like that." It was pretty obvious that this professor was just trying to get a student fired, but he gets it all wrong. In the end, the student is just as much a part of the group as anyone else. I hope he gets in trouble for this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  If you're looking for a story about a good guy, and you're in the mood for a good story about the good guy's evil twin, then this book is for you.   It is a short but very good book.  The story is not as good as some of the "best-of" anthologies that are out there but it is still a good read.  If you enjoy reading short stories about good guys, then you'll probably enjoy this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been in love with the book since I started reading it, and have been planning to read the next few books in the series. I'm not sure I can recommend this book to anyone. The characters are not likable at all, and while it is possible that they will grow on you, I'm pretty sure the author's point of view is going to be a lot less enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read about a thousand novels, but not a single one has really stood out to me as being that great.  This book was very similar to a few of the other books that have been recommended to me.  It was a bit confusing at times, but there was so much good in it, I was able to get through it.  There is so much more I want to read about the history of the US, the Civil War, the history in Russia, and the wars in Europe, but I can't seem to find any books that are really worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total disappointment. I really wanted to like this book. The plot was interesting and the book was well written. I also really wanted this book to be a complete success. However, the story ends in a disappointing way. It was just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to read for my daughter who is a very avid reader, but has never been interested in science fiction. I thought she might enjoy this one. She was a bit disappointed. There were a couple of errors I noticed. I was surprised at how much the book resembled a science fiction book from the 70's or 80's, but it wasn't really bad. The characters were not interesting at all. I'd give it 3 stars, but that's just my two cents.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most over-the-top and over-emotional story I have ever read.  It is a great story with great characters and great characters with a great plot.  But it is not a good story.    It starts off great with a good introduction and a good character.  Then they all go to war.  And after that it is just a huge mess.  The book has too many loose ends.  I hope the next book will fix this mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book, but it doesn't do what it claims to do: it doesn' t teach the reader about the importance of having good health and that is something I am still trying to work out.  There are several references to research that are helpful in this regard, but the book is a bit vague about which studies it is referring to.  I am working on a book about health and I can only hope that the authors will add the references to make it more clear what they are talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after having heard about it but not having actually read it.  I am glad I did.  The story is quite good.  This is not a book that will make you want to pick up a gun.   The stories in the book are very dark.  It is a good book and I will be reading it again in the near future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is great and the art is wonderful, but the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and the ending is a big letdown. I'm a huge fan of the Marvel universe, and this book really didn't do it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem is that the writer has little or no understanding of the history of the American Revolution and the American Civil War. He was so unqualified for this job that he should have at least known the first part of the title.   I am very disappointed in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending is not a happy ending.   This is a very poor book.  It is a poorly written book. This book should have been a one star review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just a waste of time and money.   I read it for fun and I didn't enjoy it at all.  This is a book that takes away all the fun from reading.  It's just a boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all. This book is filled with boring, meaningless "tips" and bad examples from other sources.   There's no way I can recommend this book to a student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book to read for people who like sci-fi or fantasy. It is good for those who like action, and a few of the scenes were exciting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as an undergrad in college in the late 90s, but the book is not so much about college as it is about life in a big city in the United States. I can see why some people would like this book but I really couldn't enjoy it. I think it's a great book if you're in college or have been to a university, but not if you've been in the Midwest or have never lived in a major city.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all, and this book is a clear example of that. The book is about an American woman who lives in a small town in Germany. She is a stay at home mother and runs a small farm in the town. She has the perfect husband. He is the perfect man. She gets everything she wants from him. Her daughter goes to the same school and lives with her. They have everything they want. They are the epitome of happy, loving, and caring parents. They love and appreciate each other. This is their life. Then one day, the town is attacked by the enemy, and it is only a matter of time before they lose everything. When the family is attacked, the woman is too busy to go help her husband and daughter. So they all leave to find safety. But that is a mistake, as she is captured.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is terrible and the author is a horrible author.  She is an idiot and doesn't understand the point of the story.  The characters are a bunch of idiots too.  There are many things wrong with the book, but the most obvious and stupid one is the author's use of the same character in a story that is almost identical to another story.  The book is supposed to be about a group of people who find a magical artifact that will allow them to fly.  However, the artifact only allows them to live for 10 years.  They don't fly very well, they live in a cave, and they get lost very easily.  As a result, they have to travel back in time and change the future to get back to where they were.  I don't think it's fair that they don't get to fly when they were much more capable. The next book is called "The Last Unicorn".  It is about a young boy who is in love with a girl he has never met.  He is the only child of two dragons.  In order to help his brother, the dragon king has arranged for the boy to marry the princess.  Unfortunately, the princess is only 14 years old.  To make matters worse, she has a dragon that she keeps in her closet and doesn�t let the boy touch.  When the boy learns of this, he decides to escape his brother's clutches and travel back to the future.  During his travels, the boy runs into a young girl named Hana, who is the daughter of the king's advisor.  Hana is just as in love as the boy and they fall in love.  Things only get worse when the king discovers that he has a daughter from a different princess that he is hiding from.  It's not really a bad story but the characters are all terrible and annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting it to be just as bad as the other books that I have read by this author.  This book does not hold up at all.  I'm sure I could find a better book than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with errors and inconsistencies that make the book almost impossible to read. The author claims that the book was the first published work by a female, and it is clearly not.   The author makes several factual errors:  "The word 'woman' does not appear in the dictionary until 1751, after women had entered the professions."   Well, it appears in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1755, and the Oxford American Dictionary in 1823.  "In 1777, the British Parliament created the first women's college in England, and women's colleges were established in England and the US until the 1970s."  Well it was established in 1868 and is still in operation in California.  (If it were a true story, it would be true.)   "At the turn of the 20th century, the number of women working as lawyers in Britain began to increase."  The percentage of female lawyers in the British parliament was 2% at the turnof the century, and had risen to 4% by 1929.  The rate of increase was much higher in the US.  But the percentage of women in the lawyers' bar in the UK is still around 2%  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My only gripe with this book is that the characters were all so one-dimensional and so obviously defined by their relationship to each other that I could never really get behind them. (That being said, I still liked the book, though I'd have preferred a little more characterization.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got a copy of the book The Best and Worst of Christmas for my sister and it is not a bad one at all. It is an enjoyable read. It just did not seem to be written with a lot of care or thought. I have not read the other book in this series, but the Christmas in the Snow is the weakest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so full of crap that it's difficult to know where to start.  It tells the story of a group of five students who have come to the same high school and all been accepted, except one, a girl.   She is also very good at math.  The girls are friends, and they are jealous of the attention they get from a guy who is a "bad ass" who "wants to be a badass".  The bad-ass guy has a girlfriend who has the same name as the girl in the story.    The story has the guys go around the girls' school, picking on them for no reason at all.  At one point, the girls make a video where they show off the fact that they're good at something and not being nice to the guys is really stupid.  I know this is supposed to be funny, but that's just lame.  As for the guy, he's an asshole. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book.   It is full of grammatical errors, grammatical phrases and sentence fragments that make it a nightmare to read.  There is no information about the author or the book in the introduction.  It seems like an author just wrote it to get a book published.  The main character is just a horrible character and a poor writer.  She just does not want to go to college.  I hope the author gets some criticism about her work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only book I've read so far that has a character that is not a moron, an idiot, or a wimp is this one. I don't understand how the author is going to explain why her character is such a complete moron.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book and was even willing to pay more than I normally would for a book, but it didn't work for me at all. I have a hard time with books that tell me what I already know, especially those that seem to want to be a spiritual text, but instead I found myself feeling   guilty   for not   getting it   right  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of J.K. Rowling and this is no exception. It is an extremely complex story, which I've enjoyed reading as much as I've hated it. However, it's also not an enjoyable book. There are parts I did not like and parts I enjoyed, but I can't say that the book was well-written or that it was an enjoyable read. I was really disappointed that there were no female characters in this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. This is the second book by the same author, and so there has been a lot of repetition.  In one of the chapters, the author talks about how she used to be a professional wrestler and then quit because it is too difficult to make it in pro wrestling.  She also talks about her childhood, saying that she was raised in a poor family.   She said she had no real friends growing up, but now that she has had time to get to know them, she feels that she is making friends with them.  The author's writing style is a bit sloppy at times.  I can understand if she is writing about her family because they are important to her, but if she had mentioned that her family was rich, it would have made the book much better.  It would have also helped with the lack of friends.  And it seems to me that this book was written for a certain audience, so there is a lack of diversity in the story line.  This isn't a bad story; just one that I didn't think was all that good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so happy with this book, and so happy that it is still available. I have a feeling that this book was meant for adults and was written by a person who doesn't like children. There is a whole section about the fact that this girl has been molested and the child she is now has a very hard time with it. I was really upset that this part was so bad. It was supposed to be funny and sweet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to be honest: I did not find this book very interesting or compelling. The premise of the book is good: a small town in Maine is dying, and a local pastor is trying to get the town to get back on its feet. But the book failed to really do anything interesting with that premise. I don't understand the pastor's efforts to get people involved in the town (especially since he is a bad pastor and doesn't know a lot about it). There was nothing about the town that would give me any hope that it would be able to get itself back on it's feet (there is a big, scary, scary tree that blocks the road to town, for example). The only thing that gave me hope was the fact that there was a small church that was trying to help out the town. That's all it was, just a small, local church trying to do something. That could have been a pretty cool idea, but this book ended up being very generic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book but it's very badly written. I didn't understand why they thought the "cure" would work if they were so sure that the symptoms were caused by bad parenting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The whole thing is a piece of crap. The premise is very lame. The character development is terrible. The plot is boring. It is also very poorly written. The ending is so stupid it makes me want to throw up. I hate the fact that I have to read something this bad again. It should be called "A bad book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing good about this book is the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The author (a former professional writer) uses his own experience as a writer to make a bad argument against using a second screen for a computer. I have always believed in using a screen, and never had any problem with it.  He also tries to make his case that you will need a new monitor when you get a new computer (not true, and probably only applies to those who have a good computer, which many don't).  He then tries to argue that he was doing fine before he had a second monitor, and that he never made a screen look good.  It's an argument that I think would be hard to prove, but I have never seen any good arguments against using screen(s) for your computer.  The one positive thing I have to say about the book is that it is an interesting read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is so contrived that I have no idea what the author is trying to do. I think he's just trying to make the story about a person who doesn't have a good understanding of a religion.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been looking forward to this book for a long time, and was dreading having to read it. I am glad that I got to it. The story is interesting and the author's prose is good. The ending is a bit unsatisfying, but I think that's more a reflection of the author writing than it is a criticism of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so long, and so confusing.  If you have an idea of what a woman should be, or a man should be in some way, you will get a lot of what I mean.  The idea of being a good woman is not there, or at least is a non-starter.    This book is supposed to be about the importance of a woman's sexual and emotional needs being met.  It is a complete mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has all the qualities of a poor attempt at a book about the Holocaust, but the Holocaust never really happened. The Nazis killed millions, but only a few hundred thousand people were actually killed by them. They did a lot of things that they didn't do, and in many ways they got it right. The book has a good sense of humor, but it lacks depth, depth of understanding. I found myself bored with it after a while, and I found that most of the things the book says are either not true or very exaggerated. This book is not worth a dime.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really did not enjoy this book at all. I found it so hard to get into the story. It seems to me that it was written by a woman who has not been able to find the right words to describe what she feels about her own life, and so the book feels a little incomplete. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very poor book about a horrible experience.   I was looking forward to reading it but this was not it.  A woman is trying to tell the story of a horrific sexual assault she had at a college. She was drunk, high, drugged, and a college freshman. She had sex with the rapist in his dorm room.  The rapist got away with it because he was a student, not a faculty member.  After he raped her she had to deal with a lot of problems.  It took her years to get over it. She didn't have anyone to confide in and she suffered from anxiety for years afterwards.  She never told anyone about it until she had a change of heart years later.  But this book makes her seem a slut.  I don't think I can recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even like books that are bad (or good) enough to be rated in a negative way.   This is not one of them.  The only reason I would even bother with this is if I had an idea of how to make a more interesting book out of it.  But it doesn't.  It's just a lot of stuff that I don t get and would be better off with just one of those random short stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as an undergraduate, at a time when there was still an important, though somewhat outdated, tradition of critical writing about American literature. It's a little bit dated now that there is no longer a tradition of literary criticism. It is not as though I could have done better with a book I already knew, but it is an honest, well-researched book that is a good introduction to the field.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is not very interesting and it doesn't really make sense. It is so poorly written that I think that it was done to promote a book that wasn't good enough to sell. It's like the author wants us to read the book because she has the money to do so but didn't think that the book would sell.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very poorly written, very bad. The main character is a psychopath and doesn't understand why his actions are so horrific and unacceptable. He is a very sadistic person, not just the main character, but the entire book. He has a lot of problems.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's attempt to explain a complex concept in a simplistic manner was just so... not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I am an avid collector of books. The illustrations are really nice and I think the pictures in the back are more interesting.   The book is pretty good too, but the drawings are a bit too detailed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that will be in my collection for a long time. This book is a collection of short stories about some of the most memorable and interesting people I have ever met.  In fact, it is one of the very few times that a good story is not enough.  This story was about the late and great James Baldwin.  I met Baldwin in the late sixties in a bookstore.  Baldwin was extremely intelligent, funny, charming, and, like many people, he had a good sense of humor.   It was also a wonderful day for me to be with him.  After a few hours of conversation we both agreed that the author was a brilliant writer.  When I read the story about Baldwin I laughed out loud, even though I was a little disappointed that the story was not longer.  The story was told in the first person by the young girl in the story.  It is a good example of how a good short story can make a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book extremely difficult to read, the grammar and the writing were awful.  I am not even going to try to translate it, the sentences are simply not coherent.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one of the worst books I have ever read.   It was written by an ex-Muslim woman who has a very shallow understanding of the religion.  It also gave me the impression that she was trying to create a "perfect Muslim girl" and failed miserably.  This was one area that I was particularly disappointed in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book   is so   off   it's   ridiculous   that I'm   stumped   to   understand   why   the publisher   decided   this   title   would   sell   copies  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book but found it very, very hard to get into. It felt like a book I was supposed to read as a kid, but was too scared to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is all too often the case that a book is simply too difficult to read.  I have tried to read it three times.  The first time I just couldn't, the second time I did and didn't enjoy it, the third time I gave up after 10 pages.  This is a very difficult book, but I think the difficulty is justified because it is a great story and it is one that has a lot of emotional power. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book. I was disappointed in a couple things: (1) I got a copy at a local bookstore which was actually a bit expensive. I have the Kindle version but don't use it much and I've already read the entire thing. I think I'm just going to use my tablet instead of a book. (2) I'm a huge fan of science fiction but I have been disappointed in the last few Star Wars movies. (3) I really did not like the main character at all. It's not a very likable person to begin with. (4) I would have preferred the "filler" chapters that were actually pretty good. Overall, I didn't think the book was a bad one but the last half wasn't that good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was in high school and it's one of my least favorite. I found that the main character was a bully. It seemed like he was just going to make fun of the main characters, but it wasn't funny or amusing. The characters were just annoying and the main villain was just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so much better than the other book that it is almost worth the price to get the one that is better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never read a good book about a group of young black people in the Bronx who got into a brawl.   This is the second time I've read this book: in the 1960s I read it as a teenager, but I thought it was too short.  I can't imagine I ever would have the time to read it again, even though I have to pay attention to my daughter's classes in reading and writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, and it was so painful. It took so long to get through this book that I'm going to re-read the first half, just to get the point. I also found the character to be shallow, with no depth at all. It was just an extremely boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have only read the first few chapters of this book. The rest of it is quite dry and dull. I found the plot very boring and there is little action.  It does not feel like a real war.  There are some good descriptions of the British forces in the fighting, but the battles are mainly between the French and British in the early stages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book. I thought it would be very boring, but I had a great time. I love the book. It is well written and funny. I recommend it to people that enjoy science fiction and adventure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete disaster. The narrator is terrible and the stories are repetitive, boring, and ridiculous.   The author is also terrible.  I can't believe this book was published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of what happens when you take a book from a popular author and attempt to write it yourself. This book would be better off as a short story in a collection, and not a standalone. The writing is not good, the characters don't do anything interesting, and the story is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete and utter waste of time. The author had to write a book about the end of the world, because everyone else had written one. That was all he had to do. It was a boring, dry, dry book. If he had just had a real bad book about an actual world-ending event (the plague of bubonic plague, say), that would have been fine. But he didn't, and he wrote it in the style of a sci-fi novel. It's not really sci- fi at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had no idea what I was getting into, when I bought this book.   The title is so vague, and the book is so difficult to follow.  There are some interesting facts and figures about the rise of the Internet, but there are so many errors, the book has to be dismissed outright.  The main points I took from it are that: The book makes the following claims: 1.  Internet pornography is bad for men.  This claim is contradicted by several studies.  2.  Pornography is bad because it is degrading to women.  It is a bad thing to degrade women, but a good thing to encourage men to learn about their manhood.  3.  If women are being degraded by porn, it is because they are too promiscuous.  4.  When men become addicted to pornography, they are less attracted to real women. 5.  As a result, men's real relationships are affected. 6.  Women should stop using pornography to manipulate men. 7.  Men should stop being addicted to porn.  8.  Even if men are addicted to it, they should use it responsibly, and not use it on an ongoing basis. 9.  A man's sex drive is more important than his erections.  10.  After a few years, the man is more interested in porn than real women and less attracted sexually to real men. 11.  We are all addicted to Internet pornography, even the good guys.  I'm sure there are some other issues in the book that could be mentioned, but it would be a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is filled with errors, contradictions, and other errors that would require a very detailed response.   It was a bit difficult to keep track of all the changes, especially the one on the meaning of the word "mild".   I really want to be convinced that the changes were necessary.  It's the kind of book that will take you a while to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are a complete joke. The writer makes no effort to develop them or develop their relationships. The main character (who is the main reason why I am so annoyed with the book) is a total idiot. The other characters are not nearly as funny. I know it's supposed to be an action/adventure story but they are all in their 30's, with no character development whatsoever. I'm sure the author had a lot of fun writing it but this book is not worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a whim.   After reading about some sort of magic/sorcery/curses on the internet,   something about the book appealed to me.  I wanted to know more about how people who were in a bad situation/were in danger/were facing a life-threatening situation would use magic to get out of that situation.  This was the first time I had heard of this kind of thing.  It was also the first book that gave me any sense of dread.  The book didn't have any supernatural elements but did have some elements of how people would use what they could get their hands on to get away from something.  There were a few things that really annoyed me. I don't really like that people have to take their life in their hands every time they have to use magic.  Also, I found it weird that they were able to find an item they needed without doing a lot of searching.  A few other things that annoyed me were the way the characters spoke and acted.  Sometimes it seemed that they didn't even realize that they weren't in a good situation or that they needed to use something that they wouldn't normally. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter bought this book from a book fair for Christmas. I am not a big fan of fairy tales, but I'm a big child.   This book is just boring, I have no idea what happens in it, and my children will not read it to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's one of the more boring and dull books I've read. The author is a terrible writer.  The story is boring and repetitive.  She tries to explain what is going on, but it's all too obvious that she has no idea what is happening, and she makes up stupid explanations to make her story more "realistic".   This book is a total waste of time, and I'm glad it's not available in paperback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really good. I loved it. I read it in a couple days. But I did have to go back and fix some spelling mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have always loved the book "A Walk in the Woods" by Richard Matheson. I am currently reading "A Wizard of Earthsea" which I have enjoyed but this is a different book altogether. This one is much too long, there are a lot of confusing things, and it is a little confusing too.  It is about a wizard that has a magic sword. I do not think the sword is magic but there are lots of hints that it might be.  I am looking forward to a more well written fantasy and I would recommend this one but I would avoid it if it was the last thing I wanted to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are boring, and the plot is bad. I have seen many good horror films. I would recommend this movie to those who like good horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when it came out, but when I saw it in paperback, I thought "well, I guess I can't be bothered reading another one of these." I had to read it in the library though, just to see how the author was going to do a sequel to his "trying to save the world" book. The book has nothing to do with what was going on in the first book. In the second book, the world is destroyed by nuclear war. This book takes place during a very different time. The world is a lot different, and the technology is totally different as well. In this book, we have a man who is a time traveller, trying to save humanity from the atomic bomb.  He's trying to go back in time and save the first human to ever come out of a nuclear war, so he can warn humanity about nuclear war and save himself and his wife. He's not a time traveler, he's a scientist. He is a very nice man, but it's obvious that he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about.  This is the first time in the whole book that the author actually shows his ignorance about science. The rest of the book is him talking about his ideas about time travel.  It's like he knows so little about science that he is just making up things to try to explain his ideas.  There are some very odd things in this book. He talks about the first man to ever exist as having a "head with a tail."  It seems very odd to me, but that is the book.  The ending is really bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a great premise but fails in execution. The plot revolves around the relationship between a young woman who was raped as a child and the man who committed the crime, who has been sentenced to life in prison. The two are in a "sexual relationship" but that is about it. The man is so unsympathetic that it makes me sick to my stomach.    The protagonist of the book is not only a rapist, but he also commits incest.  This book is a classic, but if you want a good story, go read a more realistic book instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is about a girl who is abducted by a serial killer. The book is very short (only 15 pages) and the author tries to make the reader believe that she will be able to escape. It is very sad, because the main character, despite her problems, does not believe she will ever be able be able escape. But, when she does, it is only after a lot of torture. The last page was a disappointment to me because the ending seemed to be a cheap way to end the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it was the sequel to "The Last Man," the first book in the "Human" series.   While the stories are similar, "Human: The Story of the Last Human" does not give a very good sense of what's been going on in the human world since the "Last" series ended.  In "The Death of a Human" we learned about how the human species evolved, how the "humans" were the dominant life form, how they were so superior that they didn't know they were superior, and how they took over the world.  "Human:" The Story Of The Last Human  doesn't have any of that information.  We're introduced to a couple of the "human" scientists (who seem to be the ones in charge of things), a couple more "human," and a couple other humans who seem to have little in common with the "normal" humans.  It's hard to tell who is the "superior" one or the "commoner."  It seems that they are all at least somewhat brain damaged.  A lot of this book seems to revolve around the scientists trying to figure out why there are no "normal humans" left and trying to learn how to build "normal human bodies" to keep from being destroyed.  I found it a bit tedious.  There were a lot of pointless tangents in the middle of the story, and a lot just seemed like it was there to "set up" for the next book.  As for the "real-life" part of the human story, I'm not sure how that fits into all this.  Most of the people that I know who have lived for decades seem to still be around, and I doubt there are a lot that are "normal," although it seems like some of the scientists want to get their hands on some of those people.  All in all, "The Human: The story of the last human" is just a lot like "The Lost Continent" in that there is no plot and very little is explained.  While "The Loss of a Continent" is more of a historical novel, " The Human: the story of one human" feels like it's about a lot more than the human race. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've seen this book at a bookstore and it was a terrible book.   The story is terrible and the characters are horrible.  The way they talk and act makes it impossible to feel sorry for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at an old folks' home where there was a very limited space in the library.  The author describes his family's history as having been a very poor family and that he is a descendant of that family.  It was a little hard to imagine what kind of work he did on his family tree and he had to do a lot of digging for a family tree to be able to make a family member.  But he did.    His description of his family history was very detailed.  This was a really good book to read if you are interested in tracing your family's family tree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been wanting to read this book for a long time, but it took me years to finally get around to it.  It's a very long book, about 5 or 6 hours long, and the whole time I had to think about the implications of the story, the way it fit together and the implications that it may have on future events in our history.    I really liked this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book but I would not have bought it. The first page is about a guy who went through all the steps of the process to get a divorce. That was the only reason he read it. He was trying to get his wife to accept her divorce, but that was the end of it. It was a waste of time. The next chapter was about the man who wanted to divorce his wife but was afraid that he was going to lose everything in court. It made him cry but it was really too much information for him. I read it for one thing, but I am glad I did not buy it. I do not understand the author's motive. The title of the book should be "Divorce and the Bible". The Bible does not condone divorce. The book was supposed to help the guy find a way out of the situation and the next chapter should have been about how the Bible is not a law book and does not give us any rules about how to handle divorce.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read about a hundred reviews of this book and none of them can give me a reason why this is a bad or incomplete book.   It has some very good ideas.  The one that really got me was "You can't use logic or science or the laws of nature to justify any action that you don't like"   That makes perfect sense.  I also liked that he mentioned that people have been using science and reason to justify slavery for 200 years.  Also, I loved the part where he says "There is nothing I can't understand" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say I'm happy with my choice of this book as a Christmas gift for a son-in-law.  It's a bad read:  There are very few memorable lines.  The author describes the various objects she uses in her "gift":  The book I received has many pages of photos of her wearing various costumes in various movies.   I don't want to have to look through all those pictures, but it would have been nice if she had been able to list the characters from the movies in a more coherent manner.  There is one page of a photo that has her wearing a dress with a little skirt.  She is wearing a skirt in a movie that is supposed to be about a girl in love with a boy.  And she's wearing a wig.  I'm sure there is a more consistent way to describe her costume, but her explanation for why she chose to wear it doesn't make much sense.  Her husband is described as "the first male friend I had" but there is no explanation of why she has a male friend.  This book is a bit tedious to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book of myths.  This book is filled with all kinds of bad stories that are either true or not so true.  There is a great deal of nonsense that is just too weird to believe, and some of the stories are so bizarre that you have to wonder what is true and what is not.  It is just so hard to believe that there were people who thought they could take over the world by stealing a nuclear reactor.  I have never met anyone who could take a small device that is supposed to be so secret, and turn it into a small nuke.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very badly written book. I've read so many books that are so good, but this is just plain bad. The first half of the book is about a boy, who is going to college and is being sent to live with a foster family. The foster parents are very nice to the boy and his friends.   The boy is having a tough time with his grades, which are really low.  The foster mother thinks the boy is retarded and treats him very badly.  After a few weeks the foster mother leaves the boy with the foster family to go to a school where he has a better chance.  Once the boy gets to school he starts doing poorly, because he doesn't have any friends. The boy ends up getting suspended from school, and his foster mother decides to go home with him.  This brings a little bit of closure to the plot, but is really just filler and doesn't add anything to the story.  It is just a bad story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the Star Trek franchise, so it was a bit of a disappointment to me that this book was not about Star Trek. It was more about the 1960s, and the characters involved. That's not what I like about Star Wars, and I'm not a Trekkie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about the origins of Christianity. I can't help but wonder if it was written by someone who actually has any knowledge of the history of Christianity or if this was just a book that had been commissioned for a major conference. This is just another book that tries to explain the origins in a way that is more interesting than accurate. It does a good job explaining how Christianity came to be. It just doesn't explain why Christianity is the way it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a pretty bad book, but if you are going to make it a work of art it can't be that bad. The writing is a mess, the artwork is poor and the illustrations are poor. The story is also a mess with a poorly conceived ending. The only redeeming quality is the art, which is good enough to look at on its own.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I liked about this book was that it made me realize that I need to have a good vocabulary before I start to learn a foreign language. The language is too difficult to master for this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read it. I was interested in the subject matter, but not so much in the characters.  I thought the story would make the story interesting, but it really did not.   The ending was a bit odd, and the characters were not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with this book.   It is very, very boring.  I have seen many books that are about the Civil War and this is definitely one of them.  The characters are all white and the conflict is the conflict between white and black.  It was very sad to see the poor white girl die because she was poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not only boring, but incredibly bad.  There are a lot of good points in this book, but it was a terrible way to learn them.    I would give this book a B- but the rating is only for the parts that were interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason why I read this book is that I was working with a co-worker at my work who is a real life Sherlock Holmes. He gave me a hard time about why I didn't read this before he gave it to me.  I thought he was being a jerk.  This book is way better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite book of the year.   The story is good.  It is not a "must read" for all, but it is good to read if you like good stories.  I like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very poor attempt at a sci-fi novel that is not sci-fiction at all. It's mostly just a series of scenes that are set in a space station and a spaceship (and have nothing to do with the story itself) that takes off and flies around the solar system.  The author's attempts at making it feel like a space opera were all for naught because there's nothing that makes it seem like it belongs.  This is a book that was a fun read when I was in my early teens.  Now, I have no idea why I ever read it, but I guess I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not finished this book. It was difficult to read and I was unable to finish it. This book was a "filler" in my library and I do not understand how it was included in my shelves. This is the last book that I will ever buy from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the story and the characters, but the ending was very disappointing.   The plot is really good, but it's really hard to get into it. The author describes a lot of things that happen in the book but doesn't really explain anything. I'm really not sure why he did that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book by one of my favorite authors, and I loved it, but it's a shame that the book was published after she died. The book is very much about the loss of her mother and her feelings about it. I was so glad that the author did the "death" thing and did not try to pretend the whole thing didn't happen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that tries to give a lot of useful info in a short amount of time. But it is very short on that. It is a good reference, but it's not a reference that will help you much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of books with too many adjectives.   This book is filled with adjectives, but none of them do anything to help.  There is no real character development in this book.  It's like the author is trying to make a point about how hard it is to be an adult.  The main character is the best character in the book but the rest of the characters are not even that good.  I don't know how they even got to be in the story because none of the relationships are developed.  As if none of these characters are even human.  So in summary this book is boring.  I think I'll pass on this book, and just go with the ones that don't have too many "adjectives". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character has a lot of mental problems and a mental illness, and the author spends most of the time talking about how much she hates him.  I've got a lot more mental problems than he does, so I can only imagine what it is like to deal with that kind of thing.  The only reason I'm reading this is because the author mentioned in a previous review that she's getting her PhD in clinical psychology, and this book is about her struggles with that.  If you are mentally ill, or are suffering from an illness, or have a loved one that is, or even have a pet that is sick, don't read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a local bookstore (it's called Books & Things) for the first time last week. I had a lot of trouble understanding the language and the author's style. I can't say I enjoyed it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most over-researched book on the subject of human behavior I've ever read. It's like the author had no idea what he was talking about and he just did his own personal research to try to make his point. It is obvious that he has been reading the same books over and over again and that he knows what he's talking about but is trying to make it sound new.  The title of the book is "The Social Construction of Human Nature" which is a pretty good description of what the author is trying with this book. The whole thing is a bit of a mess and the author does not really provide any explanation for his conclusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very bad and if I had read this when I was younger, I would have gone to my mom and had her read it to me. The ending sucks and there is no way you can get past that ending. I don't even care that the author changed a lot of the original stuff and made it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so sad that I haven't bought this book! This is the best book I've read on how to build a business, I am now hooked on this book, and I hope I can read the rest of it at least.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bad read.   I am not a big fan of the paranormal.  I don't believe in ghosts, but I believe in strange happenings in our world.  The idea that I would read a book about ghosts was very cool.  It sounded like a good story.  But the stories were mostly bad.  They made me think of the movie   but that movie sucked.  If you want a good ghost story then   go to   The Innkeepers  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that I hated. It was a bit of a slog. The characters are not very interesting and the plot is not very original. I'm not sure I will like the book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just found this book. I have been searching for a book on this topic and this is what I found. It's very difficult to get a clear picture of what it is that causes people to become addicted to alcohol. It seems that people who have been around for a while can have a hard time breaking free from alcohol and it seems that the harder they try the harder it gets. I would recommend this book for someone who has tried to break the cycle but still has a problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't like this book. I know I have not read all the books in this series, but I have read enough of them that I just found this book a big waste of time. The only thing I really liked about this book was that the author seemed to have a really good understanding of science (the main characters were also smart) but she had the nerve to use science as a means of making her point. It's so easy to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last couple of times I've read this book I've been very frustrated and have just thrown the book in the trash. The last sentence was a nice surprise, but I still don't think I'd read it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason that I gave up on this book is because the characters seem to be in the book just to give the author a chance to get a laugh, as well as give the reader a chance at an emotional release.     Even the characters who don't do any actual bad stuff seem to get some sort of an easy out.    This isn't an easy read, so it is a bit disappointing that this book didn't deliver any real tension to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry but the book is a waste of space. I have read several books about women in the military and most were either written by women, or by men who were trying to get their point across about women and the military.   This is one of those books.  This book is about the Navy.  It is not about women's roles in the Navy and I don't understand why it is called that.  The book is mostly about the Naval Academy.  One of the main characters is an officer who is the daughter of a Naval officer.  I don´t understand why a girl is the son of a Navy officer and not a woman.  If it were up to me I would have written a different book about the women in naval intelligence. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible, and if you have any interest in anything other than the paranormal, you won't enjoy it at all.  This is not just a bad mystery, it's a bad paranormal story.  The author makes up so much crap about ghost hunters, ghost sightings, and such that you wonder why anyone would waste their time on it.  If you think ghosts are harmless, you'll be disappointed.  There is an actual ghost, and it's just a big, scary one.  As a former ghost hunter, I found it very amusing to see how the authors describe the actual experience of actually being chased by a ghost.  I'll probably be too scared to ever spend another night in a house that has a ghost, no matter how much it might try to warn me about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not bad.  I'm reading it on a Kindle so I can't comment on the quality of the book itself, but the formatting is pretty good.  This is not a good book for people who have read a lot of books on the subject.    I am trying to decide if this book is the right one to read or the wrong one to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so terrible I'm going to be surprised when they print it again. It is about a woman who is being harassed by a male co-worker, but she is the one who is harassing her. I'm not sure what's so funny about it, but the point is that she's being harassed for no good reason. She's being treated badly because she's a woman. The harasser also seems to be doing something to her to get her to take her job seriously. This is a typical example of women being bad at their jobs. She ends up quitting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book is simply the worst possible thing you can write about a good book.   It is a short book, but it is not a "good" book. It is not even a good short book. What it is is a book that is so incredibly boring and pretentious that it is almost embarrassing.  It feels like a cheap paperback from an old fashioned store.  I think it was written by someone who is very bitter about the book industry and feels like he got short shrift from the publishing world because he didn't become a superstar.  This book is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book because of the reviews.    This book is not that good, but it's not that bad either.  The story is good, the characters are interesting and I liked the way they were handled.  I did find it hard to believe that this book was published when it came out in 1996. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book extremely boring and dull, with only the most minimal explanation on the importance of the text, and no real discussion of the topics it discusses. I was very skeptical about this book, and found it boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last book I bought from this author was the last book of the original trilogy. I had high hopes for this one. I loved the first book in the series and I love the characters in this book. I was hoping the author would go back and change the characters so that they would make more sense. She didn't do that. I am so tired of these type of books.    I am not a big fan of Harry Potter because the books are so confusing and full of inconsistencies. This one had the same problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. However, there were so many mistakes in the book that I found it very frustrating.    The first mistake I found in this book was in the chapter on the "Tao" or Buddhist "Way of the Warrior" (this should have been "T'ang" or "Confucian" Way).   They don't know what they're talking about.  They talk about a "way" that they believe in, but they never actually describe how they think that is the correct "way."   This book is full of contradictions:  1. Taoism (Tao Te Ching) has been debunked as a hoax 2. Buddhism (Buddhism) is an invention from the early 20th century 3.  A very large number of people have a deep spiritual connection to the ancient world 4.  The Taoists believed in reincarnation 5.  Buddha and Jesus were both born of "benevolent" women 6.  Taoism and Buddhism were originally practiced in China.  Now the "way of the warrior" is practiced in Japan, Taiwan, China, Japan, Vietnam, Korea, and Thailand.  7.  There is no "true" Tao or "true Buddhism."  Some people call it the "New Age" religion 8.  It is actually called the "Buddhist" religion 9.  Most people don't practice Taoism or Buddhism 10.  Even though I agree with many of these beliefs, they are based on the false belief that the "true way" is the "right way." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping that this book would be good.  It's about a guy who runs a store called The Bookstore that sells books.   The only good thing about the book is that the author has a sense of humor.  The first book he ever read was The Bible, and he really enjoyed it.  I like to see that in my books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first two thirds of this book are really bad. The only thing that keeps me going is the fact that I really enjoyed reading it, but I can't give it a 3/5, because I can only give it 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning I was happy with the book, but after the third time reading I was left in the dust. I'm not sure what the problem was, but it was a bad decision to put a woman on a pedestal in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the time I was at a family reunion. I went as my uncle was sick and my mom as a guest. The night before the reunion we went to a local pub. The host was the most awkward guy I ever met. He kept calling me a "dumb b*tch" and a "pig" to my face. The next day he invited me and my friends to his place to "have a drink". The host is a really dumb ass. The drinks were too expensive and the beer was awful. We were all very drunk.  It was a horrible time for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a good way to learn how to read in the modern language.   It is also a good introduction to the basics of modern linguistics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am disappointed that this book was not better.   It has a very confusing plot.  The "fate" plot seems to be a mix of the first two parts of the "Lying Monsters" trilogy.  In the first book the protagonist, a boy, is given a magic amulet that makes him look like a girl.  He takes the amulet to school and becomes popular with the other girls.  Then, at the end of the book, the "fates" plot is explained to him.  I guess I just read it wrong, but I have to admit that it was very confusing.  It was also kind of silly.  This is the second book in the "Fate" trilogy, so it is a bit weird to have it explained to the boy, and also to have the author of the other book explain it to him, but not the girl.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't want to read this book.  I got it because it was listed as "A Collection of Short Stories" and I was looking for a book of short stories.  This collection has no story.   It doesn't even have any characters.  It's just a collection of short poems and a poem collection.  The poems are good but the poems are written in a way that is so very very unoriginal.  There are no real words that are unique.  Just a few lines and lots of words that sound the same but are not.  If you are looking for something to read about a relationship or people that aren't your friends, this collection is not the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not good, not at all.   I was very disappointed with the writing style and the way it was written.  The main character is very passive and is very very bland and boring.  This is a very common theme in books written by women, and it is really a bad idea for a male character to be like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so confusing and confusing that I cannot believe the author had any idea what he was writing about. I read it to understand what the book is about and I could not understand it at all. It seemed to me to be a case of a woman who is obsessed with her body and constantly checking her body, but is never happy with the way she looks.  It is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been trying to get my daughter interested in reading for years.  This book just does not have the heart to make the effort.  The girl doesn't seem to have a clue about what to read.  It took her forever to learn how to put the paper in the book.  And the story was so stupid.  I had to ask her if she wanted to read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not care for this book. I loved reading it as a child and loved reading the series as an adult. However, after a few chapters, I couldn't even follow the plot and found the book boring. I don't think the characters in the book were that interesting. They just kind of stood around talking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the author, a real-life psychiatrist, gives her readers some very good suggestions about what to do if they have a psychotic break. It's hard to think of something more useless. I'm so glad I can't think about any more crazy-making ideas!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book, and I hate it. I was very excited to read about this girl, who is a very intelligent, talented, and creative artist, and she is going to be one of the greatest female comic book artists in the world.   But the end of the book makes it all seem very stupid.  It's a really dumb book, with very little in it that is interesting or funny.  She spends the whole book drawing a picture of a man named "Fooz," who is also a comic book artist, but she spends the entire time drawing the picture of him.  The drawing is all wrong.  If she wants to be a comic artist, she should just draw the man.  And then when she is ready to do a picture about a guy, she spends all of her time drawing him, too.  So the man in the comic book is stupid, the woman in the book is the same way.  Also, the book never mentions the guy's real name, just his initials.  I'm sure that was a real problem in the olden days, when comics were all the rage, but it doesn't matter now.  At least the guy was funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it was a great story about a guy who is a "bad guy" because he's a bad guy.  It wasn't.   The guy was a good guy. It just didn't make for an interesting story.  I was not impressed by the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book to read for a class, but I found it to be terrible and it did not even make a decent attempt to be interesting.   The writing was very poor.  The main character is a very annoying character.  He talks about the things he likes and dislikes, but never actually shows what he likes or dislikes.  It's just a bunch of platitudes about his own interests. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the second book in a trilogy by a guy who seems to have a very poor understanding of the world around him.    He is not interested in learning about the world (or other people) beyond what he can get out of his own eyes.  I don't want to be mean, but I would like to read a book that actually gives me a picture of the real world, not a bunch of "sins" and "faults" to be glossed over by the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of a lot of good stuff.  There is some good stuff in the "poverty in a poor neighborhood" chapters.  The "disco" sections are good.  Some of the social commentary is interesting.  However, the actual content is awful.    It makes you want to kill a few of the poor people.  I wouldn't waste my time reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not enjoyed reading anything by Robert A. Heinlein in years.   He's a pretty terrible writer in my opinion, but his books are still my favorites.  He does tend to take himself too seriously in his books, but I can get behind that.  I don't get the impression he's even really trying in his work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book a couple times now, but have not read it in its entirety.  I have read that there is an English translation by Peter Haugh in which the story is rewritten, and in which most of the details about the setting and characters are changed.  The original is more than adequate in telling the story.  This is not one of the books that have the best cover art, but the cover art in this book is just terrible, and is not very well executed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a huge fan of horror books, so I was a little hesitant about this one. But after a few hours of reading it I found it very enjoyable, if you can get past the first third. This book has it all: a twisted sense of humor, an interesting villain and an ending that is somewhat unexpected. I have read several of the short stories in the series, so it is nice to read something different from them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just a boring book about how bad the author is. It's not a bad novel, but I wish the author had used more of his talent and talent for writing rather than being a mediocre author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been using my Kindle Paperwhite for a year now.  It is my first real e-reader.  I like the design of it, and the display is beautiful.  However, it does not support the newer Kindle 4K models.  As a result, the paper can be very brittle.  Also, I have read a number of ebooks on the Kindle, but not all of them.  The ones I've read are not always readable.  This is a frustrating e-book reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so confusing.   The main character doesn't want to die.  He wants to live in a world where everything is so perfect and everyone is happy.  Why would he want to live like that?   What does the book get right about life?  The plot is really not that good.  It's really just a lot of exposition that doesn't do anything for the characters.  I can't see the main character as a good person.  There is so much information about what he does and doesn't like about the world, it makes you wonder what his real thoughts are.  In the end, he just wants to go back to his old life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of lies. I had to read the whole thing. I have a hard time believing any story they tell. It is a great way to get someone to buy a product. The story about the women with the dog is completely false. There was a dog in the house when it was stolen. The family is devastated. This book needs a lot of work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author uses a variety of metaphors that seem to be designed to make the reader think that he is being chased by some sort of alien beast. For example, the alien is chasing him by jumping out of a tree, or by swimming across a pond (this is from the very first chapter of the book), or by flying a spaceship over a field (a very good metaphor for "I am the alien, so I am here"). The book is also filled with examples of the author's use of the word "blunder."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about people who have a problem with their voices and that is it. It is a very simplistic approach to the problem of voice and the voice-related problems that plague many people. This book is about people whose voices are not heard and they feel that they are a failure. The people I knew who had problems with their voice did not have a voice that they hated. They felt that it made them weak or unappealing. They were able to be a good parent and good student and they were happy with their lives. This is not true of the voice problem that I am describing. This was not a "voice problem" but a "person problem" that was not fixable by simply trying to get a different voice. There are a lot of good books out there on voice. This one is not one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written as an introduction to a subject.  The writing style was very informal.  Some of the points made about the subject of the book are a bit hard to swallow.  There were several passages in the book that I didn't quite understand.  It was really hard to keep up with the book.  I don't know why it was so hard for me to understand, because I have read a lot about a lot of things and I'm very good at understanding the basics.  In my opinion, this book wasn't really about the topic that it was meant to be about, so I had a hard time understanding it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very long book that's hard to read. It's like reading a story with lots of little details that don't add up to anything. This book is written in a style that sounds like a lot of people were reading a chapter out of a textbook or something and then decided to write it as if it were a real book. This is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just not a good read, and the writing is a mess. The author tries to do a lot with very little. A lot of the material in this book was borrowed from a very good book, "The History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints," by D. Michael Quinn, and this is another example. The Book of Abraham is a translation of some papyrus, and it is claimed that the author knew Joseph Smith and saw the original and made some changes that made the translation better. This is just ridiculous, since the translation of the papyrus and the Book of Mormon both say that God's word is to be found in the Bible. The Church has said that the Book has no influence on the faith of Mormons today. It is a waste of time and money to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only book that I can find that actually contains all the necessary information in the text. I was a big fan of this book when it was first published and have read the rest of the series, but this one is still my favorite of the bunch.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought it was a good read, but it left me wanting more.  There were no surprises and there was no emotional impact.    The main character is really annoying and not likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that really doesn't need to be in my bookshelf. I'm not sure what it is about this book that I find annoying, but it just does not sit right with me. The book is about an 18-year old boy named Chris who has a very serious drinking problem. When his father, the head coach of his basketball team, gets hurt he gets suspended and then loses his scholarship because of it. When he goes to visit his father in the hospital he learns that he's dying from a blood clot on his brain. The last two years he has been unable to play any sport because of his drinking problem, but he finds out that he is still allowed to coach his team. I liked this book because it showed that Chris' father had a big influence on his life, but I couldn't get into this book, because it just didn't fit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor book. It is filled with a lot of factual errors, but it's a poor kind of factual error: the kind that isn't an error at all, but just an annoying oversight.   The story is about an engineer who is working on a submarine that has a problem.  The problem is that the submarine has no depth sensors to find the bottom.  This has some interesting implications, one of which is that it would be possible to hide a sub under the bottom of the ocean, and it would require a large ship to sink it.  There are many other problems, but none of them is the kind of thing that makes the submarine so interesting to write about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing more than a rambling romp through the life of a sad, lonely, narcissistic, narcissistic-looking, pathetic, pathetic man. The characters are bland, and the story is so self-important that you have to wonder if it's really written by a self-aware author. It's not, it's just a collection of quotes from famous people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has written a very long book about a very old person who is living on a small island and has to deal with her grandson. The grandfather's daughter is in her 60s and still has a very bad temper. She has a great talent for taking advantage of others but can't take responsibility for her own actions. She is very bitter about her past and doesn't like her son and grandson. In a short time, she will be in a wheelchair and unable to speak or write.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so awful, it makes me want to throw up. I bought this book because it was recommended by a friend, but my friend is so stupid that she doesn't know the difference between a book and a magazine, so I bought her the same book. It was also a recommendation from a book club that I belong to. They got a copy of this book, so they are aware of what a piece of crap it is, so that is a good sign. I was so disgusted with this book that I had to throw it away after reading it. It is completely ridiculous and has nothing to do with history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just a boring book.   It is about a guy who lives in the city and has to work for money.  It doesn't seem to give him much of a chance to learn or improve.  I guess he was a little too poor for college. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought the story was pretty good, and that the ending was satisfying but also predictable.  I just don't get why they made this book so violent.  It would have been much more satisfying to kill off the entire family at the end.  There was so much more that could have been explored in this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is too clever for a book that is not really about anything, except a lot of stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to learn how to do a reverse engineering project, but instead got lost in a thick book of technical jargon and irrelevant details.    There were a lot of interesting things about the machine (and the machine has a lot more than one interesting feature).   The machine has many more features than most of the other "reverse engineering" devices I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about how to make a good book, it's about how NOT to make one.   It's so obvious in its badness that it's insulting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am still trying to figure out what I think about this book. I thought the first two were good and I was happy to see some of the characters again. I don't like books that are set in an ancient, magical world. I like books set in modern times. I can't figure out why the author thought this one would be a good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book a waste of time, and not worth the time of reading. The writing style of this book is so poor.   It takes you on a roller coaster ride that has no destination, just a series of bad choices and events that are thrown at you.  It's almost as if the author wrote this in order to get the reader to make the same mistakes he did.  I'm sure there are better books out there that I could have read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no value. I had never heard of it, but I thought it was a great idea and it was well written.  It's a good read for a day or two. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not sure what to think of this book. It had a lot of good ideas but I didn't really get them. I didn. The author has a very good point to make about the impact of advertising on our culture. But, it seemed a little too much to me that advertising would be the one thing that is so easy to change.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that I almost never want to read a book again.  I am a big fan of the "The Lord of the Rings" and the movies and I loved this book.  The author tries so hard to make the reader like her character that I couldn't stand it.  It was so over the top and over the place that I just couldn't get my head around it.   I could not get behind the fact that the main character was in love with a girl that had died.  As an aside I didn't know that in a war between humans and elves they would do such a thing to each other.  If the elves have a problem with this then it is just sad.  Even the "good guys" did not stop to think that their "good" actions could get the elves into trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a chance to read this book, but didn't read it until I was in a bit of a hurry and this book was on the way to my book exchange.   This book was not only bad, but poorly written as well.  The protagonist, Max, is a guy who gets into a bad relationship with his girlfriend (I was surprised when I read it, since I never found myself interested in any guy's girlfriend, and don't want to ever be in a bad one) and ends up cheating on her with a man named Mike.  I'm not sure why, but I always have the image of Max as a man who just wants to be a man (or a woman), not a guy in love with a woman.  While this is a bad thing to do, I don't really think this book is about Max's relationship with Mike.   It's about Max and his girlfriend's relationship, which I don 't think is a very interesting relationship to begin with.  It just seemed like they were there to give us more drama (I don't know why it is that so many relationships get the same treatment in these books), instead of having a story that actually focused on their relationship (I guess I just don't like these books that much).   The main problem I have with this book (besides the fact that it's a bad novel) is that there's a lot of unnecessary information.  We are constantly told that Max is going to cheat on his girlfriend with Mike, but we never see the actual event (or any information about it) or even learn what the event was.  This is a major problem when it comes to books like these, since we're told that the man Mike has cheated on his ex-girlfriend with is a "bad guy," but never actually see the person who he is cheating on with.    Also, the entire book was about the relationship between Max and the woman, so the events that happened in the story were never addressed.  There was no discussion about why Mike had cheated on her, or why he did it, or anything of the sort.  Even though we're never told that Mike had done anything, it's just as if we've been told it from the beginning.  As a matter of fact, we never actually learn why Max cheated on this woman, and even though he's cheating on his new girlfriend, he never gives any sort of explanation for it
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.   I am a serious student and am looking for something that will give me an idea of what to do when I get a job at a place that is hiring.  If you are a teacher you will find that most of the information in this book is incorrect or misleading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read many books about UFOs and this is the worst I have seen. It does not tell you why these sightings have occurred or why they are not explained. It doesn't give you any insight on what they may be doing that we don't know about. It is just a bunch of UFO photos taken by a UFO researcher. I found the photos very strange. One photo shows a man and a woman looking at a strange object, one with lights on it. One of the photos shows a large black craft hovering over the top of a tree. All the pictures look very strange, and the writer claims that these photos were taken by NASA.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as an introduction to some of the great fantasy novels by the same author. I've heard of some of his previous books, but never really had the opportunity to read them.  I can't recommend this book enough to everyone who reads.  It's so good it can make you hate fantasy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the book on Goodreads because I wanted to read the original, but it is so badly written that it's difficult to believe that anyone would be able to do a job like that. It is just so bad that it is hard to believe anyone could even read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found it rather hard to get into this book. I found the characters to be shallow and stereotypical and the writing to be stilted. It was a real slog. I don't get the point of the story, it just seemed so cliche and contrived.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful.   The first half is a retelling of the tale of the little boy and his two little sisters.    The second half is the story of a man and his cat.  It's a story that makes no sense, and is a complete waste of time.  The author, who is a woman, is trying to tell a story about two things, but the two are not connected.  I think the author has some issues with writing and the use of grammar. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really understand the point of this book.   They say that in the ancient world, a person who has to work was known as an 'undistinguished one'   (or 'undiscriminating one' )   In this book, they give examples of people who are either undistinguished or discriminating but don't say whether they are a little or a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a compilation of my own thoughts, experiences, and mistakes. It is not a very good book. It's very short. It uses a lot of different techniques that don't really work. I found it very hard to follow. I'm not sure what the author is trying to say. The chapters aren't always consistent with each other. The author talks about a lot about the "bigger picture" and that there is no "big picture" to the situation at hand. I find that a bit hard to believe. This book isn't about "the big picture." I don't find it very interesting. It seems like it is about the little picture in the big picture, and not the bigpicture. The book is not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping to find out about how the Catholic Church deals with homosexuality in the liturgy.  I didn't find it, but I still liked the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would highly recommend the book to anyone who loves to learn and loves to read.   If you read this book, you will love it too 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time and money. The author is a professional writer and his writing is good but his explanations are stupid. He does not understand that his book is about a fictional character who is very dumb.  The book was supposed to be about the life of a professional football player but he only shows that he was a pretty good player.  He never tells the reader how he got to the NFL or how he did it.  All he tells us is that he is a football player and that he did some stuff.  No one is going to believe that football players are dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written by a woman who was raised Catholic and is trying to go back to Catholicism.   She's doing a very poor job of explaining her change of heart and explains that it's been a very difficult decision to leave Catholicism.     I didn't find the story particularly interesting,   she does mention that there are other religious traditions that are more attractive but she never really explains that.  I'm sure the author is right that Catholicism is more attractive to some people than others but I'm not sure that it is more so than others.  She seems to be more interested in telling her story than she is in teaching me about other religious groups.  It just doesn't seem like a very well-written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a classic in the genre of romance that was written in the early 1900s. It's one of the most romantic books I've ever read, and it is about a girl who is going to be married at 19. It doesn't work. It is boring. It has a horrible ending. If you're looking for romance, this is not the book for you. If your looking for something that's not romantic, I'd recommend it to you but don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author does not understand that most people have no interest in writing, and he writes like a child that wants to make the world a better place by taking it away from the "real" people.   I think this book would have been more enjoyable if it had been about an actual author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting read and well worth the money but the main character is not very realistic.  He was supposed to be a perfect man, but his wife and children are so unhappy and he does little to change it.  I like the book but I think he should have had more experience with women and more self confidence.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so boring that I have to read it at least three times to get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the "Bible Code" that is given in every Christian college. I don't believe in the "code" as they say, and I believe in free will and the right to do what I want. That said, this book is just too hard to understand. I had to re-read it several times, even though I understood what was going on at the end. And there's so much information about the different denominations and the Bible. I can't even remember all the chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written for the "literary nerd" but failed to impress me. The plot was very boring. I had expected something more interesting, like a book on the history of science. This book had very little of that in it. It was like watching a boring documentary about science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with a lot of wrong and false information. I was under the impression that the earth is round and that our planet is the center of the universe. The fact that it's only 6 degrees off the perfect circle is not a big deal. The author is full of errors. He has made many errors about the bible that I know for a fact are not true. He talks about the "sinking of the Titanic" and about the destruction of Pompeii. It is a bad and bad sounding book that you will be disappointed in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed in this book. This is a book about a woman who is raped, but is not believed, because she was seen with her husband.  The husband does not believe her when she claims that she had sex with him, and it's not until she's in the hospital and gets her rape kit done that she realizes she was raped.  She is a very good woman who has her faults, but she is still a good person.  I just think the book does a poor job of showing that her rape wasn't her fault. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book about a woman's struggle to find herself. However, it's written in the voice of a guy. And if you're reading this book, you're probably not a guy who thinks about the "self" too much.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't think it's necessary to go into too much detail about how awful this book is. I don't want to be a jerk, but I don�t know if I can go into any more detail. The characters are dull, and the writing is horrible. This book is terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book that has a few flaws but that is the cost of getting good information.  The most glaring one is the poor explanation of what is going on.  It is clear from the first chapter that there are many species in the sea.  There are several different types.  Some are very good swimmers and some are very bad.  We also learn that some sea turtles do not get along well with each other.  This does not make them bad turtles.  However, it makes the story a bit hard to follow.  And even when the story is not hard to read it is not easy to understand what is happening in the story.  I have also read other books about the sea turtles and this book is probably about the most technical and boring one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think I've ever read a book so completely and so badly written. This book is an abomination.  I have read a number of stories about the horrors of the war in Viet Nam and I have found them very interesting.  This book however is the complete opposite.  The author doesn't seem to understand what the soldiers are going through.  She doesn't understand what it is to fight a war.  They are a bunch of young kids who have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  And she writes about them as if they were children, not adults.  It is disgusting.  So many people have died, so many young men and women have lost their lives, and all these children who have been sent to a war without any training or preparation are now fighting this war. What a waste of lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just too long and too dull. The characters were bland and didn't really develop. If you're a fan of fantasy then you will love this book but I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely disappointed with this book, and was a little upset at the authors because I had expected a better story. I can see the book as an adventure book but it's not the one I was looking for. I will have to pick up another book to read the story, but the adventure parts are really fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that have been out of print for years.   The author, Robert B. Mayer,   has an easy style that makes his writing very easy to read.  This book was not.  There were so many errors, omissions,  it was hard to follow what he wrote.  If you are a reader who likes to find things out about things, this is not a book for you.  It is not an easy read but is a book that should be read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with numerous errors that could be easily fixed by simply changing the wording to make the text more correct.  There is a lot of information in the book that is not supported by facts, and a lot that is incorrect.  The author claims that "the only way for a good Christian to learn to read and understand the Bible is to read it carefully" and that "if the Bible were written by a computer, it would be a computer-written Bible."  This statement is demonstrably false, and the author should know it.  I've never had a good enough reason to read a book that claims that I can't read the Bible.  In any case, the Bible can be read without having a computer handy, and it can be done without the computer being the primary text.  It's possible to understand the book without having the Bible as a primary source, but it's not very likely. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book of lies, plain and simple. The main point is that people who work for the military are given more freedom and more responsibilities than anyone else.   It is very clear that the author had a problem with the military, especially after being raped as a child.  It just goes to show that the military is a corrupt organization, not that the women who serve in the military in some cases are bad people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of this book by my husband and read it as a "cheat" for a math problem. It did not work out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending was a huge let down, it felt like a complete waste of time.  It wasn't until I finished reading the book that I realized the ending was what really drew me into the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a classic example of the "novel is a form of art" cliche. The characters are all cardboard cutouts, the plot is contrived, the writing is poor, and the characters have no motivation. It's a pretty good read though!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A very long and tedious book, I would say.  It is a very hard book to read.    It would be great if the author had just written a review that was a bit more positive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. I don't really get what the author is trying to do with this book.   In the first part she talks about the power of the subconscious.  This has a couple of problems:  1. She doesn't really use it to explain what she is talking about.  2. She spends a lot of time talking about how her family can change because of their beliefs.  But if a person believes that he or she can't make any changes then there's no point in doing anything.  If you don't believe in anything then you will continue to believe that way even if it gets you in trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I tried to read a book from a "sociologist" I found that he was not even sociologists but a psychologist. The "sage" he is not even a sage. The sociologist would have you believe that there is some deep, unspoken, fundamental truth in society. The sage does not believe in that. Sociology does not really explain why people behave in the way they do. It is a social science that has been used to justify a number of social ills including segregation, apartheid, apartheid in law and order. The social psychologist would have us believe that society is just the way it is and the answer to all our problems is to make it better. This book has little to offer in terms of wisdom. It does not go much beyond what the sociological establishment believes is true about human nature. The book does not offer a new explanation for why people act in the ways they do and it does not provide a new way to understand the behavior of human beings. The Sage has some useful suggestions on how society can improve. However, they are based on a number that are unproven and do not seem to have much relevance to any particular problem. The only way the Sage can make a recommendation is by using the example of a "simple life" that is based on the idea that all problems can be solved by the simple things people do. He claims that these are the solutions to all problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a book about an amazing character but it is completely useless for the main character and the author has no clue about what he is doing. The character is a man in his 50s who works as a writer. He lives in a house with his parents who he is estranged from. He has never had sex. He is the last survivor of his family who lived in the mountains for a long time. He does have a very sexual life but it seems to be based on a fantasy. I think that the author was writing about his own life and he was just making stuff up. It is very annoying and I do not understand how the author can make it sound like that when it is totally not the case.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete disappointment. I expected something better than this, but it was more like an overpriced bag of chips that had the worst of all of the bag's contents.   The idea is that when a man is attacked by a group of people in his village, he is in a trance-like state, and that he has the ability to project his thoughts. As he is having the same dream that he had when he was attacked, his wife is trying to comfort him, but the dreams are so similar that they both have the same bad idea.   is the main character. He has the dream that was shown to him by the spirits. It is a dream that is so clear that he is able to remember it perfectly, so that it is the same as the one that he saw. This gives him a special power to make people think that he was the one who attacked them. This power comes from the fact that he can see the spirit world. But the spirits have no intention of using him, and he has no idea why. He does not have any special powers. He just wants to prove to everyone that he could be a real person.     I thought that he should have found out that there is a trick to his power before he started having all these dreams about being attacked.   in the book, he had the ability after a while, but he didn't know about the trick until the last half of the book. It seemed like the author didn't want him to know about it, because he was too stupid to do anything about it.  : It just got boring. The main character is the one with the special power that is the best of all the other characters. He doesn't know what to do with it, but tries to use it. Then it gets used for something else, and after that it's useless. He ends up just being the hero who has to stop the evil people from doing evil things. The only time he really uses it is to get out of jail and get a woman to be his wife. It's just a waste of time. He even tried to use the power to convince the villagers that he didn�t attack them, but that was the last time he used it. In the end, he just has to let it go. He gets a wife, he gets out of prison, and everyone is happy. He is a hero.  ....   It was so
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fun read, but the story is a huge letdown.   It was a nice idea and a nice setting, but when it comes down to it the author has no real story to tell, he just retells the same thing over and over again.  The author also takes a long time writing his story.  I would've preferred to hear the story from someone else and the character's reactions to the things he does. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author spends too much time on details that don't matter.   This book isn't really about the story, it's about the "how" and "why" and the "who" and how and why those things fit together.    It's just a bunch of random details in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. It's just so incredibly boring. There are very few characters, and it's almost impossible to get any sympathy out of them. The only character that's interesting is the dog, who doesn't get any kind of depth. There's very little plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of the books that were based on my children's favorite movies:  The Godfather Part II, The Big Lebowski, The Shawshank Redemption, The Silence of the Lambs, and A Clockwork Orange.   The first 3 are good, but the last two have the potential to be very bad.   My daughter loves them all and has been known to watch the films over and over.    The book is very similar to The God Father:  It tells the story of two brothers who run a bank.  The book follows the first brother, but adds some new elements to make it different.  I don't really care about the brother's bank either.  As much as I liked the first book, I didn't care for the third. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say I just found a way to hate this book.  The story was a great start, but it had nothing to do with the characters or what was going on.  It was all about what happened to the characters at the end of the book. They were not happy with what had happened and had no interest in trying to fix it.  There was nothing in the story that was a surprise.  No one was surprised or shocked at the plot twist.  Nothing made sense or was interesting.  I just wanted to throw the book across the room.   I have a hard time believing that a good author would go through the trouble of writing a book like this but that's what she did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible waste of time.  The idea is great but the execution is horrible.  There is no plot to the story.  It's a list of rules.  They are as bad as the rules in the book about "how to make your own paper."  It would be better if they were about "what to do if you get the flu."  If you get sick and don't have time to read a book that you read in a book club, you could use this as a reference.  Instead you can spend your time reading a book about rules.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an embarrassment to science. It is a case study in how not to do science. The authors try to make the case that, since the authors have no children, they don't know how much it sucks to be a parent. The main thrust of the book is the idea that a father's influence on a child's life is the biggest determinant of its success. The author even goes so far as to say that being a father makes you a better man. They also say that the father is more likely to raise a child who gets into college. I am not sure what the problem is here. They have no evidence for this. If they did, they wouldn't bother to cite it. This book also has a huge number of anecdotal examples of how the father makes a difference. The one I liked best was about how the parents of a teenage daughter were surprised when she decided to go into business for herself. They had always said that girls are better off going to school than working at a job. Well, the daughter went into business. It seems to have paid off. I have no idea what the author's evidence is for this, but I think he is making the case in favor of a more traditional family model. The problem is that it is not a traditional model at all. If you believe in the "American Dream" that anyone can become anything if they just work hard enough, then you should be fine with this book. It's more of a "American Horseshoe" type of thing. The idea that being an adult is a matter of being the right kind of parent is an idea that is widely accepted but that doesn't make it true. The more realistic idea is that you need to learn about what really matters to your children, including their education, work, and relationships. You also need to be willing to make some hard choices about how you will raise them. The book tries to use anecdotes as proof of this, and they all fall flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book that I've read several times. But, I can't stand it now that I'm a couple of months in. It's a typical story of a woman who gets sick, goes to a doctor who can't cure her, then has her baby by a man she's only just met.  I've already found a book that has something to say about how we feel about other women's bodies, and this is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it's good to have an alternative. If you have a low tolerance for the written word, you can enjoy the book but be disgusted by it as well. The author should be ashamed of himself and of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book. The story is about a man named Peter. Peter is a Christian and he has problems.   He has to deal with his daughter's boyfriend who is a homosexual.  He can't stand him and he tries to get the boyfriend to leave him alone.  It is all so childish.  But he wants to protect his daughter so he has to fight back and it does not work.  I don't think the main characters are good at all and they seem to think they are so good.  Peter should not be a hero.  This is a book for adults but not for a young adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not what I thought it would be. The author does not go into great detail about her background (my first book was about my mother and a bunch of her siblings, not about me), and does not even mention that her father is Jewish (she is Christian).   I think this book would be better with a different writer, but the author is a good writer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the end of the Roman Empire and the Roman occupation of Europe.   As I recall the story was set in modern day Poland.  There were some interesting and important things about the early days of the European conquest, but the end came when the barbarians took over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a very reluctant reader of horror books and this one was a toughie for me. I have not read the others by this author (she has a few others) and am a huge fan of horror. I read this one in one sitting and I am not sure if I can get over it. This book has a very disturbing scene with a decapitated corpse in it that is pretty graphic. That was the only part that I didn't like. The author is trying to say she is not a racist, but that is not what she says in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read, and that's a very high standard to hold a book to.  It is an incredibly poor attempt to show the problems that exist in the world.  I will never ever understand how any man who has a wife and family would want to write a book about a man who thinks he can be a successful athlete without having to work for it.   The author's only attempt at humor is that he thinks his wife doesn't know about his problems, but I think that's just because he doesn't want to admit it. The ending is a complete fail.  He should have just gotten rid of his family and just played football with the other guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the book. However, I was disappointed by a couple of the things that happened. The main character, a female who has a history of violence, was very mean and had a lot of personality issues. However she was the only character that really made an impact. Also the story was too long. It was way too long and I think the author was just trying to make a big story. She had a much better chance to have a good story if she had cut down on the violence and personality issues and cut down the number of pages. I think it would have worked out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that has been given a good rating, but it has a few things that do not make up for the good reviews. I am a professional writer who has written many articles.  I was surprised by some of the stuff that the authors said.  Some of the things that they said, were just plain incorrect.  The people in my life were the most interesting people I ever met.  There was a real camaraderie that existed in our community.  We had a real common bond.  A real connection.   I will never buy a book from a self-published author again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book about a horrible event. The book has some interesting information and I do think it is a bit misleading about how the events unfolded. I have had the book in my collection since it was first published in 1990.  It has always been on my shelves as a must read and I still have it.  But I don't want to read it again.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was on sale and I was on a low budget. I loved it, though.   It's a very realistic story about a man who is very religious, but he can't handle his wife going to church.  The wife is very funny.  I think a lot of guys would love to have their wives do church things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. The characters are so well-developed that they become part of the world, the society of the place. The story takes place in the year 1771, in a small town called Hilden, which is located in Germany. The plot revolves around a young girl named Anna. Her family, a nobleman's family, are from the city of Hildingen, and Anna's father is a friend of the head of the Hildin family. The book is set in a very small town, and it makes it interesting. However, the pacing is too slow. The beginning of the book is slow, and the ending is slow. I think the book could have been much better if it had been released sooner. I wish it had come out sooner.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the first couple of chapters of this book. I really liked the idea of having the characters find a new way to cope with their loss.  I think the characters needed a change of pace in order to feel real.  My biggest problem was that it was very obvious that the book was written for the purposes of the author's own fame.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very interesting book about a man who can change his physical appearance and he can also make himself invisible and has super strength. I did not like it at all. The main character is a jerk and he uses that power to take advantage of his girlfriend (who is a virgin). She is very upset that he's using his powers. It's a little too easy to hate him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a great book. It was very well written, well researched and presented. The research was extremely well done. The information was presented well. But the book itself was awful. I don't know what they were smoking that made them believe that a person who drank a gallon of alcohol a day was not only a very healthy person but had been "hiding" the fact that he was in such bad health for years. That just is not true at all. The guy was not hiding it, and I'm glad he finally found a good doctor to treat it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't care about the plot or characters. I only care about how the author writes. She has a talent for putting in a lot of extra detail without giving much more. I was just so bored throughout the book and it made the reading really boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written with the sole purpose of getting a few thousand more people to buy a self-help book called "What to Do When You Are Out of Ideas" by John Gray. This book is about how to get a job, a relationship, a good education and make a better living. Gray's entire book is a rant about how you shouldn't do that stuff unless you really, really love it. The book's primary idea is that if you want something, you have to do it yourself. Gray claims that he does this because he has so much more creativity and energy than other people that he can produce great ideas on his own. He is absolutely right. I was a big fan of Gray's "Do the Right Thing" when I was in high school and college. He was so charismatic and charismatic that I never thought I'd get a chance to meet him. However, it turns out that I did, and I was blown away. Gray was a fantastic speaker, and he inspired me to get out there and start making a difference in my community. I never knew that I had the potential to do so, and it is wonderful to realize that I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author tries too hard to make her characters more relatable than they actually are. She wants them to be a little more like us, but they are very much like the people who created them. I don't think I could relate to the characters or feel for them as much as the characters in the book, but I still enjoyed the book and recommend it to people who like good science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the war against communism in Russia that is really about the failure of Communism.   It is not a very good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a man who has been dead for 25 years.  It is an interesting look at life after death, and has the feel of a true true life story.  I think he could have made a better book about a similar subject, but the story was interesting enough to be worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most annoying thing about this book was the fact that the author's use of the word "gay" is never actually stated. Why is it so hard for a gay man to be cool? And why is it harder for a "gay man" to be popular?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I read the first few pages and then was totally confused as to what the book was about. I mean it's a history of the Roman empire. It tells how the Romans were the best at everything and how they were the worst at everything else. The Romans were great in the field of war and great at diplomacy but bad at the art of writing a good book.  I really don't like history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sure I have read the same book a million times, but somehow this time it just doesn't feel as good as I remember.  This book was so boring, I found myself thinking about it even after finishing it.  It is just a tedious read, even after you know how it ends.  I have to agree with another reviewer that it was hard to understand.   2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most confusing thing I found in this book was the "discovery" of a character named "Sandy", and her relationship to the protagonist (I'm talking about the woman he loves). I'm no expert on the characters and their relationship, but I'm fairly sure Sandy doesn't exist.   And "Sandra" is a "pumpkin" not a "cute".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not read this book since my mother's funeral in 2010, but I'm glad I did.   The book is very funny and entertaining.  There are some nice bits about the Bible and the Christian faith.  If you're looking for a good laugh, I recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed in this book. The story is poorly done. The author has no real background in the subject matter and the characterizations are not very sympathetic. In fact, most of the story is set in the past, and we never get to see the author as a writer in the present. I think it would be better if she'd written a book about how she got her PhD.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written that it made me laugh so hard I thought I was going to throw up. It is one thing to write a bad story, but to do so so ineptly that I had to throw it out the window was not funny at all. This is a book that I have to re-read, and in fact, I am trying to decide if I really should re-buy it. It should be called "My Book of Bad Advice."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had really hoped to like this book but was disappointed. The stories in this book were the worst. The main character had no sense of how to relate to people or how to be a good parent.   Her son was so rude to the waitress that I had to ask him to leave.  The family did nothing for the family dog.  Her husband did not do anything for his children.  I would have loved to have seen more about the husband and I would also like to see more about her husband and her children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing style is too slow to be good for a first novel. I didn't really enjoy the story, so I gave up on this book. I read about 2/3 of the book before I gave it up. It was very tedious. I think it was a good book, but I'm sure it won't be on my reading list for a long time
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so looking forward to reading this book. I'm not sure if it was because I knew I would love it or if it just wasn't my cup of tea but it was really good. The story was very fast paced and I was excited to get into it. I enjoyed the little side character development. I wish they would do more with her and her family. I would have loved to see a little more of her in her life before she became a part of the main story. I loved that they did a great job on creating a little bit of drama within the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, about the life of a former KGB agent, was written in a style that is both cliche and completely lacking in anything original. The book was an interesting read, but I just couldn't find anything new about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after I bought a second edition. I have to admit that the first edition was much better and much better written. It was also the first book I read with a group of people over a long period of time. But this book just does not hold up to close scrutiny. In a way, the title of the book is misleading. There are no magical spells. There is no magic potions. There really is no way to get "totally free" of your problem, so there is no real magic in this book. There does not seem to be any real scientific research to back up these claims. In fact, there is very little research supporting any of the claims in the book. I will have to think long and hard about this book, and will have my doubts about its usefulness in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a little disappointed that this is not a full-length book. It seems to have the right ingredients - there are some interesting ideas, some interesting characters, and a good plot - but there's very little depth to it. There's a good amount of description in the text, and some interesting details about the author, but nothing that really makes this stand out as a unique book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author had a really good idea and tried to turn it into a good book.   He started out strong but quickly fell into a hole of nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really great book for anyone that wants to learn about Buddhism. But for me, I got a bit lost in the middle, but then I realized that this book has some interesting things to say about Buddhism that are not always talked about.   I do think that this is a good introduction to Buddhism, but I think that there are things in the book that are over-generalized and that I don't think really add up to much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think there is a very good book here, but it is written in a way that is extremely difficult to read.  It is a long book and it is hard to keep up.  I had to get up at 4 am to finish it.  Also it is very hard to find a place to sit down when I am on the train.  There is nothing bad about the book, just something that is hard for me to take. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book.   The plot was really awful.  The characters were just horrible.  It was a really depressing read.  I'm glad I didn't read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a way of trying to get to the bottom of the mysterious disappearance of my mother, who disappeared while visiting a friend in the Philippines.  I found the story rather hard to believe, but I still found it fascinating and I'll be reading the rest of her books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book ever written by a woman for women. The characters are either so boring or so stupid that the reader is forced to stop reading after one page, if she even tries to read more.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book. It was a great read. The characters were interesting and the stories were good. I thought it was good that the author had a friend who had experienced a lot of the same stuff she was going through as a young woman.  The author has a way of putting the past in perspective.  I liked how she took the characters and their situations into consideration.  It wasn't just that she dealt with some difficult issues that I hadn't had.   It was more about being able to understand and relate to her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to understand a book about a person's life, or the story of one's life.   The author doesn't really say anything interesting about his life that I didn't already know.  It is a bit difficult to follow along as he describes the time he was in college and college students.  The time he spent in college is a good time.  But it is hard to read a book when you are already in college. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know why I didn't get this book a long time ago, but I just finally bought it. This is probably the best thing that has happened to me since my wife and I were married (I'm not kidding). I'm not sure I could put a book down and finish it, but at least I have the experience to share.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of fantasy, but the book I bought (The Book of the Black Stone by J.R.R Tolkien) was just plain terrible.  The main character is a terrible writer (he has a huge vocabulary and uses the wrong word more than once), and his characters seem like they were written by an 8-year-old who's just starting to read.  Even worse is that the only characters that seem to have any depth or personality are the evil elves, which I don't really care about.  If Tolkien wanted to write about elves, he should have written about orcs and goblins.  He probably also should have tried to write an epic fantasy series about a king, but that's a subject that's already been done to death.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an amazing example of how you can learn something from anything:  It's very interesting how so many people have been told that the Bible is not inspired.  One of my best teachers was a Christian.  She was a very good teacher.  I'm very sure that she was inspired by the Bible.  It just shows how good God can be.   In addition to the Christian teaching, the author discusses several other topics.  For example:  One time I read about a man who was being charged with killing his son.  The son was a baby and he had to have a leg amputated after being hit in the head by a car.  In my opinion, the man was guilty of a horrible crime.  He was not a bad father and he was very loving to his family.  This is what we need in this day and age.  Another topic he discusses is:    What if a person who has been through a traumatic experience decides that God was not God to him?  I agree with this as well.  We all need a little God in our lives.  There are many people who have come out of abusive situations with an amazing knowledge of God.  They can go on to a life of spirituality.  If that is something you want then this book will be worth it.  I highly recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of horror/scifi/mythology books and none have really stuck with me. The whole "the end is the end" concept is a little overplayed in these books.   The first one in this series has some good ideas, but the rest were really a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has two bad points:  - It is very hard to find a good reference book on the Holocaust.   - The most important part of the book is about how the Jews were treated after the war.  It seems like the author is trying to say that it is because they were bad people.  But I found that to be a very flawed premise.  The reason the Jews did not get the same treatment as the Germans was that they were more advanced technologically.  That was the reason why the Germans were so cruel to the Jews.  I mean it was just a matter of time before Hitler was going to get the better of the Jews so he could do what he did.  They just had to get used to being the Jews in Germany.  This is why you do not see the same level of hatred for the Jews as you do for the Germans. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very sad book. I'm a father of two young children and have read all of my kids' books (except for those that were written by their nannies and tutors). The fact that it's written by a man who has never met a kid who didn't want to be a superhero is very sad. I guess he's not the type of person who would have made a great father figure. He's also not very likable and his mother (who he does care for) is a terrible person. The book was so sad that I just put it down and tried to forget about it. It is really a shame because it was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit like a bad version of "A Few Good Men." The author has a great sense of humor but the writing is horrible and is in a genre that doesn't need more humor in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the kind of book that a student should read and re-read. The story is not interesting enough to be worth re-reading. The characters are not very believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book of lies. It's a collection of short stories, with a very long prologue. In the prologue, the author claims that the story is about a boy, Jack, who was sent to his grandmother's to get his own room at the inn. After his grandfather died, his grandmother told him that his grandfather had been a witch. I found it odd that the author didn't just give a brief summary of the story, as he did in the introduction, but then he just made up stories about the boy's grandfather. I know that many people think that stories are the way people remember things, but I don't think that is true. My grandmother told me that the book was about Jack's grandfather, who also was a witch, but he died before he could tell Jack what he had done. In this book, the boy is the one who is lying about his grandfather, and not the other way around. I don.t know how the author was able to tell so many lies about a book I already knew about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book. I liked it a lot. I enjoyed reading about how to write a great novel. I did not enjoy the characters that were in this book or the plot. I was hoping that the main character would get some sort of arc and be interesting. I think I'm getting too cynical. This is a book for people who love books and are very interested in writing books, but I did get the impression that this book is about the author, not about writing a great book. The writing is not very good, and the characters are not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a compilation of excerpts from the writings of a notorious racist: the founder of the Ku Klux Klan, Thomas Robb, who had been imprisoned in an Alabama prison in 1931 for trying to poison the president. It was in this book that he was caught and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a black man he'd been accused of raping. Robb wrote in his book that it was not true that the white man was raped, but that a black woman he was with had raped a white man (who happened to be her husband). He wrote in other books that he felt that the black man raped the white woman because he wanted to have sex with her, and she'd agreed.  Robb wrote: "It was all a hoax. They just wanted to see how far they could go in manipulating a bunch of Negroes. They wanted to find a way to get me out of prison."  After he wrote this book he died in a prison hospital.  It's very sad to read about a man who would do that to his own people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always been a fan of science fiction and fantasy and I have read many good books that I have found interesting, but this one is a disappointment.  It is filled with clichés and unrealistic things that the author did not research very well and even the most basic of concepts (the different types of stars) is a bit simplistic.  For example: the stars are different in the sky because they are different sizes but different densities (like water is denser at the bottom of a cup than at the top).  It also makes no sense that the stars move across the sky in a straight line (i.e. not in a parabola) and there is no explanation for why a star might move faster or slower as it moves across the night sky.  This makes me think that it was not researched very well at all and is the result of poor writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story itself is not interesting enough to keep me interested through to the end. The character of the narrator is a bit stereotypical, and there's no real reason for him to be there. It's hard to believe he's in the same place he is.   As a reader, it's very hard to stay engaged through the whole book, because it's so self-involved. The author is obsessed with his "true love" (or his own "true loves") and seems to be constantly talking about it. In the end, he's so obsessed with the love of his life that he forgets the love he has for the people around him.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an atrocious book and I can't believe that it was published.   I was very disappointed in this book.  In the first chapter we get a brief synopsis of the life of John Lennon.  He was born in 1941 to parents who were working class.  This may be the reason for his poor health in his later years.  But we also learn about his parents relationship.  It was not a happy one.  His father was abusive and his mother was an alcoholic.  John Lennon and his sister spent a lot of time in the hospital as a result of her alcoholism.  We also learn that his father was in the Navy.  As a result, his father had him get a pilot's license.  My father was a pilot so I never understood why he got a pilot license.     We then get the biography on Lennon's sister.  She was born with a cleft lip and tongue and was given up for adoption.  Her adoptive parents didn't like her as they were too religious.  Lennon's mother had an affair with a man named Miles.  Miles lived in an old abandoned house in the Bronx.  When Lennon saw her he was attracted to her.  That's why he broke up with his girlfriend at the time.   Lennon decided to move to the city and live with Miles.  Miles got him a job as a delivery boy.   Eventually Lennon found himself alone in the apartment.   He was very unhappy and began smoking a lot.  Eventually he decided to write a song about it.   The lyrics are as follows:  I've got to get some drugs to make myself feel better I've been through a lot, you know?   He wrote a lot more songs about this but it's hard to say what they were about because he wrote them while high on drugs.  I don't think it was ever intended to be published.   After this we get the book's real focus, which is John Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono.  Yoko is an artist who is known for her work with the Beatles.  They dated from 1969 to 1974.  Although they dated, Lennon was still very upset that he hadn't written any more songs for her.   However, they continued to date.  The breakup was caused when John Lennon decided that he wanted to move back to England.  Since Yoko was married, she decided to leave Lennon and move to England with
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read. The story is completely implausible, the characters are not realistic, the world building is just plain bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of YA fiction. I think most of the stories are either very silly, or just very silly. This is no different. The writing is good, and there are several very funny lines. The story is pretty dark. The characters aren't all that interesting.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book before and thought it was really good.  However, I did not have the patience for this book because I could not get through it in one day.  It was too boring.  I really enjoyed this book and I hope I will be able to read more books like it in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only book I have ever purchased from the library and never will again.   It is poorly written and the author's views are very biased.  I do not like the author and I would not buy his books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a bad read. It is a story about two children and how their parents got divorced. I can't believe that someone would write a book like that. It's too bad the author has no self-awareness.  This is a terrible book. I have nothing bad to say about it except that I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the potential to be great. Unfortunately, the author has no grasp of how to write an entertaining, well-written story.   I thought this would be a good way to get some real, live training for my first ever MMA fight.  However, this book just left me bored and wanting to read a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third of two novels by a woman who is an atheist. It's about a woman, not a child, and it's about atheism. The book is about an atheist woman who takes a job at a Christian organization to become a Christian. The story is about her trying to get her own way and having to take a back seat to a child. This is an extremely unprofessional and poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's author clearly has a poor grasp of basic science. The whole thing about the earth's magnetic field has no basis in science at all. This was an absolute rip off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book.   This is the only one of its kind that I've found in the last few years.  But, it's too short.  It is a good book but it just doesn't have the depth I'm looking for in a book about an abusive family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an obvious copy of " The Devil's Evolutionary Mind " by James Randi. This book attempts to prove that there is a conspiracy among the major religious leaders to hide the truth about God's existence from the people. The book is filled with many errors that I found very disturbing. I believe this book is a disinformation attempt. I will not be buying this book or the author's next book on the same topic, " The Bible's Conspiracy Theory "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been waiting for this book since its original publication in 1980 and it just didn't work for me.  This is the second time that I have tried to read this book.  I had the same problem as the previous reviewer.  The story is so confusing that I couldn't make sense of the plot.  In the end, the book's main premise didn't make any sense to me either.  It took me a while to put it together. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book on a whim, thinking it was just a typical history book about a particular topic.  I found out it is an epic fantasy that is just as well written as it is long.    I don't think I will ever have a bad fantasy book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think I'll ever be able to read a book like this one again. I've read a lot of books, but this is one of the first times I ever felt a bit cheated out of what I wanted in a book.  I have read about twenty books on different aspects of psychology over the years, but it was the first time I was ever disappointed by any one book. I thought I'd read about how a psychologist tried to get a woman to go through with a marriage and how they had a child together.  The book said that the woman was an outcast in her church, and that she would eventually get a divorce.  She said she never wanted to have a child with the guy who loved her, and he wouldn't allow it.  But the book said they tried everything.  One time they put her on birth control.  Another time they gave her a shot in her hand.  Yet another time they said she was so much of a disappointment that she was forced to quit her job.  They said she would never be happy with a man who treated her like a second-class citizen.  All I can say is... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for a non-technical audience and is written in a very simplistic fashion.  The book starts out with an example of how to use the R package:  "The R package is useful for finding a function in a package that doesn't exist in R:  (1) I'm a statistician and the function I'm looking for is called   a   ,   (2) R has no way of knowing if a function is defined in R or in some other language."   It is a simple example, but it is not good practice to ignore the fact that you have to write in a language other than your native one.   And the R script is not really a R script, it's just a Python script.  It does not show that you should know how to write a script in a different language.  If you just want to run a function that doesn´t exist in a tool that you are not familiar with, there are a lot of free tools out there:  I'm sure that you can find a lot more if you look.  In fact, I can´t find any documentation on the internet about the package that R came with, so it is unclear to me whether or not you need it.  I would recommend to people who don't have experience in programming that they learn Python.  You won´t be a better R programmer if you don´t know how a programming language works. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to see if it was as good as I remember reading.  This book does not have the charm or the energy of the first book.  There are some very interesting points in this book but it is really just a lot of words and little in the way of action.  I have seen many "How to" books and have enjoyed most of them but I am not sure this is one that I will want to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just boring and dull. The whole book was just so much fluff. I don't even care if it is about a girl who is in love with a boy who is going to die. I just don't care about any of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out with a fairly good premise. The main character is a boy who is diagnosed with cancer. His father had cancer as well, but didn't get the diagnosis until after he had already passed. His parents had a good marriage. The book tries to get at the fact that he is not well.  I think the story is too complicated.  He is a nice guy, but I can't get him to come out to his father and explain why he was in the hospital.  It is frustrating.  In the end, his dad comes to the conclusion that he must have been drunk or on drugs at the time he fell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as a gift for a friend but she had read a lot of books by women before and didn't seem to like the ones I had given her, so I just gave her the one I had read and it was the worst book she ever read. She kept going on about how she thought it was funny how all the female characters were stupid and they would end up dying horribly. I told her to read it, and when she got to the part about the male character's mother dying horribly, I said "she's really not funny."  I thought it a good book but the whole thing was ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a fun and entertaining book, look elsewhere. It is a complete waste of time. This book is nothing more than a collection of "stories". I'm not a big fan of stories, especially when they are told by "characters". These "char" characters in this book are absolutely no better than any one else in the book. They have their "flavor", but they don't contribute anything to the story. They are just there, and the author spends a great deal of time talking about them. I have no idea how he has time to write all of these stories. He has a good idea about the world, but the stories he writes are nothing but a mess of clichés.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately I was disappointed   It is so obvious that the author is trying to appeal to the "anti-feminist" crowd   What is more annoying than that is the author's constant use of sexist language   She refers to a man as a "bitch"   And a "cock-sucking whore" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that I bought just so I could use it as a textbook. It is so terrible that I can't use it at all, even for that purpose.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a very good book at a very bad time.  I really liked it.   The story was interesting and the writing was very good.  But it really didn't work for me.  It didn't seem like the author spent a lot of time on the characters, so I felt a bit cheated.  She had a couple of great moments, but there wasn't much depth to the characters.  As I was reading, I felt like the characters were really boring.  The best part of the book was the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time and is a terrible excuse to get the book that you already own  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad.   It has all the basic ideas that one would expect from a first-year economics class, and all the same old nonsense that is repeated in every first-semester textbook on economics: the economy is driven by money supply and demand, so we need to know what the money supply is, so that we can control it; there are no perfect substitutes for money, so money is always "good" and is "always in demand"; there is no such thing as an equilibrium money supply, so our money supply can never get too large; and the best way to increase output is to let the money market "self-adjust" in the long run.  All these ideas come to us from Keynes, in his famous paper, "The Economic Consequences of the Peace", and they are central to modern economics.  But they are completely wrong, and this book teaches them in the most obtuse and incorrect way.  One of the most important things to remember about economics is that the economy does not function in a vacuum, but is actually a complex system in which many things work together, and sometimes at odds.  It's like an organism:  the economy has its own internal metabolism, its own supply of energy, its internal biological clock, its chemical reactions, its psychological motivations, its sense of justice, its economic incentives, and so on.  The goal of an economics textbook is to describe and explain all these processes, and to make sure that they all work together in a harmonious way.      This is a textbook that tries to cover all these aspects of the economy, but it misses most of them, and most of the book is about explaining how those missed aspects work together.  In short, the textbook is a bit like a giant turd:   it is big enough to cover a lot of topics, but a lot smaller than the turd that it tries to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book. It is an abysmal book and very poorly written. The writing style is awkward and repetitive. He takes several scenes from the movie "E.T." and inserts them here. His dialogue is incomprehensible. He makes the story very one-sided. The ending is a cop out. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I have already thrown it out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book at the end of a long shopping trip to a large bookstore in the midwest.  I'm sure I've read a lot of self help books, but I just couldn't put the book down.  The author, who I'm assuming is a professional, seems to be giving a lot out for the price.  It was a very entertaining book.  But, it also made me feel as if I was a total idiot for not getting help for a long time.  If you are struggling with the idea that you can't do anything about any problem, this is the book to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say that this book was not what I was expecting at all. It had all the right ingredients but was far from the best book I have read recently. I like the fact that this is a "tough love" book. It was definitely the hardest part of the book to read. The fact that it was written by a married woman was a big surprise. I am glad that I was able to finish the book. The last page was a bit of a let down for me. I think I could have finished it in a day or two but I kept getting distracted by the things that kept popping up in my head.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping to learn how to sew but was more disappointed than anything. I read the whole book but didn't learn anything. The photos in the book look very good but are not helpful. I don't know if I can ever buy this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was so disappointing.   I was really looking forward to the third book but this one just isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character's main flaw is the fact that she just is not a good person. She seems to have some very dark and depressing tendencies. I don't think I can relate to her at all and I think she's really shallow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure this book would have been a great book if it had been published in the seventies instead of the nineties.   The author, for one thing, uses a very narrow reading of the Bible, focusing on the most extreme and radical parts.  There are many other passages in the Bible that I'd find much more satisfying, but this is a book that's not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a huge waste of time.    It's a collection of very poorly written anecdotes from several different people in various states of distress, and is the product of the author's desire to have a story about depression to read to his children.  The stories are often bizarre and don't add up to anything that I can imagine.  They all have the same sort of "sadness and depression" theme, but it's just a bunch of stuff that someone is telling at the time that just feels forced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book, but it was just not for me. I have heard so much good things about it that I thought it was a must read. But I didn't like it at all. There were too many spelling errors and I didn'st understand it at first. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time and has absolutely no relevance to the real world.   The most you will learn is the basics of quantum mechanics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first time I've heard of the "dick pic." I can see where the title comes from. The book is about a guy that has a collection of pictures of his dick. He's a weirdo. It's not that he has a giant penis. It is more the fact that he's a dick. I can relate. I'm a guy with a giant dick. It just happens that I have no idea what to do with it. I've always been kind of a dick, but I've never had a big one. I like my dick and it's good enough that I can have a collection to show people. I think the pictures are pretty funny. I also think the story is pretty funny (except for the part where he has sex with a horse). I'm not a big fan of the horse part. It kind of ruined the ending for me. I liked it better when he did it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a lot of boring and bad ideas in the hopes that some people will get it and read it.  I don't think I'm the only one who has read it but I'm glad it's gone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good story with great ideas, but I think there's too much filler in the book.   It seems like the author has a point to make, but it's so wrapped up in the narrative that it's hard to get a grasp on the main points. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the story of a young man in a small town who, as a teen, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of autism.  It is not the story, but the diagnosis that is troubling.  There is an awful lack of empathy in this story.  This book has no moral, no lesson.   The main character is clearly not aware of the dangers he faces.  In one instance, the main character's attempt to escape a situation is thwarted by his friend, who has a gun.  At the end of the story there is no sign that the main characters will have any sort of change in their behavior.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say I didn't like this book, but I can say I was bored out of my mind for a good portion of the time. It took me a while to realize that the book was really about the book, not the characters. The narrator and the people he meets are just an excuse for the book to show off how well it's written. The ending was also very cliche. The whole book was about how the narrator was a perfect role model for the author, but he's so bad he can't even be a good role model. I wish the author had written something different.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a difficult time getting through this book. The first half of the book is about how a good book can get lost, especially in a large collection of short stories. The second half of this book is all about how good a book can be if it is written in a compelling style.   It is difficult to follow along and understand the narrative when it is scattered through so many short stories that do not really add anything to the overall narrative.  I found the final story in the book to be very unsatisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. It was a compilation of all the movies that Michael Bay has directed, and he tried to do all of them, which I think is amazing, but it was all terrible. Bay is so arrogant and pretentious that he does not even try to do anything interesting with his movies. The one movie that was interesting was Transformers, but that was because it was made by someone else. There was also a scene where he was talking to his friends about a Transformers movie, and the only interesting thing he said was "They're really nice people." The only reason I like Bay movies is because I'm a huge Transformers fan, so I'm happy to see that he has gotten the Transformers franchise to where it is, but this is all he has. This book could have been much more interesting if it had been written by a non-Bay fan.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a person who was born in the 1800s who grew up in the 20th century.  The author is not much of a historian, and the book is filled with inaccuracies, omissions, and wrong conclusions.  I would have been much better served had the author just ignored all the stuff about her and written about her life in the 1860s instead of all the details of her life after the Civil War.   I am a history buff, so I am not a big fan of books that have to be re-read or re-ordered from their original position to the present.  However, this book is a real treat because it is a great history of the Civil war era.  For those who have never read a history book on the war, this one will give you a great overview of the period. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking forward to reading this book for some time.  I bought it from a local bookstore.    This book is a great read and is a fun book to read.  The story is set in a fictional world, where a wizard is the most powerful being in the world.  This wizard uses the power of magic to solve many problems that would be impossible to solve with the human mind alone.  He has been in charge of a small village for years, and has never had any trouble.  It is very easy to read, as it is very well written.  While the story is fun to read and the story makes the reader want to read more of it, the book is not good for a young reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but i found it very difficult to understand and it was very repetitive.  The reason why it was repetitive is because all the characters were basically the same, i think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a piece of trash, it has absolutely no relevance to our current culture, and is a complete waste of time. The book was originally written for a general audience, it was published in the 60s and the people who used to read it were people like me who were into the 60's.   The only people who still use it are the ones that were in their 60's when they were reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible piece of trash.  It is full of grammatical errors and poor writing.   The plot is a joke.  There is not even a hint of romance in the story.  I feel cheated because it took me so long to finish this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back in 2004 and have kept it in my bookshelf ever since. I am not sure if this is an honest review or just a cheap attempt to impress people. I think this book is a good one but not a masterpiece. It is not a bad read but I was not captivated by the characters or the story. I don't remember much of the story but the writing style is a bit odd and it was confusing as to why they were so interested in each other but not in the other. The characters are all very flat and boring. I will not be recommending this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disappointment. I was looking forward to reading this book as it is the book that I've been waiting to read to learn about the occult. The book is about the power of the occult and the occultic traditions.  This is the same sort of book that they've done for the last 20 years and the books are pretty good.  The main problem is that they use the words 'wizards' and'magic' interchangeably.  They have this book out about 'witchcraft' and then use the word 'witch' to describe the practices they are talking about.  It's just as bad as 'witches' and it makes me cringe.   The book is well written and the descriptions are clear and easy to understand.  However the main issue is that it uses the same words interchangeably and then talks about how it's all based on "witches" instead of just being about magic.  There is an entire section that has an author that talks about a 'witcher' that was an evil person that he saw, not about the magic and the 'witchcraft'.  I would have preferred a more focused book that just talked about how the various 'Witches' are different than the'magic.' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a story of a little girl who is adopted at the age of six. She is an introvert and is not able to cope with people and so is always being the "go-to" girl in the house. I don't think the author realized that it's actually quite difficult for a little kid to learn to interact with other people (she is still very shy). However, the story does end in a happy way, so I guess the author didn't really make the point that the adoption is traumatic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so stupid, that it's hard to even take it seriously. The book is about a man named Richard, who is the son of a rich woman, and he is a brilliant genius.  He is also very stupid.  It was very obvious that he was trying to impress the women he dates.  The problem is that he is so obsessed with their opinions, that he cannot get past his own shortcomings.  Also, he gets married to an idiot.  This guy is so far out of his league that he could never get any of the girls to like him, but he still tries.  If he had been in school he would have learned that it takes a LOT of effort to make a woman fall for you.  So the book is pretty much worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book that has a lot of good stuff, but it is a little dry at times.   For a story about a group of friends who try to stop a robbery, the actual plot is pretty weak.  They're stuck at a bar in the middle of nowhere.  Their only hope is to get into a place called the "Nordic Village," which seems a bit off.  It turns out they're supposed to stop the robbery by making a lot more money than they're expecting.  And then the book gets weird.  For example:  It takes a long time to get there.  There are two roads that they can take.  One goes south.  The other goes west.  If you go west you get a lot closer to the target.  In the end they get a car that's not a "normal" car.  You don't know what kind of car it is.  Then they have to go to a hotel where there's a very strange guy who says he's a detective and that he's going to give them information about the crime that he was supposed to do.  But in the end he's just lying.  He has to do that because there's nothing else he can do to help them.  I didn't like that he got so much info from the guy at the hotel.    Overall: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got my copy of The Dark Half of the Moon yesterday.    It has a few flaws:  1. The author's description of a "fairy tale" is not very accurate.  The tale is based on a real event in the life of the late Harry Houdini.  It is not a fairy tale, but a real-life story that is told in a very dark and macabre way.  2. The illustrations are not very good.  I thought the illustrations for the first three chapters were rather strange.  3. I found the descriptions of the people that lived in the house a little misleading.  There was a very large house, with a very old basement.  4. The ending was a little too neat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just as bad as the movie, so much so that I don't even recommend it. The characters are all so cliched. The only one that I found interesting was the "lovable" dog.  The "villain" is just a caricature and the plot is just another "WTF" plot.  This is just one more excuse to buy the movie!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is bad, and the ending is even worse. The whole story was so confusing, it is impossible to figure out what the heck is going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book.   It is a very good book that is too long to read.  It should have been split into 3 parts, like a book.   The ending is weak.  I do not know what I would do without this book and would not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to try to learn how to write and edit my own writing. I learned very little from this book. It's more like reading a book about how to get away with murder than how to develop a writing style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to give this book two stars because the plot is not really my thing, but it's a good book nonetheless.  I have to agree that the premise isn't my thing but the story is good.  It takes a while to get going but once you do, you can't put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book about the Vietnam War. I am sure the author has an interest in Vietnam, but he is way off. The book starts with an interview of a Vietnam vet who lost his brother. He says that his brother is "the reason that we have the Vietnam war" and the author "thinks that's an amazing thing to say." He says Vietnam is "a stupid war that stupid people won." It's obvious that he is just trying to give the reader a negative view of the war. This is the first half of the book. Then the author starts to tell the war story. He tells how he went to Vietnam and how he was the one who came up with the idea of putting a bunch of soldiers on a helicopter and going to Vietnam. The story is not only very short but it also doesn't include any actual combat. He never mentions any soldiers who actually fought the war and I thought he might have included them, but there is no evidence of that. He also doesn´t mention the millions of people killed. He just talks about the helicopters. He does talk about the war from the US point of view, but that is just a bunch more propaganda about how we were right and the Vietnamese were stupid. The end of the story is the same as the beginning. The author gives the impression that the war ended after we went to the war in the Middle East, but in reality the war continued for several years after the end of Operation Northwoods. The war in Vietnam is a perfect example of the War on Terror. The US government has made a big show of the "War on Terror," but in fact it is a war on freedom.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a great and tragic hero. I read it because I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Comics universe, but this book is a bit confusing. The first part is pretty good, but then the second part takes a turn. It's a good read, but it's a bit too convoluted to be a true classic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should have been a classic.     It's not a bad read, but there are some problems with the text.  First of all, the author is too quick to use the word "stupid" to describe her son's behavior.  It's so overused that it's almost redundant.  Second, the chapter on her family is very biased and a little off-putting.  Third, the family is not portrayed in a positive light.  Fourth, the "I am so sorry" is used too often and doesn't say much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about this book is that the author was very generous with his time to answer my questions. He was very knowledgeable about the topic and was able to give examples of what he thought was good writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible book. The only reason I finished it is that it was my husband's birthday, and I thought it would be funny to read a short book about his birthday. But it is not funny at all. The stories are all about a man who tries to win over a woman but is rejected. I don't understand why he keeps trying until he finally gets the woman to fall in love with him. Then he falls in love too and has to give up. The story was really long and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a man who's been on the run for two years after killing someone and stealing his car. The first time he is caught, he is very polite, apologetic, and gives the police all the information he knows about the case. He is released the next day. The second time he's caught, after stealing a car again, he gets more and more violent and violent and dangerous to the police. It ends in him trying to kill a cop in the course of escaping, which is a little scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book that does not cover a very useful subject in depth.   I am a former police officer and I used to work with officers.  It is extremely important to know the laws in your state and city to be able to write a good report. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just bought this book after reading a lot of reviews and it just wasn't my cup of tea. I don't really care for the story or the characters. The pacing is way off, I found myself just looking forward to the next page rather than reading it.  It's a little boring as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I'm interested in the history of the "sixties counterculture", but it's a bit thin on detail and doesn't really tell you much.  The story is about the Grateful Dead as a band, not as an organization or as a group.  This book was mostly about Jerry Garcia, and a good portion of the book is just about Garcia's music.  It's a good book, but I would have preferred a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and after reading it I feel that the author didn't care about the story or characters and that it was all about the action and the book. It was a fun read, but it didn't get me into the book for a lot of reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love reading books but this book is so bad that I can't even find the words to say what a bad story it is. I had never heard of it before and I thought it was a good read at the time but I can see now that it's not. The author claims he is not a Christian and then he says that he has had a change of heart and is a Christian but I just can't buy it. He also claims that he doesn't have a lot of friends so he just couldn't do this. What the hell was he thinking? This book should have been called:  I am not a very good Christian so I didn't do what I thought I had to do
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disaster from the very first sentence.   It is based on a book called " The Book of Mormon" by John W. Welch (who wrote a number of books that I've enjoyed), and the characters were just recycled.  The author does an excellent job of keeping the character's names from being repetitive, but the whole thing just felt wrong.  It seems that the author has never actually read a book by Welch (he does seem to know a lot about Mormon history and he does seem like a very knowledgeable person), so he just decided to throw a few characters from a book he's never read into his story.  They even got some of the names wrong. I had no real interest in the characters other than trying to see if they'd make a good Mormon leader.  I had to read the entire thing just to get to the part about the "Nauvoo Expositor."  I found it boring, even when the characters weren't being ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a big fan of the series. The first three books in the series are the best. The only problem I had with the third book was the author, Michael P. Hughes, changed his character names to make them sound more like the characters from the series.  "You're a real big shot!" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought the book was good, but then I read a review that said the book is boring, so I'm not going to waste my time reading it.  It's just boring, that's all I can say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor first effort at a romance novel. The book is written by a young man with a strong sense of entitlement and is peppered with expletives that could be taken as a reference to sexual assault. The protagonist is very thin and does not seem to be very intelligent, which is unfortunate because he is a young woman's ideal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book about the evils of the drug war. Unfortunately, it is not written in a very engaging style, and it is difficult to keep track of all the details that are important.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a few of these and I have to say that they're terrible. This book is basically just a bad idea that's executed poorly. The whole premise is that a guy goes to the woods to try to catch a black bear. He gets caught. So he goes back to the forest. After he gets caught, he has to decide if he wants to keep fighting to catch the bear, or give up. I'm not sure what's worse about this story - the fact that he's stuck in a black bears mouth for the whole book, or the fact he's not allowed to do anything in the forest but fight.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is a bit repetitive, with some characters repeating their actions over and over again. There is a point where the plot is getting interesting but it is completely dropped to go to the same old crap.  It was the same exact crap in the same form that I've seen in a hundred of the same kind of books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of self-help and this book really disappointed me. It was a very long book but it was a waste of time.  It is an interesting and interesting to read.   I am not a big fan of self improvement but this book had some very interesting things to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to use as a reference book in my English literature classes. I have a pretty good sense of humor, and I'm not one for academic texts. I liked it at first, but it's just not that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a woman named Sara who is an avid reader. She spends most of the time listening to a book and then reading it aloud. The story is about her son (who is now a young man) who is a little short for his age. He has to stay in an orphanage because his parents can't afford the rent and he has to live with the foster parents. They seem like the perfect parents because they love their kids and don't make them do anything stupid like play football or anything like that. Sara is the only person who doesn't get the chance to make her son do anything because she has to read to him all day. The kids are like little toys that get played with and never get anything done. The foster parents are so annoying. They are so controlling that they can't even do their jobs without making Sara feel like she is being bad or like she isn't getting the best out of her son. It was so frustrating because I was so looking forward to Sara reading her son a book so she could read to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many books and I'm still having problems with this one. I was expecting something that would be different from all the other stories I've read about the Holocaust.  This is an excellent story, but it's not really about the war.  The book is about the Jews who came to Israel.    They are sent to an area that is under British control, where they are told that they are going to live out their lives in peace.  The first half of the book is a travelogue through Palestine, and is not at all what I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book at all. I didn  This book is about a guy who is in a band. There is a lot of singing, but I never really liked the singing. I don't know why I didn`t like it. It doesn't really add anything to the book.   The book is a review of the book "The Music Man", by a guy named J.R.R Tolkien. I'm not much of a reader of fantasy. This book didn't appeal to me at all either.  , a review:This book starts out with a lot going on, but then things get a little weird. For one thing, there are a lot more people than there should be in the group. I know that Tolkien does this, and I like it, but the point of the first part is to show the group as a bunch of friends. It is not that there are too many people, but that it is hard to keep track of who is who.   The second half is about the "music" that the band plays. The music seems like something that has been stolen from a different genre. I can`t help but think that Tolkien just copied something from some other movie, tv show, or book and made it sound cool. This is not a bad thing by itself, but it is not what you are expecting from a Tolkien book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I bought this book as part of our new "women's" library (my first real library!). This book is nothing but a load of bad "gender roles" lessons. It's written by a woman. The idea that a woman is "not good at taking care of herself" is just silly and illogical. This book contains no good examples of women who are able to "take care of themselves" or men who can take care of them. The author, who is not a "woman" and is the wife of a man who has been through many divorces and is now single, talks about how men are supposed to take care and women are supposed not to. The book also contains a whole section about women's supposed innate superiority (not mentioned by the author) to men. That's all the "good" in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very basic book and does not really have much depth to it. The whole thing is very dry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book, but I didn't get it at the time I bought it because I had forgotten about the book I'd read years earlier: "The Woman in White" by Barbara Tuchman, which also is about a woman in white. This book is better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book. It's one of those books that you can't put down. It will probably stay in my library for a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for the first time in hopes that it would be an interesting read about the history of science and technology.   Instead, I found this to be a really poor book with a lot of problems that I can see coming from a mile away:  1. The book is very long.  2. There are no real scientific facts presented.  3.  This is a book about how people reacted to the discovery of the moon and space travel in the 1950s, which is not relevant to today's society.  4.  There is no explanation of the difference between a rocket and a space ship.  5.  The book has a bad preface about the scientific community's reaction to the moon landing.  6.  I'm not sure why the government has a monopoly on rockets.  7.  Even though the government is not going to do anything with a rocket, the public will do something with it.  8.  We should learn from the mistakes of the past.  9.  How does the government know that a rocket is too big to be taken on a space flight.  10.  It's hard to imagine that there would be a successful rocket that would land on a beach in Florida.  11.  These were the problems that made me wonder if I should have picked up a copy of this book instead of a textbook on rocketry.  12.  Since I did not want to read about all of the problems with the moon landings, I will not read the book.  13.  In the end, it's just a bad read about a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't read this one for fun.   The first half of the book is a long series of descriptions of the various aspects of the life of a woman who is married to a psychopathic killer.  It would have been interesting to read some of the other books she has written about him, but I am a woman, not a woman with a strong opinion on sociopaths. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book written for people with no knowledge of the martial arts. I can't believe how bad the book is. I'm a long time martial artist and know how important it is to be able to apply techniques, not just memorize them.   It's a waste of time to read a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books I've been trying to get for a long time.  I'm sure I've read a thousand of them.  In fact, I know for a fact that there's at least one more out there.   I don't want to get this one but I know it's out there somewhere.  The author, for some reason, believes that every time you turn around, someone's trying to steal your wife, and you have to save her from this terrible fate.  What I don' like is that she doesn't really give the readers a chance to weigh in about this.  She doesn't tell us why these people are trying to take our wives, she doesn' give us an explanation as to why they're doing it, or what kind of a life they lead before they turn evil.  This book is all about revenge.  It's like she's trying make a revenge thriller.  As a matter of fact, the title is a little misleading.  There are no wives in this book.  That makes the book about a wife who's in a bad marriage and has to protect her husband from this evil guy.  It seems like she has the right idea at the end but it doesn't end up being as good as it could have been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as part of my "Reading for Dummies" course. It's a bad choice because it is not an easy book to understand. I've tried to read it online and I get frustrated when I get a wrong answer. I don't get it. It makes no sense. I tried to explain it to a friend and I'm not sure how well she understood it either. She just looked at me like I was retarded. I'm just not a fan of books about kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I were planning on watching the film adaptation of "Moby Dick" at our local theater, but we came home so disappointed. I can't even get into it and it's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've ever read. It is an abomination that has a lot of really bad parts to it and is a complete failure. I have been in a long term relationship and I have found this book very offensive. It really is an offensive book. I hate reading about homosexuals, even though I have had a homosexual friend for years. The way the author writes about homosexuality in this book is appalling and I will not be able to recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has a real talent for coming up with ideas and ideas that are very interesting but then he never gets around to actually writing a story.  I liked that he talked about what he was reading (a book by James Thurber about the life of an author) but then that never got much of a go.  The book was interesting, but it just didn't feel like it would get anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very long book. There is very little that is new in the book and very little in the story that is. The story has been told and retold many times and there are some good points in there. But as a novel it is not good. It is too long and the ending is a let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped to read a good book about a man who is obsessed with an ancient device called a "pumpkin". Unfortunately the author is not good at writing stories. This is a story about a girl who has a friend who is a girl obsessed with a pumpkin that she has to steal to keep her friends from hurting her. The story is interesting but has so little to do with the story of the girl and the pumpkin. The author doesn't really give a good description of what it is like to be a girl in a strange situation and just has this creepy obsession with the pumpkins. I guess the author didn't really understand what it was like to grow up with a pumpkin as a parent and how scary it can be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I finished this book is because the editor let me read the first 5 pages. I don't know about you, but I don the most from my books before I read them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a collection of essays and talks about how people can find God in their lives. The essays are well written and interesting but I find it odd that the author feels so strongly about how the Bible doesn't help you find God. If that's true, then why is the Bible so influential? There is much to like in this book and I am interested in hearing more about how these people find God but the author seems to think that the Bible is not helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really thought this book would be better. I love the idea of a girl whose father is a cop who becomes a cop's wife. But the writing is very choppy and I was very disappointed by the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm really disappointed in this book. This is the first book by someone I really like who has yet to be able to do anything useful with his writing.  I've read about two of his books before, and they were all quite good.  His style is very easy to read and he is not at all preachy or annoying.  So it's not like I'm not excited about him being a guest on my podcast.  The problem is that the book was written by someone who doesn't know anything about writing.  It's a good book, but it's still a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a great work of fiction, and it will make you laugh and cry at the same time. This book is about a young girl, who has an obsession with the number one star in a book she is reading. The book was a good read, but I had a hard time finding the one star. There is no one who would enjoy this book and I don't want to ruin the book for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and was so frustrated by it that I had to throw it away and start reading a book that I really enjoyed (a wonderful book, by the way) before I could give it another try. This book is a series of "explanations" on how people become mentally ill. I was a bit confused by the fact that the author claimed that people are always "sick", but never actually gave any reason as to why or how it happens. I don't want to hear about "the genes" or "the environment" when it's obvious that people can't be "sorted" into any category or even the category of "being sick" or not being "saved". The author claims that it's "not a good thing to be a good person" (but not being a "bad person") or that "being a good parent is important" or that the "best time to be alive is when you are not in pain" or some other bullshit. So many things about this book are simply not true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure I ever had a good book. I tried reading this book as a short-term fix before finishing my other one, but found the story too confusing to keep me interested. This is the same story told over and over again in many different settings, but none of them were as fun. I'm sure it was a good idea to make this a children's book, but it's just not funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't remember the last time I read a book that actually was a good one.   The book was about a boy who was raped by his uncle.  It was a very sad story that I didn't want to finish because I felt the whole story was so unrealistic.  The story didn't seem like a true story at all.  I was surprised by the fact that the boy's family did not want to press charges.  After the book ended, I realized how much I hate this book.  This is the first book I have ever read that I wanted to throw away after reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that doesn't make sense in a logical way. I can't tell you why it is so bad, or if it is even worth reading. It is very repetitive, and the end was so rushed that I just gave up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first three chapters of this book are all about the importance of having the right equipment for a game. This is true.  The next three chapters, however, are about a guy named Paul Bierling who decided to have a little fun with his computer.  This is a fun story, but it isn't relevant to the subject of this game. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book at all.  This is the third book by a former NASA astronaut that I've read that has to do with space travel.  In all three books, there's an "astronaut" who is not only an idiot, but who also tries to cover his own ass while everyone else on the mission is very helpful and knowledgeable.  That's what happened in this book.  I was a little disappointed that they used the term "rocket scientist" to describe him.  He's not an astronaut, he's a rocket scientist.  There were several occasions in this story when he talked about how it was impossible to do a space flight with one hand tied behind his back.  When he was the only one who knew what he was doing and the only person not involved in the space flight program.   The story about the accident on the Challenger in 1986, which was really tragic but could have been prevented if he had been in a better position to do the pre-launch checks that they did, he didn't think about that enough to do anything about it.  After the accident, he became the leader of the space station mission.  The reason why the space shuttle program ended is because the shuttle had problems in getting back to Earth after a space shuttle mission, and he was supposed to take over that mission after it ended.  It wasn't like he was in charge of a bunch of astronauts.  (In fact, he had his hands tied behind him for a reason: he was trying to cover up a huge leak in the tank of the shuttle that was causing all the problems.)   I can understand why people love the space program, but not all people are astronauts, and I didn a few of the things that he did.   I'd also like to mention that in all three of the books, he tried to save his astronaut colleagues from getting into a bad situation, but he couldn't even do that.  The only thing that kept me reading was that the story had a good ending, and it was very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about what happened to a little boy after he found out he is adopted. I know there are different versions of this story, but I'm not a fan of the story line in this book. I liked the story about the adoptive parents being good people, but that's about it. The author could have told a more interesting story, and I would have been interested in hearing more about the adoption process (and the parents). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a guy who gets stuck in a bad relationship and the women he meets.   I am pretty sure that a lot of the guys who end up in bad relationships are not the best looking, but they are smart and they are not afraid to be assertive.  The problem with the book is that the woman that he ends up with is not the woman he met.  She has a history with her ex and he seems to know a lot about her but she doesn't seem to really care about him.  It is so hard to believe that a guy like this can end up with a woman who has a similar past as him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as a way to pass the time while traveling. However, I found it too difficult to put down. I found myself trying to make my way through the whole book without making a complete mess of the pages. This book was an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title of the book says it all. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies but this one didn't really grab me.   I was expecting something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written by a person who knows nothing about anything that has happened in the past. He gives very little history about the war or the current situation in Iraq, and instead spends the book making up his own story about how the British defeated Germany. There is no evidence to support his story. He says the British won because of superior tactics, but that is the same reason the British lost the war. He also says the Germans were better soldiers, but in reality, they had the better equipment. The British had the best technology. In the end, he gives the excuse of "history" and claims that Hitler's invasion was the main reason the UK lost. He is full of himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first book by a self-help guru I was not a fan of and now I regret buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on the strength of the author's excellent blog ( www.thirtythree.net  ) and was not disappointed.   She writes with great precision and style, and I was able to get through it in one sitting.  It has lots of good information, but not much that I hadn't already found elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very hard to get through. It is very dense and contains a lot of information about the science of a certain subject but in the end it just didn't make sense to me. I am a biochemist so I am used to reading complex material. I found that I was constantly having to remind myself that there was actually nothing new in the book, that what I was reading about actually already existed and was known about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a cheap, one-dimensional story about a young boy who goes to live with his great grandmother. I can't say anything bad about it at all, but the book is so boring that I can hardly think about anything else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In an interview with the New York Times Magazine   in February   about her latest book   about the war in Vietnam,     Ms. Sontag   told the reporter that   " I think that, in the long run, we will have to admit that the Vietnam War was a failure."   The interviewer   asked   if   this   would   mean   that    the war   is over  ?   Ms. Sontag  said   she thought it   was over .   There   has   been   a   lot   of   talk   lately   as to   what   to  do   with   the   legacy   from   Vietnam.  It   seemed   like   there   might   be a way   out  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending was a little rushed and rushed. The main character dies in the very last pages of the book.  The author should have stopped after that, but she just kept going.  It makes no sense, because her main character was in a very dangerous situation, and it's her only chance to get out alive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not that bad of a book, but it's not good either. It's just a collection of short stories, with little to no progression. I would rather have read some good stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book, it is an okay book. It is just bad and not good at all. I am a big fan of all the books by Brian Jacques but this one is just too boring.  It is so slow.  I am really looking forward to the next book by Brian but I don't know if I will get to it this time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as a gift for my daughter. She loved it but thought the story was a bit boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting and important book. I am not sure if I believe the theory that the "suckers" who write for magazines are motivated by the money.  If that were true, it would not be a huge surprise that the writers were mostly working for magazines.  This was more of a shock.  But the author is a nice guy and seems to have a good sense of humor.  I am still trying to work through some of the technical issues of what she is saying but am convinced that the data is solid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about 5 years ago, I think, and it is a good one at that, but the plot is just so confusing and the ending is so unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's style is so awful that the whole book reads like a parody of how bad writing is: "I had to go to a new high school in another town."  I didn't enjoy reading this at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for this book. The premise is cool, but the story is boring and poorly written. I read this book in one sitting. It was so bad, I had to throw it away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am giving a 4 star because the author has a good imagination, but the book is boring and over written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main reason I didn't like this book is that the plot is weak and unrealistic.   I would like to see a more realistic and detailed description of what it was like for my mother to survive and be free after a year in a concentration camp. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really poor read.   This book is not only very badly written, but is so uninteresting, you could almost feel sorry for the author.  It is almost like she is writing about a friend of hers, who is a total failure at life.  In the beginning, the main character is all about how her best friend is a failure, but then at the end of the book, she is all like "she's my best friend!"   I don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so boring. It was very boring. And, it was so repetitive. The whole book is about a man who has a lot of sexual problems. He goes to a shrink because he has no libido. But then he goes to the therapist who doesn't know what to do with him and she just gives him some herbal tea. It's like a movie that you can watch over and over again. And it's not like he doesn't have sex and they have sex. It seems that he gets into a little bit of trouble in the beginning, and he ends up going to a sex rehab center and getting help. And that's where all the book is, a story about a guy who has sex problems and goes to sex rehab. And then in the end he goes back to sex therapy and they can't fix him because his libido is dead. That's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for a college course on women in the Middle Ages. It was a waste of time, because the only thing that happened was that I was so annoyed by the book. There is a character in this book that is portrayed as being a saintly woman that would never do anything that was wrong. In fact, she was the one who did the most evil things to the women in this story. The other women in her life did nothing. The only thing she did was take them all to bed, which is not the same thing as being raped, even though she was taking their husbands and children with her to bed at the time. She is just a woman with a high opinion of herself and she had a selfish reason for doing all of these things. I thought it was kind of ironic that she was depicted as a good person when it turned out that she just wanted a good marriage. I don't know what the authors of this book were thinking when they put a character like this in their story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess, a very bad one. It takes place during the last years of the Roman Empire, but not the early days.  It starts out with the story of a group of men who have traveled from the middle east to become mercenaries to the Byzantine Empire.  The book goes from bad to worse, but the Byzantine army is so strong and so numerous, the book basically just shows the Byzantine soldiers.  As the book goes on, it becomes clear that these guys are in way over their heads.  I found the idea of Byzantine mercenaries interesting, but when the book really begins to get good, it loses most of its impact.  While the story is good, the execution was not.  This is not a bad novel, just a very flawed one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book.   I read the whole thing and couldn't stand it at all.  I just wanted to give it up after the first chapter because it was so bad.  There are no characters in the book that make sense.  This book is about two characters that get married, but their relationship never makes any sense to me at all and it was a very annoying thing to read.  Also, they do not really make a good case that the world is coming to an end.  It is a very poor argument. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is poorly written. The story is not really about a murder, but about a group of young adults who get lost in the woods and end up being hunted. The main character, the protagonist, is a coward and a "bad" person, but he ends up getting himself killed.   It's like a story about a girl who falls in love with a bad boy, and they end up killing themselves, so I couldn't really recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. I bought it expecting to be entertained but ended up being frustrated at the amount of information that I needed to know to follow the plot.   The whole book is about a group of young people who are at a rock concert and their attempt to get home by hitchhiking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the second time I've had to wait over a year to get a book, and it's all because the author decided to add a third book (which is a bad idea) and re-write the first two books (I'm not happy about that either) I'm not even sure this is a book anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about the last year of a girl's life, and while it's fun, I didn't like it.  The story has some promise.  It tells the story of a young girl who falls in love with a mysterious stranger.  She is a good kid, and he is a really nice guy, but she just can't help but fall for him.  But then she realizes that he has a hidden secret, and that he may be involved with a criminal.    The last couple of chapters were a little hard to get through, but it didn't really detract from the story.  I wish the story was more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband has been waiting a long time for a book about his family history. He really enjoyed the book but I felt that the author, though well researched, did not do enough to justify her own research.   The story is interesting and the author does an excellent job of weaving in a few entertaining facts but I would have liked to have seen her do a little more research on her own to make her story more believable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so boring and so boring that I can't stand to read it again. It was so bad that I had to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting to get a lot of enjoyment out of this book but instead I got more disappointment than anything else. It took me longer than I expected to finish the book, but even after that, I found the characters to be more annoying than interesting. They act like one-dimensional, annoying characters, even if there is a nice backstory or story that is told.  I would recommend this book to people that have a bad feeling about children's books, or people who hate reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not sure why the author decided to write about the last years of the life of a well-known American President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was a good story, but there is no substance to it. The book is full of false statements about Roosevelt's character and his life. As the story is told, the President is a man of many contradictions and a man who was neither an intellectual nor a liberal. I also found it strange that he would take such a position in such a time. In the book the President's life is presented as a series of "misadventures," but what were those misadventures? Did he do something that caused the deaths of some of his staff members? Were he and his wife having affairs with some of the White House staff? There is no way to tell the truth of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was a teenager and I loved it.  It was very funny, but I have a hard time feeling sympathy for people who have to live with mental illness.  The story was good, but it was all about him and her.  I think that's why I couldn't get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books about the Vietnam war and I've found them all to be mostly forgettable and uninteresting.   This book is much better than the other books I've looked at.  It's interesting to see the way the government thought about the war, how the media portrayed it, and the impact that war had on the country.  I'm glad I read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a story about the life of a man named "George" who was an actor and a writer. He was a very good actor and had a very long and successful career.   George was also a very prolific writer, and he died before his work was done.  He died penniless.  George never got his big break in Hollywood, so he decided to live off his inheritance and write books.  When he was a child, he wrote a story that was very good and he was very proud of it, but the editor rejected it.  So George wrote another book about the story.  It was about a man who had been in a horrible accident and died from his injuries.  The man had been a great actor.  That book got George into trouble because the publisher was a movie director who wanted the book burned.  This is the story of how George wrote a book that is about a very bad man.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an incredibly frustrating read. It is a very poor excuse for a story and is very poorly written. The characters are not interesting at all and the plot is not believable.   The author says she wanted to write a historical romance.  The author had a good excuse for writing this book because it is a historical novel.  It is really not believable at all. The main character was a female soldier.  When she was in the army, she had to go to an army hospital where the doctors told her she was having an affair with a French man.  I guess the doctor thought it would be a good idea to seduce a French soldier so he would not have to be sent back to his country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to keep it short and say that this is a poorly written book. The author is so far out of his league that he seems to think that this will be an easy read for the lay person. It's not. If you have no idea what you're doing with the English language, it's not going to go well for you.   There is no sense of pacing.  It's the kind of book that you can spend an entire day trying to understand it but you just can't because the author is just so bad at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the best thing that ever happened to me in my life. My husband has been very unhappy about his job, so this book really made me happy. I don't think he will ever get the hang of it. He was never the most bright kid but when he learned about the importance of this book he was on board right away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband is a former firefighter and we always have a lot of firewood. One time, we had a fire that didn't come close to the house. I had to carry the firewood out. I didn't feel like I could carry the rest of the fire wood home and so I just left it out in the open.   Well, my son had a similar fire that came close to our house but wasn't nearly as bad as this one. The next day, I picked up the wood. It was pretty bad. I have been out of town a few days and couldn't find it so I am just going to toss it away.   a good book about a fire: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to read this book twice. The first time I tried to read it, I didn't really understand what I was reading. Then I got through it, but not as I was hoping.  The story was great, but the way it was told just left me with the feeling that I should have paid more attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was in my early 20s and I still have some of these memories. The first few chapters are so bad that it's embarrassing. I was about 13 or 14 and this book was all over my parents' house. I felt like I was being watched.   The main character is a man named John who has a terrible past. He is so obsessed with a woman he calls "Lola" that he is a serial killer who murders random women, including a 12-year old girl.  Lola is a horrible person, but I understand the reasons he's drawn to her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book at all. The story is about a group of high school girls who spend their school year trying to make a video game that will save their school. This game is called "Varsity Blues". This is not a game that you can play at home.  In order to play it, you have to buy a new computer.  It's just not worth the time and money to buy this.  The story gets very repetitive, and I'm sure if you played this game on your own, it would be boring too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that I had no interest in reading this book.  I'm not sure why.  The book is written as if it's supposed to be a serious book.  The prose is dense, and   it doesn't seem to be working as a serious text.   I think the author had too much time on her hands, so I was hoping she'd write a book that was a good read but had some serious writing going on.  She doesn't do that.  But   it's a nice, long read.  There are a lot of really good things in this book about science, but it seems to me that the book is mainly about how science is done.  There's a lot about how scientists use data to support theories, and how they are often criticized for doing that, but there are a number of times when I thought that the authors were just plain wrong about a number  of things.  For example, the authors say that most experiments on the basis of the theory of evolution take place in nature,   but that's not true.  In the most recent studies on evolution in nature  (see here )  it seems that more of the experiments  on the theory  of evolution  are done in laboratories  than in nature.  And if you look at the data, the results are even worse.    I don't think they've got any data that would support the theory.  (The author does make a very good point that scientists are very good at manipulating data, but then she gets lost in her own theories and the theories of others.  It's a shame she can't see her own arguments clearly.)   In addition, I don the authors sometimes make silly statements like "When I was a young girl I thought I was smarter than everyone else."   (But then again, why didn't she go to Harvard and be a famous scientist?)   And   "In a few years time, a new generation of scientists will be taking a critical look at my findings."  And finally   "I don't know how many more times we will have to hear the same old tired arguments that scientists don't have enough time to do the work they need to do."     There are so many   mistakes in this  book   that I think it is impossible to recommend it to anyone.  Rating: 3 1/2
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just got a copy of this book after spending almost a year of my life trying to find a copy. I found one on Amazon and I am so glad I did.   The book is a very good history of how the world came to be. The history is divided into three parts: the Middle Ages; the Renaissance; and the Modern.  .   the Middle ages:  the medieval period is the period in which the modern world began. This is the time when people started to use written words and the printing press was invented.   I really liked the book about how people were forced to make the world a better place.   to give you an idea about the Middle East:.   - people had no concept of money until the 8th century.  - the word "Islam" is a misnomer, as it is a religion of peace.  (In fact, Muslims don't even use the word for God, but just call him "Allah".)  This is the book where I learned that my teacher was wrong about Islam being a religion that teaches peace.     .   at the end of the Middle Eastern period:     the Renaissance:   It was during this time that people started using the modern printing press to create books.   - people were still illiterate. - they could not write. . (the reason why the Renaissance was so successful is because of this)   and the Modern: ..   . It was during the modern era that we got our first computers.  . and the book says that the Internet was invented in 1989.   (but I don't think that is true. The first internet was invented way before 1989, in 1973.)   So the world we have today is the result of the work of a long history of people trying to make their world a bit better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a big disappointment for me. I loved the first one, so I was looking forward to this. But it just wasn't the same, and it just felt like I'd read the first book over and over again. It's a good story, but not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so glad that I finally got a copy of this book. I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have always loved the works of George R.R. Martin. The book itself wasn't that bad and the author did a good job with the characters. However, I felt the plot was just too confusing. The author does a good deal of work with the history of Westeros and even goes so far as to introduce the characters with a history. However the plot does not match up with the actual history and the characters seem to be just thrown into a random plot. It makes it hard to get invested in these characters. This book did not do anything to enhance my enjoyment of the books. It was just kind of disappointing to be reading a book I was looking forward so much to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a poor substitute for The Bible,  . It's like it was written by someone who was a bad student of the Bible (i.e. an adult who reads a lot but not very well) and   wanted to read something like the Bible but didn't want to pay a lot of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book several times. Each time it seemed to get more tedious, and the characters more shallow. The only character that I've found remotely interesting was the guy who was "in love" with a female character, which is one of the worst things you can be in a romance novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only read a few books on the subject of meditation.   The Buddha is the first and is a good starting point for anyone wanting to know more.  However, this book goes too far in its attempt to show how the Buddha actually practiced.  In doing so it doesn't tell the story correctly.  It shows the Buddha sitting in a cave for hours on end meditating but not in a way that shows how the cave was constructed.  This is not to say that meditation is useless but if the Buddha didn't spend so much time in a place that is a waste of time then he would have spent more time on his meditation practices.  The book is good but the story is not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed in this book. It was supposed to be about how to survive in the wilds without a compass. It's not about that at all. It is about the survival of an entire civilization and how that civilization went down in flames. The characters are not even believable in the slightest.   If you want to read about surviving in the wilderness, get the Survival guide book from the same publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to read a book that has nothing to do with the author's subject. It is about a man who has been in jail and who is a part of a group of prisoners who are on a killing spree. The main character is a guy who is part of the group and has been on the run from the cops for years.  I found this book to be boring.  It was kind of boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a waste of time. I bought it after having read the first two chapters, and when I finished reading the book I realized that it's basically a collection of short stories, which was great until I realized how many times they all repeat the same things and don't even try to tell a good story. In fact, this book is so full of clichés and flat characterizations that it was hard to keep my attention throughout the entire book. I mean, come on, how can they call this a story about a lonely girl who has been bullied by other girls at school when it's clear they haven't read any other books about bullying?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. It was a bad experience to read a bad, poorly written book. I am sure it is just a fluke, because this book is not terrible at all. I have read many books in this genre and have enjoyed many.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this novel, there is nothing in the book that is not already mentioned in the text.   There is a very good explanation of the role of the human mind in creating an image of the world around us, but it is not necessary to understand this in order to enjoy the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the early stages of my pregnancy, I tried to be as active as possible while my body adjusted to the extra weight. This book helped me do that, by helping me understand what was going on. The book explains the reasons why this is happening, but also gives you practical information on what to do about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the complete opposite of what I would expect from a great writer.  The writing is a little stilted and there are a lot of word errors and a lot to unpack.   The story line is not all that compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor book. It's a very bad story about an extremely flawed character.   I found the story confusing and disjointed.  The author was given too much freedom to tell his story.  It just didn't feel right to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad.   The pacing is horrible.  This is the book where the author describes her thoughts on sex, and then talks about how she has sex with women without getting laid.  The author claims she gets laid every night, but she's just fucking around.  Also, the author claims that sex is about getting to a point, and the whole thing is just a waste of time.  It's not about sex.  Sex is about the pleasure.  And I think she should be happy that I like to be dominated, because then I won't want to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to pick up this book because I loved the movie. It seemed like a good book, but it was nothing like the movie and I was disappointed. This book is a little confusing at times, as there is a lot of speculation about why a guy like him would be a spy and why he would go on the run.   This book doesn't even try to make the point that he's a spy, just that he doesn't like it.  I don't know if he was a spy or not, but I guess I'll just assume that he was, because it was a pretty lame plot device. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the story about the kid with no legs to be completely ridiculous.  I'm sure that the author wanted to make a funny story but I'm pretty sure he just got carried away.  The ending was not very good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed with this book. It is about a person who was a member of a secret society called "The Order" in the 70s and 80s. The society's aim was to control people's minds through mind control techniques. The only people who were allowed to enter the society were those who had a severe case of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). The only way to gain membership was to become a member's slave (obstinate), which the members considered a high honour and responsibility. The book is about one of the members, known as "Mad" Dave (his full name was Dave Williams), who had suffered the same type of OCD as Mad Mike (a member of the Order who also had OCD). In the beginning of the book, Dave is shown as a good guy, and is able to control his OCD symptoms. Mad Mike is shown to be very angry and jealous of Dave, but is unable to control himself. Mad Dave becomes more and more desperate as time goes on. His obsession with Mad Mike becomes so extreme that he is even willing to take his own life to try and gain control over Mad Mike. I don't think that this is a good book for people who suffer from OCD. If you don't have OCD, you won't be able to relate to the character in the book. If only the author would have focused more on the relationship between Dave and Mad Mike, this could have been a much better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the type of book that a parent needs to read. I have a daughter who has had several miscarriages and I've read that many women who are having a third are having problems with their fertility.   The problem is that the fertility drug the drug company is paying for is a drug that is used in the womb to make eggs more responsive to hormones.  In other words, the fertility pill makes women more receptive to being pregnant.    It's a "quick fix" to a woman's problems.  It doesn't work in every case but it works a lot of the time.  This book isn't about the fertility pills.  The authors say they are not about fertility but about hormones and the brain and the body's response to hormones (they're right).   It's about the brain, the brain hormones and their role in how we make decisions about sex and pregnancy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very bad. It is a mix of stories from the life of a "bad" guy, and a bunch of crap that the author was too stupid to realize how bad his book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book had a great concept: an imaginary friend who is really a demon that has been controlling a kid for some time. I read it but found it to be too long and boring. It is not as entertaining as I would have liked it to have been. The whole premise is not original, but the writing is not bad. I think it would have been better if the main character was a little less sympathetic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just read this book and it is terrible.  The plot is so lame that I can't believe the authors would even attempt to make it believable.   It is basically a fantasy with some historical elements thrown in.  It is not at all believable. It is a boring and uneventful book that I would not want to read again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was a good title and I liked the author's writing.  The book is full of half-truths, false assumptions, and bad history.  The book claims that the United States was founded by a group of colonists who were inspired by an ancient Christian book.  This is a ridiculous assertion that the authors don't bother to back up with evidence.  It's hard to believe that an ancient book inspired a group that didn't know what the Bible was.  I read the book in two sittings and I found no convincing evidence that the Puritans were inspired.  In fact, it's a pretty good example of what happens when an author wants to claim that a specific group was inspired by the Bible, but he doesn't bother writing a good historical record.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good, but the storyteller is terrible.   Her story was boring and it just seemed like a lot of wasted words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in high school, but only for the first half.  I didn't like it at all.  It was a lot of story about a woman in a man's world.   It had nothing to do with my high school experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an old couple that went to Florida and found a house that was in disrepair and had not been lived in for years.  They had it listed for $500.  After having it inspected, they were given the house for free.  It was a pretty bad house but they put in a lot of work to fix it up.   The book is short but is very informative and funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a part of a larger group of books on how to teach science to people who don't understand it.   This book is an excellent introduction to the topics.  While it's not a bad introduction to most things in science, it does fail to cover all the important concepts in a way that would allow you to understand and understand.  If I were to teach this to someone else, I would probably have a much better book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just so...well, bad. I know that sounds bad, but this book is so stupid that it makes me want to punch it in the face.  The story has to do with a bookie who is a psychopathic sociopath.  He is not very good at what he does, and he can't read.  I guess the reason he's so good is because he's not very smart, and so he can get away with a lot.  There is a woman who is his "mistress" and she is pretty and he gets off on this.  Also he has a woman in his apartment who he is in love with, and they talk about how they are both good looking.    They also discuss how much they hate each other.  Finally, the woman is pregnant with his child.  She is so obsessed with him that she is going to have a miscarriage.  This leads to a lot of bad feelings between the two of them, which leads to some pretty bad sex.  And then she ends up having a baby.  It's like a movie.  If this book were a movie, I wouldn't want to see it.  Oh, and the ending was very stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible, and I am not sure if the author knows what he's doing.   I do not understand the premise of the book: a mother, mother of two, who is also a wife and mother.  I can see why he does not want the mother to go to a group like the "Moms of the World" as she would then be giving up her identity and her power and making others more powerful by being a "good mom."   But the book is based on the idea that being a mother is all about sacrifice.  But it doesn't say anything about sacrificing your individuality for the sake of the family.  Why can't I be a woman who is a mother and still be a strong woman?  And why do I have to sacrifice the good parts of being a woman to have a family?   And finally, why are women supposed to have children in the first place when I think that we need to stop having children and have more sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really not into this book, and I am going to have to start looking for a different book.  It's a collection of stories, and they are interesting and different from one another.  There's a character that really doesn't seem to fit in with anyone, a couple who are just plain awkward, and a girl who is kind of a jerk.  I don't think I will be reading any more of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem with this book is the authors lack of understanding of the science of language. They use a technique called "predictive text" to show how a sentence is related to the word in the sentence before it. If you read the sentence "I love to go to the store to get my books" the sentence is preceded by the words "the store", "get" and "book". If you are a linguist you would realize that "get book" is in the first sentence, not "to the store" The first sentence "to get book" has a direct relationship to "get", it is a noun (i.e. "store") that relates to "book" (it's the thing you get when you buy a book). If "get the book" had been preceded by a sentence like "I get the book at the store". then you wouldn't even have to be a linguists to notice that "I" gets in between the noun and the verb.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read.  The prose is not clear and the book is not enjoyable.    I found this book interesting to think about and discuss but not enjoyable to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only book I have read in the last 15 years that has ever given me a strong feeling of nostalgia.   As a child I loved my old toy cars and the toy cars that came with my favorite toys.  It was a simple idea but the details are so cool.  The car has a roof which is a great idea  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in order to find out what happened to the original book I read when I was in college. I don't remember much about it. I also don't know what's in the new book.   The characters in the book are annoying, but it's not a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only way this book will work is if it's a joke.   There are so many spelling and grammatical errors in this book that I am embarrassed to say that I didn't even know this book existed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wish that the author had been more careful about the details of her experiences in India. The main problem was that she was only a witness.    In addition to the lack of detail, I found her account of her first impressions to be not very reliable.  In particular, she described a very ugly house with no windows or doors.  Even her own parents, she wrote, had never lived in such a house.  The Indian police who came to the house said that she would have to be careful because there were snakes in the walls.     The second major problem with her account was that the Indian police did not take her statement at all.  While I don't blame her for not being taken seriously by the police, I do blame the author for not asking the question why she wasn't taken seriously.  I don 't know what the police would have done if they had known the real story of the house.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a HUGE fan of the books by Terry Pratchett, so I was really happy to find that the first book of the Discworld series is getting a sequel. I read the first Discworld book in the late 1980s, and I've always been a fan of Pratchetto's work. But I just can't get past the fact that the book takes place in the same universe as the Harry Potter books, which is just plain ridiculous. I don't mind reading about wizards and witches, but I just don't like it when the whole thing is taken to be a metaphor about modern-day society. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful. The story is good, but there are several flaws that prevent it from being great. The pacing is terrible, especially the last half. The first half is a good read. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I think the first half was the best part of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, a "conventional" teacher, makes no attempt to cover the whole curriculum. Her first and only class has no discussion of how to use the internet. The rest of the curriculum is a mish-mash of boring stuff like geometry, trigonometry, and a history of science class. This course is great if you don't have any interest in anything else and you have the time. But it will be time well spent if you need a refresher on the basics of reading, math, writing, and science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure the book is a good read but I feel it's a little off-putting because the author is a teacher, not a science teacher, and she seems a bit like an icky person who's always trying to make you look bad.  The book has a lot of negative reviews that are very similar to each other, but the one I found the most ridiculous was from an author who says, "Science is for scientists and doctors, but is for everyone else, too." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending is the most predictable and stupid part of the book. The book has all the hallmarks of a good story that was rushed into publication. It is a book about a character who was an alcoholic, but after a long period of recovery, decides to drink again and then has a relapse. The character does this several times in the story. After this is done, the book says, "If you're interested in that kind of thing, you should have a drink too" and then tells the story of the characters first alcoholic experience. This is not the way to write about a substance abuse problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not the reason I dropped out of college and never went back.   It was the reason why I became a doctor and quit my job.  It's a great story, but I found it difficult to follow and the details were not as relevant as the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of paranormal romance. I don't care about paranormal romance at all. I am a Christian. I believe in Jesus, the Holy Ghost and the Bible. I have found that paranormal romance books can only get you so far. They either can't or don't get past the bad romance and bad science part. I found this book to be very much like a poor retelling of a "Love Story". The romance in this book was just not very good at all and the writing was not good at either. I was expecting a good book but I was very disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been through this book twice.   First time, I was so excited to finally get a copy of this book I bought for myself,   but   it was just a really bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not provide a clear and concise overview of the history of nuclear weapons, a topic that is essential to any serious discussion of nuclear policy. The author attempts to draw a straight line from the Manhattan Project, through the Cold War and the Soviet nuclear arms race, to the end of the ColdWar and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, this attempt to draw this line does not work, as the line has been quite a bit blurred.  I had thought the book was about the Manhattan project, but it is actually about the end-of-World War II years.  The authors have to go to the 1940s to get the Soviet agreement about the development of a thermonuclear weapon.  But the Soviets did not actually agree until the early 1950s, and the U.S. did not start developing a thermo- nuclear weapon until the late 1950s.  If you want to get a good overview of nuclear strategy, read the history books, but this book is not a good book to read about the history.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring. It didn't really make me want to read any other book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written by a self-described 'old school feminist' and I have to say I wasn't interested in her perspective on feminism in the 80s. I found myself completely disappointed in the feminism of her generation.   It was too long and not enough about what it means to be a feminist in 2016. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just received this book and it took me several hours to read it, even though it is a complete waste of time.   There are only a couple of things in the book that make sense, and they are in the introduction.  It is an awful book and the authors are just trying to sell more of their worthless books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad little book. The plot is very cliche. The main character is the only female in her class, and she is very nerdy. Her life is one of poverty and loneliness. She has little to no friends, she has to go to the library all day just to read. Her mother is an alcoholic and her father is a very bad parent. This is a perfect storm for a young girl to be stuck in a bad relationship.  It is a good story, but it is not very original.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book extremely disappointing. I really liked the premise of the book: "The world is filled with the kind of people who think they're special." I also like the concept of a world where everyone is special, but is actually just another person with a bad haircut.   It sounds like an interesting premise for a fantasy novel, but it just never gets off the ground.  First off, the main character doesn't seem to have much of a personality at all. She is boring and unfunny, and the writing makes it obvious she's the one in charge of everything.  Second, the characters in this novel are completely unlikable.  The only person I found interesting was the bad girl who just wanted to get in trouble, but the only reason she was even in the book was because the author made her a part of the main cast.  Third, the world building is weak.  There are no magic or gods to be found, which is a shame since I enjoyed reading about them.  It's almost as if the author didn't even try to create a world that would make sense for the main characters.  I just didn't like how they used the plot to bring in this new character who is supposed to be interesting, but I just don't know why.  Overall:  The main character in this book is annoying.  She is the one who decides everything, and it's almost like she's a dictator.  Her main reason for being in the story is to get involved with the new kid, but she only does so to make sure that she gets to be in the spotlight.  So the book basically becomes a competition between the author and the main girl, but really the story should have been focused on one character and not two.  Also, I can't stand the author's choice to make her the "bad girl".  She isn't a bad person, she just doesn't like getting attention.  This book is filled to the brim with clichés and clichés that you wouldn't want to see in any other book.  All in all, it's a boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, because it is supposedly a guide to writing a novel.   The first three pages had the potential to be a great introduction to a good novel, but as I started reading, it just seemed to be all about exposition.  Even when it was about what to write about in a novel, the writers talked about other novels and never really said anything about their own novels.  It's kind of like when you read about a new hot trend in the clothing industry and it turns out to be just another fashion trend.  And when I say that the story of this book is about a guy and his dog and he is a good guy, I mean he is, but you can't say that he is not.  I feel like this book could have been much better if the book had been about his dog instead of his wife and child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really happy that I got this book.  It's the first time I have used this technology for self-defense and it works great.    My instructor gave it to me, and it was very helpful for me.  I have a friend who is not as skilled as I am, but he is very good at hiding in a corner.  This is the perfect device for hiding behind a door or window. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure how well this book is written, but it's definitely a good book and I think the author could have been better, or at least written a book that isn't so preachy about how the Bible is the only good book, but instead uses it to help Christians understand their own spiritual struggle, or that Jesus Christ is real, etc. However, he is also a great writer, and if you're a Christian and reading about a lot of spiritual topics, you might be a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of "just this once" moments:  One of the few characters that seems to genuinely have feelings for other people is a gay guy, who gets a crush on a very good looking guy who is an atheist.  I find that hard to believe, but it happened to me as well.  A few other characters are so stupid they can barely function at all.  The best characters are the ones that are just plain dumb.  My only suggestion is to include a list of the good and bad things about a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't care about this book at all.    It wasn't bad, but it was kind of boring.  It didn't feel like a true horror story or something.  A few people who are reading this have mentioned the fact that there are scenes of sex that are just too graphic for a teen.  I guess I'll have to give the book that "B" for believability. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a well written book but I don't understand why it took me over a year to read it.   I know what it is about but it just doesn't make sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to get into the story. I didn't like how the main character was introduced. I don't know what the point of her life was. She seems to go from one thing to another without developing a solid sense of self or purpose. She always seems to be in trouble. I'm not saying she is a bad person but she seems to have little drive and is unable to figure out her purpose. I also felt the story was really confusing at times. There are several references to the Bible, witchcraft, and the occult. I couldn't understand what the author was getting at and felt a bit cheated. I ended up reading the book because I liked the author so much but I found this book really disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think that if you like good stories, you will like this. It's a story about two people who are in a relationship that is going badly but they are trying to keep it together. They don't want to end it because they love each other so much but they don't know how to keep things together.  This book is a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has nothing of value to it.  It's just another long list of boring and repetitive stories that have been told so many times that they become banal and predictable.  This is a book that has nothing new or interesting to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about reading this book and couldn't wait to get it.  Unfortunately, it turns out that the book was written by someone with a poor grasp on grammar.  The author makes the same mistake as many other authors of grammar mistakes.  He/she/it has an unusual spelling for a first person narrative and a very peculiar use of pronouns.  It's like they didn't even try to make it sound grammatically correct.  They were just too lazy to write something that would work.  I'm sure that they have a good book on their hands but I wouldn't waste my time reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all. The story was not interesting, and there was not enough of it. This is the fourth book in a series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in the library and the author said it was one of the best ones he's ever read, but I felt like it was really bad, and I'm not a huge fan of the whole idea of "learning by example" I don't think that's the way it should be practiced, in this case, especially since he is basically making an analogy between learning to read by reading other people's words and learning to speak by speaking.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's bad. This is a very short story and the characters are the same as in the other stories in this collection. The story itself is about a young girl who is being stalked by her neighbor and her husband and how the two have gotten together. I really liked the ending though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with other reviews that this book is a complete train wreck, it's a trainwreck in the first 15 minutes of the book that goes downhill from there, there are some interesting ideas that are completely ignored or thrown out and there's some bad writing but it's just not a good book, I'm giving it 3 stars because the book is interesting enough but it has no real meaning or use to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book, and I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy.   I've read all three, and this is the weakest one yet.  It's also a bad sequel.  I don't really know what's going on, or what's happening, or why, or who, or if, and where, but it's just a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was horrible.  It is about a child who has been abused and molested.  I know it sounds awful, but I can't believe the author had to go that far with her story.  She doesn't mention that the girl is the victim of sexual abuse.  Instead, the abuse is presented as an innocent, natural occurrence.  The book makes no attempt to give any support to the child's claim that she was abused by a family member.  Even though it was written in a book about child abuse, it made no attempt at being helpful.  In addition, the author fails to address the fact that children who have been sexually abused may develop a negative view of themselves.  This is especially true when the child was not abused by adults.  This book was terrible.    It was written by a child abuse survivor, and it failed to recognize that she is not special. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been around for ages and has been thoroughly reviewed.   The first half is good, but the second half is a huge waste of time.  The characters were all the same, and their interactions were predictable.  It's sad to say this, but I wish I would've known I'd already seen this book a long time ago, and that I would have been better off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   It's so bad that I couldn't believe it was written by the same person.  It seems that the author has a bad case of the munchies.  He has the author of the other book in this series (The Dark Knight Returns) as the main character.  What's worse is that it's just as bad.  The main character is a loser who does nothing with his life.  And there's no reason for him to have any reason for being in this book.  If you read the other books in the series you'll find that the main characters are much more interesting.  I've read that the books are supposed to be set in Gotham, but this is clearly set in another city. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's about the guy who used to run a chain of pizza places but then decided to open a bakery, which I thought was a great idea but then realized that the prices are so low that it's a good business to be in, but I'm glad I don't get my money's worth at least for a little while, because when I'm in the mood for pizza, this book will get me to go out to a nice place that I would not have considered otherwise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really, really wanted to like this book. I liked the premise and the main characters, the story was fun and I was hooked from page one. However, I had to put it down because it was just too dull to finish. It was boring, predictable, and very dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the book. It had a good plot. It did have a few problems, but not too bad. It was a good read, I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by a non-professional who has no knowledge of the subject.      I can't understand why she is writing a book about this.  The subject is well known to many, but I don't think it is so well known that it deserves a book written by someone who doesn't know it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book, full of bad ideas and bad writing, and it is filled with errors. I could see it as a good book at one point, but it became so incoherent and self-centered that it just became really irritating. I have no patience for self-indulgent, self-important people who think they know everything about anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is weak, and the characters, even if they have something in common, don't really click with one another.  I really didn't care for any of the characters and I think I would have been bored by it if I had to read it.  This is one of those books I have read a couple of times and finally gave up on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no idea how this book came about, but the author is apparently a fan of his work. This is not the case.   It's a terrible book.  I feel like the author could have made a better book if he had worked with a professional editor and proofreader, and that it would have come out looking more professional and professional.  It feels like the publisher is trying to cash in on the success of the first book (this is the first in a series), and is trying too hard to make the second book even better.  The cover is terrible, and the layout is awful.  But there is nothing new in the first or second book, which I think is why this is coming out now, and why it's getting bad reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a kid who goes to a camp with the kids from the "The Simpsons" who have no real friends, and has to learn how to act with them.   It was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read this book I hated it. I'm not sure if the author had no interest in writing a decent book, or if it was just plain bad, or something in between. I hated the first half of the book. I didn't think I could like the second half, but I did. I do love a good mystery and this book was well written and intriguing. It wasn't a perfect book, but it was better than most mystery novels out there. It had a nice story to it, I liked the mystery and it was a good read. I recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a good, solid mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book as a surprise gift and couldn't wait to read it. But when I finally finished it, I was shocked by how poorly it was written.   It starts off as a story about a man named Joe who is on a quest to find a good place to hide a dead dog.  The dog was stolen from him and Joe gets his revenge by hunting it down.  But there is a major problem with this story.  First, the dog doesn't really die at all, it just gets away from Joe.  Second, Joe doesn't find a "good" place to store the dog at all.  Third, after the dog is gone, the owner of the dog (a girl named Sally) is completely unaware that Joe even found the dog. (I guess she thinks it's just a regular stray dog.)   All of these problems combined lead me to believe that this book is nothing more than a plot device to get Joe to chase the dog around.  I found it extremely frustrating that Joe has to go out of his way to do the wrong thing to accomplish his goal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not very interesting, and I found it very difficult to follow the story.    It does not tell you why she is doing what she is trying to do, and is not that clear about what the outcome is.  The ending is also very vague.  I do not see how the world would be better off if we were all born gay. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book at all.   It seemed very "preachy" and the ideas seemed so dated to me.  It also felt very self-aggrandizing and a bit of a lecture.  The writer says things like "It was a good thing he was white."   Not really sure if he's talking about his race or just his status as a man of culture.  He also has a tendency to make grand statements like "the whole world should know" about the importance of good teaching. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book that will be required reading for a professor of linguistics or a linguistics graduate student. I don't think I will ever read a good linguistics book again. It's boring, predictable, and it does nothing new in the field of linguist/phonetic analysis. If you can't find anything good to say about phonetics, don't bother reading this. If a phonetic analysis is interesting, there is something else in linguistics worth reading. If phonetic evidence is not interesting, then you can read a book about how to make sense of phonetic data. If the information in this book is useful to a linguist, then I don´t think it's worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most expensive book I have ever bought (and that is a lot), and the worst book I've ever read. It is boring, and there is no plot.  I just can't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad it is actually painful.   It takes about 10 hours of work to do.  There are many things wrong with this book and I hope they get it in the paper because this is a bad read.  The premise of the book is that the Earth is cooling because of the CO2 gas that is in the air.  I am all for climate change, but how can a book take 5 years to come up with a point that is so obvious?   I have a good understanding of how the climate system works because I work in climate science.  A climate model that was used to predict the climate in the past predicts the climate we are going to see in the future.  When the model says that the climate will be cool in 2040, it is not an unreasonable prediction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with others who have said that this is a "filler" book.  It is not that the story is boring.  Instead, the story serves as a means to introduce the characters and their relationship to each other.  The problem is that the stories don't really get into the characters, and instead just try to cram the characters into one place.  This is not the fault of the authors, but rather that the books just aren't written that well.  There is no real emotional connection to the characters other than the ones that are "brought to life" by the plot.  I don't mean to say that the characters are flat.  Rather, that the way that they are portrayed makes them flat.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. There are no lessons in it. It is a bunch of bullshit, full of nonsense, and there is no substance to it. The book is all about what can be done to a bad girl if you get the right girl.  This isn't even a good book in the first place.  It's a cheap book to make money on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an old story, but it's still too painful to read.  It took me months to finish this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that was made for a Kindle. It doesn't come with a cover.   I thought it would be an interesting book. It's a history of how the English language evolved.  But it's so poorly written, so confusing, so hard to understand, that it doesn't really stand up as a history.  I think it's a great book for the Kindle, but not for people who really want to learn about how English changed over the last 250 years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not expecting the book to be bad.   The whole concept of this book is a joke and it is not funny at all.  The author has no sense of humor and he really tries to make his story into a drama.  It is not a good read at all because it is too dark and it does not make any sense at all to the story that he wrote about the characters.  He is really not that good a writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like the first book I read in this series because it didn't provide a lot of information about the story and it just felt like the book was trying to show that it had been written by a woman.  It didn't really do that.  The author had a lot to say about the book and how the women in her life were portrayed and she said it was a mistake and she didn't know that until after it was written.  I'm glad I didn' read the second book but I won't be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason this book is on my bookshelf is so I can use it as a reference in the future.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very good but very hard to read. It is also quite boring. The book is about the history of the Russian Navy in World War II. The first three chapters were about the ships in the Russian Baltic Fleet and the third chapter is about a battleship that was captured in the Baltics in 1944. The fourth chapter is mostly about the naval battles that took place in the Baltic. The sixth chapter is an overview of the rest of the book and the seventh chapter is just about the Baltic fleet. The eighth chapter is a bit about the war with the Nazis. I don't know why the author has to focus so much on the Baltic Fleet in the sixth and seventh chapters but he did so. This book just drags on and on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not a fan of this book, but at least it gave me an excuse to read a novel by one of my favorite authors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poorly written book, the author has no clue how to tell a story. It has some good parts, but it just doesn't flow as well as it could. It's hard to get interested in the characters, or the world. It really makes you want to close the book and never pick it up again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with false statements and unsubstantiated allegations, including:  The CIA tried to kill John F. Kennedy, because he would not approve the Vietnam War.  I was present at the Kennedy assassination.  "There was no conspiracy in the JFK assassination."  "The CIA is a rogue organisation. It is the most feared agency in America."  a. The CIA is an organisation of deceit, murder and betrayal. b. The only purpose of the CIA is to kill its targets. c. The US government is a dictatorship.  is an and organisation. is a and organisation d. The President of the US is the puppet of the elite, controlled by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. .  of the. This is one of the most blatant lies in the book. The Kennedy assassination has been thoroughly researched by the author and others, and there is no credible evidence to support the conspiracy theory. The author's reference to the CIA "spying" on Oswald is also false. The first mention of "spies" is in reference to Kennedy's personal bodyguards, a group known as the "Secret Service", which was actually a private security force. A more credible reference is to Oswald's visit to Mexico City, where he met with the Soviet ambassador to the Mexican government. The Soviets had sent their own people to Mexico to help with the assassination, but had no access to Oswald. It was the Soviet government which had first learned about the plot to assassinate Kennedy, and was trying to find out who was behind it. In a number of other statements, the author implies that the Kennedy family was involved in the murder of John F Kennedy. This is a blatant lie. In fact, the Kennedy's had no involvement in the assassination. The Kennedy's family had only been in the White House a short time, when John F was assassinated, so were not even aware of the conspiracy. The Kennedys had no connection to the assassination of President Kennedy, as it had been planned well before they came to the White house. And the author goes on to say that "there were no conspiracy theories about the assassination". This is another lie. One of the earliest and most influential theories about Kennedy's death was that there had been a conspiracy to kill him. It did not take long for conspiracy theories to surface about JFK, and the Warren Commission was no exception. This was a very well known conspiracy theory at the time, and it was
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so much worse than it has to be.  This is a typical tale of a young girl's attempts to escape her life of sexual exploitation and abuse, and the ensuing life of misery.  The girl is a prostitute.  She is very ugly.  Her parents do not believe in sex education.  They are very religious and do not have much sex.  There is a sex cult around her.  It is her job to entertain people.  But it is a job she has to put up with because she has no one else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not very good. It is just a bad idea.  I really had a hard time with it, but i had to put it down at one point, as it was getting a bit repetitive.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that is a lot of fun, but doesn't really do much for me.  It's a lot like reading a "good" book (which is usually a really good book), but not quite.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of novels in my youth, but this book was awful.    The plot is so stupid.  It takes place in the same universe as a bunch of other novels, but it is so different and confusing that you cannot follow.  This is a book about a guy who gets a "new" body, but no one knows what a new body is supposed to do.  And it's a big guy!  He's about as large as a regular person, and he's a guy! So he goes on adventures.  There's no way I could get through this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for the first time after being turned off by a couple of reviews on here and my favorite bookseller's comments that she couldn't understand why anyone would buy it.  The characters are shallow, the story is predictable, the ending is unsatisfying, and the overall lack of substance and plot make it a bad read.  This book was very difficult to get into for me, but I can't say I hated it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I gave this book a negative is that it was too long. The whole story about the little girl was too good. I wish there had been a little more time for the kids to interact and develop the character of each of the three kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read this book, but I had no interest in reading a book about how to "think" the opposite of what you're actually thinking.   I have read a lot about this and I agree with most of the points that have been made in the comments below the book.  It's true that this is an easy book to read and that it has a lot of information in it.  However, I was not that interested in the story, so I found the story a little confusing and it was hard for me to understand what he was saying at times.  I didn't think he was making the arguments that he was presenting, so it was a bit of a disappointment.  If this book was for me, I probably would have given it 3.5 stars, but it was not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of nonfiction books. This is the worst I've ever read. It's so full of factual errors and errors of fact, it makes my eyes water and I want to puke. I hate to say it, but you might as well have taken a story by a drunk, written it in the third person and called it a "true story." It's not a true story, it's a lie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of crap. The author claims that she "took my son, who had no interest in history, and taught him about the Crusades." What she did was to put together a series of interviews with Crusaders in which they repeatedly say, in so many words, that the crusades were a waste of time. They say the crusaders never went after the Jews, and they say the Christians went after them. But there is nothing in the interviews that contradicts their own claims. The fact that the Christians were not willing to fight the Jews is not surprising. In the first place, it is well known that Christianity is not very good at persecuting people. In fact, if the Jews were in the wrong, why not just say so? Second, the Christians didn't have a good reason to attack the Jews. The crusaders had a good excuse: The Jews were responsible for the death of the Roman Emperor Julian. The Jews had been responsible for killing the Roman emperor. The Christians wanted the Jews to suffer for that crime. Third, the Jews knew that the Roman emperors were corrupt. So, they went to the crusader emperors, begged them to let them live, and finally were able to get a little bit of mercy. The reason that the Jews went to them was that they had no one else. The Christian emperors had already turned their attention to their Jewish problem. The Jewish problem was not solved. I can understand that the Christian emporer wanted to do something about the Jews but he never would have gone to the Jews if they had been in his right mind. If he had known the real problem, he never could have gone after them in the first instance. So the Crusaders were only trying to save the Jews by taking their land. It is not the Crusading activity that the author wants to show but rather the fact that they were never able to deal with the problem. This book shows the reader that the Crusade was a waste. I'm glad that the book ended on a happy note because I would have been disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never read a book that left me feeling so depressed and unhappy.   The characters are all pretty likable but the plot is so poorly conceived.  It was all about "the book",  and "the author".   And it was all over-written to make the story as dramatic as possible.  I hate that kind of writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read in my life.   I would have given up on it, except that my family was in town.  I don't like the style of the writing at all.  This book is the equivalent of a "goody two shoes" to someone who doesn't have a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book thinking it would be a good read, but it was just another book about a "cool" person who is totally oblivious to the people around him.   In addition to being ignorant to other people's feelings, he also doesn't know how to deal with people.  He gets drunk in public and makes stupid decisions and doesn't think through the consequences, which leads to him making even more stupid decisions.  When he's not getting drunk, he's getting into fights and being stupid about it.  This book would have been better if he'd learned how to handle people before he went out in public in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke. The book begins with a description of the protagonist's childhood and the horrors he experienced at the hands of the mentally ill. He was a lonely child who had the misfortune to grow up with two mentally ill siblings.   It's the only description that's actually helpful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a book to read after I finished my last novel, and this book caught my eye immediately. The story was simple but interesting, and the characters had depth. I would read more about this book if I get the chance, but it didn't make it into my reading list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main reason I have not read this book is that the author has not done a good job of making it interesting to read. He does a good enough job of summarizing the basic ideas about the evolution of human languages but he does not write about the interesting ways in which the different human languages have evolved.   This is unfortunate because there are some very interesting ideas in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a number of books by Mr. F.   It is a very good read but the ending is just so cliche  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not that good. I don't know why the publisher gave it a good review. This book is very long, with a lot of material about the occult, the occultists, and a few chapters about some of the things I found interesting in the book. I read it in one sitting and it was quite boring. The occultists were all very similar, and most of them were very much like some of our "celebrities" who try to sell us their books, which are a lot like junk. I hope the authors don't sue the publishers for a lousy review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little hesitant about reading this book, but I finally did. I didn't really like the first half, but it seemed to build to something pretty cool. This book started off with a lot of hype about a girl from the future, and I thought that was really cool, especially since she is an AI. She seems pretty cool in the short time that she is in the story. The only problem is that when she is introduced, she doesn't seem that much better than the other people in the future that we see, especially when she talks about how much better they are than her. The next few pages were a bit confusing for me, and the whole time I kept thinking "Wait, I can't do that! I am an AI, I am the best of the best, why am I not better than them?" And that was it, I didn' t really get it. I have read a lot about this stuff, so I have seen a lot better stories about this. I can understand why this book is a best seller, but that is just a bit disappointing. I was expecting a bit more from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very long, but the content is not very interesting.    The book is about a man who was in a car crash when his brain stopped working, and his wife was in the car.  The brain still works, but not very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor read. The author, as usual, uses her characters as a means to an end. It's not a bad idea, but it doesn't work well here. A little of the romance between her two characters is very good, but the rest is mostly meh. I really didn't care about the characters, and didn't find any of them particularly interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for a class in high school and it was terrible. I didn't like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a terrible waste of time.  The main characters in the book are not likable at all.  They are so boring and they come off as obnoxious,  even though their motives are questionable.  This is the main reason I gave this book a 1 star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know about you but I am a little skeptical of the scientific methods of "psychological science." After reading this book I am definitely not a believer. I will definitely keep the book in my library but will not be buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read the book, but I can't get into it. It is so difficult to get the point across that this book isn't worth the read. The writing style is very dry. I understand the point of the book and it is a good one. But it doesn't really get there for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but it just doesn't work for me. The first few pages were a bit too fast paced. The characters didn't seem real to me. As I'm reading the book, I'm like, "Okay, okay, maybe he's not as bad as he seems." Then, about ten minutes in, I realize he's totally the worst person in the world. It's like he was designed to be the villain. I'm a real sucker for bad guys who have some redeeming qualities. I can't stand the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is the main problem with this book.    The story starts off well, but by the end I was bored.  This book should be called "Boring" because the characters are not funny, they are just average and you would have no interest in watching a movie with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total waste of time and money.    The book is all about how a woman has a one night stand and then she is pregnant, but she doesn't realize she has a 1 in 12 chance of getting pregnant.  She is forced to have an abortion.  After a week she is back in bed with her boyfriend and she decides to go get a cup of coffee.  It is a horrible day and it is clear she is not going to have a baby.  The man she slept with is a serial killer, and the book gives no information on who the killer is or what he is doing.  I know how to get rid of a bad boyfriend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a lot of fun. The author is very clever, and uses this as a way to get readers to do her work for her, to help her. The book was a great way to go through some old research materials. I have a feeling I'll be doing more of this type of research with her in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and the movies.   After reading this book I have a hard time enjoying the movies any more.  The character development in this book is extremely weak.  It seems that the author just put some plot points in a book and left the rest to the reader.  I also found the book to be incredibly boring and the characters just didn't seem to have much to do.  This book is not even worth reading if you're looking for a good book to read that is also fun to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never read a book about the Vietnam War that I have disliked so much. I can see why they wrote this book--after all, it was written by a Vietnam veteran--but I don't agree with it. It's not that I don�t agree with the war, it's just that I think it is a bit overblown and, frankly, stupid. The most I can say about it is that it gives a good idea of the mindset of the "militia" (the guys who got us in Vietnam) and their attitudes towards the government (the people who were there to defend us).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book. But it's a very bad book. There are many good things about it, but the writing is very bad. It is so bad that I can't bring myself to give it a positive review. The author is a smart person who tries to make a good point about how the Christian religion makes the world so bad, but he fails to do so because he can't write. If this were a book by someone other than a Christian I would have read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  The characters are all over the place.  They all have something to say about how they're going to ruin the game of rock-paper-scissors.  There's a lot of complaining about the rules of rock paper-scissor.  And, well, that's the way it goes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was very interesting and it was a very good book. I am glad to have seen it on Amazon as I have read a lot of good books but this one did not impress me at all. The character development was not good at all as it is too hard to imagine how the author is going to explain that she is a very bad person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book very much, and it was the first time I have ever been able to use a high-tech digital camera to get decent pictures of animals.  However, there is a problem with the picture of the baby deer.  The legs are bent backwards and the neck is crooked.  This is a bad picture because the legs should be bent forwards, not backwards. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most horrible book I've ever read. I don't think it's possible to make the story any more depressing than it already is. I can't see how anyone can get through it. The characters are so flat, and the plot so terrible, it's hard to take anything seriously.  It makes me think of the character "Kitty" in "The Golden Compass"  who can't stop talking about how she's going to save the world.  I hate that person! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is stupid.  It's all the main characters and the action taking place in the desert are really just people trying to kill each other, with nothing interesting happening in between.  The whole book has a ridiculous plot with no real logic.  I can't imagine any story that is so nonsensical that you can't follow it.  In short, the story is boring, and not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poorly written book.  The story is interesting and the characters are interesting, but    it's so slow paced.   It's not like the books from the 90's and 00's where the characters were doing something exciting.  There is a reason why the author is only getting 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had no expectations of this book, but found myself reading it through.    This is one of those books that is difficult to read.  It was hard to follow.  There were a lot of things that happened that I didn't know how to make sense of.  I don't know if I found it hard to read because of the language.  However, this book is about a woman's life and it's not about sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in January of 2017, and it's a very good read. The book is about the history of the early Church, but that's all I care about.  It's about the early church, so it's boring.  If you really want to learn about the Early Church, the book is definitely worth it, but it is a bad choice of subject for a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is so bad it makes the book worse. The book is set in a high school. The protagonist's parents are teachers and his mother is the most popular girl in school.   She gets her start by taking in a boy that is a bit odd.  They are always together.  The girl's parents take in a teenaged boy.  He gets an A in the class and they start a relationship.  His mother is very much in love with him.  One day the girl's mother is killed in a freak accident.  It seems that he was not in on the whole plan.  When the boy gets the news his mother goes into a rage.  She kills herself too.  My guess is the book is just about the mother and the boy.   This book is about the relationship between a highschool teacher and a teen that she is very close to.   They were together for a long time but after the teacher was killed by her daughter, the teen was not so sure about his relationship with the teacher anymore. He was going to take his mother's place but he is now considering suicide.  This book has nothing to do with the actual highschool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really thought this was going to be good. It was the first book by a woman to be published in English in the past 50 years. So the book was interesting, but not so much that it stood out from the usual female-written books that have been so popular in the last several decades. This is a new novel, but it was still about a woman writing a book about herself. The book is not bad. It is just not as interesting as I had hoped.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for the first time a few years ago and it was so good that I thought I should get it for my own. The author did an amazing job with the story. I would have liked to have seen more of the other characters. I feel like it's too much like the movie and I don't really see any point to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a well written and interesting book.   However, it's really not a good book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is interesting, but the author just repeats the same thing over and over again, with very little change in the outcome. I also found the ending a bit abrupt, which didn't make me want to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst book   It is written by a writer that just   Doesn't have a clue   Its not a good story   What a waste  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a great read. It had a good plot. It was written in a nice style. I really loved the fact that the writer did his research and was very thorough about the history of the place in which he lived. I loved that the author actually visited the place and saw the original artifacts and books and that he even talked about it. I even liked the way the author tried to make his characters like real people, because he gave us a history about a place that was real to the people who lived there. It took a few hours to get through the book, but I liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not good, but I did find the characters interesting. I thought I could sympathize with them but really I didn't like them much at all.   I would have been more satisfied with a book about the people who run a big insurance company.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why this book is so popular. I don't think I would've bought it even if I were a fan of this author's other work. She tries a lot of different things with the characters, but none of them are particularly well executed. The book is very long and slow going. At one point the characters discuss the nature of evil. They don't really seem to be thinking very clearly about evil. It's not until they've been through all this and the protagonist has been in prison for over a year that they start to get any insight into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this in one sitting after a long day of work and this is not good. The story is great but the book is not. I wish they had spent more time on the details of the story and less time on how the characters react. It took a lot of patience to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from a local used bookstore, and I really liked it at the time. It was well-written, easy to understand, and had a good plot. However, I didn't like the characters. It wasn't until I re-read the book a few years later, and the plot got even worse that I was able to enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but I didn't find it very funny. I found it very depressing, as the protagonist has to make a lot of tough decisions to keep his family safe from predators. There are a lot more depressing moments in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book itself is pretty bad. I was hoping it would be an interesting read, but the author's writing is so sloppy that it's not a good read at all. It's hard to keep track of who's who and what's what, which is unfortunate since the book is supposed to be about this girl. I don't like that she's too stupid to get it right, since she has some good points. If I had more time, I would have been able to read the book in a couple of sittings, but I don t have that much time and it would have taken up too much time, so I'm going to have to wait until I have more time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. It is a complete disaster, a mess. The book starts with a bunch of clichés that are clearly lifted from an old horror movie. The story is about a young girl who is murdered by a family member. Her body is found at a lake. The parents are never charged, but the police suspect her parents. It seems the daughter is somehow responsible. I just can't believe that the book was published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not bad. It is not good. It's just bad.  It has a lot of good ideas, and is a good read.  I liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely disappointed by this book.    The protagonist is a young man who has a very interesting life.  He is very intelligent and a good leader.  His parents are not religious, but they do have good values and they instill them in him.  But the problem is that he has become a drug addict.  It is very hard for him to stay away from the drugs.  And he is an easy target because of his intellect and good looks.  If you were the parent, you would be ashamed of your son.  I was embarrassed when my parents were not religious and my father had been a drug dealer.  So I had been thinking about this book as well.  This book is a "tell it like it is" book that is not true.  The only way I can explain why I was so disappointed is because it was so easy to write.  The protagonist was an interesting person.  There was nothing wrong with him and he was able to keep his life a secret.  As for the ending, I guess I was looking for a happy ending, but it wasn't there.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a bad read, but I was disappointed by this book.   The first couple of chapters are very basic.  This book is basically about a woman who falls in love with a man who doesn't know how to be in a relationship.  She wants him to do everything for her and then he won't.  That's all there is to it.  Then he's married to another woman and she has no idea what he's thinking about.  I don't know why a woman would want a man to do all the work for her, but if I'm not mistaken that's exactly what he does.  Also, the first wife does all the housework, but the second wife gets to cook the meals.  The second wife is clearly more feminine, so the husband feels like a loser because he can't be the wife of the more feminine wife.  But the most disgusting part is that the man who is so happy about the new woman he's dating, but who doesn t care about the woman he fell in love (who has had her husband for 10 years) thinks that the new wife is so pretty and sexy that he wants to marry her.  So that is what I got out of this book: a man that is so stupid he thinks he wants a woman, but only if he can do all her housework. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was an excellent introduction to the philosophy of free will.   But it is also a horrible book.  It starts off with a bang (which is to say, it's just a book) but then it goes downhill pretty quickly.  I have a hard time believing that people who study this stuff for their PhDs really don't have any good ideas about it.  In particular, the idea that human free will is the cause of evil is just wrong.  You can have a bunch of people being tortured and you can ask what caused it, and the answer is always the person's free will!  The argument is based on the idea of a universal cause (which, of course, is not universal) and a universal effect (which really is not that universal).  It is really easy to show that any kind of universal cause is just a way of saying a specific effect (for instance, God being the universal cause of good and evil).  But if you want to argue that all evil is caused by free will, that's a whole different ball game.  But that's not really what I want to do here.  Rather, I want more about the basic concepts that these people have.  First, I need to note that there is an excellent book on this topic by a very good philosopher:.   In it he argues that there are some things that cannot be explained by natural science and that therefore they are supernatural.  He doesn't really go into the details of this in the book (which would be too much to ask for), but I found it interesting.  The second thing that comes up in the interview is that the way we make decisions is very different from the way that other animals make decisions.  This is something that I haven't thought about much, and it seems to me that the human brain is very, very different.  For example, a lot of people would probably agree that if you put a lot more money in a jar of peanut butter than you put in a bottle of peanut oil, the peanut butter will make you fat.  Even though the peanut oil won't make you fatter.  Or if you were a child and you were told to pick a particular toy and you chose a little red square, even though the square isn't a good toy for you.  If you are a child, then you know that the red square is not a good thing for you (and you know the square
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I can give this book a negative rating is because it has the same problem with spelling and grammar that a lot of good fiction (like  The Great Gatsby ) has.  There is nothing wrong with the writing, but it's the grammar that I find so annoying.    It seems like people who know a little about writing have to have their grammar all figured out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a new graduate who has been following this series with interest.  I bought this book for my college library but it was hard to find.  Now I'm back to buying it for myself.    It's too bad that a series of books on the same subject as this one are so hard to obtain. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am going to get a good book out of this and I will say that the book is poorly written and does not follow the "book" concept of a series.    I have not seen the movies and have no idea what to expect from them.  I think it is going to be a good idea to have the first book of a trilogy be a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book I don't care about. I can't stand fantasy and science fiction. So when I heard about this, I got excited. Then I read the synopsis and was disappointed.  It's not a good book and is pretty cliched. I didn't really care for it and didn't get a great deal of enjoyment out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very sad story. The book has the same problem that all the good stories do: it has the best part and the worst part in the middle. It's an awful story about a terrible mother. It is about the most horrible mother I've ever met. It makes me wonder what happened to that woman who was so beautiful. It was the worst mother I have ever seen. I hate the mother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had never read a book that was so boring and pointless. It seemed that it was written by someone who was trying to sell books at a book fair. It didn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a bad novel. There are some things that are bad, but I didn't find them to be all that terrible. For example:  It was interesting that the man who was responsible for the discovery of the secret of immortality was the man whose wife had been murdered.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that is so bad that you feel like you need a dictionary just to describe it.    This book is about a woman who is in love with a woman that she can't have.  The book begins with a picture of a beautiful woman that the woman is attracted to.  And so begins the story of the woman, who is a horrible person.  This whole book is just horrible, I don't know why the publisher let this woman sell her book, she deserves to be in prison for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor example of the classic bad book I have been writing. I liked the premise but the end results were un-engaging. It is not the worst but it is the worst I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book at all. The book was not a good read for me. It was a little slow, which is not something I really enjoy. I am more of a fast reader, so I was having a hard time getting into the story and not feeling like I was being given anything to think about or ponder.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an old book. The author tried to be so sophisticated but got very little for his effort.   He wrote about "the last days of an old man" who had a good brain but was dying and would not live to enjoy his golden years.  His brain, he said, had been taken out by a stroke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always liked this book, but in this edition they got rid of all the humor, and now it just reads like a boring biography of a man who didn't really have much to say about himself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book. I have a problem with people that do not understand that the Bible is not just a book of history but a book that contains God's will for his people. This book is very biased against Christianity and it is not true that there is no difference between the Christian God and the Muslim or Buddhist or atheist gods. There are some Christians that would say that there are a few things that they don't like about the bible and they are wrong. There is nothing about slavery, genocide, war or racism in the bible, but there is plenty of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to agree with the reviewer above, in that this book is a poor attempt at a novel. It is not a bad novel, just a bad attempt at one. As the title says, this is a story about two brothers in a dysfunctional family that has a lot of conflict. While the book itself is interesting, the characters that are portrayed in it are not the ones that the author chose to put into the story.  The author tries to portray the characters as "bad" in order to make them more interesting, but in the end, they are not interesting at all. The one character who is depicted as "good" is only there for the plot convenience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a well written book, but the book suffers because the author writes so well that the book is not as good as the author makes it out to be. The book is a collection of stories about what it's like to be a woman in the military.   The story about the rape is one of the best stories in the book.  It shows the power and respect that a man has for a woman, the value of her sexual needs, and how that affects a man's attitude towards a woman.  I found the book interesting and enjoyable, but it's not the best story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third time I have tried to use this recipe. I love making lasagna, but when I use it to make ravioli it does not rise and is not very good. I don't even use it as a side dish. This recipe is the best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not find this book.    It is really a very long work.  It has some really good stories and some interesting stories.  However, they all seem to be told from the POV of the author.  I just couldn't get into the story and I could only understand it from the author's perspective. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not teach you anything about how to run a successful business. It is a book written by an over-entitled entitled woman who has never worked in a company. It does not tell you how to find customers. It gives you the tools you need to succeed at a small business. This book is about her life story. She has a very nice life and doesn't need this book to tell her about how she can succeed at her life. It would be nice to have the book be about a successful person. Instead, it is about a good looking, over-privileged, entitled woman with nothing but time on her hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very long book with a lot of detail about a very complex subject. It is very difficult to put down as the information is very useful to a lot. However the writing style is not my cup of tea. I found myself constantly looking up the references to try and understand what I was reading about. The book was not a complete failure but I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of people are excited about this book, and I am excited too. However, it's not as good as it could have been.   The characters in this book are very shallow.  A very boring character who only cares about herself and nothing else.  She also has no emotional depth and no real interest in anyone but herself.  Her brother is very bland.  The way they are all introduced is very weird and contrived.  It's a bit like watching a documentary of a kid who is very bad at soccer but everyone loves him because he has a nice smile.  And that's a sad thing to say about a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so bad, you would think that the author is just another hack who writes books for the money. This is the second book I have read by this author that I have given a 1 star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a lot of books. I'm not going to pretend I have any special insight into what makes a good book. I have some pretty strong opinions about some things. This book has all the makings of a good "let's pretend I can read" book, and I've heard a lot about this book. But I just didn't care for it at all. The story is really long and doesn't really go anywhere.  The characters are kind of flat and there is a lot to be said about how they all kind of fall in love with a very un-interesting man.  There are a lot more things in this book that could have been done in a more interesting or interesting way. I am sure that there is plenty to talk about if I'd have actually read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke. It is filled with blatant misinformation about what you need to get a job, how much money you need, how to find a job in the first place and how to make money working for yourself.   I had to spend over a year of my life and over $100k working on my own and this book tells you it is no big deal and that you can find a way to do it   The only people it will help are those who have already got what they wanted or who want to try it out  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not sure if I liked this book at first. The description didn't help much, but after a few pages, I got into the story. It was a nice twist to the "love is blind" trope.    It was also nice to see a woman who was not a virgin being raped by a woman in a car. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very poor. The writing style is too simple and it just goes on for about 200 pages. The book tells the story of how a man and a woman were found to have killed their entire family, the dog, and a cat, and then were arrested for murder.   I thought that the police were just trying to make an example out of these people, but they are really not even that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the kind of book that can be a little disheartening when you realize that a book is trying to tell a story but can't get any of the information it wants to. The fact that it does not do that and tries to cover everything in a blanket statement is frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that is so bad that you can't put it down, and you just want to read more about it.  The writing style is so unreadable that it's difficult to imagine anyone actually reading the book, even if they were going to.  It's a real drag.  I was hoping to like this book because I'm interested in the history of a topic that interests me.  In this case, it's a guy who made a good living as a carny.  But what I really wanted to know is why the heck he made a living as an carny in the first place.  He just sort of wandered around the streets, and the other carny's didn't like him and tried to get him to leave, so he decided to come up with the idea to make a living by being a carnie.  This book seems to say that people who do this are all crooks.  What's the deal?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. The story is bad, the characters are stupid, the story is confusing and the ending is lame. I'm not sure how I got into this book but I ended up finishing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about this book is that the author's voice is completely unrealistic and not even a bit believable. The characters in this book are a total nightmare. I could not believe what the author wrote about how much she loves the people in her life. She loved the one thing she could not give up, but even then she couldn't accept that her boyfriend was cheating on her. I can't wait for the sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read this book was at my sister's house. I thought it would be a good idea to read a book at a friend's house with the goal of having an "aha" moment and figuring out what the book was about.   The problem with the book is the fact that it takes about a year to get there.  It is not clear who the author is, but if you want a good read about a group of people that don't really get along (I did), this book is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad I was laughing hysterically at it the entire time. I was so annoyed by it.  The author has absolutely no sense of humor.  She makes no attempt to be a good writer, and the book is a joke.  It's not that she is stupid or that she doesn't know what she's doing, it's that she does not try at all.  I'm not sure if she's intentionally trying to make a bad read, but the result is that it's not only terrible, it is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that this book is absolutely garbage. The author seems to be making up his own story and is not in any way knowledgeable about the subject at hand.   He claims to have "discovered" that the sun is really a giant ball of plasma which orbits the earth.  This is not the case, it is a known fact that the earth is made up of thousands of satellites which orbit the earth,  the closest one is about 20 times closer than the sun.  Also,   The "sun" that he is referring to is a sunspot.  The sun is an orb of plasma about 8,000 miles in diameter and has no physical shape whatsoever.  He also claims that "at any moment, there are hundreds of thousands (sic) of stars in the Milky Way that are millions of times brighter than the Sun."    This does not make sense, the Milky way is very dim in comparison to the sun and only about 1/1000th the size.  Again, the sun has very few stars in comparison. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of articles by people who hate the current Republican Party, or at least some of them.  There are many excellent things in it, including the excellent writing by Mark Steyn.  In addition, there are some good critiques of both the left and the right, and of our current system of governance.  But the main purpose of the book is to try to understand why the Republican Party has become the party of bigotry and intolerance.  As an aside, it's interesting to see how quickly a group that is almost exclusively white (mostly Southern, from the South) became the party that is the home of bigots. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poor book with a bad story line.   I did not like the character who has a mental disorder. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in the style of a history, with lots of factual errors and omissions. The narrative is confusing and full of inaccuracies. I was able to read the first three pages, and that's about it. If you're going to use historical facts to support a religious thesis, at least make sure you know what you're talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most disappointing thing in this book is that the author does not seem to understand the difference between a real problem (the loss of a loved one) and a false claim (the death of a real person) The problem is that this book does not address the former, but instead uses the latter as a plot device to give a false impression of the former.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst thing I have ever read.  The first two thirds of the book is boring and poorly written.    The whole thing is basically a rambling rant about how much she hates her brother and how much he is to blame for everything that is wrong with her life.  She is clearly a victim in this book.  I can only imagine how hard it is to have a mentally unstable sibling and to live with it.  The author was also trying to be funny at one point.  There were also a few plot holes that I found quite interesting:   -The author mentions that she once got a divorce, but doesn't tell us what year or what kind of divorce.  Why would she mention it if she never got a good divorce?   -The author makes it seem like the brothers have had numerous affairs together.  But the only one that I remember is the time that her brother got caught cheating on her with a hooker.     -Her brother is a big, powerful guy and yet he is so pathetic that he doesn't even have a driver's license.  In the first book he was arrested for drunken driving and was fined $600.  Yet in this novel he is a total failure at life and he doesn' t even have his own car.  He is a huge douchebag who doesn't seem to even know how to drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a collection of stories about a group of people who live on a small island in the middle of a lake. The book starts off with one of the main characters, a man named Fred, who is a fisherman. The group is named after a type of bird and one of their favorite things to do is go out to the island in a small boat and catch a fish. This is their only source of income. It seems like a very small group with limited options. They also seem to have an endless supply of trouble. Their problems seem to be a result of their small size. They have a problem with a girl named Sarah. She has an evil look about her and is not a very nice person. One of the things she does is steal a fish from Fred. He gets a fishing rod from his uncle, who also works for the town. He and Fred go to town and buy a large hook, but he never got the rod. They get to the shoreline and find a large fish. Sarah tries to get it and the two of them have a big fight. Fred decides he is going to get the rod, and he decides to go back and get it. After he returns, Sarah tries again and Fred is still not getting it. He decides to get Sarah's fishing pole, and she lets him borrow her. Fred finds out that Sarah stole his hook. Sarah has a big fish, and Fred decides to fight her. The fight is a struggle and it's not pretty. Fred eventually wins. Sarah gives Fred his rod and he returns to the group. The next time the group gets to the water, they have to swim to a big rock to get their hooks back. After that, they start fishing again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book. It's so poorly written that I can't even say I finished it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have no clue what happened to this book, but the story is not interesting.  The story starts with a guy named "Hugh", a very handsome man, and he goes to his first "romance" with a very nice girl named "Beth".  After they get engaged they are invited to a party at the house of "Penny" the local "ladies' man" who is not at all nice to Hugh.  Then Hugh goes to a ball at "Gloria's", a nice place that Hugh is invited to and she goes too.  After the party "G" comes out of a bathroom, gets a big smile on his face and starts flirting with Beth.  It all seems pretty normal, and then "G", while talking to Beth, starts "flirting" with "H".  Then he starts asking her out on a date.  This is the worst part of the book.  I would have preferred if "G". was a bit more mature and not just talking to a girl.  Maybe "H" would have been more interesting if he was older.  Posted by G.R. at 8:48 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out well enough with an introduction on the basics of quantum mechanics and the theory of quantum gravity.   Then comes the rest of the book, in which the author discusses his recent experiences with quantum mechanics.  For the most part, the discussion is good.  I'm a quantum mechanics enthusiast and I'm very glad that the author has read my research.  The theory is well described, but the author's comments are sometimes unclear.  One thing he says is "There is no direct connection between quantum mechanics theory and the 'big bang.'"  This is a valid statement in the context of classical mechanics and in the light of quantum theory.  This statement would not hold for a quantum theory of gravity, but I think it is a useful observation to make.  Also, in the discussion on the 'grand unification' of all quantum theories, the author mentions that the 'collapse' of the wave function may not be the best way to describe quantum mechanics (and he does mention it a few times in the rest).  I can see the need for a 'collapses' to explain the results of quantum measurements.  But in the end, I don't think it's necessary.  At any rate, I think that this is an interesting read, and I look forward to more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to love this book, but it just did not work for me. I loved the book when it was first published in the early 90's. It was a good book, the author really knew how to write. It seemed to me that he knew what he was doing, so that made it all worth while. But when it came to writing it, he got really lazy, and his writing just was not the same. He just didn't have any real talent in the writing department, so the book just kind of fell by the wayside. It's just a really boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most pathetic book I have ever read.  The story of a woman who falls in love with a dead man and then finds out she was cheating on her husband with him.  If I wanted to read about a woman falling in love I would have picked up a novel about a man with the same name.  It has nothing to do with anything and is just a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad story. It's the bad writing that makes this book bad. I was expecting some great ideas, but instead I got a boring rehash of the same old thing. It doesn't make me think any more about anything, and instead makes me wonder why it was so hard to come up with something new. It may have just been that it was such a familiar story, but I just couldn't get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just an extremely bad book. I had never heard of this person before I read this book. It's a really good book and you can see why she wrote it, but if you have ever read any of the things that are being said about this woman, you would know she is full of it. I don't even know if she has a PhD, but that doesn't really matter because she was a fraud.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was so bad that I could not take the book seriously.    It was like a movie that was filmed in a bad neighborhood with the bad actors.  I wanted to leave.  This book did not make me laugh or feel anything.  The ending was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read. There's nothing good about this book. I don't know if it was intended as a critique of a particular type of book or just a general condemnation of the genre. Either way, it's a bad read and it's not good that you have to be a math major to understand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really thought this was a great book about a group of people. The book is interesting, but the way the author covers it is not. She uses a lot of old photos of the people, and not the modern ones, and she tries to make it sound like they are not all very interesting, not that they are all very poor. There are plenty of pictures in the book of the modern life of the family. But she didn't get the family from New York to the Great Plains. She tried to make them from the Great Lakes to the Rockies. She also made it sound that the children were very religious, but I didn't believe that. It was like she made the whole book about the church and the kids, which was not what I wanted to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really know what the authors intended by this book.   This is the first time I've heard about the phenomenon called "the postmodern woman" or "the ironic woman."   What I understand is that these are women who see themselves as modern but who still have an independent voice.    I'm not sure how the author of this book got that idea, but it doesn't work.  I find it interesting that the book is about how women are not supposed to be independent, but in fact, most women are.  In her own words:  "I'm still working on my feminist identity.  " The postmodern female isn't a true feminist because she's not willing to give up her self-esteem or be a victim, even though she is often made to feel like one by men.  The irony is that the women in this book are doing exactly what she is saying she should do:  they are questioning the men in their lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book. I thought it was a great read, but I have to admit that I was disappointed that this book is so short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure there's a good reason why the book is a non-classic, but if it weren't, it would be. The book is about the history of the American Civil War, and the author gives a short overview of that, but not much more. I'm not going to try to summarize it for you, because it's so long that it's impossible. It's a little too long, I think, for me to even understand the book, and I'm a historian, so I'm probably going to have to read the whole thing. The only thing I'll say is that it really doesn't belong in the "Civil War books" category, at least for me. It could easily fit into any other war book (the Spanish-American War, the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, World Wars I & II)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't normally like the genre of horror, but I have to admit that this book is really good. It is scary, suspenseful, and a bit sad.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been reading a lot about the ancient world and ancient philosophy and history and culture. But it is still a boring read.   This book is a collection of ancient wisdom. This is not some sort of advanced book that would explain some complex thing. It is very basic. It will not make you a philosopher but it will make you know a lot more about a lot less.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. I was reading a book on how to become a better writer when I realized I had nothing to say about a topic I've thought about a lot. The whole book was basically a review of books by other writers, which I think is a very interesting topic and a very useful one. I thought this book was very useful, but unfortunately, it didn't go far enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no redeeming features.  The book is filled with un-explainable (and confusing) plot holes.  A lot of the plot was never explained in the book.  This is a poorly written book and not worth the time or money to buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time and is filled with errors. There are no original ideas in the book, and the author's writing is unprofessional and sloppy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a couple of sittings because it was so boring. I thought the book was a good idea, but it fell flat for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this as part of a book club and thought it was a fun read. It wasn't.  This is an awful book.   It's like reading a movie about a horrible person, except you get to actually watch the person as they try to commit murder, not just hear about it.  There are several problems.  One, the author does a bad job of portraying the victims.  She makes them all look really dumb (and stupid) when she writes about how they couldn't get over their childhood memories of the murders, or about how the perpetrator was an easy target because he was so tall.  Two, she doesn't make it clear whether the victims actually knew about the murders (a possibility) or were just being paranoid (not a possibility).  Three, she makes the murders sound like some kind of a "dream", but the killer is never identified as a "lunatic" (the killer never said he was insane).  She also makes it sound like the victims were in love with the killer and tried to kill him because of it (but it's not clear if they were actually in love or just trying to kill someone).    This book also contains a lot of descriptions of violence and gore.  But, it's also pretty much the only book I have ever read that mentions a "bloody knife" (I guess you can't call it a "stab" if you don't use a knife).  The characters in this book were pretty flat.  The only thing I liked about them is that they were all friends with one another.  It was also nice that all of them were smart and smart women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason why I gave this book 2 stars is that I have to wonder if there was any kind of actual plot to this book.  This is the story of a young man who, after being a hero in his neighborhood and on a school bus, is found by the police with no clothes and a.38 revolver.  He has been shot in the chest and is in a coma.  His parents have been murdered, and he was kidnapped by the mob.  There's some confusion, but I don't know if it was in the story or not.   I've read a lot of stories about gang members and criminals, but this one is the most absurd. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so stupid that you can only laugh at it. The author makes all kinds of outlandish claims, but I will admit that he did a good job of making the story seem interesting.  But the actual evidence is so bad that it is hard to take it seriously.  I am really disappointed that I have to listen to this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most disturbing part of the book is the author's constant references to the Nazi Holocaust.  I've read the works of countless Holocaust deniers, but never found myself agreeing with them.  As far as I'm concerned, they are liars.  If anyone is a liar it's these folks.  And that's saying a lot.  It's one thing to believe that you were born in the wrong era.  But it's quite another to say that you are the chosen one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad novel. It's not a bad story, but it's a bad read. It has the characters and plot structure that a good author would use to create a strong story, yet it's just a poorly-executed plot. It does have a very strong character development, and some really cool concepts, but the story itself is just a mess.  I also found the ending to be a bit contrived. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor book. It has so much wrong with it that I wonder if it was written by a child. It is about a little boy who is so smart that he can make a toy out of his own toy, but doesn't understand why it is a bad toy. He just can't seem to get it right. In fact, he's so dumb he can't even make a doll out of a doll, and he even knows it doesn't have a mouth. I have to wonder if he just can not read or if he is autistic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book from the first time I read it, but I got disappointed. It is a story about a girl who is being bullied because of her sexuality and it is awful. I think it is a good book because it shows that the way one reacts to others isn't always a good thing, but it just is. I have seen it mentioned that it is the worst book written about bisexuality. I disagree. The character's sexuality is not the focus of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so long that I feel it's almost as bad as the book itself.   This is a very long book that does not really give you the sense of what it's like to be a kid in a bad situation, or what the adults who are supposed to be helping you are actually doing.  It does not give you a sense of the horror of the experience, nor does it give you much in the way of a realistic explanation of how it happened.  The only real insight I got from it is that my dad is the one who really deserves the credit for everything that has happened to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not an exciting story. It's boring. The author tries too hard to make the story dramatic. And the character's attitudes and actions don't change, but just become more extreme. If it was not for the ending, this book would be really good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think the first two books were pretty bad, and this one is just plain bad. It doesn't give you any sense that the characters are being played off against each other. It's just all over the place, with the plot and characterization not adding up, and not making sense. I don't know what the author was thinking, as she just didn't seem to understand anything about the writing style. There are parts of the book that just make no sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished the second book in the series, The Devil in the White City  It is the most boring book  The book has a good plot and is set in the middle ages but is full of historical inaccuracies  There are so many errors in this book that it is impossible to understand what is going on  This book is about the history of the White city and its people but it is full with lies and nonsense  The author is trying to make the White man seem like the most evil person in the world but in the end he is a very good person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but it did not satisfy my need to know the backstory of a certain character, or why he is a psychopath. I would have preferred to have seen more of the background for him and the events that led to his current mental state, but I still enjoyed the book and it's potential.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the best thing I've read about the Holocaust. It's very well written, and the information is accurate and factual.   It was a very difficult book to read, but I did it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a bad translation of a really good book.   The characters are so different in the two books that you would be hard pressed to tell which one is the source material.  The plot is a mess and a lot of characters have very little depth.  A lot of the action is skipped entirely.  It's a bit of a slog to read but worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a master at creating a sense of fear in a person.     His book makes it seem like people are more afraid of snakes and other "natural" dangers than of terrorists.  I'm sure they are, but that's not why they're afraid.  Terrorists can be just as dangerous as snakes.  It's just that people don't want to think about how much danger they could be in if they were ever in the same situation as a terrorist.  This is a terrible book, and I'm glad it was never published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. I am a fan of the comic "Crimson" by Kevin Smith, so I knew the main character, Jim, was in it. Unfortunately, Smith was unable to find a writer to adapt it for television. Smith is so bad at his craft that it's like watching a bad director trying to do a bad film. The book doesn't even come close to what the film is like, and if it did, I'd be disgusted too. I know it's Smith's comic book, so perhaps he thought he could pull off the same thing, but it just doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of books are great, but I always get the feeling that I've been cheated out of something special.   This is definitely one of those books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that I can't even understand how they think it's so good. I have to admit I'm very good at understanding this sort of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to read this book, but it was horrible! I have a son who is 8 and this book is very disturbing to him. The author should not have written this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a book with a lot of material about Buddhism.   It didn't have that.  The material was not very interesting.  This book is very similar to the ones you get in the "The Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" series (see my review ) and that was about Buddhism, so it isn't the best thing ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm very happy to finally read a book I've been meaning to read since I first heard of it. The book is called "The Great Leap Forward" and is about the Soviet Union's leap from Communism to capitalism. It is written by a guy who studied in Soviet Russia and lived there for a while, and he was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party. This book is a great read. It's a great story about people who were just doing what the system told them to do and it shows how those people became so much more than what they were. The way they were treated and the way they reacted to being treated is also very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in college and it was a bit hard to get into.  It is very dry and dry writing.  The characters seem like they are doing things they should not.  I was hoping they would grow in their relationship.  They never seem to get along at all.  As for the story, I found the ending a little hard to accept.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife read this book on the first read through because she wanted a good story. I liked the story and liked the characters and the story. But I did not like the ending. The story ended too quickly and I felt that the character's relationship was over before it started.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I saw this book, I was immediately drawn to it. It was about a young girl who discovers a treasure map on her mother's wall. Her father had died years earlier, and now this treasure map leads her to a treasure of her own. I was intrigued, and loved it from the start.   The book is written in a style that is easy to read and the story is told in a very clear way. The characters are very well developed, and I found it hard to get attached to them all the time. The only real flaw in the book is that it doesn't come out in a chronological order.  The book was really good and it was one of the best books I have read in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been meaning to read this book for a while now. I had it at a trade show and read it but was so disappointed I gave it away. Now I have it at my local library and I am so glad I did! It was a nice read. It made me feel like I was back in school. It's a good story and you really get a feel for the struggles that these characters face. It didn't make me feel that I could handle my own children as well as these characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about the author's childhood. I liked the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, a very nice woman, was so much more than a writer, and her work was so good. The stories are so realistic, it's so sad, how a woman with a family can't stand up to the patriarchy.  She's a writer too, so she has the privilege to write about how a man behaves, but she never seems to have any good examples.  A review that is so good, you feel you are reading an original work of fiction:  I just finished reading a book called The Last Good Man in the World.  It's about a woman who becomes a successful author after the death of her husband.  It really was amazing to me that this woman had the courage to write a book about her life, but still be a feminist.  I thought it was so interesting that this writer was able to write such a good book, because she was such a woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so looking forward to this book! It was soooooo close to being my favorite! It wasn't!  It was just ok.  It wasn.  I wasn't impressed by the story at all.  The characters were not very likable at all! I'm just not a fan of female characters who act like little girls!  Also, the author is a jerk to her sister!  This is one of those books that I won't read again! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a load of crap.  It is just an attempt to be like "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  The main character is a spoiled rich kid who doesn't have a good time because he doesn't care.  He is just happy to have some money.  His friends are pretty much worthless.  Even his family are just as unimportant as he is.  But he has some friends who are a bit more interesting.  One of them is named "Lance" (I had to look that up) and he's actually a good guy.  They get together and talk about all kinds of things, such as war, politics, religion and whatnot.  So what the author is saying is that you have to care about these people or you will be a failure.  And of course they have some great adventures along the way.  Also the story is about how a wealthy kid like him gets a good education and then decides to take off.  That is just lame.  Maybe the author should have been like "Hey, you should really care about your friends because you can't have them forever."  It would have made the book better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in an attempt to get an idea of what a man who wrote this book must have been like. I didn't like it at all, it's so boring. I liked the first two books better, and the first part was pretty interesting, but this is just another in a long line of books I will never buy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not want to read this book. I was very tired and just wanted to go to bed. I put the book down at about page 400.   The book is full of errors. I have read other books where the authors made mistakes. This one, however, is very obvious in the errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very interesting, but I have a very difficult time reading it. The author starts off by trying to explain the concept of "paradoxes", which are essentially a kind of scientific and mathematical concept. He describes how, "the paradoxical idea of the 'unpredictable' occurs in the very process of reasoning itself." In the first book, the protagonist is able to predict a certain outcome of a lottery because the probability is so high that it is virtually impossible to predict. In this book, however, he is able predict a particular outcome to a game, and yet, the book is filled with people who can predict a game's outcome. I think the author is trying to say that we shouldn't rely on "luck" to predict our future. But I'm not buying it. There is a very big difference between a mathematical result that can be predicted and a person predicting a lottery result.   (My guess is that he was a mathematician and he just didn't want to admit it.)   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book, but I wish the author had not written the whole book in the third person (or even just the last third of the book)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a family with a young child and it was so long and so confusing that it was difficult to follow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so incredibly bad that it makes me want to throw it out the window. I have always had a soft spot for children's books. I'm usually not the biggest fan of YA, but this book is the exact opposite of what I like. It's full of awful language, terrible grammar, and very poor storytelling. It is a terrible book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most terrible books I've ever read. I mean really terrible. I'm a professional translator who specializes in medieval French and German. I've spent hundreds of hours working on translating medieval books into modern English. This is by far the worst translation I've seen, and it's not even close. The French is absolutely horrendous. It's just so un-translatable, and the only thing that made it remotely coherent is that I've never actually read a translation of the entire book. This doesn't make the English any less bad, but the only things I can identify with the language are the very strange and very long metaphors. I can't really say why this book made it to the book market, but I hope it makes someone laugh and cry at the same time, because this book is just plain bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an interesting and well written book, and I highly recommend it. I just wish it had more of a good ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a collection of short stories. If you're a horror or sci-fi fan, then this collection will not appeal to you. It's a collection that tries to be both. It has a few good stories, but it also has several bad ones. If I had to choose between this collection and the old horror book that came with my Star Trek: The Next Generation books, I'd pick the first one every time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want to read a good, fun sci-fi novel, look no further.   It's about a guy that's in the middle of an existential crisis about the meaning of life, the meaninglessness of death, and what life might be like if we knew all the answers.  The only problem is that he has no idea what to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's really annoying when authors don't bother to write down the important things in their books. I mean, they have to know how to write a good book, right? But I would've appreciated the explanation of why the narrator has been acting so crazy the past few days.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to this book. I thought that it was going to be a good read and a fun read.   This book was a disappointment.  There were no real surprises in it.  I didn't like the way the story was presented.  The characters were too flat.  And, it was a very boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disappointment for two reasons: 1) It is the most boring book I've read in a long time, and 2) I didn't really care about anything in the book. It was just so predictable and unoriginal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was the book that was given to my sister to read when she got married. It was a very poor translation, so she left it unfinished. It is a good story about a little boy who had an evil sister. I would have preferred something a little more funny to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just a poorly written book that doesn't hold up to a serious review. This is the sort of book that should have been edited down to a simple plot and maybe some interesting trivia.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book in a book exchange, and it was a very fun read, but I think it is pretty much a copy of a book I've read several times.  The ending is a little too contrived and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of inaccuracies and it's just a bunch of random facts. I don't think this was a very well written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a wonderful book about a child that's very bright but is also very lonely. I loved that she was always thinking of others and how she could get in touch with them even if she couldn't always be there. I really loved how she thought about herself. The only thing that bugged me was that there was no real end to the book. There were no happy endings. I liked that the book ended with a quote that I'll be quoting on a bumper sticker: "I have two hearts, but I've never had the courage to tell them apart."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard a lot about how important this book is for the future of the church and how it was the first thing people read about Mormonism and made me interested in learning more. But I have yet to learn much about what it's like to be a Mormon from this book. It's not that the people in the church don't have good points; there's plenty of good things about the church. The problem is that the church is so big, so insular, so much of what it teaches has to do with money, sex, and power that I can't see the church changing very much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book.  It was a good read, but the ending was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I am a sucker for a good book.    The story is very well told.  The prose is excellent.  But   There is no real mystery.  If you are in love with a woman who has been cheating on you, then this is the book for you.  I am glad I did not listen to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very long. It is a lot of reading and the information is very interesting. I have a copy of the book and read it twice.  I think the author is really good at writing.  The problem is that I am trying to do this at work.  This is the first time I have read a book about this topic that I think is interesting and informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character, in the first part of the book, is a good guy who wants to be a doctor. He has an interest in the medical profession, but is unable to get into medical school due to his poor academic performance. After graduating from high school he goes to medical school, but only gets a few months in before having to go back to school.   He is not able to do anything in his life while he is in school. The main plot revolves around him trying to figure out why he can't get into a good college. There are a few chapters about him taking a test, but that is about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bit too short. The author is a very good writer, but this book was too short to be satisfying.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a huge disappointment. I loved all the descriptions of animals that I have read, but I just did not care for this book. I did not like the way the author described the animals, and it is obvious that she did not have a clue about what she was talking about. There was one animal, a gopher, that the author did a good job describing. But for the most part the animals were a bunch of stupid, loud-mouthed, smelly-smelling brutes. The gopher was a good example of that. I would have liked to have seen the author describe the gopher in more detail, but she never did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a long list of errors, mischaracterizations, and omissions. It does not even begin to give a good sense of what the book is about. It is full of errors. The main problem with this book is that there is no evidence to support its claims. It was clearly written by a very busy person who is not in a hurry to get it out. The book also claims that the "Bible" was "written by someone else" and "by the same author as the New Testament." There are numerous problems with these claims: 1) the author of the first book of the New Testa ment is not the same person as the author in the second book of that same book; 2) it is not a matter of coincidence that the first and second authors of the "New Testament" are the same people (the writer of the 1st book was also the writer of 2nd book); 3) it does not seem that the author(s) of the 2nd and 3rd books of the Bible are the ones who wrote the first two; 4) there is absolutely no evidence that the authors of "the New Testament" were inspired by God. The Bible is filled with a lot of errors and it does contain some very good things (I am a Christian myself and I believe in the Bible); however, these errors can be easily found in any good Bible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. It is a poor attempt at a fantasy/historical/sword-and-sorcery/fantasy novel, but in every other way it is a terrible book.   The main character (Severus) is an arrogant and snobbish asshole.  He is a complete narcissist who spends his time trying to prove that he is smarter and better than everyone else and doesn't need any assistance.  The only reason he is not at the top is because he is an ass.  I don't care about him as a character, but it is infuriating to have a character who is an asshole and thinks he is better than others.  A lot of the time the book feels like it is meant to show how great a character he is and how he is "the one".  The book also has the character talk about his father's death and how his mother is a better mother than his father.  In one of the later chapters he even compares himself to his father because he had the same goals.  At the end of the book, he realizes he is a good father but an even worse person.  It is also very frustrating that the character never even realizes he can't possibly have been a better father because the book makes it seem like he was just a good man and never a good one.  What really bothers me about this book is the author's insistence that the world he created is "perfect".  He says it so often it almost sounds like a mantra.  For instance, he says that "there are no bad people in this world" and the world is "filled with good people."  In the book there is a lot of evil, but at the same time there is also a lot good.  To be fair, he makes sure to give credit where it is due.  There are plenty of good characters and they are all written very well.  However, the author is so sure that this is the "perfect world" that he completely forgets that the rest of the world exists.  Some of the bad guys are very good people.  Sometimes he is just wrong about what is good and what is bad.  Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about sex, but it is not a bad sex book either. It is an interesting look at a young girl's growing up, and she seems to have gotten off on the wrong foot with her father from the start.  The way that she tells her father's story about her mother's death is not the most credible of things, but that is what makes it so enjoyable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a man who has been diagnosed with cancer. He is having a lot of problems, but he has a lot in common with other cancer patients. They are the type of people who feel like they are alone and don't understand the world.  It is about them, but it is so depressing that you will not want to read the book at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but it just doesn't do much to sell me on it. The story is mostly about a guy in his twenties trying to find a way to pay off a debt and trying to learn how to be happy. That's about it. And he learns some things that might help with that, but nothing that would change his life. That is about all there is to it. I think the book is about the way people deal with their feelings when they are faced with things that are bad for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a copy of this book and I'm sorry I gave it back. I think I should have read it in college. I am going to give it back to my mother. I don't think that it is fair to a great author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of crap and should have been left at the library years ago. The story is about a boy who gets a little too close to a girl he has never met. Then a lot of things start to happen that don't add up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book is "A Tale of Two Brothers." It's a true story, but it is also a cautionary tale. One brother was a highly-skilled mechanic and the other, a high school dropout, was a good soldier. He was in the infantry during the Korean War, where he lost two legs and was awarded two Purple Hearts for being a "decent soldier." His brother went on to a career as a bank robber, and he died from a heart attack. The family is devastated. The brother who was a skilled mechanic went to jail for a crime he committed while he was in prison. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing new to say.   It's a bunch of "I told you so"s and "I said   "s."   The main character is so obsessed with making sure that his wife gets laid, he doesn't even realize how much he is screwing her.  He gets mad at himself for not recognizing the extent of his wife's desires, but then he gets mad when he does realize how badly he's screwing up her life.  If she can't trust you enough to be with you, how can she trust you when you're screwing yourself?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off with a bang. I have always enjoyed reading about a "man who is a hero".  This book is about a man who is an incompetent hero.  I thought this would be a "novel" about a good hero and a bad hero. The hero is not a hero because he is not good.  The hero has a tendency to get into fights with the police and other people in authority.  He is a "tough guy" who can beat a "nice guy".   He has been caught stealing from his employers and is a criminal.    His boss gives him the assignment to get a guy who stole a piece of equipment back.  This is a classic hero tale.  However, the hero has no idea how to get the equipment back and he ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  When the hero gets into trouble, he uses his fists, but he is a poor fighter.  As a result, the bad guys can take advantage of him.  That makes him a hero to me.  There is a reason he gets arrested so many times and it has nothing to do with his "hero" status.  It is because he does stupid things when he gets caught.  A hero must have a little "hero in him".  I am glad I got this book because it helped me understand why so many cops are incompetent.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book interesting but I am not a fan of historical fiction. This book is full of inaccuracies about the American Revolution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the most infuriating books I have ever read.   The author,   was   so   out of her mind that she couldn't get a word in.  I had a hard time reading the whole thing because of her inability to express herself, the characters were   unbelievable, and   it   just   ruined   this   book  .   I won't waste any more time on this book and I'm off to buy another one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why people continue to put these books on my shelf. I am just sick and tired of them.   It's the worst book I have ever read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not the best book about a subject I am interested in, but it is one of the more interesting.   I've never been able to figure out how this book could be a work of fiction if it was so clearly based on reality.  It's very interesting to see how this fictionalized version of events would play out in real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a poor book. It is filled with overused and cliche plots that seem to be recycled over and over. It starts off with a woman going back in time to save her boyfriend from a murder and ends with her being trapped in a time loop by her husband who wants to take her back to the time she was murdered. I hate time loops and love cliches but this book was just boring. I don't know why the author thought that time loops would be a good way to write about a woman who was a victim of murder but I guess that is her style. I was going to give it 4 stars but I just can't because it is just over the top.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a good read for the first few chapters, but after that the plot is a complete mess.  This is a sequel to the TV series and the books are almost a carbon copy of the TV show.  The story is about a young boy who has lost his memory, who learns a lot about his family during a trip to his family's country home.  I don't see the point of this book other than to fill a few books with people with the same name. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book as much as the previous two. It's not a bad read, but I didn.t find it interesting enough to keep reading. I just didn't feel that the main character was very well developed, and there's a bit too much of a sense of mystery at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a very bad book. I know, because I have been waiting for it to come out for a very long time.  It's a book that is filled with false information.    It does not contain a single true statement.  The only real things that are said are that the Earth is flat, and the Moon is the center of the solar system.  In fact, the Moon has nothing to do with the Earth.  The Earth is not the center, but the center is the Sun, and it is in the solar nebula.    And, the only place that you can see the Moon from is in an eclipse.  There is nothing about the Moon in any of the books about astronomy that I have seen.  I wish they had included this in the book, because it would have been helpful to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love to read books that are fun and entertaining. This book, however, just was not very fun or entertaining. It is all about the bad guys, and the bad guy never really got a good story. It was just the story of how they got out of jail and ran off and the police got involved. It never really goes anywhere, and I was bored with it. It took me awhile to get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. I just couldn't get into it. I am not a fan of science fiction and fantasy. But this book was just so bad. I'm not sure what is going on with the characters. It just seems like they are just throwing things at the reader to make up for a lack of real characters. They just kept repeating the same thing over and over again. They were all so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the only good thing that happened to me while I was in the Army.   I have always been a pretty bad reader.  I can't make a word stick out in a book.  When I was young I thought I'd never be able to read or write.  Now I can read and write. I can tell a good story and I can even spell.  This is a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought I would be a good enough reader to read this book, but I'm only average. The author is clearly an amateur, and she has written a book that is boring. She tries to make the story seem interesting, but she just doesn't have it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been looking for a book to read on the topic of the war in Vietnam and I finally found one in which the author makes some interesting points.  It's just too bad that it was written by a professor at a small liberal arts college who is not very good at writing.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I needed a refresher course in physics and I had heard that this is a book on the subject. I was a little disappointed.   What I got instead was a lot of information about "theory of everything."   Unfortunately, it is all theory that was not supported by any evidence.  I got a lot more from the wikipedia article that the book gave me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most disturbing part of this book is the fact that the authors seem to have no idea about what their own opinions and values are.  They have no qualms about talking about things like gay marriage, but they have no issue talking about abortion or having a gay parent, and their "hobby" (reading books) is not a hobby but a profession.  This is a group that has a problem with science and facts, and then they claim to be the most moral people on the planet.  The authors do not seem to realize they are not the most rational, nor that their beliefs are based on bad science.  These people should be ashamed of themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am glad to say that this is the worst book I have ever read. I have read several other books by him that were far better, but this is a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to get a book from the library about the ancient Greeks (I can't say the same about the Romans) so this book was perfect! I had not known this story about Socrates and his friend and he was a wonderful character! He was the most intelligent man I've ever read about! I also enjoyed the way he dealt with his enemies. He used their own words against them and got away with it. I also liked that he didn't have a sense of humor about himself. I don't really like humor. But he had that. I had a good time reading this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a rehashing of the same tired cliches.   While it is true that there is no evidence that the Soviet Union did not produce some of the most innovative technology in the 20th century, there are a few more interesting things about the Cold War that aren't covered.  In this book, it is the Soviet and American nuclear tests that are being looked at.  It is interesting to see the similarities between the two countries that they both used nuclear tests to prove their superiority.  But the US testing and the Soviet testing, while impressive, are only one part of the story.  We need to look at other things, like the Cold war rivalry between the United States and the USSR.  While there are some interesting things in the book about the rivalry, it mostly focuses on the Coldwar and its various conflicts, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold-War era, and it does so by cherry-picking some of those events.  If you are looking for something interesting, try to look elsewhere, or maybe just read a history book instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bit of a disappointment. The author does not provide much in the way of real information or history about the events in question. I'm not going to try to go into the details of the situation in which the events take place, but it's just that the author uses the book as a pretext for making the characters into something they are not: the victim, the victimizers, and the victim's defenders. If this book is a justification of rape culture, then I'm very disappointed in the author's actions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure the reason this book is so popular is because it has a happy ending. This is a great story about a child who has been adopted by a very rich family. However, when the child turns 18 he gets an amazing gift from them: a job in a very prestigious position at a major publishing house. The only problem is that he's not even allowed to be with his adopted parents during the day. He can't go to their home or the house of his birth parents. I know it's a great book about a happy family but there's no happiness in the end. This book would be so much better if it just ended.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book does not live up to its claims, as there are a number of things that the authors don't say. The most obvious thing is that the book is written in a very non-science-y way, which does not inspire confidence in the claims.  In fact, there are several instances in the book where the authors make things up (or claim that they are facts), and when they try to back up their claims with evidence, the evidence simply doesn't back up the claims, and even when they do have some evidence, it is very weak.  Another problem is that they claim that this process has been used many times in other parts of the world (which has been claimed before by others), but I was unable to find any credible source to support these claims. In fact there are numerous examples of the same process being used in many other parts (e.g. India, Egypt, China, Greece, Germany, etc).  Lastly, I am not sure if the authors are being intentionally misleading or just completely ignorant about the process.  Overall, the book was quite disappointing and did not live to its hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a group of four friends who travel through the United States in the 1950's and meet at a lakefront house to drink beer and tell stories. The stories are pretty good and the beer is good but the stories are a little lame. This book would be better if it was about a different group of friends, but as a group they were a little boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad story. The plot is so weak, I could have written it myself.   I'm sure a few of you will love this story.  I read it for the fun of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book about a family that got separated by the death of a relative and how they are forced to live as a group. They try to maintain the illusion that they are separate. This book is not for me at all. The family is too weird and weirdly mixed up. I'm not sure they are even related. They are all very odd in some way. I don't know how I found this book. I got it because of the review about how I'm a lesbian and I think that the family is weird.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The whole book is a big pile of garbage, and has been for a long time. There is not a single new thing that can be said about the book, and it really reads more like a compilation of old things from different people than a fresh analysis. The only thing that is new is the author's view that a woman who does not like to read should read a romance book, but that is about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has many flaws but one that is the most important to me is the fact that the book is about the people who were murdered by the CIA.  As I have stated before in other reviews, this is a very interesting book about the history of the CIA and how it came to be, but I would not recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just plain bad.  It's boring.   It takes about 6 hours to read.  And it has the same old lame stories about people being nice to their pets, and how great it is to be a pet.  That's it.  Nothing in there really interests me.  But the dog is cute and I like dogs.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about a dog, but who doesn't want to read the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but it's soooooooo predictable. There are just so many characters to write about, they are all the same and the plot has been done before and done better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very boring book. I read this book over a year ago, when I was 18. I loved it at the time. But, the more I read it, the less I liked it. It is very, very predictable. The ending of the book is the main reason I think I didn't like it. The author never goes there, never really tells the reader what is going to happen, and the book just ends. If the author had given more detail, I would have been much more entertained. The fact that the author doesn't reveal the outcome, and is not suspenseful at all is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't recommend this book to anyone, not even to students, who may want to learn about "psychology" from a professional who is in the business.  As a psychology major, I am appalled by the lack of professional standards.  This book is not written in a way that the student can relate to, nor is it written with a professional approach.  I found the "psychological" part to be very repetitive, and it's a waste of time to have to read it to find out what they are going to say.  The author has a long list of books he's read, but I found myself wondering why I never learned about them.  It's as if he reads a book and then goes to the bookstore and buys a bunch of books to read.  He's just not very good at it.  And if he was, he wouldn't have spent so much time on the same book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't usually read reviews but I am so disappointed in this book. This book is full of the "I'm sorry" and "I don't know what to do" type statements. It seems like she was in a bad relationship and was trying to find a way out of it but her ex got wind of it and kept going after her and kept coming up with reasons why she can't leave him. She's also got some major problems with her mother. It just doesn't seem to make any sense that a child would be able to manipulate her mother into doing things. The author claims to be a victim of childhood sexual abuse and then makes it about her as if it's a great tragedy that she has been abused. I mean, I've been through that. I can relate to the fact that she is in a good relationship but I also feel that she should have been able to keep her mouth shut and just go with it. I feel that it would have helped her a lot to have been more honest with her friends and not make her mother and father look like a bunch of idiots. She doesn't deserve to be in the same room with her ex-boyfriend!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor read, full of errors and poor writing, and it is hard to believe it is published in 2002.   It is a story about a young boy who has a fascination with a man who likes to wear girls' clothes, and how he gets the opportunity to do this.  It takes the reader out of the story when it becomes clear that he is just a kid, and not really in love with the guy.  The story is also very juvenile and the sex scenes are not really there.  A very sad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was a real piece of crap. I was not very impressed with it and thought it was a poor attempt at science fiction. The story is about a spaceship trying to escape from a black hole. They get to the black hole but then are forced back into it. That's about it. The spaceship eventually ends up on the moon. The moon looks like a nice, beautiful place but the aliens want to steal the Earth and it looks like this book will be a very long book to find out why. The only reason I can give this book a negative is because it is a bad science fiction book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is that it doesn't work for me.  I can read books in a day.  The story is boring.  It seems that if the author wants a good plot she should have written a non-fiction book.    I was hoping for a book that would teach me something about my parents and why I'm the way I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. It had all the ingredients that made me love to read: great writing, interesting characters, and a lot of twists and turns. The book is so interesting that it is hard to keep track of all the events. But it ends in a way that is so confusing, I had no idea what was going to happen next. If you read this book you will hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a fun little adventure book about a group of dwarves who live underground. They are good at mining and mining isn't a very common skill for dwarves but they do it with the best of them. The dwarves get into a huge mess with a troll that's been raiding their mines. The trolls aren't the smartest trolls but they are the biggest and they've got some good axes. The end of the book ends with a battle with a huge dragon who is just too big to kill but he does have a huge sword that can take out the dwarves easily. I was a bit disappointed by the ending but that was just the author's opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because of the reviews on Goodreads. It is not a good book. I didn't really like the story, it was just a rehash of something that happened a while ago.   It was hard to understand what the hell was going on, the ending was terrible.  I hope the next book has better writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book about a really bad author.  It's not a bad read.  I enjoyed the book but this author is not good at writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure if it's the same book I read last year, but I think it's worth the money. I don't think I'll read anything else from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst I've ever read.  The writing is awful and every chapter is a complete waste of time.  It's not a bad story, but it is just not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for something that would be more of a fantasy than a romance but this one fell short. It was a nice fantasy but it didn't have enough character development or depth to be satisfying. I found it really annoying to read the character's thoughts of what they were doing and why they were there in the first place but there was little to no payoff in the end. The romance is over in the third act which is just a sad ending. It makes me wonder if there was a better option that didn't require the characters to make the most out of a bad situation or if the writer just couldn't finish it because the characters were getting to be a little annoying by the end of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for a college course I was taking and it was a waste of time.   It is really just a collection of stories about people who are just a bit crazy, but no one ever seems to know how to tell them apart from real problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some good ideas, but it is way too long.   The story is well-written, but not well-thought out.  If you want to get away from the "popular" books in your local library and get into the "intellectual" books, try reading a book on quantum physics instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is a mess. The author makes you wonder if he even read the book before writing it. The end is rushed and you think, "If only the book was better, I would have been able to keep up." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has one of the worst titles I've ever seen:  This is one of those books that is so long that you get a little sick of it and then it starts all over again. It is a really bad and convoluted story about a character who was just a pawn in a much larger game. This book was about a guy who was part of a group that had a bad run in with a group of people who would do anything to make sure they got ahead in life. This is why they were called the "Power Elite." This book is all about the group trying to find a way to be better than their competition. It's like the story is about people trying to get out of their bad marriages and failing. This whole book is just like a poorly written book. I don't know what happened to this guy. He got so caught up in the power game that he got out and he had a great life but then the group came back and ruined it. This guy really does get caught up with the game. He tries to find out what is going on in the world. He thinks about why the group is doing this but he can't figure it out. He really wants to get away from the group but they are really tough to get rid of. This was a really boring and repetitive book that I would never read again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. It was a very nice change from the usual "this book is about a girl who gets a tattoo"   but I just can't get into it. It is just not the same book as I read a few years ago when it was written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was terrible, I found it incredibly tedious, I didn't want to read it at all, and I gave up after about half way through.   I would recommend this book to no one
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book. It was a very poorly written book, full of spelling and grammatical errors, and not at all relevant to my interests. There is a huge section on religion in the first half, but the author doesn't have a clue what a religion is. It is a religion that believes in an afterlife (he even says "I was going to do a piece on religion as a religion" and "a religion is an organized community of believers. This book does not really touch upon that aspect"). There is also a big section on the Bible, but there are very few references to the Bible in the other sections of the book, or in the actual bible. The author is obviously a Bible-thumper. It would have been better to have a discussion about religion, instead of a big book that just tries to explain religion in a non-explanatory way. I also found the story boring. The book talks about a bunch of random people in the past, but you really don't care about the people in it (the people in this book don't seem to even be human). I have nothing against people who read the bible (I know they're not perfect), but I don't think they are worth spending your time on (or that you should read it).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring and pointless and you should be ashamed to have purchased it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book to read while I was waiting for my car to be repaired. It was a nice idea to make a book about a car. I did, however, find it a bit boring. The author is talking about a specific kind of car that has been made by a certain company (or companies) over a specific period of time.  I think it would be good to know a bit more about what the car was like before and after it was made.  Overall, the book is interesting, but doesn't offer much in the way of information about the car, or the history behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had read a review that said it was a good book, but that it didn't hold up to a lot of modern science.   The author made the case that we really don't know everything that we think we know, so maybe the Bible is more accurate than we thought.  I think this is a very interesting book, and I'm happy that someone has done some good research on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title was pretty clear but this book is really just an overpriced collection of short stories written by the same person over the course of a few decades. They don't make any sense and the writing is cliched at best. It's like I had bought this book for my college library but I just couldn't afford it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so full of crap that it almost made me question whether I wanted to go into the business. It is not the most engaging or engaging read I have ever had. I was hoping to be entertained but ended up annoyed and bored by the author's lack of knowledge about the industry and her lack of ability to make any sort of point with the book. I could see this book being the same way with most books. I hope that she makes some real changes and changes the direction of the business in the future. I also hope that it is never released again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is awful, but it is not that bad. It's like the authors never read the book they are writing about. They know what the book is about, but never get it.  It's just an excuse to say they know more about a topic than anyone else.  The book is really just a bad history book about a poor country.    I didn't even care about the history or about the poor people in the book.  I just knew it would make me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not an interesting book about any of the issues raised in the book. It is a collection of personal anecdotes about various issues, all of which are false or exaggerated. The only one of which I am actually sure is that the Jews were responsible for the Holocaust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of what not to do when creating a new work of fiction. The first paragraph is about an old man (an "old" man) and his life: "He was a man who lived by his wits, a man of no fixed principles, a simple, hardworking fellow, a farmer of the prairie, a good country man." In the second paragraph, the same man is told that he "had no right to go to his death with a white-frocked face," which "was a very fine face indeed" - and he tells his grandson that "he thought it a pity that such a good-looking boy should die with a head that might as well have been his own." The third paragraph is the man's grandson, describing his grandfather: "The old man had a little brown man's head, but the face was so bright and full of life that the eyes seemed to glow in the gloom and the smile was so friendly that he seemed to take pleasure in everyone who came near him." The fourth paragraph is a short description of the old man: "His hair was white, the skin white, his beard was white. He wore a dark-green suit of good clothes and a wide-brimmed hat. "His smile was broad and friendly, like a good hunter's smile, and he spoke with the kindest simplicity of a man whose mind was so full of thought and so full, indeed, of good-natured, honest good-will that he was often mistaken for a good and truthful man." The fifth paragraph is of the grandfather: ""There were no books in his room, not even the books his father had given him. He was a simple man with a good life, a kind and thoughtful soul, a hard working man who was proud of his wife and his two sons. He loved to hunt and ride his horse." "In that little room there was no room for a woman and no room in the world for a book. "The book he used to read, his old hunting book, was gone, but he never let his mind wander from his task. He knew that the old book was gone and that his work was not finished. "Every day he went on his task, he looked out over the land that he had tilled and sown, he remembered his old memories and he remembered the old people he had met, the old stories that he told, the stories that were told about
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never liked a book by the author of the same name.  This is a very strange book that I can't get into.  It's an excellent work of fantasy that is very weird, but very hard to put down.  The writing is very clear and concise.  But the story itself is so bizarre that I find it hard to understand why it's called "The Way of the Sword" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really unhappy with this book.   This book is about an alien that came to earth and took a bunch of human children to help with his experiments.  It is a lot of fun.  But it is really   boring and uninteresting.  He doesn't do anything interesting that would give you a reason to care about him, and I don't think it makes sense that he would do anything that would make you feel like he was human.  I don t know why he would be human at all,   but he sure is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is well told, but the ending is weak. The characters are interesting, but I found their interactions a bit shallow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of self-help books.   My first book, " The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People ",   was a disappointment.  It seemed to be about how to get rich and be successful in business.  The only advice it provided was to get in shape.  I followed the advice, but it didn't make me any more successful.  Instead, I felt a lot more miserable.  Not that it's always the case that successful people have money to spend on fitness, but that's just a sad state of affairs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. I read it because it's about a game. I've played the game before but never played as a girl. So this is like having the time of your life but then having to play as a boy. The only part of the game I really liked was when they were doing the dance. But that's not enough for me. And there's no way in hell I'll play a female game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is about the death of a woman. It is told from the perspective of a psychiatrist and a psychiatrist's assistant, as they see her dying. It's not a good book, but it does make for interesting viewing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is well written. It is good. It's not bad. It was a very good read, but I found it difficult to believe the author was trying to make a point about the nature of God and faith. I'm not sure how this author thinks that. I don't think it's an especially good book, but it was entertaining and I was glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster. The only thing I learned from it was that the author never uses a single sentence that doesn't have a direct connection to her own life. She is always looking for something that she can use as a point of comparison. If I had to describe a thing, I would say she is a narcissistic maniac.   If you want to read a book about a woman who is constantly talking about herself and has nothing worthwhile to say, check out "Marilyn Monroe's Guide to Beauty."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As far as I am concerned, I have read a lot of terrible books and this is the worst one I have ever read. I was very disappointed that it was so poorly written. It is really difficult to follow. It's almost like the author was writing in a third person. She didn't know when to cut and when to go back. It makes me wonder if she even read the book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bit dry and tedious. The characters have no chemistry or personality and I found them boring and repetitive.   I think this book is really aimed at adults and I would not recommend it to kids 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a hard time getting into this book.   It's about a high school kid who decides to become a professional baseball player.  The baseball stuff is pretty cool but the story is not as interesting.  It was interesting to read about how the high school players were dealing with their issues but it was just a story that didn't seem very relevant to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters were interesting enough to keep me reading but the writing was so bad that I ended up just throwing it away and finishing the book on the shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never read this book before, but I have read the previous books in the series, and I think this one is really bad.   The story is about a man who is a little bit obsessed with the idea of being a woman.  He finds out that being a lady is actually really difficult and that it takes a lot of effort and effort to be a lady, but he is convinced that being like a lady will make him happy.  Then he meets the real thing.  I do not get the point of this book at all.  This was so long ago and it was written by a woman and it's about a guy who is into the whole thing.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a freshman in college. I was a bit confused as to why I was reading it.  It seemed a little like a student paper about the "discovery" of an ancient text.  The book was about a group of ancient texts, the earliest ones being about the Hebrews, that are lost today, and that were supposedly written in the 12th century B.C.  This is a very confusing book.  I can't say that I understood it all, but I did read through it at least a few times.  Also, I found that there were too many repetitions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very dull book that is not funny at all.   The main character is very shallow, is never in a good mood, and has no life outside of her mother's house.  This book is really about a mother and a son, but the book doesn't do anything with the father. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a terrible book. I bought this book expecting to be surprised by some interesting ideas. Instead, I found myself bored and frustrated. I tried to be interested but I was never able to find the time to put it down. It is a sad tale that has no story worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about the early history of the Soviet Union, which is interesting, but there is not much that is new or original.   (I think it is good that the authors tried to present a balanced picture, but I also think that the book did not provide a full account of the early Soviet history, which was the main focus of the book.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very disjointed. It has a very heavy, stilted, and unnatural feel to it. I don't think it's a bad novel, it's just a very strange one. I really liked the other books that the author has written, so I'm not sure what her point is with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the perfect example of why it is important for every author to write a book that is both good and interesting. I'm glad I read it. It's a very interesting topic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit too long to be very interesting, but it's the story about the "lost" film that's really worth your time: it's an interesting insight into the film industry, and the effects it has on our society, from the point of view of a famous director whose personal life was so completely messed up that he became an extreme loner who only made terrible movies. If you liked the book, you will enjoy this one even more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I needed something light and easy to read and to fill the gap between college and graduate school. I was looking forward to this book as it looked good in my Kindle but I was disappointed in its content.  I found it difficult to follow the book, and I did not enjoy the subject matter.  The stories about this guy (who was very well-off) living in the woods, living on his own, etc. seemed to be very common in these types of books.   The book is also very self-centered.  A lot of the stories are about how the poor guy who lived on his land/ranch, but didn't care about anyone else and had to live in the wilderness because of that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why I decided to start this book after my previous book in the series,  but I did and I was disappointed.    I was also disappointed by the fact that this was published by another publisher.  It's also written by a different author.  This book is an absolute train wreck.  My problem is that   It has nothing to do with the characters and   it is about a character that is not interesting and isn't interesting because it's a generic character who isn't likable and doesn't get anything.  I feel like this book would have been better if it was written by an actual author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad it is amazing!   It starts off pretty good, but then the author loses the plot at the last minute.   I can't believe how badly she does it!  I know I can do it better!  She is just not good at writing.   So bad I just laughed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a lot of things I don't like in it, but it's not a bad read.  The characters are not so much relatable as they are stereotypes.  They aren't exactly interesting (the main one is an idiot, the others are either boring or obnoxious) but they aren't annoying either.  There's a lot to like about the book (the ending was fantastic), but if you're reading this book to get a laugh, you'll be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half is great, the second half... not so much.   It is like someone who reads all the reviews on Amazon got the book and then decided to read it.  The pacing was poor, I did not feel as connected to the characters as I was in the first book.  There were a few moments when the author seemed to have forgotten what she was writing about, like the boy that lived in the forest.  Overall, this was a disappointing book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't usually read "science fiction" books, but this one was so boring that I had to put it down.  This book is about a guy who's a robot.  The robots in the story can think for themselves.  They can use language.  It's a really boring story, and I don' t like reading about people with robots.  I'm sure I'm going to buy another book about robots.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with nothing but lies and deceit. The author tells us that there are about 500,000 documented cases of child abuse in the United States, but that is a lie. There are about 7 cases of documented abuse in a 1/3rd of a million people. She tells us there are "over 1000 different forms of child molestation", but she is lying again. The real numbers are about 1/100,000. This book has been thoroughly discredited and should be taken out of circulation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book from a friend who read it. I thought it was great but was disappointed in the ending. I guess I have to reread it for the conclusion. I have never liked the ending of the books in which the hero is a girl.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. I can't even begin to imagine how the authors would have found the time to write this book, especially since it was supposed to be a history book about a war that took place a long time ago. It's a story about the Vietnam War, but that's about it. It is a complete disaster and should not have been written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is a little thin. It is very long but the plot does not seem to be the point of the book. I was very disappointed in the book and I don't understand how the author could have done a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a first book, I wasn't impressed. But the second was much better. It had a different tone to it and was more fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't put down this book. It's just that the writing was just so awful that it was hard to care about the characters. The main character is not a person at all. He is a man-eating monster that lives in the sewers.  I am not sure why I would bother with a book like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried a number of different brands of pens before settling on this one. It does a decent job, but I had a problem with the ink leaking. It's been three months since I received it, and it still leaks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is well written and well paced.   I do not find it easy to read a book by an American writer.  As the author says, the US has a history of violence that the rest of the world seems to ignore.  I will give it three stars because the author did an excellent job of bringing the historical events to life in an entertaining way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only bad thing about this book is that it is so over-long and over-familiar.  The narrative is so cliched that I can't help but feel cheated when I have the time to get through it, but I'm not sure how much I could have cared less about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as part of the Banned Books Week promotion. It was good until about halfway through when it started making a lot more sense. I thought the ending was very stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been a huge fan of this series since the first one and this one is no different. It's a great adventure and fun, but the writing style is so inconsistent and the character development so lackluster that the story just doesn't make any sense. Also, one of the main characters was very stupid. That's the end of the book, but I can't believe that was the last one that was written by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete waste of my time. The story is not even about the person that was murdered in the book. It's about how the suspect got away and what the police and media did to get the man.  I think that is what the book is about, not the actual murderer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have only read one book so far from this author. It was about a girl that came from a family of doctors. Her parents died in an accident. She was given a new life with a bunch of kids. She fell in love with a man who took her away from her family and never even asked about them. She became a housewife. The woman I was married to for 20 years finally said, "Why do I always have to do these things? I want my own kids." I said, well, maybe your mother can give you an explanation. She said she doesn't know anything about it. I asked her if her parents did something that would make it so they would have to come back from a long trip, and she said, no. She then explained that she knew a guy who was traveling a lot and he used to bring his mom along, and so she thought she might like it. Her mother then explained to me that they would always take her along because they needed her in case something happened. I was like, "Wow. So if you have a boyfriend, you have to have his mom with you, just in case he needs to be away?" Then she told me the reason she didn't go to college was because she was a house mother. The kids always knew when their mother was coming home. When they got their first cars, they were in them for a while before mom finally let them drive. It seemed like a great idea at the time. I think it is still a great way to raise kids. It is nice that her mother knew about the trip her husband had planned but didn't want to bother her. I would love to go back to that time when her husband told her she had to take a trip with him, but I don't know if I can live without the money he gave me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I was a bit puzzled as to why they chose to include such a long and complex book in a small box. I would have rather had it in the form of a video, or a DVD. The book is very good for what it is: a description of the history of the Second World War. It's a good read, but I was not interested.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never been one for sci fi, but this book was so poorly written, and so poorly thought out.   The first sentence is a complete disaster.  There is a war going on that is going to destroy the entire planet (at least that is what is stated)  There are people who were "born to serve"  The world they are living in is the only world they have ever known.  It has been destroyed by a war (although the war is never mentioned)   At the end of the book we are left with the following:  1) The only thing left of the planet is a massive pile of rubble.  2) The war is still going on, even though the planet has been wiped off the face of the earth.  3) The planet is going through a huge growth spurt that will make it more attractive to the "other" races (i.e. aliens).  4) The new race is coming to Earth in a huge starship.  5) There will be a lot of destruction and war, but there will also be a big "golden age" that will last for centuries.  6) In the end, the race that is coming is very powerful.  7) I have no idea what will happen in the future.  8) I can't believe the author wrote this crap.  9) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a group of girls who go to a school to be witches. The story is interesting. It deals with themes that many people can relate to. It has a unique style that could make it an interesting read for anyone.  It also is very interesting to read about a school that is a part of the occult world and how they use magic to get along.  But it could be better. The writing is very poor.  The plot was interesting and the ending was not.  I found the story to be very confusing.  This book is only good if you are interested in the occult and witches.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had been looking forward to reading this book, but had to put it down for a couple of days before I finally got around to it. This book is about a young boy who gets involved in a strange game and ends up with an alien in a jar who has the power to create a replica of the boy's favorite toy. The book was a little confusing at times, especially as to why the boy was so desperate to make sure the toy would be there when he came back home. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean about having it there. The alien doesn't seem to like the toy, but then, I don't think he's very fond of anything at all. The boy does make a nice gesture in giving the alien his favorite toy when he gets home, but he just seems to do it because he doesn't want the alien there. Maybe he's just embarrassed that he can't play with the alien. The whole thing is a bit of a bore, but I'll give it a couple more tries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very weak book that was published as an electronic book and is difficult to understand and read. The writing style is bad and the stories are not interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a complete waste of time.   I would have much preferred to read about the real life adventures of these three.  I guess they are just in a fantasy world and have no real world problems.  The only real world problem that these three seem to have is in trying to get their family's name on a tombstone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   The author is not a journalist but an advocate.  The book is about how the Bush administration used its control of the press to try to destroy the career of a reporter who had exposed government corruption.  It's a great story and the facts are pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst I've ever read.   I've read a few books by these authors and their books usually are well written, but I'm so tired of their books that I'll probably just go back to the originals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time, and it's sad to know that a lot of people are going to have a hard time believing the rest of it. I don't really get the point of the story, and the author tries to tell it in a few paragraphs that could easily be left out.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of short stories that are all rather similar in content. The stories are all about a young man who is tormented by a bad case of the mumps. He meets a psychic and gets a prophecy about a war with the Russians. There is some good psychic reading in the book. I also found the book to be rather confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked the book.    The writing is very interesting and very entertaining.  I was especially impressed with the author's use of language.  However, the author doesn't always seem to have a good handle on what he is talking about, so it's easy to lose track of what he's talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book because it was the last in the series.   But it was a disappointment.  The characters all have the same characteristics:  1) They are always so nice and gentle to each other; 2) They love the good times; 3) They don't say anything that bothers you; 4) They talk about things that don't matter.  I thought that was really boring.  This book is about a guy who falls in love with a girl who is so shy that she never talks to anyone.  She is so introverted that she is scared of people and is always in a state of panic when she has a problem.  It's like she is always thinking about her problems instead of focusing on the good things in life.  So she is like this because she is so timid.  I am so used to seeing the positive sides of people, especially people in love.  But this book is just so one dimensional.  As a woman, I was so confused about the whole "dysfunctional" relationship.  Why did this girl get a good, strong man when he has no social skills?  Why can't he be more confident?   Why is he so much more attracted to women than to men?  He is a nice guy and he likes her.  In a relationship that is so one-sided, why does he want to spend all his time with this girl?  5 stars: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not find this book very interesting at all. I was just looking for a good old fashioned book about how to be a better programmer. Instead I got a book that is just boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an absolutely useless book that only makes me feel worse for not reading it earlier.  I'm sorry I wasted my time reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad I felt sick when I finished it. It is so much rubbish that it's hard to believe this book had a publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit that I'm not a fan of "Dunkirk."  I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's movies and I'm really glad that he made a "D" movie.  But I really wish that he'd made a great "D,"   because I would have been very satisfied.   For the most part,   Dunkirk is a "what the hell is this movie about" movie,  which is a shame because it is a really good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an interesting book but in the end it doesn't provide any answers.   I have to assume that the author had access to the data in the study and therefore had to make some guesses about what the authors had found.  The authors concluded that the difference in body fat is the result of a diet that is high in carbohydrates (which are the main source of energy in a low calorie diet) and low in fat.  That is a reasonable hypothesis but it is based on a small study.  It also relies on the assumption that people do not gain fat on a low fat diet.  I know that this assumption is generally true but it just doesn't hold up.  To get to the truth, the authors did not just rely on the participants of a single study.     They looked at a lot of other studies and they came to the same conclusion.  They did find a positive relationship between fat mass and fat free mass but only for men (who usually gain more fat than they lose on a diet).   If you look at the data they used, they used fat mass instead of body fat because the only difference between men and women is that women generally have more lean body mass (bone, muscle, fat).  So the authors conclude that it is the difference between the two that causes the difference.  If that were true, then men would lose more fat on the low fat than women.  But they found no difference in fat mass.  This is one of those studies that are based on the authors reading a few articles on PubMed.  So I am left to wonder how the authors reached the conclusion that is in their paper.  There is also no discussion about whether or not the study is a fair test of the hypothesis.  My guess is that the authors made some guesses based on their understanding of the study, and that those guesses were wrong.  What makes the study unfair is that it was not random.  In fact, I am not sure what sort of people were included in the participants.  Most of the participants were either young adults who were very sedentary or very obese.  For those who were not obese, they may have been older (the participants were all in their 20's) or they may not have been physically active.  We don't really know how they lost the weight but it would be interesting to know.   The study was funded by a company called Givaudan who has a
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I'm a huge fan of The Wheel of Time, and am very disappointed that I didn't get to read it sooner. I've been waiting since 1999 to see what Robert Jordan would do with the world. Instead, the whole thing turns into a very confusing, very frustrating mess. It's also a very long book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure I'm going to get lots of hate mail from people that I know are good people but this book is so bad. The writing is horrible, the characters are annoying, the story is boring and I hate how it's been written as an autobiography. It's also a poor read as there are a lot of spelling errors and typos.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping to like this book, but I couldn't. It was just a bad read. The main character was a really weird one. The plot was kind of pointless. I just couldn't really see the point in it. It wasn't the most original concept in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of lies and it is not a good book at all  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a very hard book to read. It took me a while to put down because it was so difficult to understand the main theme of the book.  It would be interesting to know what the author did in order to make his story "feel" like a real-life event and not a story he had invented in his own head.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand why so many people enjoy this book. I found the writing to be poor, and I found some of the characters to be very annoying. I don´t understand why the author wants to write about a very different type of culture (a society based on slavery) that he has never experienced. I feel like the author should have tried to write a historical book about the Japanese-Chinese War, or about the British Empire, or the American Civil War. These are real historical events that happened. If the author wanted to write something about something else, he could have done so.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a fan of sci fi and fantasy but I was disappointed in this book.   The characters are poorly written, the setting is confusing, and the book is just too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in 2008 and loved it. However, after reading it again in 2012, I found it to be very boring and dry. The only interesting aspect of the story is that the main character, Jee, is a very good driver.   The story itself is not as good as I remember it being. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. I am not a fan of urban fantasy, but this book had so much good in it. It is not perfect, but it is well written. It has an interesting character, it has a good plot, and it has great characters. The plot was interesting. The character was interesting (the other girls are all really cute). And the world is interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the best "pro-gun" books out there. It explains to an uneducated person what gun is and how it works. This is so easy and clear that I was able to use it in the classroom and it really helps people understand what guns are.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written by an uneducated, ignorant man with a huge ego. I don't know if he actually learned a thing or two from this book, but I found it to be very insulting to the reader. The first book I ever read was written about an African-American man, so I don the black mind.   I was shocked to find out that I had to go to a black school to learn.  I learned how to write a good essay, but that was about it.  He made it sound like I have to learn how to read and write to learn a skill.  The only thing he taught me was to be a good listener.  Why not just go to the library and read the books there.  5 of 5 stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard of this book before, but hadn't read it. It has a certain air of having been written in a hurry, but that doesn't make it a bad read. The first half is all about the history of the U.S. in the 20th century, which is fascinating. I can't say I am particularly fond of the New Deal. I'm a Democrat, and I thought that FDR was a bit too much of a New Dealer. That said, the story of what happened after the New Dealer left office is interesting. This book is definitely worth a read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "What's so bad about" section is a terrible waste of space. It's mostly just boring, and not worth your time.  The main reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it's not as good as the other books I read this year (including The Night Circus ).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and it was like a terrible nightmare come true.   The main character, Tanya, is a beautiful young woman who is a good-hearted and beautiful soul.  She lives in a very expensive mansion in the hills of upstate NY with her beautiful mother, a very nice and quiet woman.  Tanya is a very kind and compassionate person.  In fact, the first person to give Tanya the book that she really wants was her mother.  This is not unusual.  They are the type of people who give each other everything they want.  I thought Tanya would really like her mother, but she didn't.  So then she was mad at her mother and she was angry with her mother because of this book.  My mother is very nice, but the fact that I couldn't find the book is very sad to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor retelling of a historical event that was overblown in the late 20th century and overblown still in the 21st. The author, who has a history degree, should not be writing about these subjects, but a historian in my opinion. It is the same kind of stuff that was said about the American Civil War and World War I. This is the kind of historical distortion that historians like to say they have learned from, but they don't actually know how to do history well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of false statements, and the author, like most others who want to be popular authors, is just trying to sell a book to the public, and make a buck. The title and the cover is also misleading. It says it's about the author. It's not. It is about the man who was her father, who died after having an affair with a very attractive woman who turned out to be a lesbian. I am disappointed that the author is so shallow that he can't see the obvious that there was no real connection between them. He just likes to tell stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the story of a girl with a mysterious past and a great way of explaining things to the reader. The only problem was that the author couldn't get the plot straight. In a good way though, as I found it hard to follow at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of all the things that the anti-science crowd wants to believe are false and fraudulent. The evidence for a young earth is weak. The science behind the Big Bang theory is just not there. The moon landing was faked by the Russians. There are many problems with the earth's climate which were not properly addressed in the book. The book is filled with references to various other books that are not peer reviewed. It is full a bologna and straw man arguments. I can understand why people have doubts about the Bible or about the Big bang theory but it is not good science and I am glad I got a copy of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good read. It's a good story with a good ending. I'll probably get through it and then move on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so full of inaccuracies that it makes it almost impossible to believe anything the author says. First of all, there is no such thing as the word "Mormon" or the "Book of Mormon" being translated by the "Spirit of the Lord". The "spirit" is a concept which doesn't exist. That is the second thing wrong about this book: it doesn't mention that Joseph Smith claimed to translate the plates with a seer stone. Instead it says that "Joseph Smith used a rock to assist him" (pg. 11). I'm sure the "rock" he used was a stone, but the term "seer stone" is used only to refer to a stone used by Joseph Smith in a hat. It's a common practice to refer the "seers" in early American religious history to stones used by ancient people. I guess the author is trying to make it sound like Joseph Smith used the "stone in a glass" as a seeric stone, and that he was the first to use it. But he doesn't. I'm not convinced that Smith used an actual stone to translate. As I've said before, the idea that he used a seerd stone in a "glass" is not believable to me. In the first place, I can't think of any place where Joseph Smith could have found a rock that was so perfectly round that he could see his own face. In addition, he never says that he found the rock himself. Joseph said he "sought diligently" (no pun intended) but could not find the stone. This is a very common belief among believers that is not true. The author has a hard time believing this one too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, who wrote the first half of the book, got lazy and just repeated her own ideas in the second half.   This is a very bad book for a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book. I had never heard of the guy and I had read the book and it had been bad. I didn't like the story at all. It's all about a guy who goes around killing people and gets away with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has no plot.   The only thing that is interesting is the "narrative" of the author.  There is no plot, no conflict, no tension.  The only thing this book does is provide a little bit of romance, but I'm not sure that the author is being serious about that either.  This is a very poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book. I was hoping that it would be good and informative, and it wasn't. It was boring and didn't even include any information on the subject that interested me (or what I was looking for). I would only recommend it to people who are interested in getting an overview of the topic of the book, but don't really care about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that makes this book worthwhile is the cover art, but that's a really lame one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by a doctor who has no idea what he is talking about.  He is very concerned about the "mental health issues" in the population but seems not to realize that he is one of them.    I read this book as a means of taking a break from reading the "new" science-fiction books.  What is wrong with the mind?      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been a big fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy since I discovered it on my parents' shelves as a kid. It has been the biggest thing I've bought in the last five years. I was excited to finally get it out of the package. I read it cover to cover and then it was over. I did have a great time, but I was so bored by the end I could have read it again. The writing was so good, I wanted to make up my own characters and travel around in space. I could not believe that there was no mention of the death of the author, Douglas Adams. I will just have to have a new copy of the book in order to enjoy the rest of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The only thing it has going for it is that it's a very short book that can be read in a day. That's all. If you read any of the books on this list, you know that you can do better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad story about a person with a brain tumor who finds out about her condition and has to spend the next couple of days in the hospital to have the tumor removed. It is all too familiar, and is poorly written, with a story that doesn't make sense.   5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for my son as a Christmas present. He loves this book and his grades have improved significantly.   It is very informative and is very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it had been recommended to me by a good friend who also likes fantasy. The book has some great ideas in it about what it means to be human and how it has affected all the civilizations that have come and gone in the world over the last 5,000 years. The plot is a little cliche but I like it. The characters are also really interesting. The worldbuilding is also pretty good and a lot of fun to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is fine, and it's interesting to read a science fiction story about the future. The characters are good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written for people with a specific set of skills:  I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I didn't enjoy this book. It's written for a specific audience who is willing to take on a lot of difficult material.   It would be good to have a more general book that is written in a non-technical way but also has the information needed to teach this material, but it's not that bad of a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so terrible, I don't even want to give it a one star review. I've read about 500 bad books over the years, but I've never seen a book this bad. The story is completely unbelievable. The main character has been through a horrible accident, and in the aftermath he has gone through a series of bad people and bad experiences that have left him with a hatred for the world.  His family and friends think he is the "worst man alive." He has a terrible temper, and can't control his drinking.  He has gone off to a bad college, and is now working at a bad restaurant (which he hates because of its poor service and crappy food).  He is so angry that he has decided to drive to New York, and go after the biggest "bad" man alive.  I don t think I've ever seen anything like it.  It's not funny at all.  The whole thing is just plain stupid.  As for the book itself, I can't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a college student studying for a degree in psychology. This book was about an episode of his life. In this book he talks about being molested by a woman he dated in college. He does not go into detail about what happened. He writes about the emotional trauma that this has caused him. He talks about it in a detached way. He makes no attempt to make his emotions or feelings known. He also makes no effort to try to be a good example for his daughters. This has made him feel very inadequate as a father to his three children. I have not been able to forgive him for this. I do not believe he did anything wrong and am not sure he did it to be "cute". I am glad I didn't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from the library. I am sure that most people who read it will think I am a fool for wanting to read it, but I loved it.  I love historical fiction about the Civil War.  This is the first one I've read about the South and it's really well written.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not about the history of the Civil War.   I had a hard time following the arguments of the book.  The author seems to be trying to prove a point that the South had a better cause than the North.  I don't believe that.  As far as I know, the Southern cause in the Civil war was to keep the slave trade.  And the North, having had slavery for 150 years, was not as sympathetic to the issue as the South was.  It seems that the author has not done his research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand the obsession with these characters, the need to be able to name them, and to know what they're doing and why they're going to do it.   Their motivations are too convoluted and too contrived for me to buy into.  I found the ending unsatisfying and the characters annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of essays on how to get a girl to sleep with you.  It is filled with bad advice and terrible tips.    The book is about a guy named Tom who was a good athlete until he was in his mid-30s.        He has done many things since then to improve his life and get more girls.  One of the things he has done is to quit drinking alcohol and get off all forms of recreational drugs.  He has also changed the way he looks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are dull and have no depth. I was reading a book in college and it was a good book, but I don't remember why it was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read this book, I was very interested, but after reading the second time, I realized that this book is nothing more than a very shallow "self-help" book. It's full of very basic psychological advice that can be found in almost any self-help book you've ever read:  -Get a life partner (or at least try to) -Stop being so dependent on your parents (or anyone else) -Do something "fun" every once in a while -Try to find something that you "want" to be happy about -Try your best to not let your emotions control you  I can see how the book could be useful to someone who has been in a bad relationship or a bad family situation, but the basic advice is just not practical for someone who doesn't have a strong support system. I was in a very bad situation before I read it, but it didn't help. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an ex-CIA analyst who was involved in a failed assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein. There are a few very interesting parts about his past. But he's pretty much an apologist for the Bush administration. I have a lot of respect for people who were involved in the intelligence community, but it is very frustrating to see this guy defend a system that caused so many needless deaths.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books I thought I would love, but it turns out to be one of the most boring and tedious reads ever. It was a complete waste of time and it made me want to never buy anything by that author again. I can't believe this is the same author that wrote The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great story, but with a lot of "why don't you get a real job"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book should be easy to understand and fun to read, but this book has little in common with either.   It's the sort of book you read just for the entertainment value, but you have to be a really slow reader to really get the humor.  The characters are basically the same and there is nothing to add to their story.  It has some nice moments, but it's a pretty typical book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author tries to explain away the flaws of his previous books by claiming that all his previous novels have been published by Random House.  He is wrong, and his subsequent books are just a collection of his earlier ones.  In fact, there is no excuse for the terrible writing of this book.  It's as if he has no idea what he's doing, or that he knows the basic rules of good writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after the last one (by the same author)...      I thought it was going to be just as bad....   It was so different.....   The characters were all over the place..     There were no clear personalities.. the only real person was the heroine.. she just happened to be a woman.. her problems were caused by a male.. I have never read anything like this.. it is just so bizarre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of the book is about a group of people who go to a cabin on a lake. They have a problem. The lake is full of sharks and one of the people, an attractive, good-looking woman, has a bad case of the blues. The rest of the group is all good-hearted and good-natured, but the attractive woman gets depressed about it. In the second half, she and the other people have a discussion about it, but they have to split up because they're on different teams.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing to do with the subject of my interest in the topic of the book. It was written by a woman who did not understand the subject and did not know what to write about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I have ever read. It is the worst book ever written. It's about an ex-military man who, in order to help his wife and children out, gets himself on a list of people who should be killed.  The story is about a group of soldiers who are assigned to go into the desert to kill a certain individual.  This particular soldier is not a soldier.  It is clear that this is the person's job, not his.  In fact, he has no problem taking the life of the people around him.  He is a very bad person.  I found it hard to believe that there are so many people in the world who think like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. If you are trying to make a case for God, the bible is a great place to start. However, if you don't like the bible, you will find no comfort here. I have spent a lot of time reading and pondering about what the bible says about marriage, sexuality, divorce, and life.  I don't find it any better than any other book on those topics.  The biggest flaw in the book is the fact that there is no explanation on how these things apply to people who are not Christians.  You will never know why the god of the bible gave a divorce or divorce is wrong without reading the bible.     What did you like best about this story: The first half of the book, I was so impressed by the author.  She wrote a very interesting story.  It's a great story and the story is told well.  In the second half, I thought I would have been able to get a more complete picture of the story. The author spent a whole book explaining the reasons why the story happened.  That is a good idea and I would like to see more of that in a book like this.  What didn't you like about this book: I didn't like it when the author talked about how the story was the result of some curse, which is something that is used in many stories.  But in the end, I felt that the story, although interesting, was not as interesting as the author was trying to convince me it was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I have ever read. The first half of the book is a long history lesson on the history of the world from Ancient times to the modern age. It is a bit dry, but I could easily understand the history and it is very interesting. The second half is the story of a man who has a huge debt and must sell his family home.  I don't understand why he sold it.  This is an incredibly boring book, and it's really hard to understand what he is saying. The writing style is very bad, and there is no plot to speak of.  There is only a long and boring lecture about how everything is different from when it was a small village.  It is really hard for me to imagine a person who wants to change the world to be so boring and uncreative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narrator, although she has a voice to go with the book, is incredibly annoying.   She starts off by telling us she's not good at describing, but I was expecting her to be good at it.  I had trouble finding what I was looking for.  She kept getting into the details of the scene, but then just didn't know what was going on.  It's hard to imagine how it would have been any different if she had been good at description.  She ends up describing how the scene would have played out but never actually saying anything about it.   She describes how the men were behaving but doesn't say anything about what was being said.    That just felt   lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does a terrible job of telling the story of the first generation of women who joined the Communist Party during the early years of the Soviet Union.  It is mostly an account of their personal experiences, the social changes and cultural changes that affected them and the difficulties they had in learning to read and write.  I would have preferred a more detailed account of how the Party operated and what it was trying to achieve, but the book was more about how the women reacted than it was about how they achieved their goals.   This book does two things:  It tells the story by showing the people's personal experiences.  In other words, the women who left the Party to work in factories and factories that were owned by the government were in the most extreme circumstances.  However, I would also like to point out that the authors, and I am not just talking about the author's name but also the authors' husbands and brothers-in-law, are not bad people.  The men were great and they knew what they were doing.  While I don't think this book is very interesting, I still found it interesting that this was the first time that I had heard of this history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book I never knew I needed until I found it.  This book is an amazing read for anyone interested in the life of Abraham Lincoln.  The book is written by a retired Lincoln biographer and is a true story that shows the life, times, and challenges Lincoln went through in his life.   The main thing that I liked about this book was how honest Lincoln was.  He is not the type of man who is going to make up a story about a friend or something.  His book is about him as a man.  You really get a good feel for what he went through and what his attitude was to the Civil War.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very interesting book about a great man, but there are several problems with it: 1) it is a biography of a great leader, and that is a problem; 2) there is a major flaw in the way he handled the death of his father; 3) there are some serious problems with his relationship with his family; 4) there were serious problems when he left the army after a short period of service and became a lawyer. The author also makes up for these problems by having many anecdotes about Hitler's personality.  I do have the feeling that if I had been around Hitler when he was a young man, I would have been much more influenced by his personality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. I have been using a program like this since I was a kid and it is by far the best thing I have ever found. I use it to track down my lost keys or any other things I may have forgotten.  The best part about it is that you can have it read to you or you can just use the program to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that is so badly written it's embarrassing. I'm a long-time fan of the series and I've read it all, but this book was so bad I couldn't believe it. The plot is a complete waste of time, the characters are dull, the story just goes nowhere, and the book is over at chapter 2. The only redeeming quality is that it's a good, old-fashioned adventure story. I think the author of this book just got a few cheap ideas from the previous book and wrote the book as a ripoff.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book, because I've always been a big fan of Harry Potter and I always love reading stories about magical wizards.  It was going to be great.   But I wasn't really that into it.  My only problem is that I really wanted to like it.      I guess the problem is, I didn't really like it for me.  I'm a pretty big fan, but I don't know how a big book like this could be as shallow as I found it. What didn't work:  This book is about Harry, but not really about Harry.  He's not really in it at all.  Instead, it's about the first years at Hogwarts.  And the first year is pretty boring.  Harry is bored out of his mind, because his father is so dull.  But then he meets Ginny.  Then he meets Ron.  Ginny is also a boring character.  She's a very nice girl.  In the end, she's also annoying, because she's trying to get Harry to be her friend.   So, it turns out that they are both the same person, because they both want to be friends with the same guy.  So it's all about Harry's friends, but it never seems to really happen.  This could have been interesting.  Or it could have just been a really boring book. I did like the author's comment on Harry and Ron's relationship:  Harry:  It's very strange that Harry and Ginny have become such good friends.  How could we have such a good friendship, and yet, at the same time, be in a relationship?  I mean, Harry and Hermione are really good friends, too.  That's how I started.  Why did I want Harry to make friends with Ginny? Rating:   4 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been using this product since the early 90's. It's a wonderful book about the great power of good people working together.  I can't say enough about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a terrible book, the plot is terrible.     I feel like a piece of shit for reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great example of how not to teach. It has so much wrong with it. It uses an overly simplistic model of what learning is all about. Learning is the acquisition of knowledge. It is NOT about memorizing or memorizing the knowledge, which is a lot of the book's claims, but about making it meaningful. Learning should be about understanding something, about applying something to your life and the life of others, and about sharing that understanding. This book teaches a model that is based on the idea that the "solution" to your problems is to learn how to memorize and to memorized things and to learn about those things. It teaches how to solve problems using a lot more memorization and less thinking than is necessary. The problem with this is that it is based entirely on memorization, which isn't learning at all. In a lot cases, it is worse than useless. It's also a bad model for teaching because it is very easy to get confused about what you are supposed to do and why you are doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book I would have recommended to anyone. I don't think the author has read anything about the subject. There is no explanation of what she means by "diet" or "lifestyle". She simply suggests that a diet will help you lose weight. She's got a good book out about diet and health. If I could recommend no one's book I'd take that over this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is a huge waste of time, but I did read it. I think it's a waste of money. I can't believe they were ever published in the first place.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is not very interesting and not very funny.  I like the author but this book was not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a bit of a sucker for romance. I'm just not sure if I want to be with a woman who loves to talk about sex all the time and I'm not sure what kind of person would actually enjoy that kind of talk. That's not to say I wouldn't like to be in her company but it just seems a bit too forced. It's also kind of boring to hear her talk about things that are so mundane as she talks about her daily life. I don't think I'd be that interested in a relationship that involved her talking about sex so much that she couldn't enjoy herself at the same time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very old, and it is a very poor translation. It is difficult to understand, and many words and expressions are missing.    The most important words in the English version: the "loyal" and "disappointed" are not in the Japanese version. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  It's a book that tries to explain a scientific idea in a way that is unintelligible.  It doesn't explain what the author thinks it does, and it doesn't give a decent example of a real-world application of the idea.    I'm surprised that he included a table of "most popular applications" as if this is some kind of scientific research report.  If it were, I'd think it would be better to have a bunch of different ideas that have been proven in the real world, but the author has never even used these, so they are just thrown in because they sound cool.  Also, why are the names of people and companies listed in the appendix?   It would be easier to just include the ideas as they are, and the appendix is just a way to give the reader a few ideas that are worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a problem with the pacing, but I really liked the book.   I think I'll read the rest of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that I can only think that it was written by someone who has never written a novel. This is a terrible book and I can't recommend it to anyone. I would not buy it if I were you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read the book, I thought the author was a little pretentious about the book's subject matter, the history of the Irish.   However, after having read it several times, I see that he is in fact very good at telling a story about a country and the people that live there, as well as about the history in which they live. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think I can put this book into any category of 'bad'.   As much as I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King (although I still read his novels), this is the kind of story I could totally get behind.   The story is about a man who has a strange power.  The first time he sees a girl he thinks is a girl, he gets a call from his wife, saying she's a girl.  This is a classic case of an unusual thing happening to the wrong person.  It takes a while for the girl to realize what is going on, but after it is done, she realizes that her new friends all are really girls and she is really a guy.  While I found it a bit of a shock to see a woman who looks like a man and have the same name as a man, I found the ending to be pretty satisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last book in the series I have enjoyed, but this one was more of a slog. The author has a reputation for writing boring books, but I think this one falls into that category. It was really hard to follow along and I think it was just as boring as the first two. I can't think of a single good point that this book made.   It was also really hard for me to read, which was a bad sign.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a big waste of time.  The whole point of it is to teach the basics of how to get started on an RPG game.  It is filled with rules and examples and little else.  Even the examples are poorly done.  There is a whole chapter on the GM's job and how to do it, but it is so vague and boring that it is worthless.  What is really missing is a book on how to play a roleplaying game. This book is worth a read if you are into roleplaying games but are not sure what to get.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about this book. But it turned out to be just as bad as I expected. I can't believe the publisher would put a guy like this on the cover of a book about the history of the Christian church. I have always considered the Christian faith to be the most absurd religion out there. The more I think about it, the more ridiculous it sounds.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that is full of inaccuracies, wrong facts, and is full out wrong. The author's "research" was based on the research of the other authors he used to get his book published.   He claims he has the original manuscripts and research from the other three authors but I found out they never gave any of it to him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping that this book would be about a man and his son in Vietnam, but it's all about a woman. Her story is a little bit better, but her husband's life is even worse than hers.  I don't know if the book is too much like this woman's life or if the author is just trying to do what she can to make a living. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only imagine the poor reviewer, whose parents had to pay for her education, went through a lot of stress trying to get her grades up.  I did not find the author's "explanations" very convincing.  This book was an effort to show how the brain works.  It was not my favorite science book and I think the brain is the hardest thing to understand.  The author did not really try to answer questions about the brain that have been asked so many times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a book that is very important to remember.   The people of the past lived in a time of incredible violence and pain, and it is important to know about the things they did and how they lived.  It seems to be a great book for children as well as adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book! It's so bad I just can't imagine why anyone would buy it. The only thing it has going for it is that I've been working on my own project. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love the first two books by Brian McClellan, but this one is not a good one.   The plot is a mess.  He does a great job of showing how the people in the story are trying to figure out what is happening to them and how they can cope.  But, he just doesn't write the characters well enough.  The people are either too perfect or too horrible.  There are some really horrible things that happen to people and they all happen in such a rush that it's hard to understand what the characters are thinking.  They don't seem to have any plans, or they get too caught up in their own problems to realize that they are about to make things worse.  I felt like I was reading about people who were about to go into a real mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some interesting ideas about how we should use technology and how we could get some really good health and nutrition from it. However, it's very bad at explaining how we actually use it.   For instance, she suggests that we could monitor our weight in a way that shows us how much we have eaten, then calculate our daily energy expenditure by dividing that amount by our estimated energy needs (she calls these estimates "calculations").   The idea is good, but the problem is that this method is pretty useless.  I do this all the time with my body composition calculations.  She then recommends that we monitor our energy intake to determine our daily caloric requirements (and thus, our daily calorie intake), then calculate how much energy we have left by dividing the energy we actually consumed by our estimate (which is also pretty useless).   It's a good idea to track calories consumed and calories expended.  If I can do it with my calorie estimations, I can probably do it better than her with her calorie estimators.  In short, she doesn't know what she's talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that is so bad I had to give it a 1 star rating. I did not like the writing at all. The main character is just a selfish, rude person that does not listen to what others say or what they think. I don't understand why a person would have to write a book like that. It's such a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book.  The premise is that the aliens come to earth and kidnap the president, and when the president is brought to them, they kill his entire family.  It is horrible.  Even if you don't like aliens, it is terrible writing.  I would have been better off just buying a hardcover of the original movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping to read a great novel, but this book did not live up to my expectations.  There are many stories that are told with great enthusiasm.  The first story about the life of George Washington was interesting, but the others were boring and not as engaging as the first story.  I also found that the author seemed to have little respect for the American people.  While this may not be a problem with everyone, I found it rather offensive that she thought it was okay for the people in the book to act so rudely.  This book was only mildly interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I were a betting man, I would wager that I am not the only person who found this book to be very hard to read.     This book was written in a very high pitched, almost shouty manner, and the narrative is extremely slow.    It seems as though the author was trying to convey an entire novel, but didn't get the right ending.  This is my first experience with the genre of speculative fiction and this is probably my first time reading a novel in which a character is the narrator.  I have read some of the other books by this author but I am still not sure what they are about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending is pretty lame. I've read the book 3 times now and can't get the feeling that she is going to escape.  It seems like her whole life has been building up to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books and this one was the worst.   It was a poor book from beginning to end.  The plot was badly written and there was no story at all.  It had nothing going for it.  I'm not sure what the point was.  If you have a bad time reading a book then it is not going to be a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's very hard to imagine what a lot of people are thinking about this book.    This book is the product of a lifetime of reading and I can tell you from experience that you should never try to be funny or witty with the subject of death, even if you're going for a very sad moment.  I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I found it very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book after many, many years and the ending is very unsatisfactory. It is all about the protagonist's relationship with his son, but the relationship is the least interesting part of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of books and had this one on my wish list for a long time but never got around to it. So I was very disappointed that I read it now and have to wait until my next vacation to get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My boyfriend bought me this book thinking it would be a great read. Well he wasn't right.   It was not.  This book is full of boring and meaningless characters and it made me sick.  I wanted to throw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an exercise in  dumbing down.    The first time I read it I was struck by the fact that it is a story about a woman who has to find her way through life by following a man's footsteps to find happiness.  In fact, the title is so suggestive of a "trash book" that it's not hard to imagine the title being lifted from a much better book, one that  could have been titled "The Most Important Thing is to Have a Strong Back."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book and found it to be a great introduction to writing fantasy. It was a lot of fun and made me want to write more fantasy. However, after a while I found myself thinking that it was just a very good introduction to fantasy. The first third is pretty good. The second third is a little weak. It really has to be re-read. I found it a little boring. I would like to see some more story development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say that this book is no more than a thinly disguised copy of an earlier book on "diversity" by the same author.  In this case, it is the diversity of women in science fiction (not just the "Women in Science" column in Analog).  This book was more about diversity of ethnicities than it was about diversity in science, and the author doesn't seem to be very interested in any kind of diversity in writing either.  I find the idea of women writers in science writing, as opposed to men, to be absurd.  (I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the two authors are women.)   If I can't read this book, how can I write about it?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been a reader of science fiction and fantasy for decades and have read the same books over and over again.  But this one is just plain bad.  It's so long and over-familiar that I couldn't even keep up.  I was a little irritated that the main character died early in the story (and she wasn't really supposed to die).  And it wasn't a really interesting story at all.  Even the best of these books have a lot of good ideas.  If I had to make one change, it would be to make the main characters' names different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book.   The only thing that got me through was that it was about the same time as "The Catcher in the Rye"   and I read that one because it was on the shelf at the library,   but I can't find a copy of that book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poorly written book. The narrative is a bit hard to follow because of the many times they go back to the beginning to get to the point and then come to a conclusion that is not the conclusion they wanted to reach.  The story does have a strong moral, but that is very obvious by the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually review books on Goodreads, but this is such a bad one I feel compelled to say something about it. I think this is a very good book, I'm just not sure how it was written. I really like the story. The characters are well-developed and well-written. However, the author tries to put it all together in a neat little bow and I couldn't get through it without thinking, "It's just a story about the war in Afghanistan."   It was just a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to read it in bed.  It was not my favorite book at all.  The story was too long and too complicated for me.  I think the book was written by a different author so the story line was not realistic and the plot was so far away from the actual event that it was a bit hard to follow.  However, it is still a good read and I will enjoy reading the next book from the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The whole book is about a very long, very boring story about how a guy who is really really good at computers can't get hired at a place he wants to work at. And it's not even the guy's fault - he's really really bad at computers. It's just the place is too full of people who are really good with computers, and they're not going to give up their computers just because a guy can't make himself work at it. (Also, he just gets into it with a guy he's never met before at a party.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke from start to finish.  It is full of a number of false and misleading statements about the scientific evidence, but more about that later.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. I've tried several of his books, but none of them worked out for me. This is a good, basic read but doesn't have the wow factor I was expecting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should be read in a public library as a study guide for college students.   It's an excellent read and is worth the money if you're going to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of this book is that the world was once destroyed by a war between humans and an alien race called the Omeek. Since the war was a complete failure, the Omerks live on in the world, causing a race of humans to develop technology that's a little better than what we have now. When I heard about this, I immediately thought, "Well, there's probably a good story there somewhere," but then I read the book and realized that the whole premise is so incredibly stupid. The Omerk race has never had a problem with space travel or space flight (they are in fact the first species to discover interstellar travel) but they use it in an incredibly crude and dangerous way: They send their space ships out to capture other species of aliens, then enslave them and use them to build new space ships. The whole thing is so obviously stupid that it's almost like a satire. The only reason they do it is so that the human race doesn't have to develop space travel. It's so stupid that if the authors wanted to make a serious point about the Omen, they could have made it so that they didn't capture the Omin and used them as slaves, but they don't.   I'm not sure if this book was written for a young adult audience, but this is a bad idea. If you're reading a book for kids and want to make them cry, why not have them build a space ship and send it into space and enslave a bunch of other people. Why would they want to do that? The whole premise just doesn't make sense to me.  The writing is just so bad that I'm having a hard time trying to give it a negative rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of lies, it has no plot or plot development it is a collection of anecdotes of a man who is supposed to be a prophet, a man that was in my mind for years thinking about the fact that he is a man of God that is now gone because he has become a fraud. I was shocked when I read it, and my heart went out to him and his family.  I wish God would bring him back to earth so he can be a true prophet for all the people of God and this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book about how to become a good artist, but there are a lot of problems with it. The characters are weak, and the plot is too confusing. I also don't understand why the artist has a bad habit of drawing a picture of himself. Also, he doesn't want to draw his sister, but then he draws his sister's dog. Why not draw his mother? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never understood why people have a problem with the idea of people "reincarnating" into the same life-style as their dead ancestors. I don't really understand why the living people feel they are somehow superior to the dead people, since they have the same exact traits. It is also interesting how the "real" descendants of the ancestors feel the same way. I find it interesting how their behavior and actions are not only different, but also more childish than the descendants of those same ancestors. It's also interesting to me that the descendants believe the descendants are still living because they can't see the living relatives of the deceased being reincarnated into the exact same life style as the deceased relatives.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a very good book and it is a shame that it was never reprinted in paperback.  I liked it when I first read it and I thought it would make a great book for my children but as it stands it's not a very fun book to read.  There is very little humor in it and most of the chapters are not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts with the main character as a high school student. He is depressed and is very antisocial, he goes out at night to play Dungeons and Dragons. He finds it extremely difficult to make friends. The author has taken a very good story and made it boring and bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I wanted to get into reading more nonfiction about the greats. I read this book for the first time after I read the other nonfiction on the list. It was terrible. The author is a good friend of mine who is very interested in the subject. It's very boring. I found myself looking up the other book when I was reading this one, as I was interested in her other book. The only good thing I got from this book was that it helped me appreciate my friend more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book and can't wait to read more about it.   It's really hard to find a good book on this topic.  It is a real shame because there are so many good things to say about it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed that a book about a very different, more positive and uplifting life experience than mine ended up being a disappointment for me.   This book was more like a love story.  He told it from his point of view, which is different from mine, but in the end he ends up giving me the feeling that I should be grateful to be alive (which I'm not).   It also has the same problem I had with The Lord of the Rings, the feeling of a bad ending:  I was ready to hate the characters in the book but it was so over the top that I found it hard to stay angry about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good read, but what I got instead was an unorganized, poorly written mess that I won't read again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had any complaints about this book, it would be that it's very long. I'm usually a short story guy, but I really don't like reading a book that's that long. There's a lot of information about the subject matter in this book. However, there is a lot more fluff in this one, and the information about it is often difficult to parse. The book is very readable, and it has the right amount of information in it, but it didn't really make me want to keep reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the equivalent of taking a bath in an oil slick.  The author is an "expert" on "all things " in the paranormal field, but she does a bad job of explaining why some of these experiences are "not necessarily" related to a psychic or psychic phenomena.  There is a lot of "mysteries" in the book and it makes me wonder if this book is just another one of those books that uses "mystery" as a cover for a "psychic" who "caught" a serial killer.  I was also a skeptic when I first heard of the psychic "catch," but after reading this book I now believe there is something to it.  My only complaint is that the author makes such a big deal about her "suspects" and "sights" in some cases that the whole book becomes a bit convoluted.  This makes it difficult to follow along with her analysis, but I think she is trying to do a good job, so I can overlook it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping that it would be good, and it is. It was a fun book to read. However, after reading it I had a hard time coming to a conclusion about the meaning of life. I had to take the book to a more conservative professor to get a good answer, and even then he could only get me to say that I don't know. I have no idea if this is a good book or not, but I can say that it was worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but it didn't have a lot of plot.  It was all about her and the other characters.  And then the last half of the book is her trying to get some closure, only to have that be another problem with the characters.      I liked the concept, but the book didn't do a very good job of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an extremely bad book, and I had to do a lot of work to even understand what was happening.   I got it from my local library, and even after reading it, I still had problems with it.  I would recommend reading the whole book, or skipping it, if you are not a huge fan of Harry Potter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has been out for a few years and I still have not read it. I am a big fan of the book series so I was happy to see a sequel coming. However, the book just does not live up to the previous book.   It is a very enjoyable read but it is very predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that saves this book from an overall score of 1/10 is the fact that it's written by an American, so I'm hoping that the author will try to change the story a bit.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an Englishman who has been living in China for 30 years and who has spent a large part of that time trying to communicate with his wife who is now a Chinese lady and who is in the Chinese Communist Party. He does it all by going to a Communist Party meeting in a town where he had been living.  The Communist Party is one of the many organizations that he does not want to be associated with. He is a very smart guy but has been totally isolated and his wife is very much under Communist Party control.  She is very strong and she has to be because if she is weak she will be killed.  In the book he goes to a meeting at which he gets his wife to tell him that she is in fact a Communist and that she can get rid of him by doing something that is very easy to do.  What he does is to get her to tell a lie.  If he has not been brainwashed in a communist school, he would know that the only way to get a wife to talk is by telling a lie about her beliefs and by telling the truth about his own beliefs.  So that he can be rid of his wife, he tells her that she was in the party when he was in school.  He does this because he believes that the party is the best organization to run a country.  His wife says that the Communists are bad people.   He is told that he must go to the party and find out if his wife was really a Communist.  Unfortunately, he does find out that she does not have the strength to go.  When she gets there she is told she is not a Communist, she is a good Communist.   She is sent to the police and told to go to her boss and to tell the boss that she will not be a Communist for a long time.   This is very difficult for a wife who does not really know her boss very well to do, but she has a big mouth and can be very persuasive.  This is the main reason that this book is so bad.  I could have done a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has a really bad ending, and is just really not a very good book.  I liked the idea behind the book and how it is about a boy who can see the future and gets superpowers for it, but I feel like he was trying too hard to be like Dr. Strange, and it just never really worked.   I was really looking forward to reading about the story of the boy and his friends getting superpowers.  However, it just didn't come together for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a very common experience. If you have a very bad experience with someone, the book might be helpful in getting a good one. It's also about the difficulty of knowing what to say and what not to say to get a positive outcome. There is no easy way to be a good listener. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book to be a bad waste of time.   The author did not care about any of the things he was trying to say.  I don't want to say that he failed because he didn't care about the subject, but he also did not do a good job of putting the information in a way that made sense.  This is an old book that has some good points, but is far too long and is not very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book.   The main character is a little too idealistic and wants to help people as much as possible.  He tries to use his powers to help others by using his super-powers on a person.  The problem is that his powers are not as effective as they seem.  I feel like he just wanted to help everyone.  Also, he is really mean and really stupid.  His actions just seem out of character to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really like the books by E.M. Forster. I've read a lot of his work, so I was very excited to read this one. But I was not impressed. The writing is terrible, the characters are poorly developed, and the story is predictable, so many of the events that lead up to the plot are so poorly developed that it's almost painful to read about. It's so bad that it can't even be considered an entertaining book, as it has nothing to do with the rest of the series. It seems like it was written to be a quick read for the Kindle version, as there are almost no images in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  I really like the story, and I am not a huge fan of sci-fi but I have to admit that the plot is very believable.  The main problem is that it is really bad.  A lot of the problems with the book are the author's own writing.  There are a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies that make it hard to believe the author is trying to create a believable story.  Another problem is the author has an extremely difficult time showing the events in the future.  It's not that she can't write a future, it's just that the future she shows is just... wrong.  For example, it is a lot easier to create the future than it is to show it.  That is why it took me so long to finish the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was in love with this book, but I have never been able to put my finger on what makes it so off-putting. I've read a number of nonfiction books that were full of fascinating information about the past, but this one just made me feel so weird about the whole thing.  I understand that it's about a group of people who lived in the 1930s.  But I don't know why they were so bad at making love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting to like this book a lot more than I did. I had a very hard time finding anything that would be worth my time. I just want to laugh out loud at how silly they are.  I'm not sure if it's just me but I don't get how people think they can do any better than this.  It's like some kind of sick joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I just wish that it was a little longer. I like the idea of having the kids come to terms with what happened, but the story felt rushed. I liked the idea that this was a warning. But the way it was presented didn't do it justice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry that I bought this book.   It's so boring and over long.  I found it very repetitive and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put this book down because I was annoyed at the ending. The last chapter is a bit of a drag. This book would have been better if it was edited into a shorter volume that ended with a short, one-shot story about the events at the beginning of the book, and the ending could have been different.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been trying to finish The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  since it was first released. But I have found it very difficult. The story is very simple, and has very little depth. It is an extremely shallow story that could only have come from a writer that has never written a full length book before. The only way the story will be good is if there is more depth in it, but even then it won't be as good as the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book that I enjoyed reading, but it's not as good as my previous favorites, and I don't know if I would give it 5 stars.   It's funny, but I don a lot of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring, unoriginal, and has absolutely no effect whatsoever. I'm glad I gave it a pass on my first read-through. The last half of the book (which deals with the rise of modernist/artistic movements) is very interesting, but the middle part is very tedious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of clichés and was written in a style which is very difficult to follow. The main theme of the book is about the need to keep your friends close, even if they are not friends. The author makes friends easily but does not have the courage to make real friends. In this way, she only has a small group of friends, all of whom are not her friends and will never be her friends. I think that this is a very negative view of relationships and it is not very helpful for any relationship.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a few good things about it, but the characters are so unlikable and unbelievable that it makes me feel bad for them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of the book is good, but it was so rushed that I can't help but feel it's all been said before, and the only thing interesting about it is that the character's names all have "G" in them. It's just the kind of book that's so good you can't put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last 5 pages or so of the book are just a waste of space. The author gives an overview of the topic and then immediately jumps to the conclusions that the reader has already come to. The most important thing that the author did was to tell a nice story about a very special and interesting dog. I liked the dog.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was really really awful.  This is a good book though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has some good points, but it just ends so early that it becomes a chore to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was never a fan of Stephen King.  He always seemed to be saying the same thing, over and over again.  I think he was writing a love story, but he could have just as easily been writing about a murder mystery.  This book just didn't satisfy me.  It was like watching a guy reading the same book over and again. I could understand that King didn't want to do a full-length novel.  But I don't want him to do more than he already has done.  Maybe it's just my tastes, but I'd rather see a new book from King than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about this book, and it was about a great story that was too good to be true. The writing is great, the subject matter is interesting, and the main characters are well drawn. Unfortunately, the story doesn't add up. The main characters live in a small town in Alabama. The story is told in the first person, so there is no real way to know what is happening in the minds of the characters. There is a big conspiracy about the murder of a young girl. The book tells how the police solved the crime, and then the police cover it up. It ends with the main character having to find a missing young girl named Maddy who is supposed to have been found dead. Then he finds out she was never found dead at all. Then the story ends, and we are left wondering what happened to this girl? The ending left me wondering if there really was a murder and the police and the government cover it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book. I've always wanted to read a book on how to be a better person. It's not that I don't have a good relationship with people. I have a great relationship with my friends, family, and coworkers. I just have a hard time putting myself in other people's shoes.  So when I heard about this book I was very excited to read it. I didn't like it.   The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's about the right thing to do.  I would be happy to read about people who try to do good things even though they know it's not possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book and was looking forward to reading the rest of the series.   It is a pretty bad book.  The main character is very annoying.  I didn't care that he got shot in the head.  He just came back from a dead man's world where he was the last survivor of a space-opera and was supposed to be the last living person in the universe.  It wasn't that he didn't die at all, it was just that he survived in a different universe where he had no memory of his life in this one.  This is why the main character isn't so great in the other books:  He was just a normal guy who didn't make any special contributions to the world.  In the first book, he has to work to be more useful in the world so he can help people in the next book.  It's a pretty simple story.  Unfortunately, he is still annoying.  I guess that's the point.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is very bad, but the book does have a lot of good things to it. This is a very well written book about one of the most famous serial killers in American history. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I also recommend this book to anyone interested in history.   If you want to know more about serial killers and murder read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really disappointed in the quality of this book. I had to stop reading after about two chapters because the characters seemed so much like the ones in the first book. They all seem to be more concerned about the details of their careers than actually being successful.   The other characters in this book were just as annoying as the main characters. The main characters in both books are all so concerned with their lives. I mean really? They have their own families to feed and house and they can't just quit their jobs and go on their own adventures. They have to be busy with their day jobs or else they won't be able to take their trips.   to tell a good story, you need a good character. Not this book's characters.  , I thought, and I am really glad I stopped reading after the first chapter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad review, and not even the author knows it. It is very difficult to put down once you have started reading it. The book is about a person who can create anything that she sees, and how that person uses this power to manipulate others. The author is very vague in explaining the nature of the powers, so it is very hard to tell what is real and what is not. I don't know that the author will be able to come up with a good ending, but I can't wait to see the author try to make something believable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed in this book, mainly because I really enjoyed it at the time. However, now I don't really care for it. It's just not as interesting or well written as other works of the same genre. It is really not about the "hologram" that they showed in the film. It doesn't have any interesting characters. The main character is a jerk, and I don`t really like her at all. The author has no real story and doesn`t go deep into the characters, she just has a lot of pictures of holograms and then does some really bad dialogue. There are other stories in the book as well about the movie and a few other things, but it`s all just too boring for me to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. I'm not going to write a review about how bad it is.  I am going to make it clear that the story is horrible and there's nothing good about it.  The characters are horrible and not believable.  You can tell the author did a poor job writing it.   The ending was terrible.   I could not believe this was an actual book.  My only consolation is that it was not that good of a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an awful experience. I'm not sure why the author thinks that a book written by a professional writer can be good but a book that was written by someone with less than the skill of a first year college student is not worth reading. The main character is a narcissistic, narcissistic person. She can't be trusted. She's never wrong about anything and she never gives an honest answer. She always lies and she makes up lies. I was expecting to find a little more substance to her character. The characters in the book are all so shallow and stupid. There is no emotional depth to them. No character development. They're all just flat out stupid. This is not a good book. It's an awful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wish I'd read this before I bought it.   The stories are not all that original.  I've heard many people say the stories in this book are too familiar, and I agree with them.  The one story about a man who killed his wife with a baseball bat is a little bit too familiar.  But the rest of the stories are all pretty original.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping for a good, funny story about a kid who learns a very important lesson in life and his own sexuality.  I can't believe I waited a week to read this book.    I wish I could remember the last time I've ever been excited about a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not a book at all. It is a collection of essays about the nature of writing, which is an entirely different discipline from journalism. There are certainly good points in this book. I really like the book because it is the only book on the subject that I have read so far.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book about the history of the Civil War. It's not the first bad book about a war I've read but it is the most disappointing. If you want to understand the Civil war you have to get to know the soldiers and the men who fought in it. If not you can't tell the difference between a good general and a bad one. If there was a good war it is a big if.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book about a month ago but never got around to reading it.   There is no real explanation about how the world works and its just another way of saying "this book sucks".   The only thing I can really say about it is that I have to say it is really boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring, dry and doesn't make a good impression.   It is just a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a big fan of fantasy and I love the way the author uses the words "unbelievable" and "the unbelievable" to describe a variety of phenomena. However, the author doesn't seem to have a good grasp of the basic physics involved in his creations and the magic items that he describes can be used to accomplish very little if not no useful function. I was hoping for a bit more of a explanation of how these "magical" objects function, but this book just ended up being an exercise in writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea why this book is so bad.  It's so short and doesn't really add anything to the topic.  For example, I can't recall any actual plot that the main character does, and there isn't anything about the life of the main characters that really makes sense.  I think the author wanted to make a "dying of a thousand cuts" story, but it just didn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a bad read. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you have a strong interest in religion and don't mind being told that your faith is stupid. I just read this and was just disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute disgrace to science. The book claims that the earth is not at all old. This book completely ignores the evidence for the antiquity of the earth. It also ignores the very large amount of data about the geologic column, and also ignores many other things that show that the geology of the area is a very young area.  This is another case of someone taking a subject and trying to write a history of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out great and is really entertaining. I loved the fact that the authors would go to great lengths to make sure that their characters are interesting. But then they forgot about their characters for the most part. They had the time and energy to include a lot of other important aspects of the characters that were not important to the plot, such as the character's lack of education, their physical handicaps, etc. (I had to turn this one off after about the first third)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a big fan of the original version of this book. I'm a big fantasy reader (D&D, the Wheel of Time, etc.) and I'm always up for a good fantasy story. This book didn't do much for me. It felt like a story that was written to fit in with other books of the same genre (see: The Dark Tower, Game of Thrones, etc.). It was not as good as those other books.   The book was pretty bad overall, though. It was written in the style of a typical "love letter" to a book series. It's not that bad. It just felt a bit dated, but I suppose that's a personal thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. It has a really good message about the power of belief in life. It doesn't get into specifics too much, but it's a good start to the concept of belief. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very disappointing. The author talks about her father and how he had many affairs and how she is still learning about his behavior. The problem is that she does not mention his infidelity in the book at all. She also does not give a detailed history of his early career.  The book ends with an interesting story about how she and her parents were forced to move from their home when they married because her mother was having a hard time of it and her father did not have any money to buy new furniture.  I have a difficult time believing that her mother would have had so much trouble.  If she had to move, why didn't she have the same issues as her husband? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of the book is the last 5% of the story that is about the relationship between the two friends. It is very enjoyable to watch them get together after years of hating each other and now getting together to have a good time.  It is a good read and the story line is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the first two thirds of the book were just a series of "Oh my God!" moments.  I kept expecting the book to go off on some tangent about a young person's first love and how their love is no more than a childish game.  But the last third of the novel is not so good.  The "Oh My God!" scenes feel forced, and  I can't help but feel that the author is just making this as big a deal as possible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring, it is hard to understand and it has a terrible ending! I read it once but I feel I should have read it again and it was boring as hell!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed with this book. The main character, Marge, is so annoying that she gets a great many people to dislike her. The thing is, she is a very good friend and I can't even tell you how much I enjoyed spending time with her. In fact, I'm actually thinking about giving this book a second read just to see if the same thing will happen to her. I'm really hoping that the book ends here and she can have a normal life like everyone else. The ending just makes me feel even more like the characters and the book doesn't even really get me on the first reading, but it seems to keep me reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was about as interesting as a book about the occult can get. It had a very interesting premise. But it was a very boring book. The characters were bland. The writing was cliche. It was hard to get interested in the story. The whole thing seemed to be a set up for some kind of big twist that never came. This book will probably appeal to those who like the occult and want to read a book that is like the "Harry Potter" series but about occult stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book that I had to write a negative one. It is a collection of stories, some very good, some not. It also contains a couple of historical references. It was hard for me to make out the names of the men, and the story was confusing at times. It had a very slow beginning. It seemed that there were only two men involved, and then it just got really boring. It would be interesting to read a real life story about this group of men. The two who were killed were killed for not helping a woman who had been sexually assaulted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first time I have purchased a book that didn't do anything for me.  The author is a good writer, and she does have some good ideas, but the book is so dull, so self-indulgent, that it's hard to care about the ending.  If you're not interested in reading about how to make an entire family of birds behave, this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a poor attempt to give a complete history of the U.S. air war against Germany in WWII. There are some nice stories about the people involved and the technology. I'm glad the USAF did a good job at finding aircraft that they could not get in the USA, as well as finding the parts to build them. I like to read about technology that was developed in America and then made in Germany. It was good to learn about the German pilots as well, who did a great job with some very good fighters and bombers. I've heard of some of the German planes that the USAAF didn't find and it seems like there is a lot of history in this book about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's like they're not going to write a good book and it's not worth the effort.  This book is a complete disaster and has little to no story to speak of.  There's not a single new thing in the book that I can think of off the top of my head.  It has a lot of plot holes and a lot more character problems than I can count.  I feel like a real piece of garbage after reading this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really terrible book. I got it for my son and he didn't like it at all. I guess he is just a huge Harry Potter fan. It was not that the story was bad, but the characters were very stereotypical and unrealistic. I don't think he would like this book at all and he is a huge Potter fan, so I hope he doesn't read it. I'm going to give it to my brother, but I'm not sure if he will like it too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to get this book because I thought I might like it but it's not that great. The character is a bit boring, I think because it's all about her (which is fine but I can't think of many other characters who have had this kind of thing happen to them), the plot was pretty lame.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be rather pointless and uninteresting. I can't find a good reason for any of the people involved in the case to do the things they do. The entire case was just ridiculous and silly, and I can only imagine how it made people feel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when it was a "hot new" author book. I was not impressed.   I feel like it was written for a general audience.  It has a lot of interesting things, but there were also some mistakes in this book.  The first half is about a family with three children.  But I think that the whole book should have been about a child who is different than her parents.  I mean, I have had a child that is not like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't get into this book. The author has never been a very good writer. I find his work to be very formulaic. The plot was really boring and predictable. I was just waiting for the next scene to happen. The character development was really poor.  I was bored out of my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of the way the authors of this book approach it. It is an "I am not really into it" type of book. It starts off with a very cool concept about how we can make a small object look bigger by using our hands, but it doesn't make much sense once you get to the end.  The "hands" are a metaphor for the brain, and they are also a metaphor of how people think.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really don't like this book.   It is really difficult to get the points across.  It's like the author thinks that he can do all the stuff he does and get away with it.  He does, he just doesn't care about you or me.  I am a very nice person and he doesn't like that.  When you read a book, you read it for its story, and it just isn't there for me.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really bad. I'm a huge fan of the books by Michael Connelly, but this is by far the worst one. The only good thing I can say about it is that the narrator is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was good, but the characters were terrible. The characters were in such a bad mood from all the drama that they didn't even have time to get to know each other. They even did a couple of scenes from their past together. I'm sure it was a fun couple, but it's just not right.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been on my "want to read" shelf for a while now.  It is just so darned boring and not very well written.  This is not a good read if you want to read about history.  I have a hard time even making it through the first few pages without feeling bored and wondering why this is a history book instead of a history of what happened.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that kept me from giving up on this book was the thought that there is still a sequel coming out in a year. It just seemed that way. But it's not going to be a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first chapter is absolutely atrocious, the second chapter is awful and the last chapter is a complete disappointment. I am now going to avoid this book like the plague.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't. I didn't like it because it was boring.   The plot is bad, the characters are bad and the story is bad.  The ending is horrible and I wish the author would have stayed away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad little story with a good ending. The protagonist is a nice guy but not very bright, and his father is the worst. I don't really want to believe that the story is true because I would like to see the other side of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but I didn't care for the author's prose. He wrote it like a journal entry, so the words were a bit hard to decipher, and I couldn't understand what he was writing about. I'm a big fan of poetry, so I'm glad he chose that form to express his thoughts. But I also have to admit, I thought this was just a bunch of stuff about religion, which is a bit strange to me since I'm not a religious person. It was just too wordy for my taste.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. The author makes some very valid points but uses it as an excuse to attack Islam. I am not a Muslim, but Islam has no place in the West and I have no problem with Jews either. The best thing about the book is that the author is an American Muslim and has been a very successful one. I hope he is able to overcome his prejudices.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all. This book is not for everyone, because it is a hard to read story about a girl who is a victim of sexual assault. She is abused by her boyfriend.   This book has no redeeming qualities. It is a sad story that I wouldn't want to read, but I can't put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. It's hard to understand why anyone would be interested in reading this book when there are so many other good ones out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it was going to be about a young girl who is a lesbian but it's about a guy who is into his wife, a gay man who is in love with his wife but has trouble coming out to his family and friends. It's actually really boring and just about gay people that love their wives.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. I was going to write a review that was just about the plot but I've already written that one. This is a good book about a character I really enjoy. It's got some very funny and poignant moments in it and I really got into it. I didn't mind the "realism" of the book at all. It seemed realistic enough to me. The plot was very well done and I loved how the characters got more complex as the story progressed. I'm definitely going to read more books by this author!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was looking for a book on what I assume is the "great" English novelist (that is, someone who writes about the greats) but didn't find what I was expecting. The book is about a great writer who is not very great. His book is good because it's about the Great Writer and because the Great Writers are not great writers. The fact that the Great English novelist was a woman didn't make it better or any better than his male counterparts. It's about a writer, and about how that writer is still relevant and important to people. I found the book interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book begins with a rather unenthusiastic statement about how much she likes the book, and ends with a very unenthused and uninspired book review: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really bad book, very bad.   If you can't take a joke then you are really not interested in a book about a woman who is not really a woman at all.  She's a man with a really messed up brain who uses it to make women believe he is a woman.  If a woman really were a man who just likes to take advantage of women then he would not be doing it so much.  It is really sad that people have such a problem with women not wanting to be seen as men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry I'm not in love with this book as much as I want to.    It's just not a very good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really bad.   The story is a complete mess.  The narrator is trying to be a good role model for her daughter, but she just ends up sounding like a clueless teen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a hard time getting into this book.  This book is full of "how do I do X" type of questions and not much "how does X work" or "why is X working for me"  I don't think it's a bad thing to try and understand a technique, but it's hard to understand how it works.  I feel like I have to read the book over and over again to understand it.  My teacher did it for me a long time ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book.    I'm a little disappointed.  The story is not the story I expected it to be.  I thought that the plot would revolve around a character in an attempt to make the world a better place for all people.  Instead, it is just a little character that is there to have a good time.  This book is also not the most intelligent book I've read.  It's hard to believe that a person can think that way, but it's the truth.  But, I don't care.  There's just so much more going on in the book than the characters think it's important. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book when I was going through a very dark time in my life. I had just lost my best friend to suicide and this book is one of the few things that helped me deal with the pain and get over it. I'm not sure if the author had any idea what it was like for her to go through this or not but the book has a great deal of honesty in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My fiancee and I were in the store looking for something for our kids. We found this on a shelf and we were surprised by how well written it was. I am glad we went into the store because we found something we really liked and didn't regret buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing more than a collection of quotations.  As far as I'm concerned, the author is guilty of plagiarism.  I had to look up this author because I had read his work years ago and was not impressed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very good and a lot of fun but not very good for my money  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't normally read long books but this one really sucked me in and kept me reading, and kept trying to find some way to read the book in more than 3 hours.  This was an awesome story and I loved the ending and the ending with the reveal of the secret.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those "What do I read next?    It's like I've been reading this same book for the last 5 years and it just keeps getting worse"   What I mean is that, for all its great information, it is simply a collection of anecdotes and other tidbits about a number of different people.   The author makes a case that women's magazines were not really about women but about the men who read them.  That may be true, but I don't think that makes it an inherently bad book.  I think this is the story of a very specific woman in a very particular time and place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that the author is completely uninformed on any of the subject matter and the book reads like a textbook.   I understand that we don't know how many languages are spoken on this planet, but this is a ridiculous assertion that we know everything there is to know about all the languages we don?t know anything about.   (I am not sure how many of the people in the book speak any of those languages).   There are several points in the text that I found incorrect. For example:   1) The Japanese word for 'to be' is ichiru   2) A language is spoken by a single individual   3) All humans can speak English.   a) You are incorrect that all humans can, in fact, speak English, because English is a language.     b) If you're correct about all humans being able to speak English then you can't say that Japanese has multiple languages because Japanese can't speak English and also English doesn?t have a language so Japanese can?t speak English   4) Japanese has a word for?to be? which is izakayo and means a person who is aware of their existence, but who does not have the ability to express that existence.  :/   :o   If this was a book about the history of language in Japan it would be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this book is a textbook on Japanese.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been around for years. The author claims that he is the only one who is smart enough to write about the occult. The only problem is that he just doesn't know what he is talking about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those things that I just can't get into. This is the sort of book that seems to be intended for a younger audience but doesn't seem to be any better than a "how to get a girlfriend" book for a 13 year old. I would like to say that there is some kind of "twist" to the story but it really just is a collection of anecdotes that seem to come out of nowhere. In the end, I found it hard to take it seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a self-improvement book. This is the only self-help book I've ever read that has nothing to do with what you should be doing in your life. It's a book about how the universe is against you, and how you need to become a better person, and I found that very depressing. I'm an atheist, and the universe has no sense of humor. It seems to me that you need a good dose of humor in your books. This book has nothing that I found funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the author's style, but it is an interesting read and is a good example of the 'dark side' in fiction. It is hard to find a book that doesn't contain some kind of sex or violence. I am glad I picked this up for my own bookshelf and it will certainly be a great read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first three or four chapters are good. However, the author has little idea of the type of thing that he wants to write about, and he goes on for pages about the problems with "women" and "feminism". This book is so poorly written, it's a wonder the publisher bothered to publish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read.  I've read plenty of bad books and they always leave you wanting more.  This book was a disappointment.  It was poorly written.  The writing is very confusing.  While the main characters are not bad, their actions are not logical.  They have no common sense and there is no real logic to their actions.  In the beginning, I thought this book was going to be the best thing since sliced bread.  However, as the book went on, the writing got worse.  Eventually, it got so bad that I couldn't even finish it.  My only consolation is that the book was fun while it lasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many of the books in this series, and I am not one to give up easily.    So when I saw that the author was going to write a sequel to a previous book, I was very much looking forward to it.  I don't mind books about people who have done terrible things (or people who were in a bad situation), but I did not feel that the characters in this book were anything like the character I liked so much in the first book.  In fact, I think that the new character, the girl who becomes the "murderer" is a bit of a jerk, and her actions seem to be just to push the hero along (although, it's interesting that her character doesn't have any major flaws, unlike the first "hero" who was such a jerk that he was a danger to the whole family).  I did like the main character (the daughter), though, and she seemed to be pretty good at hiding her feelings about the man who killed her parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book expecting a well written and researched book on how to use a high end computer for professional work.   This book is the opposite.  The writing is bad.  There is no real data presented in this book to back up the claims made by the author.  I have heard many people talk about the benefits of a high speed connection and the fact that it is much faster than using a dial up modem.  When i bought this i was expecting the same type of data.  This is not the case.  A very large amount of time was spent on the subject of computer lag   In this book  I had to dig through a lot of information   to find the information I was looking for  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the "Great Awakening" and the spiritual journey of a young woman. It's interesting but has a very negative tone. It also seems to be based on a true story, which doesn't seem to add any value to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. The plot is simple and intriguing but unfortunately there is little to no development of the characters.  They're all so shallow that they are almost caricatures.  Their relationship with the dog is so one-sided that I found it insulting that the dog could care less about them.  I felt bad for them, I really did.  The only thing that saves them is that the story does get better at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been using this as my daily reading. It's a bit of a chore to turn it around and put it back in the slot, but I think it's good for a few days.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think I will have to put it down after reading this one. I would have liked to have seen the author explore a different point of view. I'm sure that's what makes the story so entertaining, but in a book about a woman who can't get an abortion, I'm not sure it would have been as interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a former student of history, I was disappointed by the book's failure to address the historical context of the Vietnam War.   It doesn't seem to understand that it was an anti-communist war that was fought to keep a corrupt regime in power in the wake of the failed US invasion of South Vietnam. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book so many times and have been a fan of both the series and this book, I was very disappointed. I have been thinking about this book all week, as it's just so similar to the rest of the series. The story of the three of them is pretty good, but this book didn't really do anything that I enjoyed about the series or this book. It just sort of felt like a rehash of events that happened in the last two books, and I'm not really sure what happened with the last few books. I did like the ending though, but that doesn't make this one any better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad I almost didn't want to read it. It is about a group of kids at a boarding school who were all involved in a suicide attempt. They did everything right. The book starts out as an excellent story about a kid who was the victim of bullying by a girl and then ends with him dying. I could not read a single word of it because it was so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most terrible book ever written. The characters are the worst. The story is terrible. The ending is horrible. The author was not a good writer. The reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is about an author who wrote this book to prove something that i did not know was true. It is a book about how he can make anything better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was really boring.   It had so many boring things in it.  The characters didn't even have names (they were just described as 'weird' or'sad' and then they had a lot of scenes in which they were sad or weirder).   They didn't have any goals or goals of their own.  There was nothing exciting in this book.  It was about the characters going from place to place and doing things for their own sake.  That's about it.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've only ever tried to read the first two books in the Hunger Games trilogy, but I was so disappointed by the ending that I gave up on reading the other three. I found this book to be so cliche and cliched, and to be written in such a way that I couldn't really enjoy it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book. The premise of the book is that a very smart girl from a very wealthy family falls in love with a poor boy. The main problem is that the poor boy is a complete idiot. His friends try to save him but it's futile because he doesn't have the slightest clue what to say or do to impress the girl. This book is like a good friend who keeps telling you to keep your head up, but never shows up to do it himself. It just makes you feel bad that the friend is so dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it was going to be the story of a man who had a stroke and lived with a family of monkeys.   The story was not what I expected.  It started out like the man had been having a stroke for a long time and just a few months ago the stroke occurred.  He became so angry he lost his speech and became a hermit in his home.  The family is a bit odd and the monkeys seem to be trying to kill him.  This story is not so much about what happened to the man after the stroke but what was going on in his head before the stroke.  I found it very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book about three years ago and never used it. It was the same type of book I've used in the past.  It had all the information you needed but was too much of a slog.  I have since used it a few times to reference. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. It is so confusing that I didn't know if I was reading about a fictional character or a real person, and I didn?t understand a word. I would recommend it to people who love to read, but only if they like to keep a straight face, don't have a lot of patience with the author, and can handle a little confusion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because of the title and then went to the bookstore to check out the reviews online.   It seemed to me that it would be a book that would be more interesting for the people that love sci-fi than the people who like sci-fantasy.  I didn't care for it as much as the reviews suggested and it didn't seem to me like the kind of book that you would want to read more than once. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was in college and the only positive thing I can say about it is that it wasn't a self-help book! It's just an autobiography about a poor boy, poor boy with a lot of problems. It's a sad book, but it's not all bad. He is a smart boy and a good person. If only his father had taken him to see him in the hospital after his second heart attack and had given him the advice that he would probably still be alive if it weren't for him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is just a bunch of different people who have a problem with something. It's not like any of them have a good reason for hating something, but it's just a mess and not very good in a lot of ways. I'm not a big fan of the plot either, and I think I'd rather read a good book than a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read. The first few chapters were just terrible. Not only was the narrator's English bad, but the story itself was so bad that I was really upset with the author. The plot was so poor and the author's prose so bad it almost made me want to give up reading it. If you read this book, you will not be happy with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book.  It is filled with many examples of bad writing, and I found it to be unenjoyable reading.  I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of the Twilight series.  The first book was awful.  This book is not much better.  There is very little of a plot, and almost none of the romance.  We are just given a bunch of names and they are just thrown in there to give the characters something to do.  They are a lot like the characters in the original series except they are all dead.  It's like they just picked the best names and put them in the book to give them some kind of relevance to the story.  And the author just doesn't seem to be able to think of a reason for anyone to care about the characters other than them being cute.  If you are a Twilight fan this book isn't for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.   The author tries to tell us a story but is unable to do so because the facts don't fit the story he wants to tell.  He tries to make us feel something about what he thinks we want to feel about the Holocaust and instead we get a very tedious book that is mostly filled with historical facts and anecdotes that seem to be drawn from some kind of Holocaust encyclopedia.  The most important thing that the book does is it tries to paint a picture of what happened to Jews in the late 1930's by telling the story of the Holocaust survivors.  It is very difficult to get the facts right and there is no way this book could be published today because it is filled with errors.  There is no question that the Germans were responsible for the Holocaust but it is difficult to find out exactly what kind of people the Nazis were and what the relationship was between the Nazi Party and the German government.  We are also told that the Nazis killed many thousands of Jewish children and young adults but there are no sources to back that up.  I don't know what kind o Nazi was running the country at the time but the fact that the SS did so much to facilitate the movement of Jews and was so open about their plans to do it is really scary.  This is a book that you should only read if you want to know how the Holocaust actually happened but not for any reason other than to try and find a book to justify your anti-semitism.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about an autistic child. The book is full of errors. The parents do not know how to raise a child, the child is not aware of this, the parents try to ignore it, and the parents do the wrong thing. The child does not want to be in a group of people who understand and communicate well. The author is not even aware of these facts. She is very upset when she realizes that she did the wrong things. The way the child acts is because of the parent's wrong way of doing things.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been meaning to read this book for a while now.    The first time I heard of this book was when my dad mentioned it to me.  I am sure that it will have a very strong influence on my life and my future career.  The book itself is very detailed about a man that has no children and no intention of having any.  He lives in his house with his wife and 2 cats.  It is in this house that he lives out the rest of his days.  For the most part the man is a very unhappy person.  However there are moments where he is happy.  These moments are brief and brief only.  Overall I am disappointed that this book will not be a part of my reading life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book but it was so badly written and so full of spelling errors and bad jokes that it made the book unreadable.    The plot is terrible.  I don't care if the characters were real, I don;t want to read a book with them in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, and enjoyed it a lot.  It was the first novel I've ever read that is so well-written and thought-provoking.    It's a great book to read while listening to music and reading.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is great. The second half is sooooo bad.   In the first half, the main character, a college professor who was on a cross-country teaching trip, gets pulled over by a cop and has a good time with the cop.  It's funny and has some good scenes with the officer.  The cop takes a liking to the professor, even after he makes a bigoted comment about how black people are more likely to be arrested for the same thing.  This is all part of the experience on the trip and it's funny.  At the end of the trip, the professor and the cop talk about how they will see each other again.  In this book, the cop's name is not even given and he has no name.  I thought he was supposed to be a real name. The cop doesn't even get a name. And the professor is supposed to have a "real" name that he used on his passport, but he doesn't have that.     In fact, there is no "real name" in this book.  He just has a "first name" that is all wrong.  I really wish that was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a sucker for adventure books, and this is no exception.   It's a good book, but I can't get into it.  I'm a total sucker for romance novels, and I've read some excellent ones.  This one falls a little short.  I know, because I tried to give it three stars, but the romance is overplayed, the plot is thin, and the characters are not very likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a complete disaster. I have been a huge fan of the book since I was a kid and this is no exception. The main character is a total idiot and is just as annoying as his friend (who is a little worse but still not that bad) and the other characters are completely useless (they have nothing to do with anything) and only serve to annoy you. I really wish the author had stopped after the first book because this one is just not worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is horrible, the characters are awful, the ending is terrible, the author is an idiot, and the cover is terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is not compelling enough to carry it through.   I really wanted to like this book, and I have to admit, the cover is great.  It's got a good feel to it, the art is very good, but the writing just didn't do it for me.  I'm not saying the story is bad or anything.  The idea of a family getting together and building a house is good.  But, the characters just seem a little bland to me. There is no spark, and the characters come off as just there.  And they all seem to be working for the same cause.  This is a pretty minor gripe, but it is one I can see happening from time to time with some novels.  Overall, I'm giving this book a B- but not one that I can recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good book.  It wasn't.   The only things in this book that made me laugh were when he was trying to be funny and he forgot he was supposed to be writing about people.  He didn't know how to use the word "nope" correctly.  I was supposed see the "I was there" in this but it didn't come through.  As for the rest...  It was a good story.  A bit too long.  But that's what the book is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to start off with the most negative thing about this book: the author is an idiot.  This book is a series of one liners (sometimes more) and is filled with typos, wrong grammar, and obvious jokes (most of which are made at the expense of women).  It also doesn't really give the characters a voice or any kind of personality.  One thing that bothered me about this particular book is that the characters all seem to think that it is ok to put their weight on someone else's back for the sake of being with them, and that the person on the other side of that weight is automatically more important than the one who is being lifted.  It's a really old, sexist stereotype.  I hope they were written as a parody or as a satire, but they could have just as easily been written as the characters they are.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but in the end I found it lacking in several ways. I enjoyed the book as a travel story, but the lack of a good plot didn't do it for me.  The setting is really interesting, but I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  It didn't seem like the characters had the kind of personality you would find in a book about a traveler, like the ones in Travel by John Irving or about a writer who travels the world.  There are some nice parts, but overall, I didn't find it to be an enjoyable read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that this book was not in print when I was a kid and have always wished I had it.    Unfortunately, now I have a library card so I can read the books I want but not all of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so sick of hearing about the evils of electronic gadgets that I'm almost finished with this book. I read it for a short review on a book club, and I had to go back to the original text to find anything that was even remotely worth reading. I'm just going to leave this review now so I don't have to look through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written that I almost gave up. I don't even like Harry Potter. This book has a lot of plot holes, but then again, Harry Potter is so popular that I am bound to see some flaws. This is another one. It was almost like someone wrote this book and tried to sell it to her friends and loved ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book.  It is a book that is worth reading, but the story gets old really fast.  The characters change so much.  This book is an absolute treat to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. It is not funny and has some extremely bad humor. It's a horrible, horrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the most boring thing  I have read in a long time. The main character is a young girl. She is a nice person and tries to do right, but she can't keep her mouth shut when her sister is molesting the kid next door.  It's like the whole book is about her talking to her sister.  I'm not sure why she's doing it, but it's not like she's a victim either.  The book ends with her saying,   I don't like it when you're a victim, it makes me feel    sick.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written and edited that it is useless as a reference book. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of John Grisham, and this is not his best book. But it's a must read for those looking for some true crime, and for those who think that Grishman is just a writer that's trying to make a fast buck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so sad that a book like this has come out so soon after the last. I'm going to be writing this review from memory until I get a copy. I was so excited about this book because it was about my favorite book: the story of the 3rd Dalai Lama. I thought I'd never get to read it and finally did and I just had a terrible time. The first 50 pages were interesting but the last half hour or so was the worst part of the book. I didn't like the author, I didn' t even like the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after I'd read the first few.   I liked the first book.  I think that's a good thing, but this one just sucked.  The writing style is bad.  It is like a guy who is trying to be smart but really has no idea what he's talking about.  It's also like he doesn't know how to write a good story.  He does have a good sense of humor though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the introduction, the authors write that the purpose of this book is to "raise the specter of conspiracy in American life."   They are correct, but the book doesn't go nearly far enough.   The book's main thrust is to expose the role that a "secret society" called the Illuminati has played in America's history.  It's interesting that the authors of the book don't appear to have read any history of the Illuminati or its role in history.   It is certainly true that the Illuminati was a secretive society that secretly influenced history. But it is equally true that a number of the conspiracies about the Illuminati, including the so-called "Illuminati Conspiracy," are just silly.   I'm not sure if the authors intend this or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a good book about a lot of interesting topics, but it doesn't make a lot out of them. It is about a boy named Daniel, who grew up with his family in a large house in a nice neighborhood, in a time before there was a lot to do in Chicago. He grew up wanting to be an architect and then a professional musician. He got an architecture degree and took classes in music. The one thing he couldn't get was a job. He lived on the edge of the music scene for a time, but soon became disillusioned by it. The book is about how he met his wife, and how they eventually split up because of the demands of their jobs. The first half of the book is a story about Daniel's music career, while the second half is about his marriage. The end of the second part of the story is where the book really loses it, and the only real lesson it teaches is that there is no way to really get ahead in this world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was good for a while, but it just wasn't. It's a nice idea, but I have no patience for this kind of thing. If I'd had any patience with it, I would have found the next one better, but as it is I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love this book. The writing is crisp and funny and I loved the story of the family in that book. I think I'll put this one in my library just for the nostalgia and the references to the family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful.  It is very long and quite difficult to read.  The plot is very simplistic and the characters are very one-dimensional.  My brother thought the story was a parody of the book "The Good Wife"  (the wife in this case is a woman named Liza who is a very intelligent woman)  It was hard to keep track of all the characters who were involved.  As the story progressed the characters became more and more confusing and they became less and less believable.  In the end I realized that I didn't like the book.  I didn 't really enjoy the book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only unreadable, it is unreadable in such a way that it will cause the reader to question the purpose of reading a book at all.  If this is how you are going to teach your students how to read, then the rest of the book is a waste of time.  The author does not explain the concept of the "word" as it relates to vocabulary and the concept is not clear.  There are some examples of "word", "worded" and "wordless" words that are not clearly defined and there are many examples of words that have no meaning at all because they have no definition.        The book is also confusing in terms of punctuation.  For example, a sentence that starts "the word of" and ends with "and is" does not make much sense.  I found that it was very hard to keep track of the sentence structure in a text.  It seems that there is an entire book dedicated to how to write in this style.  This is not a good way to write a book that I think any reader would find useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book but the writing style is too long and boring. The author goes into a lot of detail about his own sexual exploits, which is fine, but then he tries to write a narrative about his wife's experiences with a different man. I just didn't feel like she was a complete and total pawn in his schemes. I guess it's possible that the book is about his struggles to come to terms with what he's done to his wife, but the way he's written it felt a little too forced and forced.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a disappointment. I enjoyed reading about how it took the best part of a lifetime to get through it and it is a waste of time.  It takes the reader over 30 years to realize that the whole thing is a sham and a fraud.  I would not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main characters are not believable. The author doesn't seem to understand what a hero is. I've seen so many books with the main character that's so great at everything, yet not a single one that's good at anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really like this book at all. It's a typical fantasy book with elves and magic. There's some very good writing in this book, but the magic doesn't really work out very well. The elves are basically a bunch of weird, weird-looking humans. They have a good amount of personality, but they don't feel very real to me. Also, the elves all speak in a foreign language. I don't know if that's intentional or not. Overall, the book is just a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book, but I didn't find it convincing.   The only things I could really take issue with are:  -  The title.  The story is about a girl who gets married, but the wedding was really a "tribute" to the bride. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time and effort.   The book begins by showing how to make the best use of a microwave oven.  The author then moves on to explain how to cook pasta using a microwave.  Then he moves on and teaches how to use a toaster oven.   He then shows how to clean a microwave by putting it in the oven, and finally he shows how easy it is to make pizza by microwaving the crust and sauce.  These are just some of the things he does not teach in the book.  I would have bought this book if he had just given me the microwave technique instead of the toaster technique.  This is a book that is supposed to be a manual of microwave cooking, and the author spends over 300 pages telling you how to do things that most people already know.  If you are like me, you probably already know how to get the best out of a microwaved meal.  To make this book a complete and utter waste of your time, I recommend you do not buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the original.   The characters were amazing and the plot was great.  It was one of the only books that got my attention from the start.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  Perhaps the author had too many characters or something that happened in the middle of the book caused the characters to become too much like each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read for my son. He said it was a bit too heavy for him to read at first, but he got through it and loved it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the problem is that the author is too much of a coward to write a bad review about this book: She knows that it's bad and yet she doesn't want to give it a bad rating.  She can't admit that she's wrong, so she has to deny the existence of bad reviews.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard a lot about this book, but it just never really sat with me. I know there are good books about religion and religion is very interesting, but this book just wasn't for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only way to make a book about the "fringe" more interesting is to make it more bizarre. This is one of those books: there is a lot of good stuff in there, but nothing really makes the book much more than a bad thriller. If you're interested in the occult, there are a few ideas in here that you can use, but otherwise it's just another good read with a bunch of pointless references.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete waste of time. It is about a family that owns a small farm in rural Virginia, and one of the sons has an accident that lands him in a mental hospital. He is not able to work for two years, but he manages to get out by the time the year is over. One of the problems with this book is that you can tell that the author had very little knowledge about farming, and it shows in this book. It just seemed like a waste of money for the author to spend a lot of time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a great story. The author is an intelligent and witty person. But I just found it hard to get into this book.    I think it would be better as a short story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off pretty good and it's hard to stop reading when it does. I'm hoping it gets better. I've read it so many times that it's impossible to remember all the details. I remember the beginning of the book. The first page of the first chapter says:    "This is a tale of one of the last of the long-lost civilizations, the Jaghut...The Jaghuts are a savage, warlike, and powerful race, who have lived for thousands of years on the planet Khitomer, on the far side of the galaxy from the rest of humanity." It's pretty clear that this is a fantasy book. It's set in the same universe as the books by R. Scott Bakker and it is set in a fantasy world with magic. I didn't read it to be a science fiction reader. I want a good book with a decent plot. I read this book in a few sittings and it was so slow I almost gave up. I was so bored by the last few chapters I decided to go back and start over. I don't know what I expected when I bought this book but I wasn't going to be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can see that there is a lot of good in this book. It was an interesting read and I enjoyed it. However, it was an easy read. It had little to no plot or suspense.  I think it was a little too long to be a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story was interesting but it just didn't feel complete or believable.    The author makes it sound like a book that could have been written by a kid.  It was fun to read and interesting to read about.  But  it wasn't a book I was going to remember for a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read all the books in the trilogy, but not of the trilogy. It was disappointing to me that we didn't get more time with the main characters. I guess I expected a few more scenes with all the characters. There were still a lot of scenes of the main female character and her friends in the back ground of the story. They weren't really necessary. This trilogy will not be read by anyone who wants a story about a woman who wants to go out in the world, but is scared of getting her picture taken in public, and a woman whose only goal in life is to be able to see and be seen. I don't think I would enjoy this trilogy at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very disappointing.  I don't like the way the story progresses.  The characters were supposed to be good but it's not like they do anything very good.  They try to do the right thing but the wrong thing is the right one.  There is a good portion of the book about the characters trying to kill a monster.  But there is a part of it about a girl who dies in a car accident and her husband who was killed in the same accident.  If they hadn't died I think it would have been better.  Also, the story is about how they get back to the house after the monster was killed.  After that they decide to take a boat ride and they get a lot of people on the boat.  In the end they decide not to go.  This is about the same time I started getting sick from the fish.  It was a lot less interesting to me then the whole fish thing.  Overall I thought it was pretty bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not only a complete waste of time, it is also full of factual errors. The author states that "The main source of these problems was the book's use of the "dutch method" of proofreading to establish the reliability of the original manuscripts." The only source of problems is the book itself.   The first problem is that the author claims that the Dutch had invented a method of proof-reading the Bible which is very different from the traditional way of proof reading in the English Bible. He also claims that "the dutch method is essentially the same as the method of modern proof-readers, with the exception of a few important changes" and then goes on to make a huge list of these changes.  The only thing that is different about the dutch proof-reader is that they only use the word "I" when it is actually a pronoun.  They also use a "dental orthography", which is also very different than the traditional orthography.  I find it odd that the only change that the dutchess dicemaker is actually using is to change the way the apostrophe is written.  This is not a major change, but it seems to be a big deal to a lot of people.  It also seems odd that he is ignoring the fact that the "Dutch method" is actually the way it is written in the King James Version.  That doesn't mean it is wrong or the dickey.  But that is the only difference between the " Dutch method" and the traditional method.  If the author is saying that the method is "the same as a modern proofreader" then he is wrong, since the dicemakers use an entirely different method.   So the problem is not the diccemaker's use, but the fact of the dictionary that he has used.  To say that the Bible is "literally" correct because it is "a literal dictionary" is just wrong.  Again, it should be said that the book is filled with errors, but that is not what the book claims to prove. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book   Unfortunately, it's not a book I'm interested in reading  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but it's too long to be anything more than a boring biographical work about an obscure author. The author, Robert Walser, is a respected scholar of American literature and a brilliant historian, but he's a dull and insufferable writer.  I found his writing style irritating and repetitive.  His lack of respect for his subject and for good writing is apparent throughout the book, especially in the prologue which is nothing more than his usual "history" prose.  This book is full of holes, including the assertion that the "Lives of the Poets" is the "greatest of all biographies".  I find the assertion to be false, and the book is filled with errors as well.  There are several passages in which the author claims that the poems were published in the first issue of a major literary magazine in their native language and that "there is no question" that the author's "life story" is "a fascinating tale".  These passages are just plain silly, and it's clear from reading this book that Walsers is a hack and not a serious historian.  He has also misrepresented other poets who were not American and who never claimed to be born in America.  In addition, there is a passage where he claims that Walt Whitman wrote a book about the American Civil War and that the book was a "masterpiece" that was "widely acclaimed" by the public.  Again, this is complete nonsense.  While Whitman was not a great poet in any sense of the word, he did write a very interesting book about American history, and in it he made a number of points that are well worth noting.  Walsering does a bad job of representing Whitman's work.  The title of the book suggests that W. is a great American poet, but in reality he is not very good at all.  A review of "The Lives of the Great Poets of the World" would not have been complete without a section on the French, who are known as "The Poets".  However, Walserer's lack of knowledge about the French poets leads him to misrepresent them.  And there are many other passages where he makes up facts about the poets in order to create the impression that he has done a good job.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great example of what happens when a good book is published too soon.  I can't say it's bad writing but it does not flow well from one page to the next.  A good book should make you want to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so bad, I gave it away to a friend.   It was a terrible idea to read about the Bible for a group of people who don't like the Bible.  I can't tell you how bad it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a good horror story, you will not find it in this book.   The story is based on a true story, and it is not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book but I have a hard time with the author's "dynamic" style. The way she moves around the scene makes it seem like the characters are not really there, and it makes it hard to follow what is going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad story.      It's not a good story.   It might not even be a good book.  It's not really a story at all.     It's a collection of unrelated incidents that happen to a character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is all about people trying to be more interesting than they are. The book makes a point about how you shouldn't be too interested in people or your own thoughts. So you're stuck having to write a biography about someone you met 20 years ago. It's not like he was a great guy or anything. I know I'd be bored by his company too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. It is boring, repetitive, and doesn't have much to do with anything that I read. I'm a sucker for "girly" stuff like these, and I don't know what the point is. I found this book to be a bore and did not want to read any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book about four times already and I keep getting the same idea:  What a waste of time.    What's more, this is the third time  that  I have had to  read  it   to understand what is happening in this story.  It's so poorly written that I can't even begin to imagine how a good writer could get such a bad result. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has been written and published for some time, so I expect it will be a good read.   It's also not a bad deal, but the book does not have the originality of the others and is not nearly as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  The book is very poorly written and it makes me feel stupid for reading it.  If you have a weak stomach then you should pass this book by.  I know I'm not the only one who has this problem.  It is an extremely bad book and I can't wait to see where the author goes from here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of shit, not worth the time it took me to finish it. I'm sure it's a great read for people who want to know what happened in the last century, but for me it's just not.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book. I read about a girl who got the power to fly, but she only flew when she was angry at something, and was never able to actually fly. I thought it was a really cool concept and I thought this book would be an awesome read. However, it just didn't work for me. I think the premise was cool, but it just wasn't very compelling for me to take her seriously as a hero. The way she went about it was weird, and it was very obvious that she was not in any way special. She had her powers, she used them to make herself popular, and then she got to fly because she was a loser who could only fly because of her powers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so terrible I don't want to put it down. The book should have been written in a different time and place. This is the worst book I have ever read about the Holocaust. It is so bad it is unbelievable. The people are so stupid they don't know what they are doing or what to do. The Jews did not do anything bad, they only wanted the freedom of the cities they lived in. The Germans only wanted to kill the Jews because they hated Jews. They are so bad they cannot tell a lie to make themselves look better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be very boring. I'm not sure why this book was written. I don't think it's the subject matter that bothers me. I find it to be a very dull book. It really was more of a story than anything else. This book really isn't good for what I'm looking for in a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't remember the plot at all.  It's a book about a guy who has a crush on his cousin and thinks he's pretty good looking.   His cousin is the only one who sees him.  He also has a wife who has no idea about it.  This book was like a movie and didn't live up to the hype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a man who has a lot of money, but is not very good at giving back. He gives a lot to charity, but then has the nerve to not give much back himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The book is written by a man with a PhD in biochemistry and a PhD from a PhD program. The author does not have a PhD. The only thing that he has done is publish a few articles on the internet. He claims that his books are peer reviewed. The first book that I read was by someone who had a PhD, and that is how I knew he had a Phd.  This is a very strange book that tries to use a few anecdotes to create a scientific thesis.  The author writes about how the human body is composed of billions of cells.  His argument is that since the human cells are so small, it is unlikely that any one of them has a specific purpose, or even a purpose at all.  He says that there are more cells in a human head than there are in the entire body.  If you read the whole book, you will come to the conclusion that he is just using his own experiences and conclusions as his evidence.  I am not going to read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of 5 is that I found the ending quite dissatisfying, at least in comparison to the rest of the book.   I was hoping for something more substantial. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only redeeming quality about this book is that it is well-written.   I can't really understand why the book is so bad. There are no "evil" characters, no villains. There is no violence or sex. The sex is in the form of "flirty comments" between the main characters (both of which are in love). The main characters have an interesting, but not particularly "interesting" relationship. The plot is not very interesting, because it is not developed. The author says there are some good bits in it. But the book just isn't good.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really hard to read, but I enjoyed it a lot! The main character is a very interesting one, and the plot is very interesting. The author uses a lot of unusual and clever words to describe things, and is very descriptive in this book. It would be nice to see more of the world, though! I did not understand much about the different cultures in the book, and I am very disappointed that there were no illustrations or maps of them in the actual book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some nice ideas but does not work.   The book is supposed to be a short handbook on computer security.  The author starts off by defining "malware" and "exploit" as "the art of breaking into a system, or a computer system".  He then goes on to describe the different ways that one can use malware.  This is a very good idea, and the author did an excellent job of outlining what these different attacks are and what they can do.  Unfortunately, he then goes into the "how to" section and tries to explain the various ways one can exploit a computer.  He does a good job of presenting the techniques for different malware. However, he does a poor job explaining how one can actually use these techniques to break into a computer (and he doesn't even use a real attack).  I will admit that it is possible to exploit a Windows machine by using a certain type of exploit.  However, the author does not provide a clear definition of this type of attack.  Furthermore, the book does not discuss the many different ways a hacker can use the same type of technique to break in to a computer, such as the use of a password reset exploit. The author then goes onto the how to section and shows some of the different methods one can attempt to break a system.  Again, he makes some good points but then doesn't provide a good explanation of how to use these methods.  Lastly, the section about cracking passwords was poorly written and did not really help the reader to understand the different types of passwords that people use.  Overall, the material is good but does have some problems with how it is presented. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all. The first third of the book is about the life of a typical teenager.   The characters are all   likable.  However,   they are very   shallow.  They are very shallow and not at all realistic.  At first they all  seem to have good lives.  But as the story unfolds   their lives start to unravel.  One of the main characters has a hard time dealing with   the family she has to live with and eventually has to leave.  The other main character   suffers from a personality disorder.  I think these characters would   benefit from a good psychiatrist.  Another thing   that is annoying is that the author does a great job   of making   all of the characters   different.  This is   extremely   distracting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm pretty sure I read this book at a very young age and now find it hard to believe that it ever existed. The protagonist, who is a female and is in love with a boy, is completely unrealistic. I have been a victim of this for the last 3 or 4 years of my life and this book has been a huge part of my "break up" with a girl I once loved. I feel like the main character of this book should have never been allowed to fall in love. I think the author should have at least made her less "crazy" and "insane" but she's not. She's an idiot and I just hate that about her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of the genre.   The genre doesn't have much in it for me.  The only thing I liked about this book was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so wrong. I am not a fan of the book, but the book was written by a woman and is about women in relationships. She makes all these statements about men's lack of sensitivity and women's lack.   I mean, come on, who are these women reading this stuff?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like this book.  The writing is terrible.  They have a bad habit of inserting random quotes from people into the text.  A good book would have the author write about a single event.  It doesn't make sense to me that she would try to tell a story about something that happened to her.  She doesn't talk about it at all.   I was really looking forward to reading about her experiences with the police in her book, but they're all the same:  1.  When the police came they told her she would have to go to a "psychiatric facility."  2.  This is when she finally broke down and confessed to them what she did.  3.  At the hospital she was told she would be put into a psychiatric ward for two months.  4.  I have no idea why she thought the psychiatric ward was a good idea.  5.  All of this came out after she was already in prison for the murder of her boyfriend.  6.  Apparently she was in the psychiatric unit at least 6 months.      The whole time she was going to jail for murder.   (view spoiler)   It's also a pretty generic book.   It's about the same story as any of the other murder/detective novels I've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible and I am really disappointed. The first half is a bit boring and then it goes into a lot of nonsense. The ending is also very unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book.  The characters were really bland and boring.  They all have a way with words and are really funny but the way they write just makes it even worse.  If you want to read something with a good plot that's a good read but not this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I've always liked science fiction but never read one until now. This book was a good introduction to science fiction for me, and the characters were well developed. I think this book would have been better if it was a little longer. It was kind of boring. I found myself wondering what was going to happen next. But for a first book, I think I'll have to re-read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book about the rise and fall of the American empire. But, the author misses the point entirely.   The rise of the US empire and the fall of it were not caused by any single event.  They were the result of a long-term, continuing process.  The empire was the result  of an expansionist economic system.  It was the empire of slave-owners who owned millions of slaves but had no problem with selling the slaves.  Their slaves were the property of the owners.  That is why the abolitionists were so angry about slavery.  Slavery is the same as a system where the masters own the slaves, while the slaves are owned by their masters.  This system had already been around for hundreds of years before America's rise to power.  America's ascent was merely the last gasp of the old system.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on a train. The book is about a man who is looking for a good time. He finds some in the local sex club. He's there for a very short period. I don't think he's even attracted to any of the women there. He gets into the wrong kind of trouble. I'm not sure I would have read the book if I'd known this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most confusing book I've ever read.   I'm not even sure if it is a science book or a fantasy book.  The writing style is very hard to follow and the characters have too much in common. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very interested in reading this book as a child, but when it came out my mom was the one who found it.    She had bought it in the 50's when it was popular and she didn't like the way the words were all twisted and the picture was on the cover too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not read this one.   The writing style is clunky.  It was so long that it's hard to understand anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book because I thought it was going to be the best of the series. I was very wrong. I don't understand how a series can get better than the first book (and the best book in the series) is. I'm a HUGE fan of the other series (the first three books) so I expected this one to be good. Unfortunately, this is the worst book in this series. The plot was predictable and the characters were stupid. I felt like the author wasn't really interested in the story (I have to admit I'm not the most skilled writer) and was more interested in making the reader feel stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very bad book.   The writing is so bad that it makes the book not worth the price.  I could have saved myself the $20 and bought another book,  but I was too busy to waste money on a book that is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a guy who is in the middle of a divorce and has been trying to get back together with his ex. He has been doing a lot of reading about women and the kind of relationships they want to have and the kinds of relationships that don't work out very well. He starts out with an attempt to "make things right" by making her a wife to him. He was doing this by having a relationship with a woman who would make him feel like a man again (he wasn't married at the time). After he gets over the shock of the new relationship, he is very disappointed in himself for not being able to fix things. This book doesn't really have much to say about the actual relationship that ended up failing, but it does have a lot to say in terms of the problems with men who attempt to be women again (and they're not the only ones). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that I always tell my students that they shouldn't waste their time on.  It's a poorly written, uninspired story about an average kid and his friends.  I was so frustrated with it, I read the first few pages to my husband, and then I gave it to him to read to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book.  It is an excellent way to get your feet wet in the subject of human history, and is a fine introduction to historical thinking.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so full of garbage that I can't understand why anybody would ever put this book on a shelf. It has no plot, no characters, no logic, no story, no anything. This is the equivalent of reading a children's book that has been re-written by a teenager who thought it would be funny to get the children to make up the names of every animal in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character of this book is a woman, but it is clear that the author was not interested in creating a realistic female character.  She is not a woman who is able to get what she wants, but a woman that is just a little bit selfish.  It was hard to relate to her, because I think the woman in my life would be the same way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad story that doesn't belong in a "Best of" list. The story is poorly written. It is not funny at all. I found it to be somewhat frustrating as I could not help but smile when the "good guys" were winning. The only good thing about this book is that the ending is kind of nice. I would have rather read another "C.S. Lewis" book, but the writing in this book made me wonder why C.S Lewis ever wrote it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book multiple times, and the most recent time was the last time I tried to get through it.   This book was the first in the series, and I've already made it through the entire book.  It's not a bad series, but the writing is so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that this book is a great read for those who like science fiction and fantasy.   The book is well written, and while it has its share of issues,   the story is entertaining and well told. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I mean, this book is terrible. The plot is pretty generic, and the characters are so stereotypical that it's just not funny. The dialogue is terrible and the story just doesn't have any twists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a classic of the genre and a good book to learn from.   It is difficult to explain why a book is good but this one is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not that good of a book.   The pacing is all over the place.  The characters are all pretty one dimensional.  It has a very interesting premise but the characters just don't come together very well.  I don't know why he doesn't have a more interesting protagonist.  If this book was just about how someone became a thief, I'd love it but I don 't think it's going to be anything like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was horrible. It was filled with lies and deceit, and it did nothing to help the issue. It did nothing but give her another chance at getting a good job after she got fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring and very confusing. I think the author wants us to be so confused that we don't care about the story. It's a very basic book with a very simple plot. It could have been a very good mystery or something, but it's very generic. I really think that if you can understand the basics of a mystery, you can probably solve it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of reviews about this book that said that it is a poor translation and should not be taken seriously.    The author has a lot to learn about translating a book that he doesn't understand.  There is a lot wrong with the translation, but it's hard to see how it could be worse.  For example, the text in the first chapter about the three girls who are in the pool is written in a way that I would be hard pressed to describe as "poor" but is, in fact, perfectly understandable.  The language is also good.  Even the "bad" translation is better than a lot if the bad translation is worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't know this book was based on a movie. I knew it was about a movie but didn't realize it was the same person (Hilary Swank).  I guess that was the only thing that saved this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring and dull. It doesn't have anything original to say, nor does it give us any good advice about how to be happy. It's just a collection of random things that are said by people that have had some experience in the business. If you are into business and are looking for a way to make money in the music business, then you will love this book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that it's so long that you can read it in one sitting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of books with great plots, but this one was just too much.   The story is all about a couple that are married for decades and have two children.  It was great to see the love they have for each other, and then to see them fall in love with a woman who is completely different than they are.  And I had to wonder, why is she different?   It just didn't make sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book.  The story is pretty simple, and it does have some twists.  It also has some great characters.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A waste of time.   I think that the main problem is that the book does not take seriously any of the ideas that are in it, but instead just repeats the same stuff over and over again.  It's like a cross between a movie and a book that has nothing to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is a huge letdown.   In the prologue, I thought it was a great idea to bring in a bunch of new characters in the first act.  Unfortunately, they are completely irrelevant to the story and they never appear again.  Also, I think that they were meant to be introduced to the main cast as a way to introduce more characters to the readers.  This way, it makes sense that they're important to the plot.  But, they were only ever mentioned by name in the context of the plot, so they had no real value.  As a fan of this series, I just felt cheated out of the chance to see more of these characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book but after reading it was a let down because it did not live up to the hype.   I'm an old man who was a part of the first generation to use computers and is still using them. I can't remember the last time I was at a computer that I didn't enjoy at least some part of it. But, I'll never forget the feeling I got reading about how my computer had been hacked by someone who was in the know. And that someone was going to use the information I got from my computer to get me arrested for a crime I didn"t commit. I think the whole thing was a hoax. The person who hacked my computer was not the one who stole my money.   "I was a child of the internet. My parents had it and I didn?"t have it until I was twenty. My father and I were always on the computer. We were both students in college. When I graduated in 1983, I was immediately hired at a big corporation as a programmer for a major corporation. I spent two years there and left in 1986. I then became a programmer in an independent computer company. This company was located on the west coast, but it was only a couple of hours away by train. I always had an interest in computers and wanted to work in the computer field. But I knew it wasn?t going to be a career for me. I had made a lot of money, and I knew I could do a lot better. But when I was hired by the company, it turned out that the person in charge of hiring the people had some sort of computer virus problem that he had no idea how to fix. He said it wasn't going to cost the company anything. So, I took over the job, but I kept my job in the company because I needed the money. I was a good programmer. I even wrote a few programs. Then I got a call from the manager of the company. The manager said the company was going out of business and he needed somebody to help him sell the company on a new system that was being developed. The system that he was talking about was called the "Computer" and was going over to Japan. The company had just signed a contract to sell the new system to Japan and he said that the system would cost them about ten million dollars. They didn?t know if the Japanese would even buy it. So he needed someone who could help them
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a long and boring book. I don't like long books.   The writing is very repetitive and dull.  It does not make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about how a very successful man is so full of himself that he has a lot of problems and a lot that he shouldn't even be having problems about.   The book is not a biography about a very famous person, it is about a person who is trying to be something he isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a great example of how a story can be turned into a bad film with little to no effort by the director.  The film is so bad that the book is an improvement.  This is one of those "no movie is really that bad" books that has little to do with the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was really disappointing. It's like the author is trying to sell it as the "most accurate history" ever, but the most accurate part is that the Nazis never went to war with the UK or USA, and only the USSR did. This book has some interesting information about the war but doesn't really explain the Soviet's contribution to it (the Red Army fought with the British). There's really nothing interesting about the US's involvement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very poor book for a poor audience.   The characters are not developed at all.  This book was more about the story than the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a big fan of both the Harry Potter and the Hunger Games books and movies. So when I heard the author was working on a series based on the Harry Dresden books I was excited. I thought it was going to be a good book, but I was very disappointed. The author seems to be using the Dresden world as his own. It's all about the Dresden family, the villains, and what they do. I really like the Dresden characters and I like the world they live in, but this book really only makes them more of a distraction than a real part of the story. I am not a fan of books that take the same plot and retell it over and over again. That's what this book does. If you are a Dresden fan you will love this book, I'm not a Dresden guy but I'm going to read it anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is well written, the characters are well developed and the plot is interesting and complex. However, the author does not know how to write a story. The plot has a lot of holes. I had a lot more fun reading about the characters. I don't know if I should give this book 3 stars or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the concept of a self help book. It seems to be the idea that self help is about people who do everything in their power to get better. It's not. I can't get better, it's like I'm a robot with no will. I try hard and my body doesn't work. I get fat, I get lazy, I have to exercise to keep my mind working, and my friends don't understand me, so I don a fat suit and go to their house to tell them that they should get rid of their fat suit because it's making me lazy and stupid.  It's a sad thing, and I'm really sick of reading about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's a shame you have to have the whole book to read, because you have a real problem with the ending, which I won't spoil, except to say that the ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth."   No. Not at all. This is a book that needs to be read. The whole book is a good book, with a nice twist at the end. I'm still mulling over it, but I'm already on the lookout for more books by her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was terrible.    I was expecting something like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets but this one was a lot worse.  A young woman is being pursued by a strange old man who is trying to sell her on his story about how he saw her in a past life.  The whole thing was incredibly contrived and really not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author was not very good at explaining how to work with a computer. I was expecting a book that would tell me how to program computers and would have all the answers to my problems. It didn't even give me a step-by-step on how to install a computer and run programs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you can't read a good book, you can certainly get a lot out of this book: a great idea, but bad execution and too many errors to make a good read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on my commute to work. It is very interesting but not very practical. The main premise is that there are a lot of things you can do to be more productive and you can be productive with a lot less.  For example, it was stated that you can make a coffee in the morning, then sit down and watch the news.  I would recommend to try it but I don't do that very often. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a big fan of historical novels, but I found this book extremely interesting and well-written. It is a good reminder of why so many people have been so wrong about the Civil War. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does nothing but make me want to rip my hair out! The characters are ridiculous, the plot is contrived and the characters are obnoxious. The characters have no idea what is happening and no idea why! I would have quit reading if I had read the first half of the book before I started reading this half. This book was horrible and I would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has an awful lot of problems, but one of them is that the authors seem to believe in the infallibility of the Holy Scriptures. This is an unfortunate situation. If a person is trying to come to terms with his or her own sexuality, or a young person who is questioning their sexual identity, or an older person whose sexuality is changing, or any person struggling with any kind of sexual attraction or orientation, the best advice is to just take a chance on God. God has been a reliable guide to my faith over the years. And it seems to me that there's a good chance that he will be a reliable ally for a Christian who is seeking to come out of the closet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit of a dud. It has been written before, but the material is so similar to the book that comes out today that it is no wonder it is not the same book.  It is about a young couple and their children.  This is one of the few books in the world that I would put in a children's or young adult section.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I mean this book is a total waste of time. It is an encyclopedia with a hundred different articles about every type of human disease imaginable and how they are treated, but none of them relate to the real world, or the way we treat patients today.  It was interesting to read about the medical school that has made the most money off of this disease, but the real problem is that the cure has been developed for it and it is in a vogue to treat it by making people live longer.  And that is a horrible thing to say about a book that is clearly written for the medical industry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that I really, really wanted to like this book. I really do love reading, and I'm very much a fan of historical fiction. But even though I'm a big fan of the genre, the books I've read by these authors just aren't really that interesting. They don't really get down to the heart of the matter in a way that makes me want to understand them. Even though they're fictional, it's easy to just read the book and not care at all about what the authors actually think. This book is just a bunch of boring, over-the-top quotes from people who think that it's perfectly fine to make up stuff about what happened to them when they were kids. I don't think that these books really make that much of a difference in people's lives, but I think that they're probably more interesting for people who just want to read about people who are super rich and have all the best toys and fancy houses.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a few years ago and I was hoping that it would have more substance than a few paragraphs about how bad the book is.  The main character is not an interesting character.  He's not very likable.  I wish I could write better characters but that is just a matter of experience.  It's also kind of silly how he is constantly being told that he has to change and he doesn't listen to anyone but his wife.  This is the kind of book that's best read by a parent or a spouse who has problems with their spouse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess. The characters are completely unsympathetic, the plot is confusing, the writing is poor, and the ending is lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a big fat lie.   The author is a professional writer and he tries to use his own life to support his book. He describes himself as a "foolish young man" who lived a "sad and lonely life" that consisted of "losing his virginity" (no, really), getting a job in a bank, falling in love, getting a divorce, being a single father and raising a son alone.   The author's story is very well written but the author is too lazy to use the facts he has. For instance, I read the book and I was surprised by a few things. First, the author says that he has a good job at the bank but the fact is he is still living at home with his mother and the bank pays for his mom to live there. He also says he is single but he is not, he is in a long term relationship with a woman he met through the church. He doesn't use his wife at all. The only thing he says about his son is he does not want to have him "born into a family" and he talks about his daughter like he wants to be a better father than his father. I also found it interesting that he mentions how he was not allowed to talk about his mother at all and I thought about how I used to talk a lot about my mother in the past but that was until I got married.   I really didn't like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book so much. I got the free ebook version on my e-reader and read it in a day. I would give it 5 stars if the author was willing to be paid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad book. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say that I have read much good fantasy but that the characters are dull and boring. This book was about a young man that had a dream about an elf and the only thing that he had to do was kill a human. This was a little hard to follow as I don't get it but there were hints of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is a writer who should know better and is trying to make his books sound good.  He knows how to create characters, but I don't like the characters at all.  The ending was very unsatisfying.  I thought that the author should have left it a bit more open-ended or the reader could have been a little more creative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts off with a description of a woman who was involved in a terrible accident. She was thrown through a wall and had a broken leg.   It is obvious that the author is making a point that women should not drive as a matter of personal safety, which is the main reason why I don't drive.  A woman should not have to pay for the repairs of her car when it breaks because a man is supposed to do it.  However, I also find it funny that a woman could be such a good driver that she gets away with being in a bad accident. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and poorly organized. There are many instances where there is no connection between the characters and events. They all speak about the same thing in different ways. They never seem to find out why the characters do the things they do, but they keep going on about the things the characters did do, and how those things would make the story better.   There were some nice touches in the book, such as a little description of the setting, but I have a hard time seeing those things making up for the fact that most of the book was wasted on useless dialogue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but it is full of contradictions. It tells a great story, but at the end of the day, it makes a mockery of the human experience. I liked the book, and I liked this author's style, but as a whole, it's a disservice to the reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The ending is very unsatisfying and is a very short novel. I had been hoping that it would be a novel of some length, but it's a short book, so I won't be reading it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book. I'm a huge fan of science fiction, and was excited to read a book about space travel.  I had high hopes for this book, but it ended up being another disappointment.  It's too long to be worth the time, and doesn't have enough depth or depth to be worthwhile.  There is so much wrong with this novel that I'm shocked they didn't cut it out.  The author should have realized this, and have cut the story down a bit.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been reviewed before in the book club and it is the same story: the story is about a girl with an eating disorder and it was never really developed. The ending where the girl eats her mother's liver to survive is just a horrible ending to the story. I can only imagine the amount of self loathing that goes on inside of a person with this condition. I think this book should be banned. I would be more sympathetic to the girl if she had just died.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book. I think there is nothing to recommend it. The story is poor and the author has not improved over the years.  I don't think there was anything interesting in the book that anyone would want to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just so disappointing I didn't even want to finish it. The writing is so bad it is almost as if she wrote this herself. She had to make her story sound real.    I would have preferred a nonfiction book about her life instead of a fiction book about herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so long and so full of false information that it is hard to tell what is true and what is just a waste of time. I'm still trying to understand the difference between a male and female heart and it is difficult to see that in this book. I found the whole concept of female heart disease to be very misleading. For one thing, it seems that female heart attacks are more common than they actually are. I have always read that there is a significant difference between men and women in their susceptibility to heart disease, but that is not true. Men are not at higher risk for heart attacks, although they are at higher risks for dying from heart disease as well. Also, there is no evidence that women who are taking estrogen are more prone to heart attack and they are not more likely to have a heart attack than men who are not taking estrogen. The best evidence that estrogen makes women more susceptible to heart attacks is a study that found that women taking estrogen therapy were more likely than women not taking the therapy to develop heart attacks during a 10 year period. I suspect that this study was a fluke. It was done on people who had heart attacks but were not taking hormone therapy, so I am not sure what to make of it. I can't imagine why it would be better for a woman to have heart disease if she is taking estrogen than for a man. The other thing that is confusing is that this book is written by a female. I think it would have been better if it had been written by male researchers. I would like to see a study where both sexes are compared on their susceptibility and death rates from heart attack. I was disappointed that this information was not included in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I learned from this book is that the world is a horrible place and that life is really stupid. The world has a much higher rate of murder than the one I live in but it is still a terrible place and people will be miserable forever. This book is an interesting look into the life of a guy who has a lot of interesting things going on but I am just going to move on with my life and never read this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible, I read it on the train in the dark after a long day of work. I am glad that I read this in the car.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi. This book sucked. It was an attempt at fantasy, but it wasn't very good. The only good thing about the book was the cover, and the good reviews. I wouldn't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on the premise that it is a good, straightforward biography of a very important person.   This was not so.  As a first book, it was a let down.  The author claims that the man he portrays is a decent person, but that his moral compass is clouded by his own ego.  In fact, he is a despicable person.     In addition to his many crimes against humanity,   he is also a rapist, child molester, liar, and drug addict.  His entire life is a tale of deception, betrayal, and murder.  I have to wonder what the purpose of the book was.  Why was the author writing about this man in the first place?  It was just another "celebrity" biography.  8/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked it a lot.  It's a well written book.  However,  The story about the two men who have the same dream,  and how they both try to find a way to accomplish it is not at all interesting.  If I were in his shoes I would have thought of the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a "dumb blonde" who lives with her family in a house made of bricks. It is about her family's life: her father is an alcoholic, her mother is a bad cook, and the husband of one of her sisters is a jerk. The book is interesting in that it has no bad characters (it has the most interesting characters), but there is nothing to write home about. This book has nothing to do with being a person of color.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of terrible information. There is absolutely no information on how to properly and safely use a camera. There are a few good tips in this book, but they are not good enough to outweigh the rest of the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so terrible, I had to get it off my shelf and read it again to make sure it wasn't my bad copy that I got at a yard sale.  The writing is horrible and is full of grammar and spelling errors, and it takes a while to get through the entire thing.  I just finished reading the book and can't get over how bad the writing is.  It's just so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked the story, but it was very repetitive, and didn't have a plot.  The only way I could think of to make it interesting would be if there was a plot or a big reason why he would do this, but there wasn't.  I didn't even care about his character development because I didn`t care about any of the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book based on a rave review from a friend. I've been looking for a good read about a family with a disability. I thought I had found one. The book is about the loss of a father and the impact that has on his wife. The author seems to be using the story of her father to explain a lot of what she's going through. She's an interesting person. I'd read a few books about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book I am most likely to give a bad review to.  It is a poorly written book that seems to have been written by a kid who is bored and looking for a challenge.  As a writer, I don't feel that there is a lot of substance in the book.  I think the main theme of the book is that one has to be very careful in how one uses a computer.  In other words, kids should be careful what they type on their computer.   This is a great way to show how people misuse technology and how important it is to be careful with what you type on a computer because it could get you in trouble.   I don't understand why anyone would want to read this book but I guess they do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book after finishing it in a good mood. The problem is that the author doesn't know how to write a good story and doesn't give any thought to his story. The characters are just two dimensional and the story is repetitive. There are only a couple of pages of action.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written by a man who has never seen a real-life vampire, so when he read about them in the Bible he had to be pretty impressed.   I had the same feeling.  I can't stand vampires.  This is a boring book.  The author does a good job of making the reader feel the vampire's feelings, but the book is not interesting enough to make it interesting to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The reason this book is a failure is that it is not a real history. The authors make a great effort to be objective about the war, but that effort is undercut by a biased tone. There are two major sources for the war - the memoirs of Generals Patton and Eisenhower, and the official history by Arthur Schlesinger. The memoirs are good enough, but they are biased toward the good guys, and they don't present enough of the bad guys. The official history is also biased, but in a much more balanced way. It gives more credit to the French, and to the Russians, but also to the British and to some Germans.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst I have ever read. There are too many problems to list, but the most egregious ones: - the author uses the term "dumb blonde" to describe her, and it's so overused it makes me feel like a dolt - there is absolutely no real plot or characters, just a series of random events - there's no characterization at all for any of the characters, even if they're characters we don't like - the book is so long that it's not even clear why the author is writing it in the first place - the only reason why I can put it down and finish it is because I'm so tired of being told that "the world is getting better" while my family and friends are dying (and the authors of this book are still alive!)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you haven't read this book by now, don't read it   I'm not a fan of the Star Trek   franchise,   but this book is a mess   It's just so boring      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in a few days after reading The Great Gatsby. The writing is just awful.  It's like a bad movie or a bad tv show, but worse.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping to be blown away by this book. But this book is so terrible that I didn't get blown away at all.   It has a bunch of great advice on a ton of different subjects but in the end, the advice is completely pointless.  In the first chapter, a woman who is suffering from a disease that is causing her to have uncontrollable orgasms writes about how her orgasms were the only way to get through an illness that made her physically ill.  The rest of the book is basically her describing her experience of trying to get a guy to touch her (which he said he'd do but he never did)   This is the most interesting part of the chapter.  This advice is a complete waste of time.  If a woman can't get her hands on a man, then she has to find another way to find a man to touch.  And she did that by reading a book.  I mean seriously, I don't know how to get into a relationship if a guy won't touch me.  She was able to find the book by using a google search.  That's how bad this book was.  There were a lot of things in this book that I knew I should do but didn't because I was too busy worrying about the disease that makes me orgasm uncontrollably. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by a person who is clearly an ignorant and arrogant asshole.    The story he told was a lot like a bad movie:   A little girl gets her hands on a book about magic and a little boy who doesn't like it (he's a little nerd) wants it.  He doesn't have any magic powers and doesn't need a book.  The book was very boring and I was bored out of my mind from the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this to be a poor read.   This is not a good book.  This book is about how a girl gets a little attention from the guy that she likes.  She goes out and tries to get some of his attention.  Unfortunately, she gets it.  It's so cliché and so annoying.  The guy she likes likes her back.  He's kind of creepy and it's so weird.  And then when they go to the prom together, it turns into a nightmare.  I can't imagine what would have happened if I had read this in school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a good example of the dangers of reading a lot about a subject you have no interest in and that has very little to do with you. The author spends a lot of time trying to convince us that the war was about oil (despite all the evidence to the contrary) and then proceeds to spend a huge amount of time describing the military's ridiculous use of napalm. The most ridiculous of these is the fact that napalm is supposed to burn for about 3 minutes but the US used it to burn a whole town down in one fell swoop. The main reason for this is that the US was using napalm for a much more sinister purpose, namely destroying the morale of the Japanese military. The real reason, as the US admits, was to keep them from fighting back against the invasion. The book ends by saying that a war against the Japanese is not necessary because the US could easily win the war with a few planes and the fact is that they haven't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have ever read.   It is filled with boring plot points, confusing ideas, and the characters are very flat.  I would never recommend this book to anyone who has not read it or doesn't have any interest in science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so eager to get my hands on the new version of a classic that I bought a new copy on the day of the release. The book was just a waste of money. It didn't even include a new introduction by the author, and the only thing he included was a few more notes on some of the more technical parts of the original text.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed by this book, mostly because I was looking forward to it.  I think I will read another book from the author (or someone else who uses the pseudonym) but I am still annoyed by the book.  The author does a good job of presenting the events of the last 10 years and the subsequent events since the first book, but it was not enough to make me feel like I was there.  This book is not only about the people in the "crowd", it is also about the events that happen within the crowd.   I will be reading the other books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't want to have a book that will always be there in my head.   The book is fun, and you do get a good laugh out of it, but the last page is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was advertised as "for those of us who love the classics." Unfortunately, it's not. This book is not about the classics. It's not about great works of literature, but rather it's about a guy who reads a lot of classic literature, so he's a bit of a classic himself. The story is a bit too simple. It seems to be about a young woman who has a "problem" and her relationship with a famous poet.  In order to fix the problem, she decides to go to his apartment and get a job in the same place, so that they can share a bed.  This is all I can say about this book: it's so bad it's good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in a book club. The topic is a little difficult for me as I am a religious person. I am not sure that I will agree with the author's conclusions or that he is right. The book also seems to be about the use of prayer by people to solve problems. However, there are some things that I did not agree with. I was looking for a book about people who believe in God, and this was not it. It seemed like the author was trying to prove that there was no God. I just thought it was too long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I gave this book a 3 was because I was expecting a really good story about a young girl learning to deal with an abusive father.   I got a story about how to be a good friend and a good daughter.  I don't really know what to make of that, it is a bit of a disappointment, but I think that is what happens when you are a kid, you try to do everything yourself and you don't know how. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of the book should have been "Why did I buy this book: A book that gives you information about a good game."   There is a lot of information in this book.   It is about the history of the game.  The rules are very simple and the play is very simple.  It has a lot going for it.  But   it is a pretty shallow history.      This book is about a game that started in the mid to late 1800's.  This game was invented by two guys who had no real business to play in a game of this nature.  There was a lot about the game that was unknown to the public.  I know because I was the one who wrote it up for the internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible attempt to make a story that would have been so much better if it were written by an actual person. The book does a lot of things well but none of them are actually true.  The story is completely made up.  It's not a good attempt at a story and it's not even the sort of thing that could be done in a book.  I didn't even like the story that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the history of the German Nazi Party that is a complete waste of time and space is a good example of why people don't read history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad.  There is nothing here to hold the reader's interest and most of the characters are dull.   It was a lot of work for the author to try to write a good novel.  I think the book should have been written a lot earlier.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst book I have ever read. I don't understand why they made the characters so stupid and not just one person. I was reading the book and I couldn't get into it. I didn't want to. I read it twice because I couldn a t think of anything funny about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man who lives on a mountain and writes books about the people he meets. He has one hell of a time making them and I had a hard time following it.   It is very good if you're looking for a laugh but there is no character development or plot to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just an extremely bad book about a very bad guy.   It is written by a lawyer, who has a great talent for writing about his clients and their lawyers and their attorneys.  It should not be that hard to write about a client and his or her attorney, but   it is very hard.  The writing is a bit of a drag.  This book is just another attempt by  a lawyer to get some money out of you.  And then he writes a book about you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never been a fan of urban fantasy (which is what I'm reviewing) and the writing is pretty cliche and unrealistic.   The main character is a total bitch to the other characters.  I felt that the world building was pretty poor as well.  It would have been nice to see the world more expanded on as a whole instead of being put in a small city. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was hard to put the book down. I felt the need to get it out, and it was the most frustrating book I've ever read.  The author makes a big deal about the difference between fiction and nonfiction, but then uses the same tactics as a writer trying to make a nonfiction book into fiction.  It's so confusing that I'm wondering if he was just trying to show how nonfiction writers can be just as stupid as fiction writers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book. I liked the first three books in the series but I found the fourth to be extremely cliche. There is nothing original in the book.  It is simply a collection of fairy tales that has been recycled many times before.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because it was being reviewed in a book club. The book had the same basic problem as The Girl on the Train, that it was full of clichés and cliches, and I am not sure what made it interesting. The only reason I was willing to read it was that it had been recommended to me by a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so wrong.  It is so completely, utterly, irredeemably wrong.      The basic premise is that when the Earth goes through an asteroid belt collision in the distant past, it formed a new planet.  But the whole point is that it is "impossible" to get a new life form out of the old.  This has been studied so many times that it has become a trope.  If you're a serious scientist, this book is not going to make you want to pick up your physics textbook.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the idea of being able to use the magic of the internet to create a magic portal that allows anyone in the world to be in the same room as me. I have used it several times and have been totally amazed by the results. But I have never actually been in the room with the person that was supposed to be there. And even when I've been there, I've had to use magic to get out again.   In this book, the author seems to think that people in the modern world don't have the patience for that sort of thing. Instead, he is going to give the reader the ability to use that portal in his home. But, he doesn't give the user a very clear idea of how to actually use the portal or where to find a portal. If he really wanted to be helpful, he should have given a more detailed explanation of what is needed to actually be able to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really did not enjoy this book.   It's basically the story of how I got into a fight and then ended up in a mental hospital with a bad head injury, but I didn't care about any of that.  I hated the author's personality, his writing style, the fact that he didn't like how the world worked (it was very much like his own personal reality), the way he had this crazy idea that he could just be the author he wanted to be...  ...and the way I got caught up in his delusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most boring book I have ever read.   I am an engineer, I do not care about physics at all.  This book is all about chemistry, how things work.  I got bored reading about the various types of acids.  All the information is good, but the story is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very boring book. The whole time, I thought, "Oh my God. This is the first book I've read in which the protagonist was a girl."   And then I realized it was the first chapter.   I've always liked the characters in books about girl adventures, but the writing in this book was too repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is just as terrible as the reviews say. I had to read it twice just to make sure I was reading a legitimate, non-fiction book. If I were to read anything more than a couple of paragraphs about the subject I was studying, I would have a lot of trouble with it. I have a real hard time with any kind of non-fictional literature. The author's style is very literary and well written. The problem I have with the book is the narrator. She is very uneducated and I felt a lot more sympathy for her in the beginning than the author. I also felt that she was the one that the author was trying to portray as having been "fooled" by a professor. I guess I should have read it in the first place. It really seems like the author wants to use her as a narrator to give a better explanation about how it all works and why there is such a big difference between a liberal arts and a professional one. She doesn't even really know how to do her own homework. It seems like a waste of time to have a character that knows so little about such a complicated subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of bad writing and awful characters.   The plot is weak, the characters are shallow and there is no real development or development of the story line.  I think I may have read this book as an early teenager so I have been reading more fantasy and science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a great story, and a great read, but it's really only a short story. It's very long, and is very heavy.   The only thing I really liked about it was that I was able to learn a lot about the story from the author, but as a result of this I didn't like the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would say that this book is bad, but not as bad as   a lot of books I have read in the last several years.   The writing style   is very   predictable,   but the subject matter is   a bit   off.  It would be nice   if there was more of a difference between the   first   and the third   part   of the story, because   the second part is a lot more interesting   than the first .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a college sophomore in the early 80's.   It was in a course that discussed the literature of race.  The professor's presentation was not bad, but there was a major flaw in his presentation.  He claimed that African-Americans were very "violent" (as if there is anything wrong with that) and that the "Black Power" movement was all about that.  I thought the whole thing was ridiculous.  The only black "violentness" in my book was the one I had seen at the airport when I was trying to fly back to New York. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that made me realize I need a life. I have a horrible history with reading. When I was a kid, I'd go to the library to get a book to read. The books I liked (like the Twilight series) were so dry and boring, I couldn't wait to get out of there. I think my favorite book ever was Harry Potter because it was fun and filled with interesting characters. I still have it on my nightstand, and when I'm feeling a bit down, I turn to it and just cry about what a terrible person I am for not reading it.   That said, I was glad that I finally decided to go back to a real library, to my local public library, and pick up a good book. The cover of this book is great and the story is pretty interesting. The book does have a bit of an anti-climax, but I was happy to see that there were other people in the story that I can relate to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the original series, but the sequels are all very cliched and lame.  The books have a very long, drawn-out and dull plot that involves one character, her family, and a mysterious being called a "ghost" and is so ridiculously over the top and ridiculous that it's impossible to care about anything that happens in it.  It's a complete rip-off of the TV show "The X-Files" and I can't wait to see it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book is terrible. I didn't really get into the book but I did think it was boring and made up of too many clichés. It's not a bad novel but I would have much preferred something more creative and interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a shame that there is no good, non-biographical, nonreligious biography of Jesus that I know of. I know that many people think the Gospels are a fiction, but I think they are not. Jesus the man was a fascinating man. I read a biography of Mark Twain that said he was a great novelist. Mark Twain is not a great writer. I thought it was very odd that the best writer of the day had no idea how to write a novel. I did not know that Twain had written only about a year's worth of material. He was a very prolific writer, but had no novel written yet. He said he never even had time to write. It is interesting that in Twain's case, his autobiography is full of inaccuracies. I found a lot of that to be amusing, but not worth much. It was not a problem to me because my faith has been so strong since I was a little boy that it is very easy for me to forgive those who have lied about me. The book is a little dry. The author talks about many different aspects of the Jesus story, but never gives a complete picture of what actually happened. He never talks about what the women who said they saw him did, and what their testimony actually said. He does not mention that Mary Magdalene was in the house when Jesus died. In addition, I was disappointed by how he treated the early church leaders. The story of Peter and the stone is just an embellishment of an already well known story. He also gives us a few other things that are false. The Gospels did not begin to be written until about 60 A.D. The authors were not all eyewitnesses, so the accounts are not all true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did enjoy this book, and liked that it included a lot of information about the people in the book. However, after reading this book I was more upset with the people that she mentioned, than with the actual content of the book that she used in the plot. She used the phrase "they were very nice" and said that the person was very nice. I have never met a person that I felt was nice. They are rude and arrogant.  I had an interview with them and they told me what I should say when they were interviewing me.    This book is a good way to get information about how to make a living, but they don't know what they are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't expect much from a book about a religious leader, and even less from a religious book about one who's a bigamist. The whole book is an exercise in futility. The author does little to challenge the arguments of the author of The Secret, who had the same goal in mind (that is, marrying a younger woman), but was unable to convince her to stop. The book doesn't explain why this happened or what caused it to stop, or what she will do next.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not have a good ending. It is an interesting book, though, and I'd like to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really just a collection of bad jokes.  It's just a bunch of jokes that don't really go anywhere.  The stories are just too bad to make me laugh.  I don't know what it's trying to accomplish with this collection of jokes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, it was great. But I hate that it was a bad novel that had to be retold as a children's book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was not very good and I could not understand any of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be incredibly dull. It is a story about a boy named Chris who has a brother named Jack who's in a mental institution. Chris and Jack are both orphans, and the father of Chris' brother Jack was in the military and has PTSD.   Chris is an odd character. He is always complaining about something.  He is in and out of trouble at school.  Chris and his brother Jack both have the same father.  They also have the exact same father's name.  When Chris goes to visit Jack in the mental hospital Chris starts getting upset because Jack has a boyfriend.  After Chris leaves the hospital, Jack says that his father has died and that he is sad.  I don't know how I can read a story like this and not get depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason why I can't like this book is the fact that the main characters are so poorly written. I was so disgusted by this book that I wanted to kill this stupid girl and her friends (who were stupid too) and my husband would have to look after them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an utter disappointment. The story itself was okay. The writing was ok. The characters were not memorable. The plot was predictable and boring. The author does a poor job of making his characters likable or interesting, despite his attempt. It is not a bad read but it is a poor book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is really not that good. It is mostly just about the author's life experiences and his views about the world.   It would be great if this book would just tell you about the experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm soooooo tired of this book.  The first 20 pages are so boring, and then the author goes into an extended discussion about how he hates the "glamorisation" of the military.    The whole point of the book is that you don't know anything about your family, and you don´t care. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster and the author should be ashamed. He is writing for the most part about the Vietnam War and how it is portrayed in the book "The Other Side of Glory". The author takes this war and makes it into a tale of the end times and the end of days. The Vietnam War was a horrible war, but it was not the end time as the author has made it out to be. The author has failed to explain the reasons why the war continued for so long. The ending of the war is far more complicated than the author makes it out. In reality, the war was over in 1972 when it was agreed to end it in 1975. The US is still the world's number one military power and still has its eyes set on the Middle East. The American military is so big that it can have the best of both worlds. It can be both a superpower and a military empire. This war is a symptom of that. The book "the other side of glory" is also a horrible book. The main character is an American who was part of the Vietnam conflict. His wife is a Vietnamese. She is a survivor and is very sympathetic towards the Vietnamese and the Americans. This is a great example of how people can have two different viewpoints on something. One person sees it as the end and the other sees it the same way as the Vietnamese. I guess I was one of the Vietnamese survivors, but I still can't see it the way the author did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be just about the worst book I have ever read. It was so poorly written, and it was filled with all kinds of weird and crazy stuff, that it's hard to believe that this author has ever written a good book. There was no way I could read this book, it was just so bizarre and so wrong. I would recommend it only to people who are willing to buy this weird book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's soooooo   sooooo   wrong,   and   I was   hoping   it   would   work   on   me   but   nope   didn't   do   a  thing  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that I have been looking forward to reading for a while now. It is a classic work on a particular aspect of the political situation in Europe, and it has been written by one of the most respected political analysts today, a good friend and a fellow journalist.   It is also an excellent book, which I hope is read by a number of people, including myself.  I have to admit that I found it difficult to follow a particular portion of the book.  It seemed that he was giving the same kind of analysis about various European political leaders that I am used to hearing from other people: the old and the new, the left and the right.  The book is also good at explaining the complexity of the problems, which is why it will appeal to a wide audience, including those who don't know much about European politics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have no problem with being a young adult. I'm not old enough to have the responsibility, but I have plenty of responsibility myself. So I have a bit of a problem with this book. It's really not very good. The first half is great, and the second half is a disaster. The plot was fine, and I liked that there was a villain in the book. But when he comes on, the entire story falls apart. I can't think of any good way to write him except to have him be an asshole. He's not the best villain in a book, but the story falls so short of being good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very happy when I found out this book was about an author who has made her name on the internet. I have read a few other self-help books but never with such a focus on making the reader a better person. The author is a very good writer, though I do not know her by name. She does have a lot to say about how she's been mistreated and her life has been very good. The book is very easy to read and easy to follow.  The book makes good points but not always in the best way.  I think she's not giving the reader good advice if she's saying to "stop doing it that way" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written in a way that makes it hard to believe that this is not a real book.   This book is about a person who has a very real problem with a certain type of person who does not seem to take him seriously.  I understand that a person might want to have a good relationship with a bad person, but the person is a loser, so that doesn't really apply. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.   The author is trying to say that there are no good or bad characters in a story and that the characters must be "perfect".   When that is the case, the story is boring and the characters are useless.  I don't know if I agree with the author or not, but this book makes me hate him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been working on a project that requires me to write a book about the Holocaust. In this book, a reviewer is given a chance to talk about the history of the Holocaust but is forced to go back to the very beginning to get the actual story. This book is terrible. I was forced to read the book in my free time in order to do my job. I feel like I wasted my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible read, with terrible characterizations.  The story is just as dull as the story told in the book itself.  I wish I had spent more time with the characters, instead of being sucked in by the plot.   1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read. It's a bad story, badly told, and badly done.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when it was first published in 1980, and it was the first time I'd ever seen a painting with an object attached to it. As a result, I was extremely skeptical of the idea of the "thing in the painting". I still am. As far as the painting itself is concerned, it's a bad painting. It's a horrible copy of an amazing piece by Jules Paul. It has a flat color, and the subject is just... a plain thing. It just... doesn't belong. I have to admit that I was very pleased when I finally found a copy of the painting and saw the original. It is a wonderful painting and is one of my favorites.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book until I saw the cover.    A female warrior with no clothes.  This is the type of book I get when I'm at a bookstore but it doesn't fit my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't care for this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of historical fiction, but not because I found it interesting.  It's the story line that I don't get.   The narrator is a fictional character, and so she can't be a real person.  Her husband is a real man, but the man in her head can't handle his own sexuality.  That's not to say that there aren't interesting things about her husband, but I don a bit disappointed that she had to invent a story about him to explain his homosexuality.  The whole thing just seems like a poor excuse for a book to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The whole book is about one man's obsession with the "mystery of the death" of a young woman. He's so convinced that she was murdered by her lover, that he thinks about her every day, sometimes even before going to work. Then he dies from a heart attack and wakes up in a weird bed in the hospital. The book is very dull and poorly written. The story of a guy who's obsessed with the mystery of a dead girlfriend is the most boring and uninteresting plot ever.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my daughter to read. I read the first half and felt it was a little rushed, and I felt like the writing was not as good as it could be. The second half of the book, while interesting, felt a bit rushed as well. It felt like a rehash of previous information.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't like this book. I don't think it's a good book. It's just not what I was expecting. The premise is that the main character is a young boy who, while trying to protect his pet, gets a little bit more than he bargained for. The problem is, this is not what a pet is supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that should not have been written. It's written in a very bad style.   The book is written in the first person.  The author starts off by telling us how great it was to meet his parents, how he's been studying psychology since he was a little boy and he can remember "how it felt to walk through a minefield with a pack on my back."   Then he tells us how he is going to do it.      I am not sure what he means by "walk through a Minefield."    What he meant is to run around in the woods with his pack on.  If he was really going to "walk thru a mine field" he would have taken his dog along.  I'm guessing he was just trying to sound smart.  It would have been more difficult for a pack to walk thru a forest.  But even if he had taken his pack, he would be walking in the dark.  A flashlight would have helped.  He tells us that he is a good student and a good worker.  Is that true?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of my time. I read it on the plane to New York City. I just couldn't get into it. I thought I had already read about every topic covered in the book (and I did) so I didn't think I would have any problems with it.  The only thing I liked about it was the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time, and is so bad that it's embarrassing. This book would be a great book if the author were actually a scientist. Instead, she has written a book that is so uneducated and stupid, that you wonder if she even has a science background at all.  This book is so full of bad information, that it is really a pity that she even wrote this book.  She says she's going to use this information to make money by selling products that have been found in the water of the area where she found the dinosaur bones.  I hope she doesn't think the public will buy these products because of the information she's provided. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in the first person, with the character's point of view.  It's very difficult to read.  The plot is quite interesting, and I was really surprised at how well it was done, but it's a bit boring.  Also, the characters are so annoying.  I have no idea how they think they're so special.  In the end, the book ends up being more of a fanfic.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most expensive book I have ever bought.   I spent nearly $500 on a hardback book about a girl who runs around a city in a minivan.  This book is about a poor white woman who gets a job at a fast food restaurant but ends up being poor at fast food too.  It's just a horrible story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. I got it for Christmas, but it's still in the wrapping. I thought it was going to be about a man who was an undercover cop. But instead it's a really good book about a woman who was a cop. It's funny. It gets at the whole concept of the "woman in black" as an antiheroine, but at the same time it's very realistic about what it's like to be a woman in law enforcement. I don't really have a lot of other suggestions for books that are like this, but they are so different from one another I can't recommend them both.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of the word:  The author's voice is so flat that it becomes annoying to read.   I'm glad he is going to make a career of writing about the evils of the police, but I can't imagine he'll have a very lucrative one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good story, but I can't understand why a person would read this book and not be able to see the parallels with my life. My husband has a lot of anger problems and was in jail for a year and a half after an arrest for assault. When he was released he told me he had been given a good deal to make a deal.  I was in my 20's when I went to jail for the same thing and I was also given a lot to make the deal. I can honestly say this book helped me realize that this was how I would be treated as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about a woman that can't make her own decisions.   She is not very smart or intelligent.  She lives with her mother and a brother who is in prison for murder.  I think that she is a bit of a slob.  Her brother doesn't seem to care about her much.  Also she has a brother in prison,   he has done time and she has not done.  It is very depressing and there are very few happy endings. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't care how much the author was paid. This book is a waste of time. I am going to use it as a reference until my teacher can find something better.  8 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess. It is filled with inaccuracies, poor writing and bad ideas. I had a hard time finding anything in this book that actually has a point. The author says that the "buzz" in the air is due to people wanting to "make money" but she makes it clear that she doesn't know anything about the industry and the people she interviews have no real business or income. She talks about how much money people make from writing and it just doesn't seem to add up. It sounds like she went to a few of the major writers she interviewed and they gave her the same information that she is talking about in this. She is clearly not an insider and has a hard on for her own business but I just don't buy it. She even talks about her husband wanting her to be a writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm really disappointed with this book. This book is about the first time a female member of my church lost her testimony, but I think that's a poor description. I think she lost her faith because of a number of things: The fact that her husband was unfaithful to her; her relationship with her father, who was a member of the church for years; and her mother-in-law, who had a bad reputation. I also think it was because of the fact that she had a daughter, who wasn't as committed to her faith. She was not as religious as her daughter was.   But the worst thing about it was that she was very sick at the time. I'm sure that wasn't the only reason she lost faith. But I just think that was a major factor in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a sense, this book is a love letter to books.   It is a longish book about a woman who is not happy with her life.  It's a love story about a book and how it can save a woman's life. The book is told in a first person, as if the author were in the audience.  The woman doesn't like the book but wants it because it gives her advice about how to be happy.  She can't read or write but is willing to try.  There is a scene about a library book about how people should not take their lives into their own hands.  That scene is really sad because it's not how it should be, especially for a woman.  So, the woman takes the book to a library and starts reading it.  I'm not sure if I want to read it but I'm sure it's a good read.  (I don't know what a library is but it sounds interesting.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, and have heard many people rave about it, but I am sad that I won't get to read it as a child, as it was so funny.   This book is the book that was the inspiration for the movie "Scary Movie",   but the movie didn't have a real scare scene or scare-like sounds. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some good bits and some bad bits.   The bad bits are pretty awful and I think I will never, ever look at a spider in the same way again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not worth the money it costs.  It was more of a quick read than a detailed examination of the subject.  This is a "quickie" book for students to get a feel for what is going on in the military and civilian police.  The information is not relevant to the real world.  I was disappointed that I did not get more out of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good read, but it could have been better if the story had been more engaging.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible.  I got it for my 13th birthday.  It is basically a biography of a famous poet.  The author makes it sound like this was a real book.  No such luck.    The poet in question was   Thomas B. Costain, who wrote the following poem:  "I saw a great black bear once, And I asked the bear what he meant by'my love is sweet." He looked at me like I was an idiot. 'I mean, you know, That there's no such thing as love As the poet says.' "      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only problem I had with the book was that it was too long.  It was hard to get through.  The pacing could have been better, too.  There were a lot of "what ifs" about the ending.  I thought the characters were really fleshed out and it would be interesting to see how their relationship would work out in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand how people can read a book like this and still not enjoy it.  It's like watching a video of a kid doing a bad impression of a cartoon character.  There is nothing original about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. It is so wordy that I couldn't follow the plot at all, and there are so many random characters that it was hard to get to know them. It would have been better if the author had given them the chance to explain themselves to the reader instead of just dropping them in my face.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that I was looking forward to reading. It has all the necessary ingredients to make a good fantasy novel: strong, compelling characters, lots of action, a good mystery, a strong plot. But unfortunately, it's just not good at any of those things. The main characters are all terrible. The villain is so unsympathetic that I wanted to smack him. The plot is so bad that it's basically impossible to follow. And the author's tendency to make all the characters look like assholes is just really annoying.   I'm a bit disappointed that this didn't turn out to be a terrible series, but I'll give it a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's one of those books where the authors were too lazy to write a proper introduction. They just go into the book without really explaining why they think it is so bad.   The problem with this book is that it has no real point. It has no story. It doesn't have any characters.  There is no plot.  It has absolutely no suspense.  The book is so predictable it is boring.  I've read so many reviews of this book saying it is one of the worst horror novels ever and that it makes the audience think about what they are eating.  Those reviews are completely wrong.  This book is the opposite.  To anyone who likes a good book, you need to read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's description of how he went about building his own computer sounds like a bad joke.   I can't tell you how many people have told me how they tried to do it, but eventually gave up.  I know what you're going to say, but the only reason to build your own computer is so you can use it at work.  You'll want to have it for those "office hours" when you're trying to get a word count down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written. I don't understand how any of the characters ever become successful. I get the feeling they've done a lot of reading and they've decided to just make it up as they go along. I really wanted to like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't find much of value in this book.   There were a few very good things that made it worth the time, but the book itself was mostly a bore.  The story takes place in the town of Lusk in New Hampshire.  Lusk is a very small town and the story revolves around two families.  Both families are very strict but also very loving.  They teach their children that it is a bad idea to cheat.  The one who does the cheating family's daughter is punished but is eventually accepted back into the family as one of the boys.  This leads to a very interesting story about a mother and son who love each other very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book on the history of political thought and one that has a lot of interesting and important stuff in it, but I would have been more impressed with a more in-depth treatment of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. I can understand the interest of some people in the French revolution and the rise of the modern republic (or what was left of it) but the book is not worth my time or the time of anyone else I've told about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor. The stories are terrible. There are no characters to care about or even to be aware of. It's not the end of the world for this to be a great book, but it's really sad that the author couldn't get the book published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why I read this book at all. This book is a complete waste of time.  This book should have been called "A Complete Waste of Time" because it really doesn't have any value to it at all  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very basic guide to the various types of drugs and how to use them effectively. I was really looking forward to the sections on psychedelics and how they would be used in the "novel" I'm working on now. I'm really glad that I didn't buy it because it's not worth the time or money. I will not be using any of these drugs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. It is an introduction to the topic of the "Elder Scrolls". It contains little that is new or original. The author spends too much time talking about the history of the series and about the games. He then tells us what is new about the series. I had a similar experience with a new book about the game series that I read. The book talks about the Elder Scrolls games and the game engine. The game is also described as being a simulation game, but they actually are more like a first person shooter. There is little in the book about other games. The only thing that is worth mentioning is that the game can be played in real time. This is a good thing because a lot of players can't be bothered to turn the game off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been trying to read this book for about a year now and every time I tried I just couldn't. The writing was awful and the writing style was too "modern" for the time period. This was a book about the Vietnam War, not the Civil War, and while there were some interesting things about the war, it was just a lot of political propaganda that was written by some random hippy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a college professor.    I am an adjunct professor, not a tenured faculty member.  I teach four different courses in the same college.  All of my students are white.  They don't think about race.  This book is about a black student at a white university.  He tries to change the white community. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book.   It is not a very good book at all.      The whole story is really a waste of time and I could not get through it.  I felt bad for the characters and thought they were all kind of awful.  This book had so many terrible ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad story, it's just that the author doesn't seem to know what the hell she's doing, or how to write a good one. She spends half of the book writing about how the heroine is in love with the main character, but the author is so bad at creating the perfect relationship that it doesn't work. The two characters are never really even close to each other.  It really takes a lot to make me stop reading a book, especially a book I've already finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that I didn't really care for the characters. I can't say I liked this story a whole lot. I like it more as a premise than as a story. I found the characters, especially the girl, to be a little on the dull side. The story is very similar to that of a good mystery novel: a man meets a girl and goes off on a date. I didn�t find this to be much different.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very sad book. It tells the story of the tragic life of the family in which I was raised and of my own tragic life as a homosexual. The book is based on an interview with a brother and sister. They both were abused and were victims of child molestation. My parents were abusive to me too. The author does not make a good argument for why a homosexual life should be less hard on a family. I'm afraid it is a book that will make some readers cringe. It is sad that a book can tell such a tragic story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of holes and the author has no clue as to what he's talking about.  There is no reason for this to be an interplanetary story but this is the most ridiculous thing I've read.  It's about a space ship and a planet and the story is about a man named Jim who has been in the military.   The story is so full of errors and mistakes that it makes the plot a joke.  The characters are also a joke, but I don't think they were intended to be.  They are like the cast of an old Saturday morning cartoon:  The captain is the dumbest guy in the room and the first officer is an idiot and his assistant is just as dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a poor excuse for a horror novel. It is filled with pointless gore, poorly constructed characters, and poorly thought out plot twists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's very difficult to read this book. I'm afraid I won't finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most tedious, boring book I have ever read in my life. I have read several other books about WWI and World War II.  This one is the worst.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a better book than this. The ending is rushed and I feel like this was a poorly thought out and poorly written book. It was a nice experience and a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand the appeal of this book at all. If you are looking for a quick book that will get the facts across quickly without too much drama then you will be satisfied.  But if you are more of a serious person looking for an interesting book to read then you won't get it.  If you want a book that tells you what you don't know you will not find it here.  There is a lot to learn about the history of science but the authors doesn't know what they are talking about or the basic facts about the past.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has an interesting perspective on life.   It's a good story, and I like the characters, but the way he tells it is a bit slow, and the ending is unsatisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete joke. I don't understand the authors purpose in writing this book. Why did they pick this subject? There is no real reason for the book to exist other than the authors ego.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking forward to reading this book for years, but I just found it tedious and not that interesting.  The writing is choppy and it feels like he tried to make a political point but fell flat on his face. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a terrible teacher and the class is worthless.   I would rather pay for a good teacher than pay for this worthless book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about what is happening in our society, but about the culture of the 'good' and the 'bad'. It is a cultural critique of modern life, which focuses on the role of religion in society. It focuses on a few of the most powerful and influential religious leaders in our day, but I feel the book is too narrowly focused. If you have ever had a spiritual awakening, or are interested in studying the Bible for the sake of religious study, you should not read this book. However, if you are interested or involved in a spiritual path or simply want to know more about the power of the religious leaders of our day and the culture they are shaping in our lives, you may find this book helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very tedious to read. It is about an old man, who had been living in a mansion for a while, that had been inherited by a rich family. After his family died, he got a job at the family mansion, and eventually moved in to take over the estate.  When his boss left the mansion, the guy left too.    He kept the mansion as a place to sleep, but was always being pestered by his landlord's family, who were always trying to get him out.  He also had to take care of his old mistress, who was having an affair with his boss's brother.  This is a very depressing book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is interesting but the story is told in a way that is so confusing it makes me think I am reading a children's book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not worth the price, it is too vague about the world building and the setting, and the world is too flat. The book does have an ending, but it is the last page, and I don't feel like I can use it to figure out the rest of the story. It just ends with a bunch of questions I don`t have to answer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I like how they used a lot of real life examples to give their point. They also used examples that I know would have a lot to do with my own experience. The main reason I'm not so sure is that they used these examples to make a point that would have been different for me. They make a comparison between the way that the Bible was written (and interpreted) and the way it is being read today. It is true that some Christians have interpreted it the wrong way and are still interpreting it the same way today. I know I read it that way, but that's just a reflection of the way I read the Bible. The reason I read a different way is because I was a Christian. But I have always been more open to new ideas and new information, so that's not really an excuse. I also believe that I read things the wrongway when I was in the church. I was raised to believe that if I didn't understand a concept I should just reject it. I don't see any reason why the Bible couldn't have been more straightforward. It would be great if they would have given a good reason for why the word "hell" means so much to them. I believe that God gives us the gift of discernment. I think that sometimes we are not very good at it. But we should be very honest with ourselves about our limitations and strive to improve ourselves. I have read some pretty strange and strange things in my life that made me question things. So I don.t think it would be a bad idea for a Christian to ask himself why God would have written this way. The whole book is interesting and informative. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and spelling mistakes. It is a poorly written book with no meaning or relevance. It should not be given a grade because it has no purpose or meaning. It was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute disgrace. It is so bad, in fact, that I'm not sure what the author thought she was doing by writing it. It's a long story with a long beginning and a long ending, but that's about it. The author's entire life is a farce. Her mother, a single mom, has a great job and lives in a nice house in a good neighborhood. Her dad was an auto mechanic and her step-mother is a social worker. She has two step-siblings (and a brother) and she has a daughter who's a year younger than her. The story begins when she is in college. Her father is a failed artist, and she gets into his life when she has to help him get a job. Things go downhill from there. The first two chapters are very good. The characters have a lot of personality, and the writing is good. There is a long scene about how she spends her nights on the couch watching television. I found it interesting and made me think about her father and her own relationship with him. The next chapters, however, are really bad. She finds herself involved in a long string of bad relationships. Her step-father is a drug addict, and her husband is an alcoholic. She spends her time getting drunk at a party, then goes home and tries to make love to her husband. When he doesn't respond, she goes out and has sex with a man. Then she goes to a party where she has sex a second time, and then goes back to her boyfriend. Then her husband dies and she moves back in with her parents. Then the book becomes a long description of how she and her friends get drunk, get high, go to strip clubs, etc. She's not in love with anyone, but she has nothing else to do. It takes a lot to make me laugh in a book. I really didn't find any humor in this book. The only good thing about the book is that she's so bad at relationships that she gets a job at a strip club.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a bad one but it was a bit confusing. I had no idea what I was doing when I started reading it. I think the author is confusing himself to be the author of a book. I can understand it when someone reads something for the first time and then is confused, but he makes it hard to follow when he starts talking about a book that was originally published in 1970 and was not a best seller when he published it. It is a very interesting book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book.  The book is about a person with Asperger's who is given a computer and gets to use it to help him do his job, but it's very hard to get him to use the keyboard and mouse, and when he does use them, they are extremely slow.  He is also very clumsy and it's hard to do simple things like turn on a light.  I'm not sure why he is given this computer, but there are so many limitations on how it can be used that I feel like he's being punished for his Aspergers.  Also, it's not clear that the computer is even really a computer at all.  It's like he was given a video game that requires him to walk around in a specific way, but he has a problem with being able to walk in the right way.  Finally, the person with the Asperg's is so awkward in the video game, I can't imagine how hard it would be to do the game in real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sorry I had to wait until the final two books to read this series because it's so much like the first book that I was dreading the third book.   The main character is not as nice as I thought she was.  Her mother, a nice woman, is constantly angry at her for doing something bad.  The first two books were so good, I thought I would hate this one but the third is a little too long.  I just wanted a little more from the third story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only book I'll read in a long time, and I've read a lot of books in a short time. The narrator is so-so. I don't know if he's just really bad at narrating or if his mind is so clouded that he can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy. I have to assume the former, since his voice is so dry and uninspired, but it doesn't make for a good read. It's about a woman, a witch, who lives in a castle. She has a pet bear and an owl who she calls by a strange and unpronounceable name, "Little Man." She is a very unhappy person. In the castle she lives with her sister and brother-in-law. Her brother- in-law has a son, who is a sorcerer, and his wife is a witch. She thinks her husband is being unfaithful, and she wants to kill him. She goes to a witch for help, and when she hears the answer she can't believe it, she doesn't think she can be a witch after all. So she tries to kill her husband and her son, but in the end the witch kills both of them. She decides to kill herself too, but when she tries she dies. She is cursed, and her spirit can't get out of the castle.  I was so disappointed in this book, and the narrator is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is very bad. It's like someone took a page from the original and used a pen to write on. It has the same feeling as the first book: the story is too good to be true. It makes me angry that the author is making a fortune with his book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad read.  The story is all about how the world is falling apart.  But there is so little development of the characters that I was bored after the first third of the book.  There is so much talk about how bad the world really is, but the characters never seem to care about anything.  And then there is this huge fight between the two main characters that never really gets to happen.  I guess it was supposed to be a battle of wills.  Then there is a fight scene in the book where the hero just shows up and fights.    And in the end, we learn nothing about the main characters.  As a final note, this book would be a much better book if it wasn't about a boy and his girl who are in love and trying to raise a family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a student in high school. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and is looking for a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in a very bad style. The writing is terrible. The story is told in the first person from the point of view of a woman who is in love with her boyfriend but is afraid that if she gets too attached he might leave her.  She is told a few things about her boyfriend, and that he is a bit odd but then is told that she's too much of a prude.  The book is about the girl and her boyfriend.  I'm sure it would be a better story if it were told from the girl's perspective.  It's written in the third person so the reader is in the mindset of a character, but I didn't care.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite book in the library right now is   the  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several books about the first world war that were all bad but the only thing that could have saved this book is that it had more time to develop it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book about a good subject but the author does not have the patience to really explain things in a way that will get the student to ask questions about things that are not in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mom was the only person I can think of that would have actually read this book.   She is a little obsessed with this book, and is always talking about it.  It has really sucked me in the past, but this time I am not so interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book itself is very bad and it is full of spelling errors.   The main character was really annoying in this book and the author wrote him to sound so smart, but he is just a complete idiot.  I was going to give it a bad review but I thought about the many ways that the author could have written this book.  It would have been better if the author had focused more on the love triangle and less on the two friends who are in love with the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those "if you're a fan of books that are based on a comic, then this is for you" books. But I just couldn't get into it. The story itself is ok, but I'm a huge fan of the comic and it just wasn't a good fit for me. I'm so glad I didn't buy it though as I might have spent a lot more money on it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. I'm not sure why I didn't read it sooner but I have my fingers crossed that I'll get to read it in the near future. I loved the book's concept of the two sexes having different abilities and weaknesses and the way that the different abilities were explored and used to the male's advantage. The female characters were very interesting too, especially the main character.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit that I didn't give this book a chance. It came out of a collection of the same names that I hate: "The Man Who Loved the Dead," "Dead Men's Voices," "The Living Dead," etc.   The books are in a genre called "horror."   My problem was that this book, which was supposedly about a boy and a girl who were going to a cemetery to bury a dead body, sounded a lot like a horror movie.  It was about a little girl who had a terrible dream.  And the boy is so creepy, that I had to put it down and read something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving this book 4 stars because the first 3/4 of the book is about how to write a book. It's about how the author had to work really hard to write this book, and what a nightmare it was.  The last third of the story is the author explaining how the writer's block is like, and how it makes a great book.  So, I guess the authors of the above review are right - it is hard to be a good writer, and when you are trying to write, you feel a lot of guilt because you know that it is a bad idea.  But that is not how it works with me - I love to write.  I love making up stories.  And writing is my true passion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book in a trilogy, and it is the least successful. It is boring and drab, and the characters are mostly stereotypes.   I will probably only finish it once I'm done reading the other two books, but it will stay with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from Amazon and it came with a terrible review from a fellow bookworm.  It's one thing to read a bad review about something you've read, but quite another to see the reviewer go so far out of their way to be negative about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time.  The author spent a lot of time telling us about some "mysteries" that were found at a local hotel, but the author could not have cared less about any of them.  He spent the bulk of his book talking about his "discovery" of the hotel.  This is the first time in the book that he actually describes the hotel he supposedly found it in.  It was a total waste of a book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good book at all.  It's a very slow paced, boring, non-researched book that is full of unproven science.  A lot of people say that the earth is flat, but the author doesn't really say that, instead it is implied.  If the earth was flat, how could the earth's magnetic field be the strongest in the universe?  It also implies that the solar system is in orbit around a planet that is in fact not even in our solar system.  The author also tries to make up for the lack of scientific evidence by saying that if we find life in a rock then we will assume it must have come from a planet.  This is completely wrong because life is made up of a lot of chemicals and minerals that would not exist on a planet like earth.  These are just some of the things that are wrong with the book, it also has some really stupid quotes from religious leaders about what it means to be good.  In summary:  If you want to know what the earth looks like from space this book is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book.   The title implies that the author is from a small town where everyone knows each other.  It is a little hard to get a good story out of a smallish town, especially one in which most of the residents are "good people."   A big part of this book was the interaction between the two main characters, a young girl named Lucy and a little boy named Ben.  The book is about a fight between Lucy and her older sister about their father's will, and it is pretty predictable.  I thought it was funny when Lucy said, "I have two sisters that are pretty good at this stuff."  Unfortunately, this book takes place in a small village in which every girl has a "sister."  I think this is one reason why I was not impressed by this story:  The story was repetitive and boring.  Lucy and Ben's relationship was also predictable, and I was frustrated with Lucy because she was always the one that did the fighting.  Even when she was helping Ben, I knew that Lucy was doing it.  There were other things that I thought were a little ridiculous, like the idea that the village elders would have to be involved in this fight to protect their little girl.  This was not a realistic idea.  Also, the whole situation is resolved in a few paragraphs; you don't have to wait for a book to resolve a conflict.  Overall, I think that this book is one that I will not be reading again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book about how to write a bad review of a bad movie.   The story is about a guy who is in love with a girl who is a prostitute.  He is trying to find out what the girl is doing so he can get her to give him a hand job.  However he finds out she has a big secret.  It turns out she is not a prostitute at all, she is a sex trafficker who has a girl slave.  She sells her girls to rich people who use them for sex and drugs.  This isn't a very good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read in my life.   I hate the idea of a woman who is a lesbian going into a heterosexual marriage.  It's   a lie.  If I were a lesbian I would marry the most attractive man I can find and have a child with him and get a divorce after the baby is born.  What a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it is almost impossible to review. It is very poor and there is no reason for anyone to have read it. It tells the story of a woman who is very sick and she goes to see her doctor because she is scared that she is going to die. She goes into a lot of detail about how she is not going to be able to do things that she has always wanted to do. She is a very self-centered person who does not appreciate others or what they have done for her. I am sure she could have done better. I don't understand why people who read it have not commented on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know about you, but I found this book to be very boring. I had no idea what I was reading about and didn't like it at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that is more about being wrong than anything else. It's about how to live a long life without aging (or living forever) in an unhealthy way.  It's all about the science and science-fiction of aging.  I'm sure the author has been told about all of the scientific research on aging. But he just doesn't care.  In fact, the book is very anti-science, if that's even a word.   I have no idea what the author is thinking, but it makes no sense.  This book has a lot of potential to be an entertaining read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of crap. I'm a fan of horror and suspense and this book is no exception. I didn't like the premise. There are a few different reasons why the story is written as if it was a movie and not a book. There's a lot of writing in this book that just seemed too out of place to me. Also, the author is an aspiring writer who just doesn't seem to know her stuff. She's got a few interesting ideas but her story is so unoriginal that it's hard to get excited about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that needs to be reviewed. The plot is a good one. It is about a character with a brain tumor who is in a hospital that is full of idiots who do stupid things. I am not sure that I really understood the plot, but that is how the book was supposed to go. It did not. The book was about a group of people who were all in their 40's. The oldest was in his 60's. I was surprised by the fact that they could all remember and use their own cars.   The story was not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book about a lot of stuff, but it's a book about "stuff", and not just stuff like a lot to be ashamed of. I think a good way to sum up the book would be "It's about all the things that really annoy me." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a very, very, VERY enthusiastic purchaser of this book and was very disappointed in it. I think that some of the arguments for the non-existence of a Creator were flawed, but they were more about arguments against religion than about science.  I read a lot about science, and I found the arguments about the existence of God very strong, but it was the religious arguments that I found most problematic, and especially the arguments that came from the scientific community about evolution.  In fact, I think this book is the most convincing evidence that evolution is the correct answer to the origin of life.  If you are interested in a well-written, well-researched book that discusses the topic of religion, but you find yourself disappointed by it because of its anti-science, anti-evolution arguments, this book may be right for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of a few short stories.  The stories are not good.    A few of the stories are about a man who is an "unrecognized" author.  There is no story about a woman's sexual experience with a man.  A man is a rapist.  He is the only one in the book who can be accused of being a rapist even though there are many women who say he raped them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad and not very interesting book. I was trying to understand the concept behind the term "paleo diet" (i.e. eating mostly grass-fed meats and vegetables). I was hoping to find some research that supported the concept of paleo and that didn't. The book is very short (only 4 chapters), but the first 3 are very confusing. I didn't get anything from the last one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In an effort to make my writing more accessible to non-specialists, I've rewritten it to make the concepts easier to understand. I used to have a hard time with the book, but I can now understand a lot more about what it's about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a very bad friend of mine who died.   It is written in a way that makes it sound like he had something to do with my death but it is not true.  It was a bad decision that he made to get in with a bad crowd. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard of this book before it was even out.  I read it because I was looking for a good romance with a strong female lead.  It doesn't live up to those expectations.  A woman who can be a very powerful woman and yet has very little interest in romance or sex is a hard sell.   The characters in this book don't have much depth, and the romance is not strong enough to make it work.  The sex is there, but it's not a memorable scene, and you can't even tell that they have sex.  Overall, I'm very disappointed in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an interesting and well written book.  The problem is that there is no real ending, which is a huge problem for me since I had a lot of interest in this book and would have been interested in it more if the ending had been more definitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.  It is filled with useless information about the different styles of fencing and how they differ.   There is no use of fencing at all.  The book is all about tactics.  What is that?  I have a very bad back and the book doesn't teach me how to do anything useful with my back.  I tried fencing for years and this book doesn' t help me at all... I can't learn to fence from it.  So the only people who will benefit from this book are the people who think it will teach them something new. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book on the history of the French and Spanish Revolutions. It is very good, but it is also very boring and repetitive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was interesting but too simplistic. There were so many "facts" about the war that it was hard to understand the war. This book would be better if there were more "facts." I would love to see more on the POWs and the camps.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really hoping this book was going to be a great book.  I've been wanting to read a book about the military and military culture for years.  This book seems to be pretty accurate, and it was good enough that I felt the need to read it.    However, I really wish it would have been edited a bit more, and the end seemed to be the most unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting to love this book but after reading it I just didn't care for it. The story line was boring, the characters were one dimensional, the plot was predictable and the story line that the characters are "evil" didn't add up to anything interesting to me. I guess it was the author's fault because the book was bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it's bad, really bad, I don't want to hear anything about it.  I thought this book would have some interesting ideas and then it was like "huh, I guess I'm not really a feminist", but then I was like, "oh, right, because I'm a woman"  The whole book is about women who get "dumbed down" and then they get smart, and I just couldn't understand how anyone would think this is a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know why I was so excited about this book. This is a collection of letters to the editor of a journal that was a sort of precursor to the modern-day newsletter. It's dated August 1962 and I've read this before but it's not the same and I had a hard time remembering all the names. The author is Mary O'Leary, who goes by "Momma" or "Maggie". This is her third book of poems but her first one to be published. The letters are full of clichés and in some cases the author is just being repetitive. She doesn't have the same sense of humor that she does in her other books so it can be hard to take her seriously. She's also too nice to her enemies. In one letter she complains about the bad reviews in the "newspaper of record" and her husband's "unfortunate" behavior. She says he was a "wretched, nasty, nasty old man". I'm not saying she's lying but she seems to be in a way saying that a man can't be a man if he doesn't act like one. I thought she was being a bit mean.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not worth the time it takes to read it.   The narrator and the story itself are both terrible.  The narrator is boring and the book is boring.  If you want a story, read a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a girl, who goes to a very bad high school. It is a very good book, but I was very disappointed in the author's writing skills. She does not know how to create tension, how to get a good story, and what not to do. I would recommend this book only to someone who is very interested in a good book about a teen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an example of why I would rather not spend time writing negative reviews. If you are looking for a good mystery book you should not look at this one. It is just not up to par with what you could get in the US. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best thing about this book is that it is just about the most complete and thorough explanation of the science behind the magic mushrooms. The whole book is about the science of magic mushrooms (not a good thing) but it really covers it all and is a must read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've only read one of this book.  It was a waste of time.  I have read more fiction books than this and I haven't liked any of them.  This is not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most tedious book I have ever read. It's full of boring boring things. There are a lot of questions about why a person would do that but you can't answer them. This is a book about a woman who thinks she is a good person but doesn't know what good is, a book with a lot more to it. This book was written by a woman.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as part of a "reading group" and it was a very boring and uninspired group. We were supposed to learn how to read and talk about various works by various authors. We had no idea what we were reading or even who the author was. We never did figure out what it was that we were supposed learn. I think that it's a good idea to learn a lot about different authors so that you can learn how they wrote their work. However, this book was not a good start to that kind of discussion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's style of writing is not consistent. I was hoping he would write a story about a good person who had some problems, but he just doesn't have the patience or intelligence to tell a story well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has a strange and strange way of describing his work, like he's describing a car wreck. He says a lot about his work in a way that doesn't really tell us anything about his book, and at the same time he gives his story a very strange and twisted spin, in which a young girl falls in love with a man who has been living in the woods for 20 years.  He's so strange that the book feels like a horror novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no real plot to it, the characters are all over the place and don't really have a reason to be together other than that they're the same sex, and even if they were in a relationship they could not make it work. The author also had the gall to write that the characters were all "sooo perfect" when they have no real basis for that comment other than the fact that they are the same gender. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this book for several years now and I can't figure out why I kept putting it down. This is a well written book but I just could not get past the parts about the "real life" stories about the people I have known in my life. I don't have any close friends who have died in my time. They were real, they really did die, but my feelings about them are more about the life I had rather than their actual deaths. So it would be great if they came back and helped me through some of the stuff I was going through but no. I guess I just had to learn from my mistakes and move on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book, but it was so terrible that I have no intention of reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My boyfriend, who is a massive fan of all things Sci-Fi, was very disappointed in this book. He had read it at least five times before I bought it. The characters are generic and boring and he doesn't understand the reason for their powers, their history, or their motives. They just seem to have a "bad" attitude about everything. I would have expected better from an author that has a good reputation, I can only assume the bad reviews are due to the poor sales. I don't care about the characters at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not love this book. I was disappointed that it didn't make more sense to me.  The reason that I didn't love it is because I didn t think that there were any real consequences to the things that happened to the characters.  If anything, it just seems like the author did a good job of putting the book together.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem with this book is that it is poorly written. This is the kind of book that you need to be on a long airplane ride to read, not one that you can easily get off of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. It has all the makings of a classic. The characters are well developed, and there is some fun to be had in a story about a young woman who is too proud to wear a wedding ring, but not about a woman who goes to great lengths to get a marriage annulled because it is against her religious beliefs. The author is a little too concerned about how she is portrayed as the "loser" because of her decision not to wear the ring, and I'm sure she's a wonderful person. However, her book is a poor representation of marriage in the modern world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a really fun time reading this book. It was definitely a bit of a drag for me to read the book. But it's fun and I enjoyed the story. I did find it odd that this book was written about a guy who lived in the 1950's. It really wasn't that much different from living in the 20's and 30's when I was a kid. That being said, this book is very good for kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book but I didn't get it. It was a very boring book with very little to say. There is not a single interesting idea in the book. I guess that is how the author thinks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really long and hard to read. It is very technical and is mostly focused on the theoretical, but doesn't tell you how to do things in a good manner. The authors have a nice concept but they don't use it to its full potential.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know what the point of this book was. The whole thing felt rushed.  The entire book was a lot of unnecessary words and information.  I feel like this was just meant to be the first book in the series, and it was just rushed to the editor.  Maybe it's because it was the first one I ever read, and I was expecting it to be something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just awful.  The author takes a very well written story and just mucks it up with a bad writing style and stupid plot holes.  It is a waste of time.  This was one of the best books I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was interesting but it was the same old story of a child and an older woman, but with more adult jargon and more adult prose.   The child's story had a few interesting points but it did not have the same heart as the other two. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to help with my "how to be a bad mother" book.   However, the author makes no attempt at making her child feel like a real child.  The child is clearly being used to create the "feel good" story.  My 6 year old has been a big fan of the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book at all. It is an easy to understand story about an elderly man who has a bad accident and can no longer see. The story was about the man trying to get his sight back with all the equipment he can get and the doctors telling him it is hopeless. It was about a lot of doctors telling the man he has no hope. The man is so desperate he buys a device that turns his eye into a camera that will take pictures. He then uses the device to try and get his vision back. The last couple chapters were very depressing. The final chapter where he sees a woman for the first time was a depressing one. The whole thing is so sad and I do not like it at all but I guess I can't give it a bad review because it was so easy to find an excuse to not like a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I'm interested in the relationship between the Church and the modern world.   It seems to be a pretty fair discussion of those relationships.  I found the chapters on the Book of Mormon to be the most interesting.  The authors of this book seem to think that the Church is really the modern-day church in which Joseph Smith taught.  It's pretty easy to debunk that idea by comparing the Book Of Mormon with the Bible.  They both claim to be scripture, but only one is true.  And neither is really a book.  In short, the Book is the Book, but it's not the Bible, it's a history of the Jews.  While I don't think that it's bad for a book to be an historical work, the authors make a poor argument about the book they want to be.  That argument is really not good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about a guy who was born into the wrong family.   The family he was born to was a wealthy, powerful family. I didn't really understand why he was so bitter about it.  I guess that's part of what made this book so good.  It's an incredibly emotional book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't find much that was really novel or unique about this book. It is a very boring and cliched book that does not offer much of anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read. The plot is not even believable, the characters are not believable, and the story is just not worth it.  I'm sure this book is going to be a massive disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a book that would help me learn how to work on my own projects. This book doesn't do that. Instead it makes me feel that I'm not learning anything useful at all.    I don't know if I'll buy the book or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters were all annoying and the story was not very good. There were some plot holes and the ending was not what I thought it would be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was hard to get into, but it is a good book that I think is well written.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book I purchased about the occult and the "hidden world" was disappointing. It was a book written by a man with a very strange sense of humor, and as such is not the most reliable book about the paranormal. He is very much in the dark about some of the details of his book. He claims that the occult is about "unveiling secrets and the true power of good people." But I can't see that as a real interest in occultism, or at least not a very interesting interest, since his book is so short. It is mostly about the "occult world" and his personal experiences with it. The occult is interesting, if that's what you are into. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book that had nothing to do with anything I read in college. It's not an enjoyable book at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a lot of good ideas, but I found it very difficult to understand them. I could not even tell you the name of one of the many things she was talking about. I ended up putting the book back on my shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a great story but I have trouble with the ending.   I had a lot of fun reading this book, but I'm not sure what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really know what to say about this book.   The book starts off by saying "it is a story of a woman who can't find a place in the world" and then goes on to talk about how her husband can't be bothered to support her or to help her get a job.  It goes on about how she has to work because she has no choice, but how she doesn't have to work as hard as her husband, how she is not as beautiful as she thinks she is, and that she has trouble finding a place to go after work because of the men who can afford to pay for her fancy clothes.  She also talks about how many men don't want to do anything with her because of how much time she spends around them.  In other words, she is being blamed for the problems of her husband.  The story doesn't get better as it goes on.  This book doesn't tell the reader that being alone is a good thing or that being in a relationship is a bad thing, or that there is any good in being a single mother.  So the story goes:        a woman gets divorced and moves into a one bedroom apartment with a friend.    She does the laundry every morning but it doesn't make the laundry pile up.        When her friend leaves, she spends her days working at a job at a supermarket and making ends meet.  At night, she stays home to cook and do the dishes.  After a while, she gets a job as a home health aide.  But she doesn' t like the job and quit because she doesn''t want to be in a room all day.  Then she spends the next few years in her apartment and eventually moves back to her parents' house.  Now she spends all her time with her friend and doesn't go to work.  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  I also didn''t like how the book ended.  Instead of the woman finding a new place to live, she moved into a group home for people with disabilities.  What did she do there?  How did it help her?   In short, she spent the last few years of her life doing what she did best:  sitting in her room and drinking coffee.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad I feel bad about writing a negative.  I found this book very hard to read, and I was so sure I was going to hate it.  The premise of this book is that there is a new form of cancer which only affects males and which has already killed 3 men.  This new form is a very aggressive cancer called "Hangman's Disease."  I felt like this book was trying to say something about the fact that males are so much more likely to die from cancer.  It is hard to find anything to criticize in a book about men dying from cancer, but I guess I just don't get this new cancer or how it is affecting males.    Overall, I didn't like this at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am still disappointed that the book never made it out of the manuscript stage. It would have been nice to have been able to read the actual drafts in order to compare them to the final versions.    I guess this book is for a few people, and I am one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. I'm going to have to spend a lot of time reading the next ones.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book's title is "A Short History of the World." But it's really more like a long history of the human mind. And that's fine if you want to learn about the evolution of human minds but not if you don't. I think most people don't really understand the evolution part of human evolution. We know it happened because we have the evidence to support it. And there are a lot of evidence that supports it. So, the book's just a long description of how the human brain got to be what it is today.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A good novel with great story, but it takes forever to get to the good stuff.  The story has a great theme of betrayal.   It has lots of good scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on my Kindle but I couldn't get past the boring and tedious writing.   I wanted to like this book but I just couldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book interesting, but not so much about the "scientific" aspects of the case. I think it's a good read but a little thin. It doesn't really make much sense at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book, but I just didn't like it. I don't think it was well-written or edited. The characters didn't have any real life experience that I could identify with. It felt like it was written by someone who knew very little about the world she was trying to describe. It also had a lot of sex scenes that I just can't get into. It just doesn't do a whole lot for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had the misfortune of reading this book as a high schooler.   It was so boring that it was hard to get through the entire thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was not a good book.  The story line was poorly written and poorly told.  This book was the same way.  It took me 3 books to realize that there were no characters that were interesting enough to be interesting or likable.  There is nothing to them at all.  And I really enjoyed the book so I am not going to give it a bad review.  I think it was written by a person who just started to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most important thing about this book is that it's very easy to read.    This is the first book I've ever read that was so easy to follow, I didn't have to ask a lot of questions about how things were explained or what was actually happening.  It was just so easy, even for someone who has to read in the slowest reading speed.  I think that's the best way to learn about a subject.  There's a ton of information in this book, but it was so well-written, I was actually able to put it down and go back and re-read sections, because the writing was so clear.  Also, I like that the author didn't just gloss over some of the less-than-positive parts of the Mormon church.  This book is very well-researched and very factual, but I still had some questions that I had never asked before.  The author goes into some of those, but also provides some good reasons why you shouldn't feel bad about being ex-Mormon.  He also gives some good arguments for why it's a good idea to have a good faith in Christ.  In fact, it's really hard to argue against the whole "God hates fags" part of that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most confusing part of this book was the "pre-history" section. The book tries to use that as an excuse for a long period of history that doesn't exist, as if history is something you can change.   They didn't know anything about history, and didn't understand the basic concept of "prehistory."   A "prehistoric" world would be a world of constant war, where everything was based on warfare, and where civilization was destroyed at the end of every war.  But this is not "prehistorical."  A prehistorical world has no "civilization" at all.  And there is no mention of the "Great Leap Forward" at the start of this period of Chinese history, nor of any period where there was a continuous war.  It's a nice attempt to explain some of the reasons for the Great Leap Forward, but it's not the real reason for the fall of civilization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. It has the same basic premise as the earlier books, but it's the same story. It's the old "evil teacher who gets away with murder" trope that's been done to death. As always, the author's "excuses" are lame: He was under stress, he didn't know if he could trust the other kids, he wanted to teach the class how to be killers. The book is full of juvenile, childish, and downright stupid "excuse" moments that were all too common in these books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had this book for months.  It is a long and tedious story about a man who can't stand his own voice.  The first two thirds of the book are about his struggle to overcome that and to have a happy life with a girlfriend.  As he goes on with his life, he slowly becomes less happy.  He starts to have problems with his job and with his ex-wife.  Eventually he is able to overcome those issues and his life seems better.  This is about two years into a relationship and he is still not happy. He still has the voice that he can't control and is unhappy about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a man who can read people's minds and predict their actions.   This isn't really a book that will change the world but it is interesting.  I liked the story and the way it was presented. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible! I know it's an autobiography, but it is just a bunch of anecdotes. There is nothing of value in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't want to read this book at all. I don't like paranormal or mystery stories and I don a l of   this book.   The story is all about how   the   family and friends   don't   want   him to   see   a   psychic.   But, when he   does   he  realizes   that   it's   all   real.  It   feels   like   reading   an   book   about   people   who   think   they   are   special  .  It's  like reading  a  bad   book  ,   written   by   someone   whose   writing   doesn't   match   what   his   readers   really   expect   from   stories.  I was   disappointed   to  find   no   ending   in   my   opinion   of   this   novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just found this book when searching for a good book to read on the bus. The story is very good. It is just about the same as most of the other stuff I have read about Vietnam. It really does show how bad the American forces were in this war. It does give you an idea of how much of a mess the war really was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a collection of one man's stories. There are no themes or characters, just a man telling his own story. The characters are uninteresting. The prose is not the best, but there is nothing much that is worth reading. This book has a lot of holes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best thing about this book is that it has an excellent ending.  I'm surprised that I've not seen it before.  This is the first novel I've read in which I didn't know where to stop.  It's hard to put down after the end.  If you like epic fantasy, this is an awesome book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book has a lot to offer. The story is well told, there is a great plot twist at the end that makes me happy. The characterisation is excellent. But, the characters are all the same: they have the same personality traits (for the most part), and there is nothing that I find unique about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really get the main thrust of this book and found it to be a bit confusing. The main characters, Tash and Jody, are very believable. I enjoyed their interactions and was very interested in their lives.  The other main characters in this book, the twins who take care of their father, didn't get enough screen time and were pretty one dimensional.  I was hoping that their stories would get some time in this novel but that never really happened.  Overall, this was a very interesting read but a bit disappointing to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book twice, once when I was really interested and now that I've finally finished it I'm pretty sure it's not worth reading. This book is a bit boring and there is not much in it for me. The author makes a lot of vague references to other books in the series that were never written and then never mention any of them. It's hard to imagine the whole story in a couple of hours, which is why I gave it a 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible.  I don't know why they have to make these books in this genre.    They are always awful, and they never add anything to the story.  They just get in the way of the main story. I hate reading about the past.  It's always about the present, which is always bad.  If you want to know what life was like during the Civil War, this is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just terrible. I don't know if it is because I am a woman, or just because the book is written by a woman that it is bad, but this book is terrible. The story is about a girl who has an accident, and she is in a wheelchair. This girl is the kind of person who would never want to give up on herself. She never gave up on her dreams, she is very strong and brave, she loves to go to the gym, and even though she has no use for her arms she still uses them to make things for others. I am glad that she did not get to live a life like that, but I wish she could have been left alone with her problems and not have to deal with others. It is not that she is bad or bad for wanting to be disabled, it is just that she was not born that way. I have to wonder if her parents would have allowed her to live that way if they knew the extent of the damage that was done to her. The book was really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad! The main character was a complete jerk. I mean, it was obvious to me before I read the book that he was a total jerk, but it took me almost a year to realize it. I think I got more enjoyment out of reading his first book, "Babes in the Woods" by Robert Coover than this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped to love this book but I got a headache after reading it. It was a slow read and very boring. The plot was very weak and the characters were flat and unlikable. There was no point to the story. There are so many holes that I just had a hard time reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really interesting book.   It is a short read and the information is very interesting.  The first few chapters are very well-done and the rest is just a recap of all the information I gathered from my sources. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most boring book I've ever read, but it got me through the boring class.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a guy who is having a hard time getting a date.  He's very awkward, so awkward he can't even make a girl laugh.   After a few dates he's like a duck, he's not funny at all.  I don't think he's a bad person.  This is one of those books that is like a short movie that shows a person's problems and then gives a solution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a collection of short stories about people who, by choice or necessity, are not very smart. This is an example of how bad stories can become worse when a new author tells them.   The stories range from amusing to absurd. The best of the collection is a story about a man who lives in a world of mirrors.  I hope this collection doesn't come out in paperback.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book for children.  The author should have included a warning label at the beginning of the book so that I could know what to expect from it.  This book is about a character who is obsessed with a certain kind of "magical" food and refuses to accept that it is unhealthy.  It's really just the same old diet stuff.    This will be a boring read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the author got it wrong here.   This is a bad story, and you will like it less than the author thinks you will.  It's the sort of story you'd find in a bad mystery or a bad science fiction novel.  I don't think you'll like it, either, but it's at least not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible. The whole thing was too long.   It was so difficult to read because I felt like I couldn't remember anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My second time reading this book I was disappointed as the character was too old for her own good. The plot was very confusing. The ending was abrupt and didn't make sense. It seemed like the book was going nowhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a couple that had a little boy. It's not a good book about it.  I got this book because my mother has a lot of children, and she liked the author.  It took a while to get through this book.  She was having a hard time getting through it, because she doesn't know how to read.   She gave me a copy of it as a present. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in a couple of days after reading the first book in the series (which I think is better).  There is a LOT of fluff in this book, it is not the sort of book I am a fan of.  It is a bit slow paced and I would not recommend it to a first time reader (although it would be a good book to read after the first one). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just an embarrassment to me. It is full of spelling mistakes. The stories are so bad that I am embarrassed for the author. She is also too much of a drama queen. I would give this book zero stars if it were a bad novel. I'm sure that the publisher had a great idea in putting the author in a relationship with a married man. I am so embarrassed for myself that I will not be able to read anything else by this writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad book.   The book is about the history of science and of science fiction in the 20th century. There is a chapter that talks about science fiction from a very long time ago. It is a very short chapter but the author makes it sound like there was a very large number of science-fiction authors in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The book is full of bad references to authors that are not good, such as Gertrude Atherton who did not write anything good. The author also makes the mistake of not including many authors who are good science fiction authors but did not publish in the same way. The chapter is very long but there is no reason for the author to spend a chapter on every author that wrote good science-fictions. There were many science-fi writers who wrote good books that I never heard of and who probably wrote better books than this author ever did. It makes the author seem very arrogant and condescending towards the genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a chance to read this book and I just couldn't get into it.   It's not that the stories were bad.  It was that the author doesn't seem to have much in the way of any real character development.  She spends most of the book telling her story, but at the same time seems to forget who or what the character was.  I found myself rooting for the protagonist a lot, but I felt like there was something missing from the story.  As if there was a lot of stuff in there about the protagonist's father, but nothing about her mother.  If you don't care about her as a character, then the book is probably not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to get a laugh but I just kept thinking about all the people I know who have tried this and it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at a great time, when I felt ready for a real book.   The story is intriguing, and I think that will keep readers interested for a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the Doctor Who novels, but this one is a disappointment.   I've read the entire series so far, and it's always been great, but these three books feel like they could have been much better, in many ways.  It's almost like the authors weren't really thinking when they made them.  For instance, in the first book, the Doctor is forced to leave Gallifrey and travels to the planet Zetar.  This planet is an inhospitable one, with the sun not shining, and the only source of energy is the suns' light.  The Doctor ends up running into the Zetarians, who want to use him for their own benefit, even though they don't need his help.  He's a hero and a survivor, so why isn't he saving them?  In the second book, he's given the TARDIS keys and asked to take the Doctor and his companions on a time-travel adventure.  I loved the first time, but in this book, it's the third time.  Instead of taking them to a more suitable planet, they go to a planet that is just as inhospitably cold, with only a few people living on it.  Even with the Tardis, they find that it's much harder to get around on a Tardise than on a normal ship.  In addition, there are plenty of "too much science" jokes that are poorly thought out.  And of course, the TARDIS is much harder than it looks, as is the Doctor.  After reading all three books, I feel like I got a bit of everything in the series, but only the third one really impressed me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a good book. It should have been called "The Art of Being a Gay Man" because it deals with the various facets of being gay in a world that can't comprehend it. It was funny, and at times, very sad. I didn't realize how important being a gay man is until after reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not worth the price.  The main character's "heroic" actions don't seem heroic at all, since he doesn't do anything in particular and is generally incompetent.  He doesn't seem to understand that when you have an enemy, you have to make sure they are never able to hurt you.   It's as if the author just had a bad idea about the character and put him in the story to sell more books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first few pages are very promising. We are introduced to the hero's brother, a man with a mysterious past who is the "only person in the world" who knows what really happened to his brother. We see how he feels about this new "truth", and how he is dealing with it. We get a good look at the family's old house. But by the end of the first page, the brother is back in his childhood home and the mystery remains unanswered.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very short book.  I was hoping to read a great book. Instead, this is the worst book I have ever read.  It is too basic to be of any use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a fan of Dostoevsky for a long time. This is a disappointing work.  The story starts out fine but falls apart in the middle.  It is really boring.   Dostoyevsky's greatest work is the one where he's a good guy who does a bad thing and gets away with it.  I found it interesting that the author is a big fan of this book but then doesn't read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a pretty good book. I don't like to read about war, especially when it is a conflict between humans. The author, like a lot of authors, is writing about her own life, but she does a pretty darn good job.   I do wish that she had written a little bit about the other side of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't care for this book, it's very cliche. The protagonist is a rich man, and all he wants to do is get his money back from the bank. The plot is so lame it makes me want to pull my hair out (but it's only $5,000 and he just wants his money). It also made me feel bad that it cost so much to buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that I like about this book is the cover art.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't have much time for the books of people who make claims about how they will live their lives differently because of their gender. But, unfortunately, I found the first part of this book to be rather lame and I found it frustrating that there wasn't much more of the book after that. I don  It seems to me that this book should have been called "Women, Men, and Children: The New Gender Politics in Feminist Theory." It's a book about gender politics, and that's all that matters. What's interesting is that the author spends a lot of time explaining the differences between the way men and women behave, but fails to get at the differences that do exist. In particular, he's rather vague about the differences in how men and men behave with children. He spends a few pages explaining that it's really men who are the main caretakers for children, and it's women who spend more time with children, but then spends the rest of the time arguing that men and not women are the primary caretasters of children. What about the women who don't care for children at all? Why do they have to be "special" in order to get to the top of the gender hierarchy? It's one thing to talk about how men should be primary carers for children. It's another to talk in the same breath about how women should be the primary caregivers for children as well. This is particularly bad because the author seems to think that the way in which women are treated as a group is a bad thing and he's trying to fix it. He thinks it's better for women to be caretoters and that the primary caregiver role should go to women. He does acknowledge that the fact that women don't want to be caregivers is something that needs to be addressed in some way, but he argues that if we don't fix this, women will continue to be treated badly and be treated like second-class citizens in society. I think it's a shame that he didn't get at some of the deeper differences between how men are and aren't treated in society and in families.   It's not that I'm against the idea that we should have more gender equity, it's just that there are some problems with the author's approach. The book has some nice ideas, but I can't get past the fact it spends so much time talking about how gender should be treated and how women need to be protected from themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was an insult to the intelligence of my fellow human beings. The author uses a variety of words, but only the last one is actually correct. The whole book is about how women are always the ones to suffer. There are no men in this book except the women. They are either in denial or they are victims. There is never a positive male role model in this work. The male characters are never good at anything or even trying to do it. The only positive thing that happens to them is being rescued. I don't get it. This is like a college textbook.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad. It is very badly written, poorly organized and has many mistakes. It has no sense of humor and is filled with ridiculous statements. I can't believe someone thought they were clever. If you read the back cover, it says this is a parody of the "Mysterious Island" books by C.S. Lewis and Stephen King. Well, I guess I won't get that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an avid reader of fiction, and this book was a big disappointment. I had high hopes for this book, and was hoping for a great story. The story was mediocre, the characters were boring and uninteresting, and the plot was not believable.   This book is like reading a bad short story about a guy who can't hit the bullseye,   which I would've expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought I'd read the book by David Duchovny but I can't stand the guy. He's a boring hack and I think he's making himself look bad because he thinks he's a funny writer. His stuff is just so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the book.    The plot was a little too complicated and convoluted to make much sense to me.  I would've preferred the book to focus on the relationship between Harry and Ron. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book until I realized that it's just a book about a man's obsession with sex with women who he calls "cute". The fact that he is not gay at all is pretty interesting in a book with a lot of interesting characters but that's about all I can say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be very boring and dull. The only thing that got my attention was when he mentioned how there were no books in India with a good deal of historical information on the subject. But I found that the material he gave about the Indian history was not accurate and made him seem like a complete and total dolt. I don't even remember how old this book was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am going to start this review by saying that I have not read this book before.  It was one of those "must read" books that I thought I would have to read but I never did.  This is the first book I've ever read that I didn't feel like I knew what was going to happen.  I don't know if that's because I don' t know the characters or if it's because it is a really good book.    It has a good balance of action, mystery, and fantasy, and that makes it a good read.  And I've just read a few more fantasy books in the last couple of years and this is the one that stands out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed reading the book, but I found the plot to be extremely predictable.    I mean, how many times have you read a book where the hero is on a quest, but he gets kidnapped by a monster?   There are a few times in this book that the hero's quest is the main focus, but other than that it's pretty much a standard fantasy quest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a complete disappointment. I bought it based on reviews and my desire to be a medievalist. I was not disappointed. The only thing it does is make me think that I will never read a medieval history book again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A great book, a bad narrator and terrible writing that makes it difficult to really enjoy. The book is about a group of students who play a game called "Brick Mansions" which is a variant on "Turtle" that is played by two people.   The game has been played since the 1700's and has been banned by the police because of its excessive violence.  One of the players is a psychopath and he murders a few people in the game.  He is arrested and he has to go to a mental hospital but there is one problem:   He has a girlfriend that is going to be killed in the hospital by the psychopath.  This is a great book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's about a young girl who is raised in a very abusive household. There's no love, not even a hint of it.   It was a pretty bad book, not worth the time I spent on it, but I'm glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as a Christmas gift and it was a big let down. I expected to be entertained but there was no humour at all. The story was boring and the characters just weren't real to me. I felt like I was reading a bad version of a movie that was released several years earlier. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful.   It had absolutely nothing to do with the book.  It was about a guy that was trying to make some money with a novel.  The idea of a guy trying to sell a novel that is really about the writer's struggles to write.  Why bother with the plot when you can tell a story about a real person.  I'm sure that it is a good book, but there are so many things that made me put it down after reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of the book was about a woman who had an affair with a married man and then ended up in a mental institution after having a nervous breakdown.   It's about how it feels when you're with someone you don't really know, and you're thinking about how to get out of the relationship.  I didn't think about it that much until the end, when the woman, now divorced, goes into her sister's house to do some shopping.  When the sister comes back she sees that she's got a new boyfriend.  My husband and I both had the same experience, but we ended up having a much more enjoyable experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book.    It is very detailed and you learn more about the history of the Church than you would get from a basic book on the history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a lifelong gamer.  The first time I saw a game based on this book, I was a bit skeptical about the story and plot.  It took me about 3 or 4 tries to realize that the characters are really just playing a game.  They do what the story requires of them and that's all that matters.  This book is a little over the top in a lot of areas but I'm still looking forward to reading the rest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was the first time I've read about a good Christian family.   My husband and I went to a Christian camp together and that was the reason I bought the book.  The camp was wonderful.  They had a pool and a volleyball court and a bunch of tents.  It was a good experience and I was impressed.  But it didn't have a lot of detail about their lives.  What little they did have was so short and boring that it was hard to take. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a lot of fun reading this book. However, I think the authors were too literal in their use of the English language. The characters have names that sound like English, but are not really the English words. Also, the writing style is sometimes pretty clunky, but at least the characters are human.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book for a great price. The author makes it very clear from the beginning that he is not a fan of the popular genre of paranormal romance. The romance in this book is so very bad. I can't wait for a sequel where she tries to make it good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so horrible that it took me years to find the time to actually read it. It's so bad that it makes me feel like I should never have had the opportunity to read it in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad example of the type of writing I've come to expect from people with little understanding of the world and no interest in improving it. I found it to be a poorly researched and written book. I'm no historian, but I can't think of a single good reason why someone would bother researching the life of the first pope. I don't know if he was a martyr or a victim, but either way I doubt he would have had the same influence he had in his lifetime if he didn't have the backing of his followers. He certainly was no martyr. The book is mostly filled with irrelevant details about events that occurred before he even became pope. If the authors had bothered to find some original sources, the story would have been much more interesting. The authors also give the wrong date for the election of John Paul II and fail to give an accurate date for his coronation. They also mischaracterize the history of the papacy. The popes had a long and rocky relationship with the pope of Rome and they were very different people. The papacy in Rome was an institution that served the interests of a very small group of people, not the interests and values of the Roman people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors, and has no relevance to the topic of this review. I gave the book 3 stars, because it was interesting and the book was informative, but it just seems like a poor attempt at a book about a group of individuals.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have always loved fantasy. This book wasn't any better than others I've read about the war in Afghanistan. This is what happens when a politician runs for president. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I did not like it. I have read a few books about the Holocaust, but this book was about as good as it gets. The author seems to think that he is giving a complete history of the genocide. In reality, he is just repeating what other authors wrote, and not actually giving any new information. His approach is "this was the genocide" and "this is how the Jews are still behaving" and then goes on to discuss the other Jews who are not as bad as the Jews. The book is full of this sort of approach. I felt as if I was in a school history book and not a history book. I do not know what I am going to do with my life now that I have had this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished reading this book. I was hoping to find something more than a quick, fun read.   This is one of those books that you can just enjoy for the amusement of it.  It's a good laugh.  This book is a very quick read. I think I read it in about a week.  I was not sure what to expect.  The characters were very good.  There is some character development that takes place in this book but the story is very funny and I found it easy to follow.  While I would recommend this book, I found the story lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have heard about the book and its author but never actually tried it. I read it on a whim. It was a good read, but it left me wanting more. I really like the concept of the story and the fact that it is based on a true story, but there is no substance in the story itself. I don't know how this story would make it in a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read and enjoyed several books on the history of Russia.  This book is no exception.    The book is about the last czar of Russia and his family, but it is really about the way Russians thought about the czar.  I would not want to be a Russian person in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  It was really a period of intense hatred and violence.  In the book, there are many examples of Russians saying that they would rather kill the czars of Russia than let them live.  (They did not just say that they hated the czares of Russia.)   This hatred of the czarts of Russia led to a lot of wars, and the deaths of millions of Russians.  There are many horrible things about the Russian czars.  One thing that is really awful about the tsars is that they were so powerful that they could kill anyone who offended them.  But, in spite of their power, they were not very good leaders. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of holes in the construction of the plot. The characters, particularly the two girls, have no discernable motivations. They are only there for the sake of the author's vanity. They do not seem to have any real goals. They just want to be loved by their "sister" (I think she means her father). It was so sad to see the character's life end. The plot is so poorly thought out that it really didn't add anything to the book at all. I found it hard to believe that the book was published in the 70s. The author had so much to say about how women are oppressed that I just found it to be too much. It really was not needed to say anything about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was atrocious.  This is what happens when you write a story that's set in the future.  It's like an early 70's science fiction movie.  There's no story or character development, and most of the story is just the characters trying to find the most logical way to get around a bad situation.  The setting is very interesting and well written but I just could not get invested in it.  Overall it was a very bad book and it makes me sad that I had to buy it to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never been so annoyed by a book before.   The story is interesting, but the writing is just atrocious.  The narrator, who describes his childhood in the south in a way that sounds very much like a Southern preacher, is a bad author.  It's like he read something written by a fundamentalist or some other racist and just started parroting the ideas.  I was expecting to hear some southern cliche but I got nothing.  If he's going to write about the south, why not try something original?  He doesn't.  A horrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just so hard to read and understand.   It is a hard book to understand.   It seems like they are trying to make a point about the importance of understanding how we interpret the world.  But this book has so many problems that it is impossible to get into it.  It seems to be about how people are interpreting and comparing things.  They make this claim:  "We're all so different from other people that the differences between us can seem like they can't be reconciled."  But what they are really saying is "I don't know about you, but I'm just a really bad person."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about the murder of a friend and the man who is sentenced to die for the murder. The first person narrative is written from the point of view of the friend and there is not enough information given to really get the plot going. This story will be of little interest to anyone but a murderer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not get much out of this book.   It was not an easy read but the story was interesting and the characters interesting.  But the plot is a little thin and the character development is not that strong either.  It is a very good read but it is not a must buy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever written. The only reason I read this book was to find out what happened to the people who left the island. I don't think they would have made it without their drugs. I would love to read about the drug addicted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book as a gift for my brother in law. He read it a couple of times, then put it down, but then picked it up and kept reading. Then he said it was "the best book I've read in a long time" (I've read a lot of books in a very long time). This book had very little to do with the real world and was filled with things that made no sense to me. It had a lot to do about how you need to get over your insecurities about how great your life is. It also made a few bad statements about women in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story has a "sketchy" feel to it, and there are a few parts that were not very interesting. It's hard to get the details, like why the kids all got the same test, but I'll try. The test was given by a very nice man, who showed a lot of concern for the kids and seemed very concerned about their future. The kids did better than expected, but only because their mother gave them a few extra questions, so they didn't get the same one twice. This also affected them in a negative way, but they didn  I have to say that I don't think this is a good book for kids. It is a fairly typical story about a boy and a girl that have to get together. However, the story is very odd and doesn't really work. The main character doesn't like his mother and his mother doesn't seem very happy either. The mother's boyfriend is a little weird. The girl, on the other hand, has an amazing personality. I think the story just wasn't interesting for me. It seemed like the main character and the girl were doing everything in their power to keep from getting together. I guess this book is about how people react to their parents.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book. I like it, I'm a fan of the genre. I just don't like the main character.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure what the point is, other than to show that the author of the book is a horrible writer. I don't know how he can't be better at writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor book and a poor book I could not recommend to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a kind of challenge, but it didn't turn out that way. It is a good book but I can't get past the fact that it is based on the movie and not the book. The movie is a little confusing because it doesn't explain why the girl has an orgasm when she is being raped by a man, and it doesn's't explain what happens after the girl's orgasm when the man rapes her. Also, when the girl is being rescued, it seems like she gets in trouble but she doesn't. She is saved and doesn't get in trouble. This is really confusing to me. I don't think the movie did a good job at explaining the book either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. This book is full of inconsistencies, and I have read a lot of horror and mystery books and none of them have ever given me the feeling that they were full of holes or errors. The author just tries to sell this book as a supernatural horror/mystery story. It doesn't work.  I found the book to be a little too slow for my taste.  It is really hard to get into the characters.  The main character is a very boring character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In general I am a big fan of science fiction and fantasy.  However, this book left me cold.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing this book does is give you a very detailed description of how a man who lives on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean is able to travel around the world without having to go through any airport security or any other sort of security measure. It's just not a very useful book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good, but it's all too easy to just throw the characters together and have a happy ending. I don't know how many people will read this book but it was soooo boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because my husband had requested it. I'm glad I did, because this book is terrible.   It's a book that's supposed to be a history of how the American government and military came to be created, but there are so many flaws in it, that the actual history is a little fuzzy.  In the early 1950s, the United States was in desperate financial straits and the military needed to get back into the business. They looked at a lot of options, but none of them looked promising. The idea of a new Army was born, but it took several years to get the Army's funding to match what the Army was paying for it.  The last thing the government wanted to do was take on the cost of the new Army.  Once the funding was in place, the Army got started in 1952 and spent the next two decades trying to get it right.  This was a tough time for the military. The Cold War was getting worse.  When the US became involved in Korea, it was because of that bad situation.  After the Korean War, the military saw their budget cut by a third.  It also had to deal with a new problem:  When they started working with Koreans in Korea in the 1950s they found out they were not as good at learning how to use their weapons as American soldiers were.  They were able to get around that problem by having a Korean officer teach them how to shoot, but that didn't make them any more good at it. The Korean officers were all so bad at shooting that the Korean Army started to take them out of combat units and replace them with Americans.  Eventually the Koreans were out of the Army entirely and the Americans started the Korean Conflict in 1951.  And that was the last time the US Army was involved in Korean war.  So when I heard that the Army created the modern Army with all these new skills, I was pretty excited to read about it.   It was fun to learn about the Army at the time, but the book just didn't add up.  I don't know about the other reviewers, but I didn't really like the book at all.  If you're looking for a fun book about how the Army came to exist, I wouldn't bother with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had really high hopes for this book. It was supposed to be about a black man who was a drug dealer. The protagonist had a good sense of humor and was a good person. I had high hopes. I can't believe that the author used the term "nigger" as a verb instead of a noun.   It was a real disappointment.  It's hard to read about a good guy who isn't that good and isn't very good at anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disappointed with this book. The first 3 chapters are very interesting.  This is the first book I have read about the history of American gun culture.  I was curious about this subject, and I did a search on Google, hoping for a good book.  But the more I read about it, the more confused I became.  It was confusing to me that in the 1800s and early 1900s, gun owners were the target of criticism.  Gun owners were seen as lazy, violent, and law abiding.  How could they be?  This book says they were.  Why is that?  It is so confusing that I have trouble putting it down.  The author says it is a historical problem.  Yes, it is.  However, it also has a lot to do with social changes.  What has changed?  How have people used guns?  I have a hard time believing that gun owners would take a chance on a bad gun that has a few bullets in it.  Then again, some gun owners are good people who just want to make sure their family and friends aren't shot.  A bad gun is not a good gun.  So it is possible that it is just the bad guys that take risks.  As for me, I've seen plenty of bad guns that I'd take a risk on.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the first book in the series to be lacking in story. It was an interesting premise that could have been interesting if it had been a little more developed. It seemed that a lot of the characters were either too much of a cliché or were just completely flat, like a lot o' girls in a bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book. It is well written, has a good story, and I found the humor in it very enjoyable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed with this book, I don't know what to do with myself. The story was so predictable and so badly written, that I was expecting a bunch of ridiculous events to happen in the first half. The only interesting thing I got out of the story was that it had a happy ending. This book was supposed to be a fun read about a guy who is just going to leave his life behind to live with his dog. It wasn't. This is not a good book. It is a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment.   It's a well-written, but flawed, book.  It could have been much better.  The narrator is the only reason it didn't get 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not teach me how to write a successful novel.  It does not show me how my characters would respond to a change in their circumstances.   It shows how they would react to change in the circumstances of other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was in a terrible mood. I don't normally have these kinds of feelings, but I just felt a deep, unshakeable anger toward this book. It was so, so bad, it's ridiculous. It's the kind of book that would make a high school girl scream and swear, but not a highschool boy. It makes me want to punch every character in the face.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total waste of my time.   It is about a guy who does some odd jobs to get by, and does some more odd jobs after he gets a little money from his uncle.  I know a lot of people that do such things as wait tables, work in a lumber yard, work as a cashier, or work as part of a traveling circus.    I have never done any of those things, so I don't know what the big deal is.  He goes on and on about how much he hates his life and how he wants to get out.  I would be glad to just get a job.  There are a few really interesting aspects to this book, but for me it just didn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that does not make sense.   It is a lot like "the story of a person who is not a storyteller", or "The book about a man who is a writer", or even "a book about the guy who writes books".   The story of the author is a man named "George Orwell", who writes about his life in his book "1984".  In the book, he is told that if he were to tell the story of his life to someone, he would tell it differently than he did, and that it would make it more boring.  His book is the "memoir" of this life.  It takes a very long time to get through it.  I'm not going to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very pleased when I discovered that I was one of the "first" people to read this book. This book is well-written, and I was not disappointed at all. I enjoyed reading about the different types of women in the military, and was very intrigued by the details about the way some of them handled the different kinds of "dirty work" they did. The book had many great ideas and examples to draw from. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a terrible disappointment.   It is a very boring book,   written by someone who   doesn't understand what it is they are writing about.  It   is so poorly written   that   it doesn't even have a plot or characters,    and   instead   attempts to   put a positive spin on   the horrible   things that happened   to        .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the style of this book at all. It's very boring. I have no idea why it's called 'A Man Called God' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. I was not looking forward to this one, I mean I had read this book, and I didn't like it at all. But it turns out to be more than I expected.  The story is boring. The plot is not very good.  This is just a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time and effort.   The characters were poorly developed, and the plot was a big load of old wives tales.  The main character, a woman, is basically a female version of the evil witch in "The Wizard of Oz".   It was boring and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was terrible. I was going to read it to my friend who has a lot of mental illness issues.  The book was written by a psychiatrist for people with mental illness, so the book was supposed to be a little more sympathetic.  It was not.   The only thing that kept me reading was the fact that the main character had a great family.  He had an older sister who he loved very much and his mom and dad were really great.  But the rest of the family was so unsupportive and he just felt like he had no family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't enjoy this book. It was interesting, but didn't add anything to the genre.  It's not that it wasn't good, it's that it didn't live up to expectations.  I can see why some people liked it, but it's not my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not bad, it's just not a good read. This is the second time I've read this book.  The first time, it was bad but at least it was interesting.  It was about a group of people who live together in a house on the wrong side of the tracks.  There is a guy who keeps getting in trouble and then getting out of jail and he has a girlfriend who loves him but she is too much for him.  Also the girl is a bit of a bitch.  This book is about the girlfriend.  I can't remember why this one didn't work out but this time it did.  So I have to say I think this was a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of crap. I was looking for a good, well written book to read for a class and this was it. I would never buy a book from this author again. The writing is so bad it makes you question what kind of an author he really is. I'm sure he's good at making money but if he can't write good, quality books for someone who is supposed to be an author, he's a really bad writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting and engaging book, but it is very dry.   I don't think it's worth reading in its current form. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most complete book about the early LDS Church that I've ever read.  In addition, it's a great historical overview.  The Church is a great example of a religious organization that made a bad decision. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a really good read but it was just too confusing.  It seemed like the author took a lot of the material in this book and then used it in a different way.   I thought the author made the book too difficult to understand.  I found myself having to reread it several times before I got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book about a month ago. It is terrible. I'm a fan of books about psychology and how they relate to our lives.  I'm also a fan in general of psychology.  The book doesn't even try to be interesting, just uses the techniques of people who are really good at things to make a lot of money.  This book is filled with lots of little stories about people who have gotten rich using techniques they learned from this book.  All the techniques are lame and stupid, like getting people to tell you they have a bad back by doing exercises that will cause them to injure themselves, etc.  There are a lot more interesting books out there that I'm sure I could have read about.  It is also a shame that this book is about 50 bucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a new reader of this author's writing, and I found it to be quite dry and boring. I did like how the story had a nice mix of humour and sadness in it.  I have a problem reading anything by the author that doesn't have an upbeat ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first experience with a book was a very bad book. I was trying to learn about the history of the early church. It was written by a scholar. It had some interesting things to say about Joseph Smith.   This book, however, is completely flawed.  I am not the only one to think this.  One reviewer in the Goodreads forums wrote:  This is a pretty good history of Joseph Smith, but it is missing the most important thing about Joseph:  His character.  What I like most about the book is that it gives some of the things Joseph was doing before he started being a prophet that are interesting, but not really important.  The book is about the founding of the LDS church and its early history.  It is about Joseph as a young man.  But it is also about Joseph's character.   The first time I saw this, I thought it was a good book but it was not Joseph's story.  This time I read the book and it is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have given this book a lower rating if the first third of the book had been more focused on the science of magnetism.   In that part of the story, the authors seem to think that magnets only affect metals.  This is completely false.  Even if you use a magnetically shielded metal container, it still affects the metal it is in.  In the case of a hardcover book, it may be best to not put a magnet on the cover but to put it on a magnet that can be held to a book in a specific way.  The authors seem more interested in the effect on the magnetic field than they do the effects on the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure why this book is called "The Art of Making Things", but it is. I got very frustrated with the way this book goes about describing the process of making a device. The author talks about the basic elements of a "recipe" and how he "borrowed" from a book about building a clock and some of the techniques that were included in that book. He then went on to say that the clock parts he used were "not as good as the ones I had at school." That's a little ridiculous to me. If someone told me they "borrewed" something from a "clock book" then I would assume that they would have been a terrible teacher (and I'm sure they were). But what I found even more frustrating was the fact that he says he "did everything in the book" (which he obviously didn't) when in fact there were a few steps in the steps that he did not take. The only thing he "used" that I actually didn't use was the screws. I think I'll be trying to make my own clock next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. I've read a lot of stories about serial killers, and I think they are more fun than boring. This is one of the few stories that I actually enjoyed reading. The writing was pretty good. But I have a lot more patience for books that I can finish in a couple of days, and that didn't make me want to finish this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for this book as much as I thought I would. The characters were not interesting, the plot was not interesting (and didn't work at all), and the story just didn't make sense (which makes sense considering the author's lack of experience writing a book).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not read this yet. It is a short, self-published book with no reviews. I don't think it is worth reading. I will wait to see what the book's author has to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so boring.  It just took me forever to understand the plot.    It's a very slow book and I really didn't like how long it took for it to get good.  I'm a big fan of John Grisham, but I just can't get into this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy reading this book. The main character is not well developed. Her life was very happy but she had to face the fact that she had been a drug addict and a thief for most of her life. The book is about her finding out the truth about her past. I was hoping the book would give a better understanding of the author's writing style, but she left out some of the details. I also did not like the character of Mary because she just was too smug and self-righteous.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished reading a book about the life of a "good Christian".  The author's style is a little rough, and it was very easy to feel like the author had something to hide.  I thought that the story would be a little more interesting if it had been told by someone who was closer to the person, but the author didn't even try.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so bored with this book that I can't even bear to put it down. The characters are so annoying and there's no tension in the plot. This book is the worst book I have ever read. I'll stop now. I'm giving it 2 stars for the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book a lot, and it made me laugh out loud a few times, but the ending is a total let down.  The characters are all so clichéd and uninteresting, and the whole story is a farce.  It's so hard to believe that the world is so crazy that these people would put on a show in a casino.  In the end, the show is the most ridiculous thing they ever do.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very interesting look at the development of the American Dream.  The main character is a middle-class black woman, who moved from Mississippi to Connecticut to get a better education.  It is a great read.  I like the way she uses history as a way to understand how we got to where we are today.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last part of the book is a collection of quotes from various famous philosophers. The author spends a lot of time on how we can never know everything. This is very true, but I think that we can learn from other people's mistakes, and that we may be able to change our habits. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of bad ideas that seem to be based on the premise that the world would be better off if it had more people like us who believe what we believe. The authors do a very good job of convincing everyone else in the book that we're a bunch of stupid rednecks that just want to be in charge of our own lives and not depend on government for everything. That's a pretty good selling point to the non-believers in the U.S. as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible! I didn't realize the extent to which it was plagiarized until after I finished reading it. I have read some great books that have been blatantly lifted from other works, but this was a whole different level. I am sure it is not just an innocent mistake. I feel the author should be ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sorry I didn't get ahold of this book sooner. This is one of the few "science" books I have read in the last few years that isn't just a bunch of facts about the universe that are just wrong.   In fact, most of the facts are just completely wrong. For example, one of their examples is that the earth rotates on its axis.  It doesn't.  They also state that the moon is "slightly" farther from the earth than the earth is from the sun.  This is simply not true.  The moon is farther from earth than it is from sun. In fact the sun is "close" to the earth.  I was very skeptical about this book until I went through the "method" of trying to prove their point, and it failed miserably.  If you're looking for a science book that is just right, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but I'm not sure I ever did.   I'm not a big fan of the Harry Potter series, and this one didn't really appeal to me either.  The plot is pretty straightforward:  Harry Potter and his friends go to visit the relatives of one of their classmates.  But the real problem I had was with the author's choice of words.  She uses words like "sickening" and "horrific" to describe the situation, and I just can't get over the fact that they are used in the first person, and not as the person experiencing them.  It's a terrible way to use language.  And then there are the other descriptions.  Some of the descriptions in this book are very graphic, including rape, rape threats, and even the use of objects to commit the crimes.  I would have preferred to see the author use words that would have been more descriptive, like "disgusting" or "appalling".  It also seems like the author was trying to tell a story, rather than trying to express herself.  (I also have to note that I am not a fan of rape, even in fiction, and that this book is very graphic.  Perhaps I am being a little harsh, but the author is not being specific enough in describing the scene, so it seems a little forced.)   Conclusion:  I wasn't a huge fan of this book.  Although it's not the worst book I've ever read, it certainly wasn't the best either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for something new to read, and this was the best book I've found yet.  As an expert on the subject, I found myself very satisfied.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete waste of time.    I don't know how to explain it.  I have been reading this book for the past 2 months.  After reading the first chapter, I felt the same feelings as in the book.  It is really hard to understand anything they say.  So, I am just giving a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of the book is the title. The author is very clear about what his argument is about, and it's not a good argument. He just goes off on a tangent about his father who was a "bad" writer and was fired from a newspaper, and how he wrote his novel because of that. The ending of the story is also a bit strange, as the guy is fired and then gets a job at a newspaper. This is also the first time that the author has really put his own spin on a character and that really adds a lot of character development to the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters were so dull and stupid that I couldn't stand them.    They're like kids, they know nothing but play and want to be heroes.  Read more reviews at The Book Smugglers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had a bad feeling about this book, I would have been able to let go of it by the end.   It is a very boring book, and the ending is not a happy one.  I feel like I have wasted my time reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's good. I can't wait until it gets a bad review from a good reviewer so it can get a good review. It was a really good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love reading books about ancient history, especially history of ancient Greece and Rome.   But this book has so much going wrong with it that I found myself constantly annoyed.  It is so full of mistakes in the research, the writing, the history.  This book is a big waste of time and money.  I hope that someone will put this to rest soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to start off by saying that I love the book and I've loved it for a long time. The story is amazing and so well written. It has so many twists and turns that you don't really know where it's going. I have a problem with this because I've always been a huge fan of books that have so many mysteries and twists.   It is a real shame that the ending is so unsatisfying and the ending of this book was one of the worst parts of it.  The characters were so poorly written that you could hardly care about them. I really wanted to believe in them but that didn't really help them in the end.  I was also disappointed that there was no mention of the evil spirit and what he did to the kids.  In the end I can't help but wonder what the author will do next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a pretty avid book reader, so I'm pretty good at keeping up with the latest releases, but this book was so boring that I just didn't care to read it.   This book was more of a story about a woman who became a Christian than a real, historical account.  And it was kind of hard to care about anyone in a book about a church because the woman in the book (a fictionalized version of a real person) didn't seem to actually care about anything in the church.  This isn't the first book I've read in which the author seems to have written the same book multiple times, but in this one the "stories" kept getting more and more unbelievable.  I mean, just imagine the first thing the first person in this book would do is start talking about how a woman "fell in love with Jesus" and "changed her life" and was "cured" of a disease.  It would be the most unbelievable thing anyone has ever told anyone, but it's actually true.  So this book is a book of a woman's life that starts with a woman falling in love and ending with a girl who's "cure" is to "be a good Christian" (even though she's not even "curing" anything).   And that's not the worst part. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read the book, and the book was awful.    It was a very tedious book that had some interesting things to say about history, but had the problem that all it really had was a lot of good old-fashioned, unadventurous propaganda.    I mean, the book had some great images, but the content was mostly boring propaganda.   It's not a bad history book, but it's not exactly a good one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the best book ever written about how to get rid of a bad boyfriend or husband. I can't say I have ever experienced any of the problems described in the book, but if I had, I don't think I would have gotten a bad guy as a boyfriend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very interesting, but not in the way the book title suggests:  It is the story of a very young child who grows up to become a very evil man.  The reason for this is that he is a product of a family in which there are multiple mothers and he was the first child born in his family to have a single mother.  I understand that there are many different ways to raise a child but the author's version is a bit strange.  He has a very difficult time growing up.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. I have enjoyed all of his novels and the movies.   I was excited to get my hands on the new series.  Unfortunately, I am not impressed.  This is an interesting book that takes place in a future where the government has created a kind of time machine that can travel through time.  However, the machine was not working and the government decided to take everyone's time machine, including mine, and put it in storage.  The book starts with a character named Robert.  Robert is in his late twenties and works in a bookstore.  He lives in a small apartment with his wife and a cat.  It is a quiet, nice neighborhood.  His neighbors are mostly young people.  When I was young and living in this area, I used to be afraid of them because I didn't know them.  I knew my neighbors and their neighbors.  Now that I am older, I find the neighbors more interesting than the neighbors themselves.  But I was afraid to talk to them. The neighbors don't seem to want to talk about anything.  They live in a time when they do not know that they will live through wars.  Their houses are old and they are afraid of the neighbors.    They are all the same and it is a very lonely life.         The book is about how the government created the time machine and used it to take their time machine.  Then they had a huge argument over what they did.  Eventually, the government was forced to give the time machines back to their owners.   Robert gets his time machine back and is allowed to return to his old neighborhood.   I really liked Robert and I wish he had stayed in the time he lived in before the government took it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about the first book in this series, but this one just made me sad. It's hard to get a sense of what's going on in this book.   The characters all act in a way that seems to be based on the old trope of the "good girl", but I can't help but feel that their motivations are so limited. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book about the early days of the Civil War, and a great read at that.   I'm just not sure it is a good historical account.  It is interesting, but a lot of it is just making shit up to justify a war they wanted to start anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book ever. I read it and I felt like a dumbass after I finished it. The story is the worst thing ever, you get a few moments of excitement but it's a one way trip to the bottom of the barrel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a shame that the author's work is so poor. I thought this was a brilliant book.   He has a gift of telling stories about people's lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most annoying thing about this book is that it is completely incoherent and filled with inconsistencies.   "   "I didn't understand how people could do that.  That is just  ..   dumb.  "   The author does not understand how the brain works   or how the body works      It seems to be based on a few short sentences from a bad science book   that was published a few years ago.  This book was not worth the price and will not help you improve your brain, just make you feel stupid  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are all the same, the same type. They have all the typical problems you get with young girls. The father has a big head, the daughter has a bad personality, etc. But the writing is so bad that I had to put it down to read the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's all about the ending.   I liked the beginning of the book, and I thought the characters were interesting, but the ending made no sense to me.  The end of the story has a very weird twist ending. I can't tell if I'm supposed to be disappointed, or if the author just forgot to write the ending he wanted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book.  The only positive review I can think of is that the book was the basis of the movie 'Liar Liar' and is very funny in that respect.  There is nothing in this book that makes sense.  This book is just a horrible piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad read but it's not good either. The plot is very predictable. This is a series about a vampire who is a priest and is very spiritual. I don't know what happened between the last book and this but this is a very slow and dull read. I am not sure if it was the author's decision to not write a good book but I was disappointed with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poorly written book.  The story is a collection of vignettes, each of which is told from the point of view of a different woman.  There is a man and a woman, a white woman, and a black woman, each from a different background, who are going to have a lot of problems getting together.  I don't know why the author felt the need to add a "third woman" to make it "three women in a row" when it was already the first book.   It is hard to see how the author managed to make the white woman "the hero" by giving her the power to be the "strong one" and then to make everyone else seem weak by having them follow her around.   In the end, it all just seems to end up with the black woman getting the short end of the stick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was in college. I thought it was a bit boring, but I enjoyed it, mostly because of the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a good time with this book. I did not have high expectations because it is a children's book.   It is not like any children's story I have ever read.  The story is set in a small town where everyone is an expert at something or another.  When the kids are not learning something the adults do.  At first I thought it was a little lame but then I thought about it.  I can get my kids to read things I don't understand.  Then when I have to get them to read a book they don't really like I know I will have fun with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have no interest in reading anything by this author.  His "philosophy" is simply a bunch of ideas that he thinks people should read.  I find his philosophy a very shallow and shallow concept of human rights.  It is a concept that has been in existence for centuries and has no relevance to modern day life.  This book is not really about human rights but more about human stupidity.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been looking for a good story about a girl's love for a dog since I was in middle school. I bought this book because of the synopsis:  It is a true story about the love between a girl and her pet dog, Binky.  Binky was her best friend when they were young, but after a dog attack in high school, the girl lost her confidence in her pet.  In this story, Binky helps the girl get over her dog attack.  I like the character of the girl and Binky is cute.   It was interesting, but I would not recommend this to my young readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I've ever read. It was very boring and hard to understand. The author uses many of the same phrases as the other bad books by the same author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the least potential to be a good novel, but has the most potential to get worse. The writing style is so dry and boring that I was just looking forward to the end. I got the feeling that she had nothing new to add to the genre and that she just threw in random bits and pieces.   I had to look up a lot of terms in order to figure out what was going on in this book. The whole thing is a mess and not worth the time to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring. The book has a couple of really good stories in it.   The one about a guy that was trying to learn how to play chess but got distracted when a woman walked in was a great story.  The other one was about a woman that got raped by a guy and then he was forced to have sex with her.  I also liked the story about a kid that had a friend that had gotten into drugs and then the kid went to his friend's house and his friend murdered the kid.  Unfortunately, the stories were the only thing that kept me from reading the rest of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't care about the story, I just read it because I like the author's style.   The writing is terrible and I couldn't understand a word of what she was saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not good. The first chapter (of four) was just so wrong and misleading that I felt I was reading a bad joke. The story was so bad, and the book so poorly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part about this book is that it is so well-written.    It's about an older guy who has a wife who is in a wheelchair and a son who is blind.  But the father's wife and son are still there.  And they are really well written.  They are not "nice" people.  It is interesting how many times the father reminds the son that he is the one that has to take care of his wife and his son.  He has to be responsible for his family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book but very long and complicated.   I'm sure the author knows the basics of astronomy but the book is a little overwhelming to follow.   This book is interesting to read because it explains some of the basic principles of astronomy. However the book does not discuss any of the "special" objects like comets or satellites. This is because these are things we can observe and understand using telescopes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason this book is so bad is because of the author. She is a bad author. Her stories are lame and have no life to them.  She makes up for it with her bad spelling and grammar.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first part of this book is quite a fun read. But the second half, where it becomes about the "cursed" and "hacked" internet and how it is used to spy on the world, is a really awful and depressing story.  I wish I had read this book a few years ago, and it would have saved me a lot of time and stress and wasted time on this stupid book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I didn't buy this.   There are so many glaring omissions and factual errors that the only conclusion I can come up with is that someone made a conscious decision to put together a bad read.  The book is so poorly written, and so full of inaccuracies, that it's hard to believe that anyone actually believed it was the first book in a new series.  This is not an enjoyable book, but it's not one that you'll be disappointed with either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first half of this book I was hoping for something interesting but it ended up just being a boring read.   The second half was much more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was interesting, but the story was boring.   It felt like it was trying to tell a story about a real person but it really didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I just want to start by saying that this book is a complete and utter piece of garbage, so bad that I will not be reading a word of it. It's so bad, that it's not even funny. It actually makes me feel that I shouldn't have read it. I can only hope that there are other people out there like me who will never buy any more books by this author. She has nothing but a bad track record and I just can't bring myself to buy any of her books ever again. I've already decided to go back to the original series. The author is clearly not a good writer. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book. This is a horrible book. It is not a good book for anyone to read. It does not contain any information about any real world problems. It has a few good ideas that were completely ignored. It seems like this author has never been on a mission and just goes into the field. It just takes him too long to get there. It makes me wonder what kind of an experience he had in the army. It seemed that he had a very hard time getting into a unit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. It has a lot of good parts, and a lot that's just plain bad, but it's all mixed together in a horrible way. The book is about a guy who lives in a cabin with a girl. He has a terrible cold. One night, the girl has to use the bathroom. He goes to the bathroom to use a urinal and comes out with the worst hangover he's ever had. The girl wants to go to a club and he doesn't want to go with her. He says he doesn,t want to have sex with her because he hates sex, but she thinks he's joking. He doesn't think he is, because he thinks he has a good job. She then suggests going to a movie instead of going to the club. He insists that she go to the movie and that he'll make sure she has a nice time. She says she's a little upset about not going to go the club, but if he wants to watch a movie he can. She decides to go. It's a bad movie. It is about some people that have a great life that's ruined by bad decisions. The worst part about it is the fact that there's a bunch of people who are supposed to be the good guys who are in the wrong, and they just act like assholes. They're not mean, they just want to get what they want. There are two bad guys in the movie, and one of them is in the best place. He's in the cabana. The other guy is a total ass. He just wants to have a good time. The movie is about how good life is if you don't have bad choices, but when you make bad choices it's the worst. I didn't like the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book from a library book sale in order to try and read it while I was out of town for a week, and boy was it worth the money.   It's a very good mystery story with some good characters and I really liked the ending.  However, I think I could have used a little more of the mystery aspect.  It seems to be a lot of setup for the actual story, which I think could have been a lot better had the mystery been more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written, that I had to stop reading it before I even started. I don't care if it was an honest review, because it is still a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the same as   The Big Fat Quiz   and   No Easy Day  . The answers are the same.   I'm so used to reading about a man who takes his kids to a camp for four nights and makes a living by selling things they don't need that   my expectation was met.    What I got was a bunch of kids and a couple of parents who are trying to get by.  I expected more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was terrible. There was no motivation for any of the characters to be a good person.   I was really hoping for a happy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the best beginning of any of the books in this series that I've read.  I'm not a huge fan of the character, but the plot is great, and I'm interested in the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book was interesting. The characters were developed well. I did like the characters, especially the younger one. He didn't come across as a child.   But the last half of book was a mess. The main characters are almost all the same, and I'm not even sure why they're the same. The whole book is just the main characters trying to figure out why they are so different. The author never really explores the reason for their differences. It's just that their parents are different and they have different friends.  :  The main character is in the middle of a love triangle. His girlfriend breaks up with him, and he starts dating a girl who is also from his class. It was interesting that he actually thought about what his parents would think about him dating a black girl, but he was so turned off by the whole thing that he never really thought about it.  That's a lot of bad romance, though. I really had high hopes for the characters. The romance was interesting, but it ended up being really annoying. :  The ending was really rushed. There were so many plot holes that it really confused me. It didn't seem that important to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in the 80's and the plot was the only reason I read it. It was just a bad story. The characters were like they were written by a 3rd gradeer and were written in the most juvenile way possible. The way the kids acted was so stupid and the way the parents acted was like they thought they were going to get their kids into a good school.  It wasn't worth the time I spent on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea of a new religion, the idea of an ideology which can take root in a nation, and can change the very fabric of a people, sounds so much like something that could have come out of a fantasy novel I thought it was an obvious rip-off.   It's the exact opposite of the truth:  I have a very religious and very traditional family and the idea that I could get away with not believing in God is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a big fan of the book and found it very hard to read. I found the book to be very tedious. The plot was very poor. The characters were boring and I felt sorry for the hero of the story because I could not relate to him. I didn't want to read the book. I felt it was an attempt to make a best seller. I really didn't enjoy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book that is written by a brilliant guy.  It is well worth the money, and I am glad I got a copy.  I have never met a professor who is as passionate about their subject as he is about his.  The book is written in an accessible style that anyone could understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very bad book. I'm not sure how anyone could ever find a use for it, except perhaps for someone who's just getting into Buddhism and wants to know how one gets there. It is very hard to follow. You need a good teacher, a good book, and a good mentor to get where you need to go, but you can't have all three.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time and space and I am extremely disappointed in the writing.   I know there are some people out there who like this kind of material.  There are many other books on the topic.  However, for those people who like to read about science fiction and fantasy with some historical background, this is a good book.  This author could have added a little historical background to her book if she had bothered to find it.  The people who wrote the books were probably not scientists, and this could have been an interesting story if it had been told with more care.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not finished this book yet, but I was very disappointed. This is just another attempt to try and make a "great" book into a "perfect" one. It's just not. I will give this book 2 stars, because there are moments in the book that really stood out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed that I did not get to read this book. I loved the book. It is a very good, realistic and dark book about the drug war.   It does have some good parts, and it is a good read, but I was not a huge fan.  It was a bit too long for me to read in one sitting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my 11 year old daughter. She hates reading and she found this book to be very boring. I'm hoping she'll find something to like in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about an old, but still very good man.  He is married to a nice woman and has a very nice home.  This is the only time he has ever had to buy his wife a house.  The problem is that he is never able to spend the money on the house and he is always living with his parents.  I did not like him or think he was good for his family but I didn't hate him either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a fun read, but it is very boring, and the characters were so bland and generic that I couldn't get any enjoyment out of the story. This book was also too short, and I really liked the book series by Robin Hobb.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very well written story about a little girl who gets stuck in the woods at her aunt's house, but has no idea how to get out. She does a lot of digging to find out the right answer to a mystery that has been bothering her for many years. The writing is very good, and the characters are all very well drawn. The characters are funny and endearing. This is a good story that will have you laughing and crying at the same time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a review by a reviewer who stated that he enjoyed this book, but didn't like the fact that the characters were all black.   He didn't seem to like the main character and I'm not sure why.  I found that he didn't even give the main black character the chance to speak.  However, it was good that the main characters had a positive outlook on life, even if it is only through a negative lens.  It would have been nice to see the black characters as people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed.   The book is about a man and his family, his mother and his sister who were abducted by aliens.  It's a pretty common theme in many abduction stories.  The main character, Dr. Krieger, has a good idea of what happened to him.  He was kidnapped by aliens in the 70s and he's been trying to figure out how he got home.  But his sister, a college student, gets very excited about the topic and is obsessed with it.  She spends a lot of time reading about it and even has a website devoted to it.    It would have been interesting to read a book about alien abduction but this one falls flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book, which is about an American Indian who goes to work for a Jewish family in Palestine during the Holocaust, was written as a historical account and not as a political work. It did not discuss any of the Jewish anti-Semitism or the reasons why the Jews wanted the Indians out of Palestine.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   I was expecting a book that would help me with my writing, but I was sorely disappointed.  It made me hate writing.  I don't want to work on a story.      I had been looking forward to reading this book.  There was a lot of good info about writing in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been the cause of many headaches for me. I bought it from a book fair in order to find a good reference book on medieval English history. I found it extremely difficult to understand the book because of the heavy use of historical fiction. The main character in the story was very annoying and he had no idea of the real history. The whole thing reminded me of the movie "War Horse". The ending was very unsatisfying because I felt like the main character was a fraud.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really like this book. I've been looking for something that would explain my relationship with my dad (my dad's parents divorced when I was in college) and this book doesn't do that very well. He seems like a good guy but he doesn't really talk about that time in my life very much. I found it hard to connect with him.    The main character, who I'll call Nick, is a college student who just moved to Seattle. He's been trying to find a girlfriend to help him get through his classes. He talks about his parents a lot, but there was a lot of information that he didn't bring up in that book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring. I'm a history buff and was really hoping to get a good perspective on WWI. Instead, I got a history of the whole war that is more interesting than the war itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last book I ever bought was "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat". I read that and loved it.   This is the same book, and a worse one.  This one was written for kids, and it's written in the style of a "funny" cartoon.  In this book, a boy is told he can fly by saying "I can fly, if I try hard enough"   It's a good cartoon, but there are a few things wrong with it. For one thing, he doesn't fly for long, and his parents get the wrong idea, because he's not a pilot.  Also, his mother thinks he's a bad pilot because he doesn't want to fly, and he wants to fly because he wants his parents to notice him.  If he was a pilot, they wouldn't notice him, and if he wanted to fly he'd have to fly harder.  The other problems with the book are the plot (which is bad, and not in a good way), the characters (they're not that likable), and the plot twists (which are way too predictable).   Overall, this book is a bad idea that has no merit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book interesting but did not like it at all. The author does a bad job of writing and explaining things that are not important to the story. Also, I think the author should have given the characters their own names and not just one word descriptions that could be translated to the same meaning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible.  I don't like the idea of people being brainwashed.    The author is so un-educated about what is true and what isn't that he makes a mountain out of a molehill.  If you are brainwashed by a bad teacher you will never learn.  In addition, he makes all of his points without any evidence.  He uses phrases like "it's just what I was taught" and "this is what I've been taught".  I can't stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book at all.   It's really hard to read a book about a fictional character who is supposed to be real and have a good personality who just can't seem to do anything right, so that the only person you care about is the character and that you can't relate to him or her at all, or that she's so crazy she can't even get a job or find a guy who actually likes her.  He also seems to be really angry and bitter about a lot of things, so I'm sure that makes it harder for him to be a decent boyfriend.  The ending makes no sense to me either.  It seemed to be some kind of "You can't make me, so you'll have to kill me" kind of ending.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good way to end a story, especially a story about a character who's supposed to come to life and have all these cool powers and stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has some really good ideas about how the modern media is going to destroy us. It's a pity that the book is written in a way that doesn't seem to have any effect on people's actions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you can't find the one good thing about this book, it's the ending.    I've never understood the desire of authors to write books in which the ending is so happy.  Even if it is a happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a great idea to make a book on the history of the church and the founding of the Mormon Church. But the writing is so terrible.   I don't think they are trying to make the story of the Book of Mormon come alive.  It just sort of happened.  I think that the book was written by someone who was not a scholar and the research that is in it is just not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read. This is bad in many ways.  The author tries to tell the story of the story by writing about it, but it is not really a good book.  There are many inconsistencies, and the author does not give the reader enough time to get to know the characters.  She is not very descriptive in her description of the world.  Also, the world is very confusing, which I think is a great idea to put in a fantasy book, but is a bummer when it is used in a book that is supposed to be set in a real world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this is a bad read. It's not that it's a bad story, but that it doesn't give the reader a true feel for what life is like in the modern world. It doesn't take a deep dive into the psychology of a modern society to see that this is not how the world has always been.   It's so obviously not the case that it seems more like the author's trying to be funny, instead of giving a true reflection on how life has changed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author writes in a very academic style but is so out of touch that it's not even clear to what degree he is a "researcher" or not. It's more of a "sociology of writing" kind of book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an avid reader, and I'm a sucker for mysteries. I'm also a sucker when they're badly written.   This is the second mystery I've read by Jodi Picoult, and it's the worst one I've ever read.  This book is just not good.  The characters are very one-dimensional.  Even the villain is a one-note jerk.  As a result, the reader has no emotional attachment to the characters.  I can't see how this book can get a 6. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a good book but it was written in a bad way. The author is very emotional about his family and how they have changed him. The problems with his dad that he talks about is the main problem with the book and the main reason I was put off by it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am glad I didn't buy this book as I thought it was so bad I would never buy it again.    This book has a few good points.  I like that it gives a good description of the way some people behave, but it misses a lot of other good points, such as the bad behavior of those who do not obey the law, especially when the law is unjust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like this book at all. I'm a fan of the original series but this book really doesn't feel like it's a continuation of the first two books. The main characters are in a horrible situation that's so bad it's funny and the book doesn't seem to care what they do.   I was expecting the last book to be a lot better but it's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a problem with this book. The author uses the term "narcissistic" to describe the main character, but it just doesn't fit the picture. The main character in this book is a sociopath, not a narcissist. He is a "super-person" who has an "emotional intelligence" and has a "neurotic" personality. He uses drugs and alcohol to control his emotions and is very good at manipulation. But he is not an "idiot" or a "loser". He is very smart and manipulative. His personality is the exact opposite of that of a narcissic personality.   The author is trying to use the term to describe a character who is not "normal" but is "different" in a way that is "superior" and "unique".   This book is just not good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never read any of the books in this series, but I read the summary, which was accurate. It's a fun little book, but it didn't have the depth I expected. I'm glad I got the book though, just to get a glimpse of the world and some of the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a shame that this book has been lost. This is a wonderful collection of poetry about growing up.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not worth the $12 it cost to buy it.   The book does not give you any details about how to perform the technique in a good way.  You are told that the best way to improve is to use the technique with other people.  But you are not told what techniques to use with each person, and when you do that the results are mediocre.  And even when you get the techniques down, they aren't the ones you are looking for.  So this book is really just a book of exercises that the authors use to get themselves out of a bind.  The whole book is very much about the authors using the techniques to get laid.  There is a lot of discussion about how you should dress and how you can get girls to like you.  It is almost like the authors are doing the best they can to get a "couch surfer" mentality.  I would have spent more time reading a book about how it is possible to get into a relationship and how to do it without being a complete loser. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an amazing read. The story is amazing, the characters are believable, and the story has a good plot. I highly recommend this book to all fantasy lovers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe this is the third book in a series. The first two were so well written that I wanted to read the next book right away.   The third book has no plot.  I don't know if it is a bad thing, but it is just not the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know why anyone would read this book.  The main character is an ugly old woman who talks in a very unnatural manner.  And the dialogue is terrible.  It's so bad I don a little smile when I read it.  I hope the author reads this and makes a good change to her writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very boring book. The characters are all so much like each other that I have a hard time believing the author has read anything of this genre before. I read a lot about the subject matter, but I found this book boring and did not enjoy reading it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really want to love this book but i have never been able to put it down for more than a day, and I've already read the first two books in this series (though i don't think they are particularly good).   It's a little frustrating because I have to wait until I get home to read the third book (the next one in the series, the first one is great but it's not the same) and I don't really care much about the first or second books because they're just so good   .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds this book boring and poorly written. It has a very poor ending.  You get to the end and you think: "Well I'm done.    This is the last time I'll read this book."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoy the stories and characters in this book. They are very interesting and relatable, and are all very different. There are three main characters, a woman, a man, and a child. Each of them have their own story to tell, which is what makes them so much fun to read.   Unfortunately, the story does get repetitive, especially towards the end.  I know that they want to be realistic and give the audience what they feel like the story deserves, but it just doesn't work.  It's hard to feel good when there are three different protagonists who don't seem to have any sort of connection or emotional connection.  In fact, I found the two male characters more interesting.  I don't think I would recommend this book to someone who is a fan of The Dresden Files series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book that has nothing to do with the subject matter. The author has a poor grasp of both the psychology and the mechanics of being a parent. The book is about a mother who has a very difficult time with her daughter. This book was not very helpful. It just gives advice and never provides anything that is useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the fact that it is a self-published one-man show. If the book was good, it would have been a best seller.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first 3/4 of the book were very good. However the last third was just as boring and predictable as the previous 3/5 of the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book about how to be a successful artist.   The story is told from the point of view of the main character and it's a terrible story.    I would have much preferred it if he had actually been able to draw something that was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't normally read science fiction but I found this book to be very interesting. The author seems to know a lot about the science and technology behind this kind of technology. There was a lot of research on this subject, which I'm sure makes this technology very practical and realistic. The problem I had was that the main character was just an old woman who didn't know much about science or technology. She had some really cool gadgets and gadgets but they were a bit too advanced for me. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed the book. I did not like the plot. I felt like this book should have been about a character who was so good at a game, they didn't even need to practice, but instead, they got to practice a lot. I thought it was a little too easy to say something like "he was the best at this game ever!" or "he could've done this better." It was like watching a video game that someone made, and didn't get to play, but is so fun to watch the people play it, they can't help but play.   It's sad that there was no discussion about the difficulty of the game. That would have been interesting to read. I'm glad the story was fun to read about though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that people think "I want to like this but I can't".  It's just a lot of information that I don't really understand.  It is a good book if you are looking for a bit of history but for me it's not a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about this book when it was published. It's about the same time as my first book, but more detailed and in a more accessible form. I was also excited to see that the author was still a student.        The main thing that I have to complain about is that the book is too long.        
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of space and time. It is a textbook about a game that was so bad that it had to be pulled from shelves because of poor sales. The basic concept is that you play a medieval fantasy game as a female elf called a paladin, but she gets to play as a knight of a different type. She gets to use a sword and shield instead of a sword, and the game is all about her. In addition, it is all over in 5 pages. I think it's bad for both the character and the book: if it was all about the character, it wouldn't be a problem. If it was about the book, I would be very upset.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book because I'd heard a lot about it on the radio. The story is really interesting, and it has a bit of humor in it. However, I really wasn't enjoying the story that much. The main character, I believe his name is, was a bit too eager to find his dead father and get back together with his mother. I also found the main character's behavior a little bizarre. He seems to believe in a lot of superstitions, and his beliefs have a lot to do with a book that he's read, which is the work of an "anti-psychiatry" person. This guy doesn't seem to have a grasp of the basic concepts of psychiatry, but he's trying to get people to believe his beliefs. I guess I just found it to be a little odd that he was so eager to get back into his mother's life, because I can't think of a reason why he would want to get to know her. I don't think the author was trying to make a point about the dangers of psychiatry or the power of superstition, but I'm not a doctor and I don;t want to be told about my problems by a bunch of mental health patients.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was really hard to read, but I'm glad I finally did because I really liked it.  The narrator is really bad, and her voice is really weird.  This narrator is better off in a different book, and I'm not sure how that works out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was interesting at first, but then the characters just kept coming back to do the same things.  The only character that was interesting was the villain (though I liked him) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book about religion. This is a book by a professor that is trying to make a case against religion.   It's about a professor who is making a case that religion is stupid.  That is not good science.  This kind of book is used in the "studies" section of the new edition of the Encylopaedia of Religion  (I have no idea how old this is), and it's just another attempt to prove that religion (specifically Christianity) is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love how you talk about things that are so obvious that you can't miss them. It just makes me so sad when people use their smarts and skills to try and figure out things they should not be doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most disapointing books I have ever read. The story is interesting, but the writing style is awful.   The characters are either bland or annoying.  They have no personality.  It's very hard to take a character seriously.  I would be willing to give it a 4 star rating if it wasn't so disapointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and got a headache for days after finishing it. This is a very confusing book to follow. I kept getting sidetracked, and then I lost interest because the story was just a bit too complicated.  The characters were very poorly developed, and the whole thing just seemed like a way to put in some extra cash for the author.  It would be interesting to see how the authors would have liked to get paid for this book, or if they have any other ideas for the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad fantasy book. I don't care what the author says about the world in the book, it's just a fantasy world with a lot of flaws. This is why I don?t read fantasy: it?s so much trouble getting the world right. I like my fantasy worlds to have magic and dragons, and the author gives them both in this book. In addition, I don,t care about the other characters: their motivations are so unclear and there are so many plot holes that they're hard to take seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible! It was poorly written, it was repetitive, and it didn't even make sense!   It took me forever to figure out why I wanted to be a "vampire" instead of a "brave man"!  The plot is a little convoluted, and the book ends on a cliffhanger, so you're left wondering if the book is ever going to get better or not.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is that the author says things that are simply not true, like this: "The first time I ever took a math test, I failed and was told I was not good enough.   I took another math test the next day and passed.  It's very clear that this book was written by someone who is incompetent."   It is not clear to me that she was trying to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a group of friends and a few friends who were involved in a fatal car accident. The story is about how they were able to survive. The book is about them getting back together and being a family again.  It's about a time when they were in college and didn't have much money, but it's a very touching story about how that is something they can bounce back from.  This book is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book, as bad as a bad novel can be. There is so much "there but for the grace of God go I" in it that it becomes a drag. There are so many twists and turns that it's hard to follow. The whole thing is ridiculous. A great way to kill a good idea is to make it a good way to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with what it is about. I was expecting a more traditional, realistic novel with a good story, but this is a very strange book with a lot of confusing events.  It starts out with a woman having an affair with her husband's secretary.  They are not together.  I know the woman is not a woman of means, but still I think that it is inappropriate to have a married woman having a sexual affair with a secretary.  But the main plot point of the book is that the woman decides to run for political office.  She meets a guy who is a "fascinating" politician who is very charismatic.  And she ends up winning an election.  But this is not where the book takes off.  The next few chapters are full of conspiracy theories about her and her husband.  After all, she is not an official candidate.  Now the reader is wondering who is going to be blamed for all this.  Is it really her husband?  Is she just making all this up?  Or is she really a good politician?  There is so much to think about here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for a course in science fiction and I liked it. But I think it's a very poor way to teach this.  The author doesn't really go into a lot of detail about how a ship and its crew are affected by the crew being exposed to strange alien beings who may or may not be responsible for the strange deaths in the ship's crew.  And it doesn't help that the aliens are almost completely invisible.  I would have enjoyed reading more about how the ship crew are able to adapt and live in this new environment (or even more about the weird things happening in the crew).  I could see a lot in the book that could be used in a real life situation.   12 of 14 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the only book I have read by a known, known, and very well-respected science fiction author. I was very disappointed with this book.  It was an unoriginal, poorly written book that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  I feel like it was written by a very angry person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really want to read this book, and I had already read it in one form (in an earlier version of this review I made the mistake of comparing the book to The Handmaid's Tale, when it was really an earlier draft). But the book has such a bleak, pessimistic tone that I couldn't stop. So I went in looking for a light hearted, entertaining book that might give me some hope, but it didn't do that for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book, which will keep me from reading any more books by this author. The characters are all so stupid, and the plot is so bad that I don't think it will have much of an effect on the world around the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book. I'm a big fan of the original book and this book was just a very poorly written book.   The main character is a girl that is raised by a bad family. When she becomes a teenager, she meets the main character, who is the daughter of a very rich family. Her mother is an evil person and her father is a good person, but her mother is very jealous of her and the main characters parents. The main character also gets a bad reputation as she's "bad". Her mother's bad reputation gets the main charactar fired from work. The characters parents try to help the main girl become a good mother, but they all end up hurting her by getting her fired. The book is about her mother getting revenge for years of abuse.   "They had been her friends. She had been hers. It was a shame to have lost both. She knew the pain in their eyes, and she hated it. It made her feel sick."   What did I like about the book:   1. It's a story about bad family life. It has a happy ending.   a) The main characters mother tries to get revenge by getting the main Character fired from her job.   the main charachter doesn't think she can do it. b) The story is about how she can't be good and has to go to therapy to learn how to be good.  : I'm not a fan of this book because I don't think the main main characters mom can get revenge on the main Characters parents.   of the characters parents:  . They are the parents of the main Charachter, and they try to do their best to help her become a better mother. but they can't and they get hurt by it..   : the story is really about her mom not being good and she gets in a lot of trouble because of it.   and the book ends with her going to therapy because she's not good enough at being good. She needs to be better at being bad.  .. I'm disappointed that the main story isn't a happy one. I like the book but I didn't like it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like this book at all.  I think the writer's point is very well taken.  It's like a "troubled teenager" story about a high school student who doesn't like to study and just wants to have fun.  But the story lacks the "toughness" that I like in a book.     4 of 5 stars:   I have to say I really liked this book. I thought it was interesting.  Although there is some violence in the book, it's very light-hearted.  This was the first book I read about a young girl in high school.  The author does a great job of describing her as a girl who doesn the act of sex and does it all the time, but doesn't really have any real sex life or a "girlfriend."  I thought the author did a good job in showing the girl's personality.  Unfortunately, I think this book is going to be a classic in the future.  I think it's a good idea to read a book like this one to get a better understanding of a character's character and then to read it in a different setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book.  The writing style is horrible, the characters are boring, the plot is contrived, and the ending is stupid.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute nightmare. It has nothing to do with science.   If you don't understand the scientific method, then you are not really interested in science. I was hoping that it would be a simple explanation of the basic laws of physics, and instead it is a bizarre tale of an odd little guy who was so obsessed with physics that he wrote a book about it.  He claims that he is the greatest physicist in the world.  It has little to do.  If the only reason you need to understand something is to write a book on it, then I guess you should write a science book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a lot of non-fiction and this book is just the worst. I would have given it a 1 star but the author doesn't seem to have read any books about the subject at all. The book is about a former drug addict who got clean, got married, and now works as a social worker. He has problems with alcohol and the police. In the end he is charged with possession. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an absolute disaster. It has a poor plot, a poor idea of what is going on, a bad and very biased narrator, and a completely ridiculous ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible piece of shit. It is written in a childish way, with little to no real knowledge or experience on the subject. The author is just trying to make a name for himself by writing something stupid. It doesn't get any better from here, the author just goes on about how "I can't even get into a new car" and "I am too busy getting drunk to be a good mother" (I'm sure there are worse things to do) but that's just my opinion. This book will just annoy you until the day you die.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at a bookstore.   It was ok, nothing to write home about, but the book was not worth the price of admission. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was just boring. It had the same ideas from the beginning to the end. I've been thinking about this book a lot. I read a lot of books. I like to read books. And I like the idea of reading books. But I'm just not interested in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very boring book. It was written by an author with a lot of other books to write. The only thing that interested me in it was the story about a girl who has to go back to school after her father is in prison. It is so boring that I had to stop reading and get another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just another book in the collection of the "Masters of the Universe"   I've already read and enjoyed   If you're a fan of   The Lord of the Rings,   Game of Thrones, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this book would be a useful introduction to an important concept.  The concept is a great one, and it is worth it to understand it.    Unfortunately, it is very poorly done, and I was disappointed in the execution of the concept. It is hard to read, and sometimes it seems to take the author's own words and rewrite them.  I also found the use of pictures, particularly those of flowers, annoying.  It was difficult to figure out why she felt that the flowers should be "beautiful" if they are just leaves.  This is not a problem that I will encounter when reading other books by the same author.  Overall, I felt that this was a poor book that does not justify the author or her work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book twice already but I will only read it once more to understand the plot. I've read this story before in the first book and was interested in reading it again, but I find the story to be lame. The author should write more complex and realistic stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a bad read. I don't know why, but I thought that it would be a nice story about a boy who is an orphan. However, I didn't like the character development that he got. He was supposed to have a good life growing up, but then it turned out that he was a total jerk. I'm sorry, but there is a huge difference between a little jerk and a complete asshole.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not even sure if this is a book.   It's not very good.  The characters are just a bit too one-dimensional, the dialogue a little too predictable, and the plot is just a little flat.  I have no idea what's going to happen next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book very confusing. It starts out with a good explanation of the evolution of the word "cute" from the word it is derived from, cuckoo, to the term we use for cute animals, cute kids, etc. Then, the author takes us on a journey into the history of the English language to prove that "cutes" is not an old word at all. She claims that in the 17th century, a writer named William Shakespeare coined the word, and the Oxford English Dictionary lists the earliest recorded use as 1701. She then explains that in 1670 the word became associated with the French word for "foolishness," and then a century later, it started showing up in American literature. She goes on to say that by the 18th century "cuteness" was used in various English-language works and was widely accepted as a synonym for "covetousness." Now, she claims, it is all over, and she wants the reader to think she is wrong. But, there is nothing in the Oxford dictionary to support her theory. And, if you are really confused, there are plenty of references to other sources to prove she is not. I was surprised that I couldn't find anything in the OED that supports her claim that the word was invented by Shakespeare. I would like to see a good, solid, scholarly book that could be used as a reference on this subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a book about the rise of Christianity and the persecution of the early church, but this was more like a re-telling of the origin of Islam and the origin and early growth of the Muslim faith. It is more a historical piece than a theology book, so you'll learn more about Islam and its religion than you will about Christianity. I can't imagine how many Christians have bought this book because it is a great way to educate them on the history of Christianity in the Middle East.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a terrible book. The story is really weak. The characters are stupid, they make mistakes, the plot is badly executed, the main character is a jerk.  It's a bad, bad book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure why so many of the reviewers have a negative view of this book. This is a very good book, but the plot is too convoluted. If you like science fiction, you will like this. If not, it is too far out there for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a science fiction fan, and this book was so bad that I just threw it out. I'm still thinking about it, and the way it was written made me feel like a fraud for spending money on this crap. I hope the next one is a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written in a very strange style. It's just like a bunch of different writers tried to write a book. It has no point. I would have preferred a story about a kid that doesn't know what a vampire is, or something like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not good.  It was not entertaining either.    The only thing I can think of is the fact that it was written by a white guy.  The author was so afraid of writing a book that is not white.  I just don't know why he wrote a book about his life that is all about white people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one of the most painful reading experiences I've had in a long time.   It made me feel so ashamed of my ignorance.  It's like a kid trying to explain why he did something wrong.  I've never been so frustrated with a book as I was with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband is a good reader.   He bought this book for me.  He loves the book.  But I did not like the writing style of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the Holocaust written by a non-Jewish person would not have the power to offend anyone.  It is true that the book is about the Jewish experience in World War Two but I can't see how this is relevant to the Holocaust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have been happier if I didn't have to buy this book! I'm a writer. I read a lot. I have read the whole of A Confederacy of Dunces and I've read it again. I know I am going to hate this book, but I couldn't resist. I guess it was a gift that kept on giving.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is an interesting read, but it just doesn't really add up.  It's about a guy who has a hard time being intimate with women, but still wants to get a girlfriend.  I've been in a few long term relationships with women who were not comfortable being intimate, but I've also been in ones where I have.  So I'm not a big fan of the way it's written.  The "romance" is really just the guy trying to get laid, and then he has a crush on a girl.  (This is a very common theme in romance, but also not a good way to be romantic.)  It also seems to have a little bit of a plot hole in that the guy is also in love with the girl who is trying to be intimate with him.  This is a problem in most romances.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a bad story. It's just not very good.   There are several points in the book where there is a lot going on. The first chapter is about a family in a small town that has to deal with a murder in their midst. The second chapter is a long discussion about a "vampire" who is living in the house.  The third chapter is really about the story of the vampires.  And the last chapter is just about the vampire.  These are really good, well written, stories.  But when they all come together, they don't really come together.  They just end up feeling disjointed.  I know they are trying to use the story to illustrate some of the ideas about religion in modern America, but it doesn't really seem to be working.  It's not just that they are telling the story in such a disjunct way that the reader can't really connect.  There's no one thread tying the stories together.   This is just a series of very good stories that have nothing to do with each other.  (view spoiler)   (hide spoiler) I read this book at the end of a long week.  My mind was on a lot of other things.  As a matter of fact, I was reading a book that I'd just read that morning about the "possessive" nature of God, and the importance of faith and trust.  On top of that, I'd read a few articles about the Bible and how Christians don't have to accept it, just as many articles about how God is very jealous.  With all of that in my mind, I just wasn't paying very much attention to this book.  Sure, there were a few things in it that I did understand and agree with, but I wasn't really sure what they were.  When I finally got to the part where the "vampires" had to find a way to survive and find their way back to the land of the living, I finally started to understand why it had taken me so long to read it.  After reading about the evil in the world, the book really hit home for me.  Now, I'm not saying this book is a good representation of Christianity.  This book is very much about the world and how it can be a difficult place to live in.  While it is true that this book could have been about any other religion,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment to me. The author has a knack for making it sound like the characters are not smart enough to handle the situation. I really don't care what happens to them because I'm not a big fan of the idea of these people being so stupid as to think that this is a good idea to sell to kids.   They just don't seem to understand the concept of "not being able to do everything that is asked of you" which seems to be the theme of most of the other children's books out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just plain stupid. It is the typical "we need to make our society a better place to live in" type of "what we need is a better system to make it easy for people to get along and work together" nonsense that we see all over the place.  I hate this book with a passion because I would like to see a society in which people can't get mad at each other because of what they have or have not done in their past.  It would also be nice if people had a little more respect for each other, because that is a hard thing to get when people have to live together in a society where it is the norm to be able to get away with anything.  As it is now, it is not possible for a person to have the respect of his or her neighbor without the other person having to show some respect to the person that has shown some respect.  This is why it is so important to get the message out that no one is above anyone else, even if you have done a lot in your life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is very smart. I like the book but I found myself bored by the end. The book was too short to be anything but a "walk through" and I am not sure if the book is worth the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author makes some claims, but I don't think any of them are very likely to be true.  The first book ( The God Delusion ) has some good points, but the second ( The Evolution of God ) is just bad theology.  I was not a big fan of the second book, but if you like the first book, this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been a big disappointment.   I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Paul L. Gebhard, who is one of the finest and most important psychologists alive today.  I thought he had done a fantastic job at writing about what a typical human being can learn about life.  Unfortunately, I have not found much evidence that he is right about human behavior at all.  If I were writing this book, I would have focused on the negative aspects of our personality traits, rather than the positive.  The book is full of examples of bad behavior that we tend to repeat:  It is common for people to overcompensate by seeking extra-physical stimulation,   which is usually not enjoyable.  This often results in problems with anxiety and panic attacks.  We all seem to need an escape, and are constantly searching for something to do to feel more in control.  In the end, we become trapped in our own neuroses, and our lives are dominated by our fears.  Some people are so caught up in their problems that they never learn to take a step back and observe how they are impacting other people.  Others try to solve every problem by themselves, which often results with them being hurt by others, who are simply too self-centered to see that they are hurting.  There is much talk about the need for better education and better mental health, but most of the time the solution to a problem is not that simple.  Dr. Gevhard is right that we need to be mindful about our behavior, but he does not seem to have the solution that we are looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why anyone would want to read this book.   This is a book about an   psychopath,   who has been in prison for more than 30 years.  The book is about his life from birth until his current life, and it's only about about   that.  This book is only about his  bad   life,  and it doesn't say much about his good life, but it's about him bad .   And it's not a very good book.     1/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book. I thought the story of the dog had a bit more depth to it than it did in the movie.   It's like when a writer gets stuck in the middle of a book about dogs.  He tries to make up for it with the movie, but I'm not sure he's able to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the book, but had some major problems with it.  First, I really disliked the author's tone.  I've come to realize that when writing a bad story about a terrible person, there's a lot of tone deafness in the way she writes.  When she says "He was in love with me", I felt like she didn't even bother to learn her own dialect or the proper way to use the word "love".  Second, I'm really not a fan of the romance between the two characters.  It felt a bit forced to me, like they were really just in love.  The author does try to hide the fact that it's a love triangle from the reader, but it's still a pretty terrible plot device.  Third, I found that there were many places where the author got things completely wrong.  In the first book, when she says she had to leave the city because of a dangerous disease, I was left with the impression that the disease was actually contagious.  Now, I know that the city wasn't really that dangerous, but I felt that if the author had just said that the virus was contagious, it would have been more believable.  Fourth, when it was revealed that the villain had been hiding in a museum, I just found it a bit off-putting.  She was able to trick the reader into thinking she had actually been to the museum when in fact she had been to another city, and it just seemed a little too convenient.  There were also some things about the plot that I just didn't care about, such as the villain being so incredibly boring.  Overall, I still enjoyed the book though.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was great, but not the book I expected it to be. The author describes how she learned about a "natural" cure for cancer and then tried it. It didn't work. She eventually discovered the real cure was to get the tumor removed and to prevent it from coming back.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had just finished this book when I got a call from a friend of mine telling me that the author, a fellow of my religion, had said something about this book being anti-religion and had asked the publisher to take it out. She was upset by it, but I was not. This book was not anti-religious, it was about the fact that religion is an illusion. If that is your definition of the word "religion", you can't have it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad it was almost a comedy! I read it to the kids as a Christmas present and they laughed so hard I could have cried!  They were the ones who were the most confused about how to read it.  I'm going to give it one star, but only because it was a good surprise gift for my daughter, who has already started reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad, it hurts me to read it. It was written for people who have no idea what a good book is like, and it is just plain awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author spends a lot of time telling the reader how wonderful she is and how she's perfect for you, but she's wrong about you.   Her parents had a good life when she was growing up.  They weren't rich or well off, but they were good parents.  She's a pretty good writer as well, but her stories are really poor.  Her descriptions are awful.  I thought it was a really bad read, especially when it comes to how she portrays her own family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had been able to get my hands on this book in the early nineties, I would have loved it. I've read it in a few editions but never liked it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been wanting to read this book for years, but I've never been able to find a copy. Now I finally have it.    This book is filled with stories about people who think they are smarter than they really are.  Some people say they don't need to worry about what people think of them because they are smart enough to know that people think differently about them than they do about themselves.  I agree that a lot of people who are very successful, and get a lot done in a short time, don't really know that they are.  But then, I don't think I'm that smart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book! I have read several books on the subject and this is my favorite. The author, who I have met at conferences, is a terrific writer, and has made a tremendous contribution to this field.    I would recommend this book to everyone interested in the application of logic to biology and/or the philosophy of science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to recommend a book that tries to teach kids about sexual orientation.    It's the sort of thing a child might find interesting, but the teacher's tone is condescending and patronizing.  The whole thing is also confusing and over-long.  I was also frustrated with the author's assumptions about what the book should have said. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.    The entire story line is a joke and the book itself is an obvious copy of a film that came out in the early 80's called       The Last Days of the Third Reich  .   In the movie, Hitler's troops go into Poland and get slaughtered by a Polish army that is much better at fighting than Hitler's.  I've seen the movie many times and it is still hilarious.  The only reason that this book is not a total bust is because of the plot and the fact that it was published in 1983.  If this had been written in 2001, I might have given it a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a very long book, about the same length as The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It was filled with a lot of details, but it felt like a lot more was going on. The only things I liked were the descriptions of the "new" Roman city (and the "relics" and "museums" and the other stuff) and the "ancient" (really ancient) Roman Empire. The rest was kind of a bore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  This is not a bad novel.  It's not bad in the sense that it doesn't make me want to read more.   I'm not looking forward to reading a third of it, but I'm glad I picked it up and have the pleasure of reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love the idea behind the book and the concept of how people can fall into habits, but I just felt the whole book was wrong about all the important stuff. The book said that you can't expect to make money by having a good business plan or investing in a good company. The thing that I find most interesting about the book is that it makes a ton of money off of the idea that people can't have a good plan, but will make money with a good idea. It makes me wonder what else they are going to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know if the book was written by a person with schizophrenia or by someone who just doesn't like science fiction. The plot of this book is about an alien, who goes to a planet to find out what is going on and what it is about that is so important to them. Unfortunately, the aliens have nothing to tell the humans about their planet.    They just show them pictures of a planet and then leave.  The people who live on that planet are completely obsessed with their planet's history.  I don't understand why they would waste time studying pictures of the past.  It is a waste of time, energy, and resources.  As for the aliens themselves, they are kind of boring.  They are not intelligent and they can't speak.  Their language is very simple.  But I guess that is what you get for being able to talk to a computer.  At least they are interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was a bit silly but the ideas were interesting. It was fun and easy to read but I couldn't get into the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book about 3 times before I got around to it.    As the title says, this book is about a girl who is taken from her mother at an early age and raised by an orphanage.  The book is told from her point of view.  At the orphanage she has a very hard time adjusting and becomes depressed and is almost suicidal.  She also experiences sexual abuse at a very early age.  One of the main characters, a very old lady who is supposed to be her mother, is the only person who is there for her.  I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  This is an orphan/child story.  It does not deal with the effects of abuse on the child but on the adult.  When she is around the old lady she is not allowed to have her own emotions.  After the first book she seems like a very damaged child.  There is a lot of drama and the story does not get a lot done in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was in high school. It was written by a former marine, and I remember thinking, "Wow, that's the most awesome book I've ever read." The book is about the life of a guy who is stationed at a base in the middle of nowhere in Vietnam. The base was a lot like Camp X-Ray at the Marine Corps Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas. It had a bunch of big, old tanks, which were converted to a temporary barracks. They were a little rundown but still functional. The barracks were a total shithole. Every room in the barracks had one small window with a sheet of paper taped to it, to keep out the mosquitoes and flies. There was no toilet, no sink, and no running water. There were no books to read. The guy was assigned to a tank that was just hanging out in the garage. He took a shower and used the hot water to wash his clothes. There are all kinds of things that he would rather do than shower: watch television, eat junk food, play video games. It's a good book. It describes how the guy kept his shit together while living in this shithouse, but when he tried to explain to the officer about the shitholes, the officer said, "Well, we can't fix it, so we better put it in a hole." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping to learn something about the history of the Middle East. What I got instead was a collection of recycled stereotypes, most of which were about Israel. I don't see how the United States can be a neutral party in the Middle Eastern conflicts. Israel, by the way, is a democracy and has the largest economy in the region. The only time Israel ever got attacked by another country was in 1948, when it was a tiny country with little military capability. As for Lebanon, that is a mess. Israel has had to keep the Lebanese from the border for many years and they have to deal with an increasingly unstable government. It is not like the U.S. has done much in the same way.   I wish I could say I learned something, but I only found out that the United Kingdom has an embassy in Jerusalem. I never really got into that part of the story, because I thought it was ridiculous. I thought that the U2 album cover showed that the Middle Ages were much better than the Middle-East we live in today. It was a silly book to read, and I don 't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disappointment. It's a great book on the philosophy of Aristotle, but I don't think it really works.  I read the first half and was disappointed.  Then the last half I was very frustrated and gave up on the book.  This is a very good book for those interested in philosophy but the ending made me feel like I wasn't really getting anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love the book, but the plot is very weak.  The main character, a very good looking girl, is the best friend of a guy she is sleeping with.  They have a threesome at a hotel and the guy ends up with a different woman at the hotel.  It's so weird that this character has a girlfriend, but that's the only reason I gave it 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know if I'm ever going to read a book again. This is a book that was so good I felt bad for myself because I felt like I wasted my time reading it. It was so boring and I didn't want to finish it and I thought "why did I waste so much time on this?" I feel like I could have just as easily had this book when I was younger.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me a while to get through this book, because I was so worried about whether it would be "worth the wait". But when I did, I really enjoyed it. The main characters are likable, and it makes for some fun moments between them. I was also impressed that it is the last of the "Mae West" series. (Although that last book was quite good as well.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to read some of the reviews on this book, and I can't find a bad one in there. The story is a bit predictable and the characters seem a little flat. The setting is interesting, but there's not much to do there. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it's nice to see a well-written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for a good story to read but didn't find any that were any good. So I read this book and it was ok. It had a good plot that got a little old, but there was some good humor in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story was a disappointment.  The characterizations were weak.  I thought the book was a little too clever for its own good.  It was interesting to see a "bad" guy in a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book I needed when I found out about a new version of a classic book.  The book is over 200 pages long.  It takes a while to get through the book..   ..  A very tedious read.   The main character is a bit off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of crap and I feel sorry for the authors. The book is so full of bad information that I can't believe it's the author's first book.  The basic information is wrong.  This is the third book in the series so the authors must know that this is a bad information book. I hope this book gets a good review from a professional reviewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a few of your books and this is by far the worst. I don't understand the reason I was interested in this book. It was just too complicated to get into. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my son, who is a huge fantasy nerd.    He's a big fan of Tolkien, so I thought it would be fun to read some of his stories.  Unfortunately, he didn't like it at all.  As soon as I started reading the book, he got annoyed.  He kept asking me why I was writing about these books when they were crap.  When I said "The Lord of the Rings" I got annoyed when he said " The Hobbit " (I think he thinks they're about the same story.)   When he said he didn't want to go to school because he had no one to play games with, I got pissed off.  I also thought he was being overly dramatic about it, which he wasn't.  Overall:   It's an interesting story, but the main character was annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad in any way.   It has a great deal of good content and is good at teaching you how to do certain things in the kitchen (but no how to use a sous vide machine).   This is a good cookbook for the beginner/newb alike and I would have enjoyed it even more if it included some more of the basics (how to make a good batch of macaroni and cheese) or if there were more recipes for specific dishes (such as an "Italian" omelet). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that I found wrong about this book was that it was written in a rather dry, academic style.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very bad book. It is very difficult to write a positive review about an book that is this bad. I can't even begin to describe how bad this book is. It's not just the fact that it's a bad read, but also the fact it was written by a person who clearly doesn't understand the difference between fiction and nonfiction. She gives a description of the protagonist as a "fantasist" that is so ridiculous that it is difficult to believe she is being honest. I also don't know why she didn't use the words "mental illness" in her description. She uses the word "crazy" like that is a bad thing, but it's not. She also uses the term "schizophrenic" like a bad word. But that is the only bad thing about the book. The rest of the book is just boring. This is a book that I would read if I thought I could find a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second time I've had this book in my hands and it's the second book in the series that I've been a little annoyed by. It's just the same old, same old. The same old characters, same tired plot, same cliched ideas and all that.   It's really bad.  , I mean it's bad enough that it's funny. The humor comes from the fact that this book is so bad that it actually does become funny. It feels like a bad movie, or an awful play that got bad reviews but somehow managed to make it to the stage and still managed to be entertaining, even if it doesn't seem that way. I'm not saying that it makes it more interesting than it was in the book but it still managed that, despite the fact it's so bad. There's a scene where the hero tries to get the princess to let him have a "love potion" to get her to leave the castle. Of course, it doesn  The story is about a guy who has the ability to change himself into the shape of a horse. I guess that's a little too over the top for a romance, but that's about as far as it gets. As a result, he becomes the hero of a story about a girl that loves him, but he can't make her leave her kingdom to go with him. It doesn't help that the princess has a magical ability to make people fall in love with him but he still doesn't have any luck with women. The only good thing that happens is that they end up in love but in the end, it's too late because the heroine leaves him for someone else. This guy never learns his lesson about being so much better off with the princess than the guy he's trying to please. It would have been much better if he just tried to get a girl to like him instead of constantly trying to win her over, but then again, he doesn't know any better, so that doesn't work out either.The book is supposed to be about a man who finds out that he has a talent for changing himself into a horse so he can ride. He tries to go to the king, but the king isn't interested in having someone change himself in order to ride. The problem is that the king has a terrible horse but he wants the hero to ride it. It turns out that the hero can't be changed into a pony so he has to stay as
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure how I'm going to react to this book.  This book is the equivalent of a college freshman that has to take a math test.  The questions are so easy that the student doesn't really understand how the test works.  I don't even understand the math, but it's too late.  A book like this can teach you how to do simple math, just like a good book like "The Little Prince".  I am not sure if I will get the answers I'm looking for from this book or just give up and keep on reading.  This is a good, but very basic book for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a book, but a collection of quotes from famous people that are in quotes that are not in quotes.  This is a book about a celebrity that has nothing to do with the topic that is in the book.  If the topic is in it, it would be a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the only book that I have ever had that I didn't like at all. I'm sorry to say this, but the book is a joke. It is filled with so many obvious mistakes that I was left completely confused. One thing that really bothered me was that the author says that he can't get away from the old ways. I guess this is an example of how the author thinks he's right when he's not. The most offensive thing about this book was that it was full of such obvious lies and misinformation that you would think the author actually believes that. I am not a Christian and I am glad that he has chosen not to follow the Bible. If he had been a true Christian, I don't think he would have had any problems at all with the bible or the church. He would have been happy just being right and following the bible. But as it is, he is so much more concerned with his own self-righteousness and how he can make money by telling others how to be "right".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a good example of what happens when people don't take responsibility for their actions. This book was given to me by my friend and it's very clear that he wrote it. It's about a guy who was molested by his father. The main character is a man who molested a little girl and when he gets caught he gets off with a little slap on the wrist and some community service. But he is a bad guy. The molestation of a little kid by his parents makes him a monster. He goes to prison for life and it was the victim who is the victimizer. He was not a good person. I hope he is punished for his actions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about the worst possible use of a word - "femme". It's not about a man who was in the wrong, or a man trying to correct himself. It's about a woman trying to get over the fact that a man was right about her being "cunt". The author should have said that to get past her, the woman needs to accept what she was born with and get over it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a bit too optimistic about how well they can use the techniques he's teaching, in particular his "hippocratic theory".  It's an attempt to apply the principles of the "science of behavior modification" (SBM) to a particular domain (human behavior in the military) that has a significant element of the randomness that SBM is known for.  But it's pretty much a case of trying to apply SBM's tools to a domain that has no direct relationship to what SBM does.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first part of the book is a brief history of the concept of "rebel" in the Arab world, and how that concept has become more or less a dirty word, and not just for a few bad apples. Then we get to the part about the Syrian rebels, and this part is all about the American government, and a bunch of people who think they know how to run a country better than the Syrians. The part about Assad's father, who had no real interest in his country, was also a little strange, as I have never heard a story about Assad where he was portrayed as a "reformer". The part where Assad is a "war criminal" was just a little too much to take. I guess I expected the second half to be about the U.S. involvement in the conflict, but it was mostly about the "regime change" part. Not bad, but not good either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love the idea of an "adventurous" teen reading the book. However, I found the writing too simplistic, and it left me with an unsatisfied feeling about the ending.  This book was a huge disappointment to me and it ruined a great opportunity to be a kid again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the same old thing.   The authors seem to be under the impression that their audience can only see the good in a book.  They have made their book a "trademark" for their own "unique style".   This is a book that can't even be sold in the real world because no one would want to buy a book by someone who is so far out of his league.  It was a great idea to have the authors create a "cult classic" that is not really a cult classic.  The only good thing is that the book has a great cover, but the book is so bad that it's just plain ugly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know how much more of a disappointment the book is, than the book. I mean I was going to give it 4 stars but I just can't. The author's style is very awkward, I just didn't care for it. It felt very contrived and rushed, like a poorly written screenplay.  The ending is a huge let down too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited about this book because I was interested in learning more about the history of the Church.   The book has so many flaws it is a total waste of time.  The history in the book is so far from the truth that it is unbelievable.  There are so many lies and misrepresentations in this book that it makes it impossible to believe that it was written by a genuine historian.  I found myself asking, "How can anyone believe this?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an incredibly bad book that is completely without interest.  It is basically a book about a man who is married to a woman that he is unable to have sex with because she has a vagina that is not "normal".  It seems to be about a lot of different things and the author does a lot to bring out the worst in men.  I don't like the whole concept of having a woman as a wife because she isn't really doing anything.  There are a lot more people in the world than women that are able to do things and I don´t like the fact that some women can do a lot better than others and are the only ones that are capable of doing something that most men can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing more than a glorified ad for an online dating website that promises to connect you with a woman who is as hot as a picture of a hot dog. I think they were trying to be something that wasn't really there and it worked, but the fact that it was so blatantly obvious is kind of a bummer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to start reading this book. I'm a fan of the series, so I knew this book would be good. But the author really let the story go to waste. It was like he was having a bad day. And then he started talking about a book about a dead guy and what he got from it. It got really boring. The ending was really unsatisfying and disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find this book very good. The author is a great writer but I did feel that there was a bit of a "I told you so" in her description of the "New Age". She talks about how it is "the most dangerous religion ever invented" and "it is the first to promote suicide" and how it "sounds very nice to think we can get rid of the body we have grown tired of". I think that there is a bit more to it than that but I am sure it is not "the first to make that claim" and the fact that it is so far along in development is a real concern. I also thought the concept of a religion based on "the sacred" was a little too much like the idea of "the Christian God". I am glad she put in the "sacred" word though because I thought it would have added a little something to the book but it just made it seem even more like the Christian version of "The Secret". The concept of the'sacred' was a very interesting one, but I do not know if it is the right way to go with it. I can imagine a situation in which people would need to be saved from themselves and so a "sacral" ritual could be a good idea to save people from that. It is a lot of work though, and the book was a real struggle to read and I am not sure I would have liked it as much if I had not already been told that I should not get involved with it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims to have invented the word "slut" and then just writes a story about her. She doesn't explain the meaning of "sluts" nor does she try to explain it in any way.  She just uses it like it's an everyday word. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about this book. I was looking for a good example of a woman from a time when the roles of men and women were not very different and I thought this book had that.   The book is good, but is a bit more historical fiction than I had expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wish I hadn't read this book because I got so angry reading about the abuse and I thought I would be in the middle of it, but I had already moved on to a different book. I guess I was just looking for a happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this novel, we follow the life of a child whose parents are extremely rich and whose father was once an elite scientist in the Soviet Union.   The parents of the main character,   who's been adopted by the rich,  are very nice and supportive and seem to have no problem with their child.  It's a nice book, but it has too much unnecessary stuff in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the plot is uninteresting, the writing is sloppy, and the writing style is choppy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was horrible.  The story was not believable.  I am a strong believer in reincarnation.  It just made no sense to me that someone would want to be a part of a book where they know the outcome, and then have to deal with the aftermath.  This story could have been so much better had the author been more honest about the possible outcomes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from amazon.com in hopes that it would be the best book on the subject I could find. I was disappointed.  I could not get through the first few pages.  It was not worth the money, and the authors have a tendency to put forth false ideas.  The idea that the bible is the perfect book to help you overcome sexual temptation is false.  You will still have to overcome sexual temptations no matter how good a book is.  And the bible does not say that only men and women are allowed to have sex.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a few copies of this book on hand at any given time, and I'm always looking for new reading material. The writing style is not that good for a general audience, and the plot doesn't quite make sense. However, it is very enjoyable to read, especially if you like fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've had the opportunity to read several of Dostoyevsky's books in the past few years, and I've read them all and they've all been really good. I haven't read this one yet, but I am thinking about it. I do have some interest in psychology and psychology in the real world, and this book isn't really all that different from other psychological books I've heard about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a boy who grows up in a world of magic and witchcraft.   It's all well-written, but it's pretty obvious that the author is making up some things.  The main thing that is really important is the love the boy has for his grandmother.  But that love is a little more like a drug than a true connection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last book in the Dune series, the one that started it all, is a complete disaster.  It is filled with plot holes, bad characterization, and boring characters.  I can't believe it's been 20 years since I read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of "the history" books, and this one was very short, and it was about a small area of Germany.  I think it is a very poor historical account, and the only thing it got right was the German-Polish-Russian alliance in World War II. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so boring that I feel bad for not having read it sooner.   It has a great concept and some good ideas about how to handle the stress of being a student.  But there is nothing that actually adds up to the ideas, so there is no real way to tell if they are true.  There is nothing to suggest that it will make a significant difference in my life, other than a little more time to study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a group of people trying to live together in a large city: they don't have time to cook meals or clean their house or do any kind of household chores, so they do it together. It's really quite depressing, but they make it work.  I guess I like this book because it gives an honest view of a group that is sometimes treated as an afterthought, but is really important and should be a priority in people's lives.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this. I like a lot of the stuff that I read on here but I was hoping for something better. This book was boring and it made me feel like a moron. I have no idea what is going on, why they are doing it, how they are able to do it, or why they do it. I don't understand why they have to take a child from his parents or what is in it for them. I think it was just a way to keep their son away from their wife and to keep her away from her son. It is sad to watch a man lose his temper and yell at a child. I am glad I never had the chance to see him in action.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it is written by a woman and because it was recommended by a good friend. It is not, but it is about a woman, and is not about women in general. This is the story of a woman in the early 1900s. She is a wealthy woman who was an orphan because of her mother's disease. She then gets into the medical field in a very unconventional way. The only reason I'm going to give this book 3 stars is that I found the ending very dissatisfying. It was not very interesting and it seemed to be based on a very old wives tale. If I were a guy who didn't know any better, I would probably find this story to be extremely interesting, but that's the only reason why I gave it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really know how to rate this book.  It is an entertaining read, I guess.  As a child, I had a stuffed dragon that I loved to play with.  But when I read about it in this book, I felt sad that it wasn't real.  I loved this book because it had a cute dragon.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's goal of "being a professional writer" has been achieved.   It's a bit difficult to understand why people would pay money to read a book that isn't very good.  It doesn't come out very nicely.  The characters are all cliches.  I don't see how a professional could possibly write a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I recently read this book for our daughter's 10th birthday party.   It's a fun book, with a lot of good ideas.  The problem is that they don't come to fruition and they're not very well presented.  For example:  One of the suggestions is to put a few of the kids on the stage at the party.   This would be a very good idea, but it is not presented well at all.  We also heard that some of the ideas in the book are too vague to be effective, so I won't buy it for that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. The premise of the book is a great idea: how we think about ourselves in relation to others. This idea is used well to describe a good way to handle a friend who doesn't want to be around you anymore. The main problem with the book, though, is that it takes a good idea and twists it around into a mess.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some very good ideas, but the story is terrible. It was like a high school student took a class from a teacher who has a lot of experience, and wrote a book about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster. It is a book that you read, thinking, 'that sounds interesting, maybe I'll read it.'  It is so dull, so unimaginative, so uninteresting.  This is the kind of book that is good to read on the train ride home, or when you have a lot on your mind, but you can't bring yourself to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as an introduction to a course on the history of Chinese Buddhism. I had been thinking of taking that course for several years, but had always been put off by the difficulty of learning Chinese and the lack of practical Buddhist practice.   This book gave me some of the answers I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very old, and it is very dated. It's like the first chapter was taken from the second book (which is still available)  It is a very dated story about the adventures of a little girl and her dog in a tiny village.    It would be much better with a more interesting premise, and I am sure there are a lot of people who would enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a bad and dull read. It is a very good book for anyone who is looking for a very light book. The writing style is very easy to read. The content is light, easy to understand and the pictures are very good. The illustrations are well drawn and very clear. The story is very good and the characters are all well drawn. I really enjoyed this book. It's a very easy read and is perfect for a quick read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the complete opposite of what I expected. I really enjoyed it when I got it, and was happy to finally read about a woman who gets it and still does not feel guilty about it.  But that was all it was.  The whole thing is just that:  She is not ashamed.  It's not like she has had a bad time in her life or anything.  She just doesn't want to be ashamed. I know that sounds weird and wrong.   But she does.  I understand that feeling and I get it.    But I also know that it isn't about her at all.   I don't know that I would feel that way about her if I had lost my sister, or even if I hadn't gotten married.  If I had had a boyfriend, it would have made it harder to feel that.  And I also get that if she had been single she would have had more of a problem getting over her sister.  Maybe that is a common feeling in some relationships, but not for me.  But that is just my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book. It has a very bad ending, and is so full of bad ideas that I can't see how anyone could possibly want to read it. It's too bad that so many people don't read fiction to begin with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book which I loved would have been better had I not found out the author was a serial rapist and necrophiliac.   I was very surprised that she could write a book that is as good as this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is a bit off. I understand that a lot of the characters were not born in the 1940s, but there is not enough explanation of why. The plot was a bit of a bore.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping this book would be better than it is.  The story is a little slow and it has a really long prologue that could be cut.    The prologue explains the author's "love of reading" and the "desire to be a writer".   But when the story gets going, it's a real drag.  I liked the setting of the book (a small farm in a tiny town in the heart of the woods) but the character development was poor.  The characters felt very one dimensional and lacked any real depth.  At one point the main character's father died and he is forced to take over his father's farm because his mother couldn't do it.  This is a huge problem because the main characters aren't even that interesting.  If I were the main male character I'd be totally pissed off at how he's been treated.  There was nothing about him to make me think he was even half as interesting as the other characters.  He's just a pretty face with some random skills.  That's it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The author, a self-proclaimed "professional" writer, seems to know absolutely nothing about what makes a good story. It's just about her and her friends. There is a lot of fluff in this book. The only thing that I like about it is that there is one scene where she takes her kids to the zoo and the animals are so funny. The other characters were pretty annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed when the book did not come in a hardcover and I did not get the "golden age" reference. I have seen it a couple of times but the only one I remember is in the first few pages when it was a book on ancient Roman architecture. I liked that but would not read it as an archaeology book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book but the ending was a bit confusing.   It was supposed to show that the girl is in fact a ghost, but she is not actually a ghost.  I liked the ghost story but this was a very poorly executed ghost story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has so many problems, and the problems are all very small. First, the author seems to have a serious misunderstanding about the basic idea of writing. She claims that "writing is the act of constructing a world." This is an odd idea for someone who claims to be a historian to have, and it is one that I have seen used in the past to try to make historical claims. (For example, I've seen it used to make claims about medieval England and other areas, and this sort of claim is very hard to test.) Second, the way that the author handles the details of the lives of the women who had been slaves, including the one she is most interested in, is not just problematic but deeply offensive. (One of the things that I find fascinating about slave women is that it's very hard for anyone who is not a slave woman to understand the social world in which they lived. There are lots of reasons why slave women are different from the rest of us, and a lot of those reasons are the social role they played as women. The fact that this author doesn't see the difference is shocking to me.) And third, it's really odd that the main reason for slavery was to make money. It's one thing to use a slave to produce food. It is quite another to use slaves to make a living.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book. I loved the idea behind it, but I didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would. It was very boring, and had many plot holes. I think I'll give it a miss and look for something else to read, but it's a good idea, just a very boring one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of the classic "Star Wars" series (and you should be), then you'll love "Star Trek: The Next Generation"   The Next Gen is a perfect blend of the "Trek" franchise and "The Original Series."   From the look of things, they're going to make the series a hit and I'm really looking forward to watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to get this book, since I love the TV series "Doctor Who". The book is well written and I liked that it covered the show. It had the Doctor talking about the TARDIS and the other shows he's seen. I thought that the story was great, the characters were interesting and the story made you want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last part of this book was just not worth the price. The writing style was awful and not professional at all. It was so hard to understand what the author was trying to get across. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. I loved the title. I got this book because it has a great quote about life: "Life is a book, but you can't put it down." The book has a good idea, but it's not well thought out. The only thing that makes me not want to keep it is that it's only about half the length of my own book, The Good Life: A Guide to Making Good Decisions and Surviving Good Times. I'd also love to see a better translation of the quote.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love this book!  It's one of the best I've ever read, and a lot of that has to do with the wonderful characters and story.   I'm not sure what the author is trying to say, but it's so beautifully done that it makes the book work, and really, it should have been a full-length novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like this book, and I don�t think anyone else should either.   I think that many of the things that make up the book (the characters, the world, etc.) were all present in some form in the book that was published by Random House in 1995 (and I'm not just talking about the plot). I can't remember exactly which book, but the idea of a person from a parallel universe living in a world with an Earth that is the same as ours but with a different history and culture was something that was alluded to in the original (and most recent) Star Trek: Voyager. I just don't see it working here. The main character is a robot. I don;t see how that helps. The setting is interesting, but again, we don't have any other information about the universe beyond the fact that it has a different past. The idea of having two versions of the same story that exist in two different time periods doesn't make any sense to me. The only thing that made the first Star Trek work was the idea that the people in the other universe were real, so I don?t see that working here either. The characters have very little development, the plot is very linear, the characters are almost all archetypes, and the characters have nothing in common. I would be fine with the premise, but I think it would be better served by another book or a TV show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should not have been published. It is full of errors and makes a bad case against the validity of science.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to reading this book.   It is a fun, humorous book about two college kids who have a crazy, crazy life.  The characters are so much fun.  I can see how they are fun to read about.  However, the book is a little hard to read and is a bit hard to follow at times.  There are some typos.  It makes me wonder why the author chose this one as the starting point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked the idea behind this book, but the execution was bad. The whole thing was over-written with too many plot-lines, and I felt that some of the characterizations were unnecessary or too vague.      I really liked all the characters.  I thought they were all well-developed and well-drawn.  There were several characters that were particularly good- I loved how the main character came out of her shell.  The supporting characters were also really interesting.  Some of the things that were said about the main characters seemed like over-exaggerations or just made it sound like they were jealous or angry.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading for a while now and I'm a bit frustrated at how much time has passed. I feel like this is more of a history than a thriller. It has lots of action, but it's the plot that's the problem. It's so obvious that the book is an anti-military/anti-war book that I'm not sure why it's being written. It looks like the author has never been to a military or a warzone before. It doesn't help that the ending of the book left me a little confused. I have no problem with the book as a whole. I'm glad that the author is doing something different than the standard thriller, but I wish the book were a little longer so I could finish it in one sitting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about a year ago, I think. I don't remember much about it.   It was about a guy named Nick who was the head of a small business, he had a lot of money and was very well liked by the customers. Then, one day, he suddenly had a sudden loss of money, and it turned out that his bank had been robbed by a bunch of guys. Nick tried to figure out who the robbers were, and found out that one of them was a former colleague from high school. He then hired a team of private detectives to follow the robbers. They ended up doing it by using a computer, and they ended up discovering that Nick's own daughter was in on the conspiracy.   the book ended on a cliffhanger, and I didn't know what was going to happen next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really good book. It has a lot of useful information about the Bible and the Bible.  The one thing I found frustrating is that the author has a great understanding of the Bible but is unable to get the most basic facts about the historical and cultural background of the Hebrews.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry but I can not get over the fact that it is a book about a girl that is a slut, a whore and is obsessed with her body. Not only does it describe how she takes care of herself but it also tells us what it is like to be a slut. The worst part about this book is that it makes me cringe even though I have read about a lot of bad things about girls like this. It is not about a female's body but about the fact they can't control their body and they want to be sexual. It doesn't matter if they are a lesbian, a bisexual, or a transsexual. The only thing that matters is their sexuality and they use it to control other people. It makes me sick to think that people are reading about girls that like to get fucked and that girls are so selfish that they need to have someone take care of them. If I had to describe a girl to you it would be someone who thinks that they are the best in the world at everything and the other people need to respect them because they are special. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very poor piece of writing. It is filled with false facts and unsubstantiated accusations.  The author claims that the Church leaders are hiding something and that he has seen a document that proves it.  I think he is probably right about the church hiding something.  But he has no evidence of it, no documentation to support his claims.  It is also impossible to know how much time he spent on his research.  He never goes into specifics about how much money he has spent on this book, or who is paying him for it.   He also says the book is for the general public and not just a group like the LDS Church.  These are not valid arguments either.  His audience is the general audience of the LDS community.  If his book was about the general community, I doubt that it would have any merit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess. It's an extremely disorganized book with little to no information in it. The main character is a guy who was on the brink of suicide until he found Jesus. His wife and son have left him because he's a coward. I was hoping he would find someone to love and be happy. Instead he finds the worst person he can think of in a friend of his dad. I'm sure it's a good story and a great way to show that God can save anyone. But, I wish it was told in a more organized way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst one I have ever read in my life. The entire story is a lie. The main character is just a retarded person who has no problem with lying to make herself seem more successful and important. The book is full of other retarded characters that she meets that are completely uninteresting. The writing style is so boring and it doesn't even try to be funny.  There is also a huge problem with the book that is mentioned in the last few pages of the book. The story is about the main character being pregnant with a son that her sister has given up on after the birth. The sister had promised her brother that she would marry the son that she was carrying. The brother refused and instead married a woman named Sarah. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book.  The book is set in the late 19th century in the Scottish Highlands.  It is the time of "Bloody Mary," and the Scottish peasantry were so superstitious they had a "Celtic Knot" that tied their hands together so that they would never be able to kill a person who had cut them.  When a person cut their hand the knot would grow and break the person's hand.  I thought the story was interesting but the character development is bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm just glad I didn't pick up this book.    It's an atrocious book.   The story is terrible, the characters are stupid, the writing is terrible.    The writing in the beginning was bad as well but that was a different story.  It wasn't until I got to the part where she has a breakdown because her mom is in jail and she gets over it pretty quickly that I thought this book was over.  She gets her mom out but then she is back in it because she is still stuck in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. The author does not have any talent for writing. This is a non-fiction book, so it is hard to understand what the author is trying to say. The book is just a collection of anecdotes about his family history. His family history is interesting, but it doesn't help the author understand what happened. This book is a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of holes in the plot, and it's clear that the author didn't read this book.     The plot:    The main character is in a relationship with a girl he met online and they have sex.   They also had sex before they met in real life.  The girl's parents found out about it and got her to have a sex change operation.  In a strange turn of events, the girl's new boyfriend also has a sex alter ego.  I don't think the story was meant to be taken seriously, because the author did a horrible job of making the readers feel sorry for the main character.  There was no emotion in his scenes.  He's not a particularly interesting character. He's just a boring old dude who is trying to get into a girl's pants.  It's hard to tell if the story is meant to have the characters be gay or not.  But the author is obviously trying to make a joke out of it, so that's kind of sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a collection of short stories about a group of friends and a series of misadventures. It is the type of story that you can see the characters at the end of and say, "Well, that was fun." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out by telling you how wonderful it is that the people who live in the area that was the site of the WTC attacks are now very concerned about terrorism.  It's not that they were terrorists.  They were just victims of a terrorist attack.  (The author did not mention that the attackers were Muslim or that 9/11 was not a Muslim plot.)  This is the sort of thing that I love about books:  It tells you that terrorists were not responsible for 9/ 11, but you're still going to learn about that because of the book's theme.  I have read many books about the WTC, so I have a pretty good idea of what is going on in the WTC at the time of 9/1 1.  What I don't have a clue about is what is happening at the WTC in the year 2004.  Why was the WTC renovated in 1996?  It is obvious that the WTC was going to be hit again, but they were so careful about the renovations that they did not even try to repair the damage.  This tells me that it was probably not necessary for the WTC to be rebuilt at all.  As far as I know, there are only two things that have ever been done to the WTC: 1) The Twin Towers were demolished in the 1990's. 2) The original WTC in New York City was demolished in 1973.  The New York World Trade Center is a real tragedy.  But this book tells you the story in a way that is very positive about the new improvements.  And it has a lot of good material about what went on in New Jersey after 9/ 1 1, and it has some good material on what went wrong in New Orleans after 9 1 1.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting to like this book, but I found the ending extremely unsatisfying.  I thought it was a great idea for a children's book, that it would make a good story to read aloud to my children, but the story ended up being so badly written that I found it really confusing.  It was a bad idea to have it end on the cliffhanger of a giant squid, and the ending just wasn't well-executed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the best book I've read about the Soviet Union. This is a good book about what the Soviets were and are, but it is only a good novel.  I had no problem with the way the author wrote it, and the author could have been a good writer.  But this book was just a bit too much for me, in a good way, because it really shows how the Soviet system works. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's thesis is that the current generation of kids is too self-absorbed to grow up. The book is full of "theories" that are completely ridiculous and are not based on anything real. The authors claims that the children are spoiled. But I don't think that's a big deal, and they don't seem to know what they're talking about either.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a poor example of science writing. It has no scientific merit. I have not understood a word of the text except the title. It seems to be a compilation of information, but not a single article in the book supports the conclusions or makes any sound scientific arguments. This book was published before many of the discoveries of the past century. It appears to have been written by a young doctor who was ignorant of the work of his colleagues and the science. He claims to have come to the conclusion that a plant was poisonous and therefore should not be used for food, but then he goes on to make the case that all plants are poisonous and should be avoided. I do not know what his conclusion was, but it is not supported by the facts in the text. I don't know why the book is not listed on the Web at the U. of T. library or in the library catalog.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a hard time with these people because they're so bad at what they do. They spend time and money trying to make a name for themselves by getting their names on some of the world's most famous buildings. They should just make a website and start selling books on their own.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an embarrassment to a field that prides itself on scholarship. The authors are not interested in learning more about the Bible but in attacking it, and they have no interest in learning about the culture and people who produced it.  The "Christian" argument is that all these great books are written by people who weren't really Christians.  That's nonsense.  It's not as though there's no evidence that the authors of the books in question were Christians.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book in a trilogy. It has a story, and it is interesting. But it is not gripping, and you don't really want to know about the characters after the first few chapters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry but it's not worth the money.  It's just so poorly written.  I don't understand what they are trying to do.  The main character is a total mess.  They use a lot of fake names, make up stories about themselves, and then throw it out there like it's something the characters will remember.   I think the author just wanted to put together a bunch of different characters and throw them together in one story and then never tell us anything about them.  This is just one of the worst books I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about religion. This book will not entertain, it is just a list of stories that are supposed to make you think. This is the only good thing that I can say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was a good read until the end.  I felt that the author could have been a little more detailed about his childhood.  The book has many good quotes but it was a little hard to figure out why he says "it" and "that" and is unable to say "I" and I don't think it was that difficult.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great read for a good price. It's got all the classic features of a good book, and it's got them well in the first place. I'll read it again at some point, and I'll probably buy a few more of these types.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book. It takes two hours to read, and the book has an extremely poor flow. One paragraph is about the history of the first printing of the Bible, the other about the first edition of the New Testament, and both seem to be about a very similar book that was published around the same time. As someone who has read both of these books, I can tell you that neither book has much to do with the other, except that they are both by the same author. The author's main problem is not so much that his work is bad, but that it is so long that he couldn't fit the entire thing into two hours. If he would have had the time, I think he could have written a much better book than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad fantasy book, but it is very poorly written and has a huge number of problems. First of all, it is a fantasy novel and that is very important. Second, the book is written in a very childish way that really detracts from the story. Third, the story is very cliche and cliché. It is basically a girl who has magic powers, and she uses them for good, and bad.  There is really no reason for her powers other than a story she tells herself.  It has all the classic elements of a bad novel, but the author fails to make it work as a book, as a fantasy.  She tries to shoehorn it into the genre, but then does so in a way that is so bad that it doesn't even make sense.    "So... did you know that I can do anything?  It's true.  I can make myself invisible.  Or turn myself into a werewolf.  Just by thinking about it.  So what do you want to do?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and was disappointed with it.  The whole book is just a bunch of people talking about the history of what they did not like about the past, which is the fact that women have been excluded from certain things in our culture and history.  I don't think I am alone in my disgust for women's exclusion.  But the whole point of the book is that women in our history have had different roles in our society than men and that it is just because of those different roles that we have come up with such different societies, languages, and languages, etc.  That's what I am getting at.  It's a lot of talking about history that is boring and unoriginal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm still in disbelief that I bought this book.    As a lifelong fan of fantasy, I'm always looking for new authors to read.  In this book, they don't even attempt to make the characters believable.  They seem to be based on someone else,  and that's it.  This book has very little to do with the original trilogy (which I love)   The world building is so bad that I couldn't believe it even happened.  The characters all sound like they are straight out of a bad science fiction novel (minus the space pirates)  It's like they were made up for this book!   In the end, I can't help but feel that this book is just another example of the people who thought they could make a living writing fantasy books by taking a couple of ideas and twisting them into something terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think I am in the minority in that I am disappointed by the lack of plot development in this book.  I really wanted to get to know this character, and get a better understanding of what he is really like, but this book did not deliver.  It felt very superficial to me.  There were a couple scenes I found a bit too predictable and not as interesting as I was hoping for.  The ending was also a bit anticlimactic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so bad I stopped reading. The author doesn't have a clue about history and he is just a horrible writer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is very convoluted, but the characters are very weak.  It would have been much better if they had just let him go off on his own, as the other characters are too dumb to understand what he's talking about.  I can't believe he's still a detective.  If he's really good at what he does, I guess that makes him a good person.  He also has a lot of sex.  This isn't a good book, but I'm not giving up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think this is a good book, but I really wanted to like it.  It's not a bad story, but it's not good either.  I think it's pretty clear that the author has never heard of a few key science and engineering concepts that are fundamental to most of our modern technological lives.  The story itself is not bad (the story is pretty much a retelling of an old folk tale) but the book does not help much with understanding the concepts in the story.  So I guess I don'  I am not a fan of the sci-fi genre, but the last one that I enjoyed a lot was "Aliens", and I read it in about two weeks.  This is a little better, but still not the best book I've read this year.  Maybe if this was written by the man who wrote "Alians" I would have been a bit more forgiving, but that is just a guess.    "The End of Eternity" is a short story that I found to be kind of interesting.  But I really don't know if it would have appealed to me as a "sci-fi" book.  (I think the sci is a bit confusing to me).  I am pretty sure it was written for the kids market.  That's kind of the point of the story:  to explain to kids the concept of the time machine.  However, the story is very simple, and I just didn't understand much about the concepts that were explained.  Also, the book itself is a tad short.  The only other thing that I really liked about the story was the ending.  And that was only because the author didn't really get around to telling us what happened after the time travel.  If I had to guess, I would say that the ending is not a happy one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a book on why we need to move to a higher ground, or why we shouldn't be afraid of the future, you should probably skip this one. This is the "deeper truth" book that so many are talking about these days. There is a lot of good material in it, but it's the presentation that makes it so useless.   This book is full of the same old stuff that is already out there.  You have to go through all of the "experts" (that is what the book says is "experience") and "experiments" (as in "the world is going to end in about 3 weeks") and just find the one that makes you feel good, and move to that.  It is like a science experiment:  "If I can make this go so well, I will be a great researcher."   I can't believe that these people don't have to pay for their own meals.  I don't think it is any good to just read this stuff.  And if I do have to read it, I think I will go back to a good history book and skip to the part about the "big bang" and evolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a kind of a prequel to "The Devil in the White City."    I'm a little disappointed, but I have to give it some credit.   It's not the best of the three, but it's better than the other two.  The first thing that I noticed about the book was that the cover and the author photo were almost identical.  That's not a bad thing,  but it does seem a little too similar.  I don't like the cover of "The Black Tapes" either.  It looks like it's been printed on a cheap copy of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think that it was written to be as lighthearted as possible and I think it is.  It does contain quite a few "I don't like this" moments, but the jokes and references keep you laughing.  The writing is very fun.  As far as this book is concerned, I will not be picking it up again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not good. The first half was about the life of a young woman who went to a convent school. The second half was a collection of her letters and diaries. The diaries had been written as she had been dying of cancer. The writing was very poor and was filled with mistakes.  The stories in the second half were more interesting but were written by people who had no experience in writing about life or death.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished a hard to find (and expensive) book about a little known person from a distant past. The only good thing about the book is the author's ability to write about a person he knew well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very similar to a previous book I read by the same author, except that this book is a little more enjoyable. The first two chapters are the same, but after that it's very hard to get into the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a bit disappointed that this book was not in the "best" list.  It was really, really bad.  I've read about 10 of the previous 20 or so books by this author, and have been extremely impressed.  This book just didn't seem to live up to my expectations,  but I'm going to give it a 3 because I'm trying to read more contemporary fantasy and I'm very excited to see how it turns out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not worth the $25 it was charged at the bookstore. The writing is very choppy and it was difficult to follow what the characters were saying. The plot was so convoluted that I could not understand it at all. The characters were a bit clichéd. I have no idea why the author chose to put these characters in such a situation and make them into a bunch of idiots who are constantly getting into trouble. There was so much nonsense in this book that I did not understand a word of it. This book is so filled with spelling errors that I don't even think it's worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title of this book is very misleading, because there is very little new material here that was not in previous books.  The focus here is almost exclusively on what happens after you get your license, so there is not much new to report about how to use your car, how to be a good driver, or even how to pass a road test.  It's almost like they are saying that it is a bad idea to get a license just to learn all this stuff.  I would like to see them say something like: "If you get a CDL, you will be able to make a few more trips to the DMV before the day is up, but it will take longer and you will have to get the training again.  Don't expect to be able drive on the freeway or in the city without getting a CDLA license in 6 months." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because of the rave reviews. This is a bad bad book. It is filled with half-baked attempts to "explain" the Quran to the non-Muslim. It gives a few quotes that sound "progressive" to the modern secular reader, and some that sound a bit like "the good old days". But the most glaring problem is that the author never actually explains the meaning of anything in the Quran. His understanding of the Quran is more of a personal view of the author's life than a thorough understanding of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am currently on the fence about this book.   This book is a bad one.  I have no clue what the author is trying to say.  At the beginning of the book, he writes, "I will attempt to explain what I see as the real meaning of the words of Jesus."   He then goes on to explain that Jesus is talking about his resurrection (or his first appearance), and then he goes on and explains the importance of being a "gift" to others.  He seems to think that this makes the "gifts" he gives to others "good".  It doesn't.  It is a gift because it is an act of love.  But it is also a gift in order to demonstrate his love.    It was a gift for the woman at the wedding feast because he needed to demonstrate that he was a good man and she was a "good woman" by giving her a gift, and that is why he is able to be with her.  That is also why he was able to die.  And if you think about it, it is actually the only reason he could be with that woman.  The woman at that wedding was not a "bad woman" but just one of those people who could not see the "good" in something.  She did not realize that a good person could be a bad person or that there were good people who were bad.  So the "explanation" he is going on about that doesn't make any sense at all.  There are several other books that he could have read, and I am not sure if they would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the premise of this book. But I have to give this book 3 stars. The story has some promise. But the ending left me feeling like I had read a bad novel. The main character is introduced in a way that makes her seem like the typical teenage girl who just wants to get laid, and then is given a completely unrealistic love interest in the end. It's like a guy is trying to turn a shy, lonely girl into a woman. It was unrealistic in a bad way. The way it was written, the way the character acted, was so unrealistic that I felt like I was reading a bad romance novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking for a good book on the ancient origins of Judaism to read for a long time, but found very few.  This one, however, is very good, very readable, and a good reference for many things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters are really annoying. It is really annoying that a book with an important message is not written in a clear way, and I mean that in the best way. I just felt the message was lost in the translation. I have read many other books in this genre and none of them come close to this. I will not be picking up the next book in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book I'm reviewing is about a young woman who has a very good job in the government. But one day she was given a very bad book by her boss (who has a horrible reputation).  I'm not saying that was the reason she quit, but the book was horrible and her boss never even gave it a chance to improve.  This is the kind of book that is great to read if you don't know the author, but if you do, it is terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the second time I have tried to teach the idea of non-monogamy to my wife.  The first time I tried to explain that our marriage was a good fit for non-committal non-sexual relationships was about a year ago.  This time, I'm not sure I'm going to get very far, but I'll give it a shot.  My wife has a history of having sex when I'm away.  I have never had a problem with this and I think it's a good thing for our marriage.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that she'll be able to do this while I'm gone.  It's not that she's never interested in having sex, it's that she just hasn't found the right person yet.  She's had a few girlfriends and they've all been pretty good.  They have all been kind of vanilla, which doesn't really appeal to me.  After a year of trying to get her to have sex with me while I was away, I figured I'd give it another try.  At first, it was just about a week every few months, but eventually I ended up having sex with her about once a week.  While I was home, I'd take her out to dinner, go on a romantic date or spend time with my kids.  For a while I didn't think about it too much, but one night I found out she had a guy over to her house.  Since we don't do that much together, I didn t know about it.  Well, she told me about it and told me that it was all a big misunderstanding and she only wanted to get back together with her boyfriend.  Now, I was upset because I was really looking forward to sex with my wife, but not just because she wanted to cheat.  So I asked her if she had told him about us.  Apparently not, but he's not exactly a great guy.  He's pretty mean, he's got a drinking problem, and he's really good at making up stories about me.   She explained to me that he was a bad boyfriend and that she didn't know how to tell him that she wasn't interested.  As it turned out, he did tell her about us, but that he didn't want to hurt her feelings by telling her that she was cheating.  All in all, it worked out great for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't think that this book is a good one. The narrator is so over-the-top and annoying that it just makes the book worse. The first part is really boring. The protagonist was so boring that I was annoyed when I found out that the protagonist didn't really have a reason for doing what he did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was so bad, it was a chore to put down. I can't even begin to explain how it was written.  It is a novel that had the potential to be really good, but unfortunately fell apart before it could really get going.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In spite of its good parts, this book is a mess, and it's very difficult to tell where the good parts end and the bad parts begin. The author spends the entire book explaining how the "bad" parts of a book (the "badest parts" in fact) are the parts that make the book good in the first place.   This is an interesting idea, but it doesn't hold up in practice.  The "bad bad bad bad" parts are not bad because they are bad, but because they do things that are bad (explaining why a book is good) but that we're supposed to be glad about.  So when the "good bad bad good" parts get in the way of the story, they can't help but detract from it.  And the "drama" in the book is not even worth mentioning because it's a "dramatic" reading of a story that's already "dynamic."  This book is also about as long as a good novel should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book but it just was not for me. I don't like books with a lot of action scenes but I thought that was why I wanted to read this book. I found it too fast paced and I just didn't get a good feel for the story.  I didn't like the way the author made the character "The Mummy" sound like a big ass. I like my characters to sound like real people. I'm not really sure how they can portray someone like that with such a flat voice and a big head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been used by my wife as a "spanking" device for me to beat her at the dinner table.  She is too young to be doing the "spankings" but this book is a good way to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not disappointed in this book at all, I was disappointed in the author.  This is a really boring book, and as a result I found it very difficult to get into it.  I'm really not a fan of "myth" books as a whole, but this is a case of a "myths" being turned into facts.    The writing is very poor and not interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just about as bad as a bad novel can be.   The plot is a terrible mess of an attempt to explain the meaning of life, with characters that seem to be made up of cardboard cut-outs, a lot of pointless expositions about a lot  of topics, and the kind of plot that you can make up in a minute but it is still stupidly convoluted.  It is also full of  obvious attempts to make a political point and it is pretty obvious that the author thinks that people would like to know the meaning  of life.  I don't know why he thought that people might be interested in the meaning... and the whole thing reads like a bunch of stuff that has been tried out and rejected.  This is one of the dumbest books I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, written by a self-published author, is a book about how a single woman can make her own way in the world of men, and that a man will treat her better than she would a girl he has been friends with for years. I had a very bad experience with this book, and I don't know why she kept writing it. It's written like a self help book, where she tells you what to do.   It starts out with her mother talking about how her boyfriend never wanted to do housework or go out with the girls, because he knew that they were only looking for sex. She said that he always talked about how he would never be in a serious relationship until he met her. He never said a word about how she would make him happy, and he never asked her for anything. Then, he started doing things for her, and eventually, she asked him for the keys to his car. She says that after a few dates, he broke up with her. She feels he doesn't really love her. Then she gets a letter from her brother, who is a lawyer, asking her to marry him. She doesn't like it, but she says he can do whatever he wants with his life. She goes on a trip with him, and it turns out he is not the kind of man she thought he was. She is a very nice person, and she doesn't want to hurt anyone, but he isn't. She can't get over him. Then after a while, he gets her pregnant, and then she doesn  I just read this book and it was awful. It was like the author was trying to put herself into a bad situation. Her life is great. She has a successful career and a beautiful family. She lives in a nice house. She's happy. She never had any trouble getting men to marry her, so it must be because they were desperate for sex? I was very disappointed. This is a self published book, so she can write whatever she wants and get away with it. Her only saving grace is her personality. I can see why so many men are so desperate for her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very interesting book that tries to explain the way our language works but ends up being a really bad read.   I really wanted to like this book.  It makes the case that a lot of the "unnatural" sounds in the language are not really that different from our natural sounds (like the French consonant "p" in "pass" is just like the English "p").   But the book is really bad about explaining this in an accessible way, so it's a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure what to think about this book.   It's an interesting little read and has a good message but is so confusing and the stories are so confusing that I'm having a hard time keeping track of them.  It just doesn't make sense that they say, "I'm not gay, but..."   In the end, it all comes down to the fact that they're gay.  The thing that I can't figure out is: Why do these guys say they're not gay but have gay friends?   Why do they have gay sex and not get pregnant?  I've been told it's the only way to have a child, so why would they get pregnant if they're straight?  There are a lot of good parts of this book but there's a lot that I don't understand and don't know how to feel about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first book about my experience with the police was so good that I was tempted to buy more.   It was just so sad to see all the lies and deception.  It also was so depressing to hear the police officer's own words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of inaccuracies. It is true that the US has never had a single major national war since its inception, but that is not a justification for not being involved in World War II, nor for not having a "war" in Korea.  As for the war in Korea, the US did not begin the war until the end of August, 1950, and it ended in a humiliating defeat that ended in the evacuation of American civilians. The US did win a major victory over the North in 1950, but it did not prevent the North from becoming a nuclear power. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I have ever read. It's like reading a bunch of junk mail from a person who is too stupid to read the mail.  It is also a poor excuse for a "good book"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book about the history of American slavery and how the US became the world's leading industrial power.   The author has done a superb job explaining how slavery and race relations were important in shaping American history.  However, his book lacks the historical depth of others and suffers from the same problems I have encountered in other books about slavery.  I think the authors have done a very good job of putting a historical perspective on slavery and the development of the United States as an industrial power, but it would have been better if they had made a little more of an effort to look at the American slave society as a social system. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books I can see the author trying to make a buck off the author.   I'm sure that he was able to buy it, and I have a copy of it.  The book was written in a very technical manner, and there are no stories in it.   It's more like a report of how he used to play basketball and now plays it too much.  I'll have to give up on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really disappointed with this book, because it is so obviously bad that I could not even believe that it was published as a serious book.  It is the most inept attempt at a story telling in history that I have ever seen.  In fact, I think it is even worse than the fictional history books written by the great John deCamp in his book on the CIA.  The book is a collection of personal letters and diaries that John de Camp wrote during his years in the CIA, in which he describes the time he spent working with various types of people from a variety of countries.  Some of the individuals are very interesting.  Others are interesting, but they are just so inept that I find it hard to believe that they are really working for the CIA and are actually writing these letters in order to give their experiences to someone who would understand them.  I do not understand why the CIA would want to keep this kind of information hidden from the public.  This book makes me think that the CIA has a history of using people like John decamp as "experts" and giving them "expert" letters.  If this is true, then it is not surprising that the agency would be interested in what these people have to say, but why would the agency want to hide these letters?  Why would they want to put out a book with letters written by people who are incompetent and stupid?  It seems that the purpose of the book is to demonstrate how the CIA can use people like de camp as "externals" for their own intelligence work.  Why not just hire them as "interns" and have them do their work for them?  This is an attempt to use a person like deCamp as an example of how an organization can use incompetent people, but instead of showing that the organization is inept, it shows how the organization can employ incompetent people.   I think that this is not an accident. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading a lot of fantasy lately and wanted to get into this genre, but the more I read, the less I want to read any more. The characters are the most boring, the plot is very poor and poorly explained, the magic system is almost non existent and the world is filled with boring clichés, stereotypes and stereotypes about the people who live in it.  I am not a fan of this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a good historical fantasy book you can't go wrong with this one.   This is a good fantasy story with lots of action and excitement but there is a slight problem.  The author seems to have no idea of the history behind the characters or how the world works.  He uses a character with a strange name to explain a strange thing in the story but doesn't really explain what that thing is.  A lot of characters have the same name and that is probably the biggest flaw.  In the end the story gets too convoluted.  It just got too boring.  Also the book was very long and I can't find a good place to start reading the rest of it.  I guess I'll have to wait for the next edition.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about history. This is a book about people who were not very well off.  The author makes no effort to present the facts about poverty.    Her claims are based upon personal anecdotes and a superficial understanding of the history of poverty.       
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a fan of the "Harry Potter" books, but I have read all of the movies, including the terrible "Deathly Hallows." Now I feel like I'm stuck in a "Twilight" fanfic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. The author has absolutely no idea what she is talking about and is just trying to sound smart. I found the content to be very confusing and irrelevant. I will just keep this book in my library for my bookshelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking for a book on a particular subject for a long time. I have searched on google and elsewhere, but have never found anything that is helpful.  My book on The Beatles is not about the band per se, but about a man who is obsessed with the band and their songs.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just about what one would expect from a book written by a Christian fundamentalist, the book being one of the first to come out of the new wave of Christian fundamentalist theology. It's a polemic against the Catholic Church, and it's not at all subtle.   It's basically a "I can do no wrong" attitude, a "there are no atheists in foxholes" attitude.  It seems that he has no problem calling a Catholic priest a priest, but when he gets to a Catholic university, he gets a bit uncomfortable, and calls a Catholic scholar a scholar.  The fact that he's trying to convince his fellow Christians that the Catholic church is full of bad men just makes it more pathetic, especially since the author was a priest in his church for years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe that my mother gave this to me when she was sick. I was only 11 years old when she died and I'm now 35. I don't think she would be proud of this book. She wouldn't want to see me reading about her illness.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first section is very confusing, but then it gives you some good information about the "magic" of a "new" spell book. The author is the worst when it comes to "scientific" information. The last section is really boring and pointless.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to have something to read after the "The End" trilogy. It didn't work out that way. I'm not going to waste my time on another "Warmongering" novel, especially after the first two were so bad. If this is the last "W" novel I read, I'll be more disappointed than disappointed. If it's the first, I won't be too disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good story with a good ending but a bad premise.  The story is about an inventor who builds a device that can turn a car into a submarine.  He does this to stop the government from trying to make submarines illegal.  While it works well in that it stops a potential violation of the law, it is also very poorly written.  It is hard to follow.  A lot of the characters in this story are quite confusing.  One is an inventor that is working on the device that would turn the car into an submarine and another one that is the president of the country that wants to keep the submarine law.  This is not just a good premise, but a very bad one.  I just felt that the writing of this story was a bit off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I read the review that said the book is a "disappointment." I bought this because I was a big fan of the Harry Potter series, and I wanted to read more Harry Potter. Unfortunately, I couldn't. It's a very confusing book. I read through it in about an hour, and that's not a lot of time to learn all the magic system, but that didn't make the book any better. The author had a good idea for this book, but she failed to make it work. The characters are poorly developed, and it's a bit difficult to keep the main character's feelings and motivations straight. I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, but this book left me with a lot more questions than I had when I started reading.   Also, it took me awhile to realize that Harry was supposed to be a boy. I really expected him to be the girl that he is in the books. I would have liked to have been able to learn about his family background before reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a collection of some of my favorite short stories. It is a very short read.  The stories have a very distinctive voice and writing style, which is not easy to accomplish, but the stories are very well done.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time, it has no value.  I tried to read it as a form of self-improvement but the more I read, the more my knowledge of how to be a real man wane.  The man who wrote this book is no different from a woman who wants to get a promotion in her career.  It is a complete waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the original series, but after reading this I realized how boring and predictable it all is. The characters are basically the same, the plot is a complete mess and the ending just feels rushed. I'm really hoping the sequel is better, because I really enjoyed the original trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author uses the term "vampiric" to describe vampires. But she doesn't actually use the term, and her descriptions of vampirism are way too graphic and creepy.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so glad to have found this book! I had no idea there were so many variations to the same story in this genre. The story is about a young woman who meets a man and falls in love with him. She is not happy until she meets another man who loves her as much as he loves her. He's a good person, kind, and takes good care of her. The book takes a turn when the man dies, leaving his lover, and the woman begins to question her feelings. I thought the book was a little too long at the end. The ending was so tragic, I had to put it down and go find a new book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the only thing I've ever read in a lifetime that had me in tears.   I am so, so sad about this.  I really liked the other books in this series, but this one made me tear up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. It was written by a woman who used to work for a porn magazine. She thought it would be a good idea to write a novel about the life of a porn star. But no one would buy it because it was just another book about a pornstar. The writing is terrible, the sex scenes are disgusting and the characters are boring and annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the book, but was disappointed that it was so difficult to find a good reference for a good book that is a very good one.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so boring that it is actually embarrassing to read. I have never been so bored in a book. It is just boring reading and not in a good way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping for more, but ended up feeling less than satisfied. I don't regret my purchase, but I just don't know if I'll ever want to read a book by that author again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't stand this book. I read it in a weekend, and didn't feel much like reading it at all. The author is a bad writer. She has an awful voice, and her writing is so choppy that I can't tell if the text is from a real person or from a character in a bad novel.   The book takes place in a fantasy world where a king's son has been kidnapped by a wizard and held captive in his castle. I have to admit that I'm a bit of a sucker for this type of story, and while this one is a bit over the top, I can understand why some people would like it. But it's too cheesy to be a good book. It's hard to follow the plot, and there's a lot of stuff that doesn't add up. The king's nephew is actually a very boring character who spends most of the book being a dud. The story is so bad that it's hard for me to even recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor book. The author's main thesis is that we humans have become so desensitized to our surroundings that it is no longer worth trying to find out the truth about anything in this modern world. His example is that the average person's idea of a good sandwich is the same as a good meal in Paris: nothing but ham and lettuce. This is true. But, he writes, the average man does not have that kind of information to base his choices on, and therefore the sandwich is simply an illusion.  I think it is a mistake to take something that is in fact just a good lie as a valid claim about reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping that it would be an interesting exploration of the subject matter but found it to be dry, confusing, and poorly written.   I had a hard time understanding a few of the more complicated parts of the book, and found myself going back to look at the original research and conclusions before I made any decisions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about the war in the Ukraine, not a good book about the US.   It is a history of the war, with an occasional account of events in the US, and it is all ahistorical and misleading.  It also has a history that is entirely irrelevant to the events it describes.  The authors were partisans of the pro-Russians in the Kiev revolution, and there is an odd, self-serving, and very anti-American view of history here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a poorly written, badly researched, and just plain old lame book.    This book tries to be a serious account of the development of the English language.  The author claims to be able to speak the language. He can't.  He uses his "profession" as an excuse.  This book is just a list of "words"  I could not get through      
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was weak. The main character, the boy, had a father who was a "joker" (the best description I've seen of a father) and a mother who was "fussy". I could have written a much more accurate and original character summary:    "He's not your typical boy...   He doesn't like to get his hands dirty...  Not like his father...  "       This isn't a bad story.   It's just a little predictable and cliché.  It was really interesting to learn more about his mother (who I didn't know about) and his father.  I'm glad that he's going to be in a school that's based on a book, but it would have been better if the story had focused on a family from another country (perhaps Russia) instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had many good books but this one is bad.  It's about a boy who has an older brother who is a bad person and the brother does nothing but try to kill the boy and gets away with it.   It makes me feel bad for the boy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read, by a man who has absolutely no talent for writing and absolutely no interest in any sort of entertainment. He wrote it because he had nothing better to do, he thought it would be good for publicity.   The characters were all completely unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poorly written book.  It's a good book, it's a very bad book. The first half of the book is really good, but the second half is so bad it makes me feel like I've read the same book for the past 5 years.  The first part is about a girl who is trying to find a job and she's not doing so well, and she does a lot of work to get her skills up to a good enough level.   She ends up working at a restaurant and gets to work with a guy who she's a little attracted to, but then they both get a job at a different restaurant and they both end up getting fired.  She gets fired and is a little bummed about it, but she keeps going.  When she goes to her new job at the new restaurant, she's surprised to find that her old boss at the restaurant is still there, so she's in her old job at another restaurant and ends up not working at her old one because the other boss is the new boss.  And that's basically the first half.  As far as the second part is concerned, it starts out with her trying to get some money so she can get some insurance, but there's a whole lot of shady characters involved in that.  At one point, her new boss is going to give her a promotion because she's such a good employee, but he ends up giving her a demotion because she got pregnant, and the demotion was for being pregnant.  Eventually, she makes a big mistake, and her boss decides that he's going to get rid of her, but after he gets rid of the bad guy at the other restaurant who's also the bad boss, they have to work together to get him out of a jam.  They end up doing a little bit of crime together, but they're not so good at it that it's much of a crime.  I found the book to be extremely frustrating and I ended up skipping it in frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished this book and it was not enjoyable. It was not even entertaining for what it was supposed to be. I had high hopes for this book because I love books about the Civil War, but this book was all about the North and not the South. It is all about why the North lost the war. It does a good job at explaining why the South had to be victorious over the North, but there was nothing I liked about it. The author was not objective in this book, he was only trying to be objective. It would be a good book if the author had a little more understanding about the American Civil War. I think the author missed a great opportunity to write a great book about the civil war and to help teach people about the war and the soldiers. I will not be buying this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was very young, and I've forgotten about it. But I remember thinking it was a great book about a great person, and that I'd love to know more about her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of so many false statements about the past that it just boggles my mind that someone is still peddling it.  In fact, it is so inaccurate and ridiculous that it is hard to know where to begin.  There are no known or documented instances of the Jews having done anything wrong.  Jews are not the descendants of the ancient Israelites, as the book claims.  The book is a fraud, plain and simple.  It is full with bogus historical facts and bogus "evidence".  In this book, I found that there were many inaccuracies and omissions, but there were also some things that I found to be true.  I wish the author would have written a more thorough and scholarly book that was more objective.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that I will be sure to read when it is available again is the one about the American economy.   It is a book that was very important to me.  It was also a book I read very fast and didn't like much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very good for a nonfiction book about a person who does a lot of good but never gets a lot (and never even gets a little). It is very informative but very dull in the end. I liked that the author didn't try to use all of the information about the history of the movement but focused on the early years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad I can't stand to read it. It was hard for me to buy this book as I love fantasy novels. I found the plot lame and the characters uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is really long, but if you can get through it, it's good. The pacing is really bad, but there are a couple of good ideas. I just don't know how much of a good idea they are. I also don't like the author's voice, he seems to have no real ideas of his own. I'd say, read it if you want to read about a character who is good at magic but doesn't know it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The prose is bad. The plot is terrible. The characters are all bland. This book is filled with clichés, poor characterization, and a plot that is completely pointless.  I don't care about the characters, the plot, or anything else about the book.  The only reason I've kept this on my shelf is because the cover is so nice!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is lame, the characters are poorly developed, the plot is so weak it makes you want to scream, the author is awful. The only thing that makes it worth reading is the plot twist and the final scene, but that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy reading this book. I felt like I was reading a very boring book with nothing of interest going on. The book is about a man named Robert "Bob" "Red" O'Neill, who in 1941 became a high-ranking officer in the U.S. Navy and rose to the rank of Admiral. He was the top commander of the Pacific fleet during the war, and had an amazing command of the sea. He became the only U. S. Naval officer to be awarded the Medal of Honor in the Pacific War. But, while all this was going on, he was a high school dropout who went to Princeton, where he was an honor student. So, why did the world's most famous naval officer drop out of college and become a naval officer? Well, in the book Red tells the story of how he did it. It is pretty amazing, in my opinion, that Red would make a great naval officer. He is a natural born leader, and he has a way of commanding people that is so powerful that he could get the most important people in the world to do whatever he wanted them to do. He gets a group of young men together and gives them all a list of things they are supposed to accomplish. This list is never very long, so they have no trouble finishing them. This is the power of a leader. They finish these tasks, and the next day he is back to having the authority that they gave him. It all works, because he has the authority. I found it strange that he went from being a high ranking officer to a high student. This was not the way the Navy was supposed to be run. I was surprised that he did not become a professor and get more respect from the college faculty. I am not a big fan of the Navy. It seemed that the Navy had the right idea in getting rid of officers who were not good leaders. They seem to have a lot of them who are useless, and I don't think it is wise to keep people like this. I hope that Red was able to take advantage of the opportunity given him to become a Naval officer, because that would be a great accomplishment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of science fiction, and a huge supporter of the genre as a whole. I was looking forward to this book, as I had read a lot of this type of material in the past. However, this book is a total waste of time.   The plot was predictable and uninteresting.  The story was really a long string of things happening at the same time, and never had a "big" climax.  I really could not connect to the characters.  There was no tension, and the plot just felt very predictable.  At one point, a character mentions how he's had to kill his family to make ends meet, and then there was a fight with the guy's sister, so who knows?   For a book called "The Last One", I'd expect at least a few of these things to happen, but I didn't even get that.  So in conclusion, I really can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. It's about an extremely powerful wizard who was one of the most feared wizards in all of history. He used his power for good, but it was often difficult for him to do so. He had a few good people around him, but they were always at odds. When I first heard of him, I thought it was an interesting book. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the lack of a happy ending. I just wanted more, not less. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible! The plot is really bad and there is no mystery at all, it is really just an annoying book. The writing is bad as well. The characters were boring. I thought the ending was stupid. The only good thing about it is the last page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out with a lot of hype, so much that I was tempted to give up on reading the book and buy the movie instead. The book's main focus is the concept of the Matrix (the computer that connects all the worlds of the universe), but then it jumps to the whole Matrix vs. real world theme, which is not very interesting. The story is about the evil people who tried to use the Matrix to destroy the world and the hero who used the Matrix against them. The protagonist is an android, who had to put on the clothes of a real person to stop them from using the Matrix for their evil purposes. It was really cool to see how much the writer of the book had to learn about the Matrix before he could even write a paragraph about it. There was just so much info that I had to go on a google search to get any of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so very bad that I can't even begin to talk about it.  I was expecting a good book about the science of sex, but it's really just a very boring and boring book about sex.  The writing style is very dry and very pretentious and it makes me very angry.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to say that this book is NOT the first in a series by the same author.  This book was the second one that I have read.  It is a good read, but it is a little bit more complicated than it needs to be.  The characters in this book are really shallow and I could see how a character in a book about a cult would be a little more interesting.  I was disappointed in this novel because it did not offer much to me.  A lot of the action took place in the church and I did not feel that the story was that interesting.   I do not think that the author should be held responsible for the poor quality of this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a hard time getting through this book.  There were too many times when I was confused about what was going on or the fact that there was so little information provided.  I found myself going back and rereading sections of the book because I didn't quite understand how they were different.    This book was a waste of my time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really disappointed in this book. The main character is a racist. The fact that she thinks that the white woman in her house is not attractive is completely off putting. The whole thing makes me feel bad for her.  I would not have recommended this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book, and didn't get it. The story seemed very generic and unoriginal, with lots of plot holes. It didn't feel like a true story, but instead just another boring thriller. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book about a great character, but it's so badly written it makes the character seem completely one-dimensional. The author has to rely on lots of detail that doesn't really help the characters to make sense. The narrator also tries to tell the reader about the characters, but fails to do so in a way that's actually interesting.   The only good thing about this book is that the author gives us an opportunity to hear the author's own thoughts on the book. It's really interesting to see a writer with his own ideas about writing, his own opinions about the craft, and his own philosophy about the writing process. The problem is that in the end, the book is a mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't stand these books.  Their plots are too contrived.  They have characters who seem too perfect to be real, but are just there to be the perfect foil for the main character.    I am a bit disappointed in how they are not in fact written by the same author.  The first one was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book after reading it a couple of years ago.  It's still very good.   It is still a very good read and I am still a fan of Mr. Smith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part about this book is that the author is not very good at telling a story and doesn't care about the story. The author tries to do this by having a very large number of people (who all know each other and have been friends for a long time) who have all heard a rumor that the book is about a cult that will kill their entire family if they tell the truth about a conspiracy to kill a prominent person. However, when they try to get the truth out of a person named D.B. (who knows that it is about him and is only pretending to be a friend) he makes them tell the entire truth about the rumor that a cult is behind it. However as soon as they do, he tells them that it was a hoax and they are now part of a cult. I don't understand how people get so upset about something that someone else wants to make up about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read. It's boring, it's boring to me.   There are a lot of things I would have liked to know in the book, but not because it is an instruction manual about how to do things (which it isn't)   but because it doesn't go very deep into any one thing.  I'm sorry that the author chose this book, it was the only one that I could find that is not about how I do things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a kid and loved it. I am a little disappointed that I never got the chance to finish it. My mom loved it as well, so I guess that means that the author's daughter (whom I think would be a great author for children's literature) probably liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't recommend this book at all. I am a medical writer and had always thought I would never read a medical book. However, this book is not about medical care but about the "art" of making money. Dr. Cates describes the process of creating a "good" book, but it was too difficult for me to read. I was hoping to find a book about medical research that would teach me something about science and medicine. But, I am disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  This book was written to make you believe that black women have it easy in the world.  The author did not take the time to learn about the lives of black women and how they have to struggle just to survive.  She also does not seem to understand the importance of a black woman having a strong family unit.  I am ashamed to say that I have no interest in reading another book like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book.  This book is so poorly written that it reads like a series of disconnected conversations.  The characters are not the only ones to make stupid decisions; the other characters are also very dumb.  I found the book very boring.  It was very much a "I'm bored of all the stupid people" story.  As for the story itself, it was interesting, but the characters were so bad that it made it difficult to care about the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not an enjoyable book at all. I think that I might have enjoyed it if it had been shorter.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad. I really didn't understand it, and found it really annoying and disheartening that there are so many things in the book that are just plain wrong. The biggest one is the "fascinating" part of the book: that a couple of centuries ago a woman named Maria was the first woman to have a baby.   It's true that there was a time in history when a woman could give birth to a healthy child, but it's just as true that a woman cannot give birth naturally to a child, let alone a healthy one.  It is also true that the time in which this woman lived was extremely difficult, with little to no medical care.  So if Maria was born in a time of great poverty and extreme poverty, and then had a child (who wasn't herself well-off) in a society that was very well-equipped to care for children, how was the child born healthy?  I'm really confused by how people are trying to claim that this was an important historical event that has a lot of significance in our world.  I just don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A boring book about a boring topic.    It's like a bunch of people who don't know about anything besides "being the best" wrote it and I don't care.
