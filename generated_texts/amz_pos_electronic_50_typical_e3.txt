Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device is great for a very good price.  It has an audio input and a microphone input.  I am not sure how the audio output is supposed to work.    I have a sine wave audio input from a laptop.  When I plug in a mic, I hear static.  This was not a problem with my laptop audio.  There is no headphone jack so I have no way of listening to audio from my phone.  But it is easy to plug in and out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have owned my PS3 since it came out. It has always worked flawlessly and has never been in any kind of repair work.  It has a lot of features and is quite the gamer.  This is the first time I have been unhappy with my purchase.  The first thing I noticed was that the hard drive tray got caught in the drive slot.  After a bit of troubleshooting I found that the screws on the side of the drive tray were loose.  I took a screwdriver and loosened the screw.   I then tightened it and everything worked fine.  My problem is that the PS3 will not power on and turn on after having the hard disk tray loose.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this keyboard for my work. I had my old QWERTY keyboard with the numeric keypad in it for years. It was the only keyboard I could type with a good, normal hand. This new QWERY does not have the numeric pad but is great for typing with my right hand.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first electronic device (and one of the first of my own design), so I can't comment on any of the other devices that are on the market. But, as far as the design is concerned, I like it. I also like the way the keyboard has the numbers and the arrows on it (so you can easily change between numbers). The only thing that bothers me is that the keyboard only has 4 keys - two for the cursor and one for the spacebar. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very nice sound board for my Yamaha MT-20 keyboard, with some extras to make it even nicer. It has a built in mixer with EQ and gain knobs and a good quality, but expensive mixer preamp. It also has a line out jack so you can plug a CD player into it. I have had the sound board hooked up to my keyboard since late 1998. It works perfectly and is the best thing I've ever purchased for my keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had my e-reader for about 2 months now. I got it at Best Buy because it was on sale. It's been on and off. The battery is the main issue.  I tried it on, on, off, off again. I read a lot of books in the past year so I knew that was not going to work out.  After reading a few more books I noticed that the page turns at a very fast rate.   After a few hours of use the battery is almost completely dead.  That's not a good thing to do when you have an electronic device that you have to recharge often.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second laptop that I bought from Dell. I have been with the first one about 4 years now and it was the last one I used until I got this one. It has been through many hard drives, and many computers. It is a beast. The only thing that I dislike about it is that it can only accept memory cards that are 16GB. But other than that I love it. I will never buy another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very good keyboard. The key layout is the same as the QWERTY, so you can write very fast. I also like the way that the keys are all arranged on a circle. This way, you can type a lot faster than if you typed on a QWERW keyboard.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from I have a Macbook Pro 13 and I found the keyboard a bit... I have: a    MacBook Pro 13   in an 11 inch screen   and a  MacBook Air 13  in a 13 inch screen and this keyboard is very useful when I am typing. I use the space bar a lot to move around in the text field. I also found that I have to type on the keypad to use it. The other good thing is that I can change the keys to anything I want. The space bar is the only key that is hard to hit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had a few years now of owning a Motorola Droid. I purchased the Droid as a backup phone and a backup music player.    It's fast and responsive.  The back cover has a few rubber ridges and they are very grippy and easy to keep in place.  There are many other options out there for better batteries.  I still have the Droid and it's been a pleasure to use it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good tool to get started with the Arduino. It comes with a good set of parts and a good guide. I bought it mainly because of the "R" and "N" at the end of the names. I can tell them apart easily, but I'm not sure what it's for. It's good for beginners to try.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony HXR-NX7R portable audio player which I bought a few years ago to take to concerts. I like it a lot. It's not as good as the big high-end stereo I have, but for the price, it's pretty good. It has a good built-in mic and a decent built- in amplifier, so I use it to record acoustic guitars, and it's also good for a lot of music I don't care for, such as country, rock, and classical. I bought the new model with an internal mike, so the volume controls are on the front panel. The internal mikes are very sensitive and need to be set at high volumes to get decent sound. For that reason, I'm going to upgrade my HX7 to a better unit.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is a wonderful player I am a professional musician, I have been using my Sony HM-700 for about 3 years and it works perfectly. This player has all the features of my HM700 but with more. The player is much quieter and has a built in mic, that makes it a great player for home recording. I highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a great, low cost player.  the internal mics are also built in which makes it easy to use for live performance.

It's been working perfectly and the only problem I've encountered is that it's a little noisy. But that's a small price to pay for a fast computer.    If you can't afford a higher-end computer, I recommend a second-generation iMac as well. I bought it in the fall of 2008 and have been very happy with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device for an emergency situation. The battery lasts forever and can power anything from a flashlight to a laptop. This thing is so small and light that it makes it really easy to hide. Also, if you do get caught, you can get away with just using a keychain light to conceal yourself. I use mine in places where my keys would get me arrested.

I can connect it directly to my HDTV with no problem, but when I connect it with the cable that came with it it seems to get stuck in the port and sometimes I can't get it out. Also the remote is a little small and hard to use, but I don't really mind since it is pretty and is very accurate.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these in my collection. The first is a nice looking unit with nice sound. I use it with my old Sony PSE-35 which has some built in speakers that can't be heard on the old unit. I like the PSE35 better. The PSE4 does have a small disadvantage: The power button on the P4 is not on the front of the unit but on the bottom of the speaker. This means I have to get at the top of the P3 before pressing the power button. This is a good thing. The other P4 I have is the same model with the larger speakers and better battery life. This one is a great little unit. It has been a long time since I used an old tube radio. This unit sounds great and has a nice range.

The only downside to the camera is that it is extremely sensitive to light, and even the slightest shadow or reflection is enough to cause it to crash. That being said, it is worth every penny, especially for the low price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson printer is a good all-around printer, not very good for professional work.   It's only good for a couple of different types of printing, such as photoshopping photos, or drawing.  It has good ink capabilities, but it doesn't use it well, printing on thick paper.  My computer uses it for scans, which is better.  I got the printer because I'm a big fan of Epson.

If I am going to buy an MP3 player for a couple of dollars then I will take a look at this one.

It comes with a couple different programs to use as well as a CD and a couple other things to play. It has a nice little plastic case. I don't know if I would buy this again, but if you're looking for a nice portable device for your laptop then you might want to look into this one

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had the original Dell laptop that came with my iMac when it was a "pre-laptops" era. I wanted to get rid of it but I was afraid to.  The keyboard is just too small for my hands.  It has a floppy drive but it's a little hard to get in and out.  My old Dell has more room for a hard drive and a bigger battery.  I found that the original hard drive was more reliable than the newer one.  After a few weeks of using it, I was able to use it as a media server and I'm very pleased.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to replace a bad battery in my computer. The quality of the unit is good. It's very light and compact. It is not easy to charge because it has a plug at the bottom but I found it works well. I use the usb cord to connect the unit to my computer via usb. I just put it in and plug the USB into my pc. I can use my laptop at night and not worry about the power going out. The screen is very bright and the sound quality is great. It does have one drawback: the battery life is about 3 hours. But if you need to charge your laptop, you can't go wrong with this product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by KEVIN from This is a good battery. I bought the 8400 mAh and it lasts about a week.

It's very easy to program your MPX and it's very good. The MPX has a lot of flexibility and this gives you a good amount of flexibility as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's been a few months since I had the new Sony VCD-C1000, but I love the new screen, and I love it with the CD player.   The interface on the CD has been a bit of a problem for me, but it is the way the VCD drives work that is the problem.  If you have a CD player, and the computer screen is in a different place than the player, the CD will read from the player's memory and write to the computer's RAM.  The problem is that the player will read out the first half of the CD, but will not read the last half.  This will not work, unless you buy a new player.

I have a small cell phone (Sprint Galaxy S3) and had the old iPhone 5s so it was easy to switch to the 6. I didn't expect to be using a wireless data connection to my laptop but my old one was no longer working so I had to buy a new one.    The phone works perfectly.  I can check my email, read my email on my tablet, and watch the tv on my phone.  It is much better than my old phone which is now my work phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great monitor. It is light and easy to move. It can be used as a PC monitor, or as a laptop monitor. I just bought this monitor for my wife who wants to do video editing and she loves it. I am glad I bought it and she will love it too.  Rated 4 out of 5 by David from Very good monitor for the price I am not very happy with the resolution on the monitor. The resolution is lower than a 60Hz monitor but you get what you pay for. The screen looks great and the price is right. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is the cable. It was hard to keep the monitor attached to the computer to connect the cable to the cable adapter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first purchase from Digi-Key, and I'm very happy.  The device itself is excellent.  There is very little lag, which is nice.  It does take some getting used to, though.  My old laptop had a much larger screen than this one, but I still have a hard time using it.  I can't quite see the layout of the keyboard at the moment.  This device has a lot of potential, though, so hopefully that will change with more experience. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the first time I've used a smart phone and I was really surprised at how fast it was to load files. I use my iPad as a laptop but there's a big difference in file loading speed and file transfer speed. I have my iPad with 4gb of storage and it takes me 10 minutes to download the same 4gb video on my phone it takes 10 minutes on the iPad. I can't say if the phone is waterproof or not because I've had a few drops on the front and sides but I've been through about 100 pages of a book in a very long period of time. I've never had a bad experience with a phone but I'm pretty sure that this will be the last one that I get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent electronic device. It is very useful and has a good amount of memory. The batteries last a long time and last me about 10 months. It does not get hot and does not require much maintenance. It works great. I am a musician who needs to keep all of my records in a pocket. This has a very good amount and has all the songs in my collection and is small enough that it is not a big deal to keep it. I'm a fan of digital recording because it allows me to make my own records. The record player is very good, it does not play all the time but it is good enough to play when I am out and about. I recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my cell phone as an upgrade to the previous one. It has a nice design and it works flawlessly.

I have an SDS-100M, and it works great with it, but it does not allow me to read my odometer, which I use to determine the distance traveled. This thing works great for the most part. The only downside is that the power button needs to be removed to access the battery compartment.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a Dell Inspiron laptop, and after a few days I decided I'd give it a go. I've owned several laptops over the years and have always had issues with bootup/shutdown and I thought I was about to have the same problem. But it took about an hour and a half to set up and get it working. I had to go to the computer store to get a different model number because mine was the same model number as the laptop that was in my brother's computer case. So I have another Dell laptop, but now I have two Dell Inspirons.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my mousetrap all the time, and have it for more than a decade. I was hoping it would work with my new camera, but it does not. I tried everything I can think of: new battery, new battery holder, new lens, new camera.  I have been able to get my mics to work on it by putting them in the other side of the case.  If they fit in the mousets case, I just can't get them to fit in my camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a big fan of this product.  I can't wait to buy a second one.  The only con I can think of is the fact that it's hard to use at first.  This is a big, heavy case, and you need a steady hand to put it together.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first computer, and I'm so glad I bought it. The graphics card is very powerful, and you can run games pretty much as fast as I can play them. The keyboard is excellent and responsive. It's also really comfortable to type on. The only problem I have with it is that it's not really built like a tank: the processor fan is in the back. This can be annoying, and it's hard to see what's going on. Also, the screen is not really bright. I get used to it though.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little sound device.  I bought this for a friend and he absolutely loves it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this in March for the first time. I used it for about a month and then I decided to sell it because of a lot of issues that I had with it. I have had my problems with my computer, and this thing is no exception. I've had it since November of last year, and it's not perfect. The biggest issue is that the micro usb port is very short, so I have to constantly plug it in or it won't charge.  The other thing that I've been having issues with is that it gets really hot.  Other than that, the product is a great value and I'm glad that I purchased it.

After that it works great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second Sony Playstation 2. This one is about 5 years old and has a lot of use. It has been my gaming machine for years. It is very quiet, and it plays pretty good. I have been buying this device since it came out in 2005. I don't know why they don't make a better one.  Good value, but has a few problems:  It is pretty cheap. However, there are a few drawbacks. 1) You have to put it into the DVD drive when it is powered on to make it boot into the game. This is because the DVD slot is too small to fit the drive. 2) There is no built in memory card slot. You have have to plug a USB memory card into the PS2's USB port. 3) It does not have a built in modem. 4) You can only plug in a USB cable into the port on the back of the PS 2. 5) There are no built-in speakers. 6) You cannot use it as a PC, you have to buy a keyboard. I was able to hook it up to a laptop through the HDMI port and was able play a few games, but there are some things I would not do. It took about 30 minutes to connect the PS and a USB mouse. If you are buying this for gaming, it would be nice if you could buy a controller as well. It does have a power button on the front. .

That's just a little weird.

I like the USB port, as it makes it easy to share my files to other people. I'm using it in my hotel room. The only thing that I don,t like about it is the way it mounts on my desk. It is really hard to just pop it in, as the clips can be a little tricky to get on. I think it would be better if it had a detachable stand.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my 12 year old son to play with. He was a huge fan of the Sega Genesis and the Mega Drive. This unit is awesome. I was surprised to see that the controller is a standard controller. It's not a joypad so much as it's a standard gamepad. This means that it's not like the Sega Mega Drive, but I don't mind. I can get used to using the standard controller if I need to. The only problem is that there is no sound, so I can't get the game to sound right.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is great to work with, especially when I can see it from my desk. I have used the iMac at my desk for several years now, and the iPad for a short time. The iMac works fine, but I just don't have the time to devote to the iPad and I get tired of using the touch screen. The iPad is a great device for kids, and for use as a tablet for reading. It's really nice to have a full sized tablet for my kids to use. I am really happy I bought this and have it in my office.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this monitor to do some graphics work on a digital project I'm working on. The picture is very clear, very bright, and the picture is clear enough that I didn't have to adjust my monitor settings.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good little device, if you want a little more power in a little smaller package.  This little monster is a little larger than a credit card, but that makes it easier to use.  The battery is pretty powerful and it's rechargeable.  It takes a few hours to get it charged, but you can charge it while you're using it.  There is a built-in speaker that makes this little monster more useful.  You can also use it as a phone.  I'm using it to check my e-mail at work.

I can fit it in my pocket without it taking up any extra space, and it still has enough juice to last a few days.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the first electronic device that I purchased and I've found it to be very useful.   I bought a pair of these to replace my old pair of cheap headphones that would not play my mp3's.  I've had good luck with other products that cost a lot more and I thought that the sound quality would be the same as these.  When they first arrived I thought I was getting a pair that had a bad capacitor and it would not work with mp3s.  After the first day or two I started to get some sound quality problems.  First I heard a hiss in the sound.  Then I heard the sound coming out of my ear.  This has never happened to me before.  It sounded as if I was listening to the speaker that was mounted in my ear canal.  However after reading about some problems with these headphones I decided to try them.  The next day after using them all day I had the same problem.  Since then I have replaced all of my mp9's with these and have not had a problem.

It has several modes of operation: it can play music from the CD player, read CD and MP3 files, play and pause a video, and play a sound file.  The device is also quite easy to use.  This was my first time using a CD player and I found it very easy to operate. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice device, but it's not great for everything. I bought this for a digital camera and it works fine. It's nice to have the ability to adjust shutter speed on the fly and have the speed adjusted by holding the button down and sliding the dial up and down. The buttons are a little on the stiff side, but they're not too bad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a replacement for a previous digital camera.   The camera is pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using my HP Pavilion laptop since 2008. The only reason I got the HP Pavilion is because my work PC has a floppy drive.   The HP Pavilion has been my work computer ever since I purchased it in 2008.  I use it to do all my documents and my school's business software.  It is so simple to use, and it is very stable.  The only thing I wish is that I had purchased a laptop like it back in 2008 instead of the one I have now. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used the X2 for 3 days now. It has served me well. I am not a gamer but the 3D games that I have tried so far are not bad at all. The X2 works with my laptop, and with my phone and tablet. I use my X2 as a remote control for my TV and the cable TV in my house. I also use it to watch videos on YouTube on my PC. It is easy to use and works great. I will continue to use it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very nice electronic device, but unfortunately the internal batteries do not work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with my Epson. I love the fact that it has a built in projector that has the ability to play DVD movies.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had an old laptop that had become a junk drawer for my kids, so I decided to buy a new one. This thing is so easy to set up and has everything that I needed. It works great. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it doesn't have a built in hard drive. But it was a lot cheaper than a new laptop so I'm not complaining.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this in October, I needed to get a new TV remote to replace the one that had gotten dinged up. I thought that I could just buy the new one, but I found that they do not make the remote anymore, so I had to go to a store and order a different one. It works fine and I can use the TV remote as well as the computer. I don't like having to type in passwords on the computer, but at least I can see what the computer is doing. The price was really good and I don`t have to deal with my computer getting dirty.  Rated 5 out of 5 by J from This remote is a nice addition. The only thing I would change is that it could use some more buttons to make it easier to use. It would also be nice if the button labeled "Start" would work in the same way as the "Menu" button. It is really hard to find the menu button on the back of the remote when you first put it on your tv. It also is very hard to use the start button to go back in the menu if you want to change channels or channels you have already selected.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this as my first digital camera and it has performed flawlessly. I was worried about the camera being "fixed" in the way that a digital camera is but after a week of shooting and having the camera on the camera strap it looks like I've bought a quality product. It has more features that the Olympus I used for 20 years ago and has better image quality. I'm now using the camera to record video of my kids and it's great.

I can use the DVD and then use the optical in a flash drive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the    Kobo   for over a year now. I have purchased it from Amazon for about $50. It is fast, easy to use and works well. I find that it is easy to get the pages back into the device. I was a bit worried about how the book would look when I got it out of the package. However, the book is really good quality. The pages are thick and sturdy. I think it would be a good investment if you like reading.

It's a little hard to fit the antennas that I have, but I was able to get a good result.

Rated 5 out of 5 by James from Great for my Mac Mini This is a very nice product for a good price. It's small and light weight. It has all the features I need, including the DVD burner. I haven't seen an optical drive that is smaller than this and it's not even close to being an optical disc drive. It also has the ability to play back a DVD. I can't think of anything I could want more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The  Nucleus  is a great little machine that does a lot. The main screen shows the current date, battery life and processor speed. It also has a small, very useful battery level display that gives you the current charge level of the battery. The battery level can be changed with the  Nuculator, which is attached to the  C-clip on the bottom of the  Nucleus. It can be attached to an  Arduino  with a single wire, or to a Raspberry Pi  with an additional wire.   The C-clips are attached to two different spots on the top of the  Nucleous  (they can be used to attach to a 3.5mm  plug  if you want to use a different cable).    I have used the Nucleo to test a lot of electronics. It has worked flawlessly in all cases.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a Sennheiser PCM-M4A in the early 1980s and used it for many years until my son got me a Sonex (Mk II) which is better. I've had several of the Sennhers. The first one I had was a Sony D3, but it was broken and I bought a new one from a local electronic store. This is the best one I've owned. It's a bit loud, but very clear. The built in mic works very well and you can use it in stereo or mono. The only problem is that it can get pretty hot, so keep that in mind.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first time I have used an external USB drive, and I'm really glad I bought it. The external drive is a must have for all those times when you don't have an extra floppy drive or an external hard drive and need a backup of your files. I was able to backup my files without a computer (I can only connect to my computer via a USB cable) and have access to them on any computer I want. The drive itself is small and portable, and you can even use it as a media player by plugging it into an audio interface. I just don't like using external drives on a daily basis. I used it yesterday to backup a few files, and it was very quick and easy. I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a really good device. I have been using a digital watch since about 2000, and the only major improvements that were made were better battery life, better GPS, better accuracy.   When I first bought it, I was excited to finally replace the analog watch that I had, but when I saw the price tag, I knew I couldn't afford it.  However, when I got it I just about fell off my chair.  The design is great.  I'm not sure I'd ever buy a cheap electronic device, but I would certainly consider buying one of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This little guy is very versatile.  It has all the features I was looking for and it's compact.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the screen is pretty dim and the battery only lasts a couple of hours.  However, for the price, I don't mind it at all.

I use my TV as my main source of entertainment and have been buying a lot of Blu Ray's for the last few years.   These sound just like my DVD player!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product. I used to have a mechanical keyboard that would only type on the back of a floppy disk, but this keyboard works with my iPhone and works great. I use it for word processing and other typing.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Lacey from Easy to Use, Great Functionality I bought this keyboard to use for my iPhone as well as my old computer, and I love it! I use the iPad as my main computer so I am always on the go and when I do use my computer, I need a keyboard to type on. The keyboard is very easy to use, the keys are easy to find, the keycaps are easy for me to work with and the touch pad is very responsive.

It holds a good amount of music and video, and you can charge it by plugging it into a USB port at home. You can't beat that!

I can fit this thing in my pocket, in my camera bag, in a briefcase.  It does take a while to charge up.  If I wanted to take a picture, it would take a couple of hours.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen was very clear and sharp.   When I was first reading the manual I thought the computer would not boot because it had no operating system.  But after a little practice I figured it out.  I had to download an operating system that allowed me to connect a printer to it.  Also the battery life was a little limited.  For a day or two I had the computer working great.  However after the batteries drained out and I used it again for a few hours, it failed.  The software and the drivers for the computer are not complete and the support for the device is very bad.  This is a very expensive device that I have spent $100 on but I will be very disappointed if I am not able to replace my broken computer with a different brand.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It was a pain to get the batteries out, but they worked.

It takes a bit to get used to it, but it does the job, I think.

I use it mostly to take pictures but I also use it to do word processing.  The only issue I have with it is that the hard drive seems to be stuck and the hard disk won't read any files from it.  It won't turn off if I turn off the power to it, but it still has power.  That is a little annoying.

The only downside is that it is only a 4 pin molex.

I've been using my printer at home since the 70s. I like it so much I'm going to get one for my home office, too. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The best audio monitor I've ever owned. The monitor is extremely loud (much more than the computer speakers I had been using) and accurate. The built in microphone is a must have for any engineer. The best part is that it doesn't break down (which I've had to do with many monitor systems) I've only had to replace the audio input jack once (it's too noisy). It's so quiet, that I use it in my studio all the time.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Best sound quality out there, even at its price I was a little disappointed by the lack of a mic in the audio jack on the monitor. This monitor was a no-brainer purchase, especially considering the price. It is very accurate, and provides a great sound. My first choice would have been the Sony MR-60, but this is way more accurate than that system, even without a mic. My only regret is that I was unable to get it to work with a CD player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device for when you need to listen to a song or podcast without having to plug it in to a PC. The interface is easy to navigate. The speakers are loud enough, but not very clear. I used the sound card in my PC, so the volume is a little low. The other thing is that the sound quality is better when you're listening to a CD over a USB connection.  This is a good product at a reasonable price. I will be buying more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first set of USB headphones. I have used several in the past and they all sounded the same.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the   Xtreme Pro for a little while now, and I've never been disappointed.   It's a very good quality device that's easy to use.  It doesn't come with many of the accessories you may find on other similar devices.  The case is pretty nice and the keyboard and mouse are nice and accurate.  There's a really good program that makes it easy to change the key combinations you want to use, and it's pretty easy to find.  I like the fact that you can do this on the computer while on the road, so you don't need to lug the Xtremes around.

It's a nice camera that's quite different from the typical Olympus PENTAX cameras.  It does everything I need and then some.  A nice lens is good for the price, a good video cam is nice, a great viewfinder is great.  I got the camera for the tripod mount.  The mount is great and the camera is very light.  You can shoot handheld and it's really a good cam for that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good portable keyboard, but it does have some problems.  It has a small key on the right side, and it is very hard to type on, because the keys are too far away from the keyboard.  If you want to use it as a normal keyboard, you should look for a larger one that has keys close to the keyboard, and that is also good.  This would be good for travel.  I bought it for travel, because my old keyboard is a bit broken.

I keep my other tool (a bottle brush) in a separate place, but it would be nice to have a bottle tool that could be used to hold a bottle brush and a bottle and get them out at the same time. I also use it to put an empty bottle on the floor so I don't spill a lot of nail polish. I love the fact that it doesn't take up much space.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The XM is a great, compact, and accurate way to record and replay.  I used to work at a local radio station and was always searching for a way to capture that station's show.  The xm is the perfect solution.  It's small and lightweight, and has enough power to get it through most obstacles.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm an electronic engineer who is also a musician and musician-electronics designer. This was my first purchase from an online store, but it came with great advice, and is well built. It's very small and light. The volume knob is very responsive, and the interface is easy to navigate. I also like that I can set it to whatever volume I want by turning the knobs up and down. Overall, it's a very good deal and a good introduction to electronic devices in general.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is awesome!  I bought it because I'm a big fan of the old-school Nintendo games, and I don't really want a Wii.  This is a great alternative that doesn't suck, either.  It's fast and responsive and very easy to use.  I can play Super Mario 3D World on it while I'm watching a movie on my TV, and it works perfectly.  The controls work well, too.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a good old V-1 Walkman, the model with the yellow face. It has a built-in speaker that plays music. It's good for listening to the radio (or maybe a radio show). I've been looking for a new one, but none of the ones that have been on the market have worked. But then, I don't have any good ideas to sell them. Now that I have an inexpensive, portable V-2, I have one to use on my walkman. It is a good piece of equipment.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from It's small, but it plays music I've had a Walkman for years, but never had a need for an external speaker. I had one installed in a bedroom and the sound was very tinny. I was thinking of buying a second one. This one has the speaker built in, so I can use it on my Walkman and still have a radio. I have the Walkman on a shelf, but now it is just hanging off the back of my chair. I also have a stereo system and am using a Bluetooth headset to listen to music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this camera to use for my wedding. I don't think I can recommend it highly enough. I used it for the entire shoot. It was very easy to set up and use. It has a very nice built in flash. The lens was very sharp. The built in camera viewfinder is excellent. The only problem is that the batteries in the camera are not interchangeable. I have to buy extra batteries to make it work. It's worth the money if you need a very small and cheap camera to take pictures of your guests.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was in need of a good, portable radio.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this camera because I'm in the market for a new camera. I'm a huge Nikon fan, so when the new Nikon D750 was announced I had to get one. This camera is the best I've used so far. It's very fast, accurate, and has the best quality. The only downside is that the lens cap falls off often, but you can always buy a replacement.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this to replace an older one that I bought a few years ago that was a bit too small for my needs. This one is about as big as I'd want it to be. It's a bit heavier than I expected but it fits nicely in my backpack. It works fine. The display is not very bright but I can adjust the brightness by adjusting the color temperature slider on the back. I think the only issue I have with it is that it's a little noisy. There are a few clicks and rattles every so often. Other than that I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the third electronic device I have purchased. I have a Sony Playstation 2 and the Sony VTR-S and a PS2. The VTR is very good but the PS2 is not. The PS2's remote is much better. It has a larger button that is more comfortable to use and it has a button that you can press to change between a game and a movie. Also, the PS3 is about 5 times more expensive. But, if you're looking for a great computer that is very small and looks nice and you don't want to spend a lot of money, the VTR's remote and DVD player are good choices.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 on a special offer at Best Buy because I couldn't afford to buy the new iPhone 5. I didn't want a phone with a plastic case that would scratch easily. I have to admit that the phone is nice. It is very slim. I use it mostly as a music player but can listen to most of the music on my computer. It has a very small display but that is not a problem for me. The only thing I don't like about it is the "clicky" button on the back of the phone. The buttons feel like a plastic toy. It doesn't hurt to tap the button but I wish they would have made a different one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first Mac and I am really impressed with the performance and quality of the machine. I have a Mac Pro, which is the most powerful Mac ever made, but this is even more powerful. I am a very serious photographer and a professional photographer in the field, and this is the only computer I use now that I can afford. It also is a lot easier to use than my old Mac.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little unit, the price is great, but the build quality is not the best.  The main board and the case are made out of a plastic,  which does bend easily,  but  also  has a plastic coating that can peel and crack easily, and the LCD is only on one side    This will probably last me a long time,   but it is not  a must have

It is fast and quiet.  I also like the way it is designed for the touchpad.  The only downside is that the batteries do not hold a charge very long, but that is just an issue with the brand.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a used iPod from an electronic parts store to play music on the computer, but it never worked properly.   The iPod came with a CD player and the speakers, but the CD player would not play any music at all.  It worked fine when plugged into a computer and played the CD, but after a while it would not accept the audio.  After trying all the different brands of iPods (with and without the CD) I found the right one.

It is very light weight, it has a good sound quality, and it has everything you need to do a show, and all you need is a guitar.  It's like having a real guitar but without the need to actually play it.  I have been using the guitar for a year now and I haven't even been able to use it much but it's perfect for what I'm doing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using the K-Line R-500 in my studio for about a year now. It has done exactly what I wanted it to do.  I can get it out of the box, set it up, plug in the cables and then get a recording going in a few minutes.  The R-250 was so bulky that I always found myself looking at the R-350 when I was ready to get the recording going.   The K-line R-100 is much smaller, so the R100 has a little more flexibility, but the R500 has the most features.  It is a lot cheaper, so you get more functionality for less money.

The earbuds are very comfortable and they can be worn for a long period of time. The bass is deep and punchy, but it's not too harsh. I'm not sure if this is due to the headphones or just the way I listened to them. Overall, I'm very happy with them and would definitely recommend them to others.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this thing to use as a desktop monitor, and it does exactly what it says on the tin. I'm a big fan of computers, and these monitors have been on my wishlist for a while now. I was happy to see they were able to have their monitors display multiple graphics. The one I got is a 1k, but they do offer larger sizes in the store. I have the standard model, and have had no problems with it. The only problem I had was a few small scratches on the back of the monitor. I'd be careful using it with an external drive if you're trying to get the best out of it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this with the intention of using it to store my digital photos. However, after about a month of use it has already been broken, scratched and broken on every corner. The rubberized case it came in was also very flimsy. I can't imagine why this was sold as a "tactile" case when the case itself is very thin and flimsy and does not protect the unit. I would not recommend this unit to anyone, unless they are using it on a computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for a special occasion. My girlfriend bought me the iphone a few months ago.

The only thing I would change is that   I would have preferred that the    the case had a more durable back so i could put my camera on the back.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a huge fan of this little guy. It's easy to use, just plug it in, and it makes a great little music player. I don't think the "audio" on this thing is really an "audio", it's just an analog input, but that doesn't really matter. I'm just so used to my iPod and iPhone that I don�t even notice. It does have the same basic features as the iPhone, but it�s not like the iPhone is really a phone, it's more like a little computer that can run iTunes. So, the phone feature is nice, but for me it doesn't matter if the phone part is digital or analog. It�s just a great music player and that�s about it.

I'm really glad I got this for him!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I got the unit I was expecting it to be really small and be of poor quality. But when I opened the box I found a nice set of accessories for the unit: a USB cable, a micro USB cable and a micro SD card. I had a few different SD cards laying around, so I bought a new one for this.   It also came with an SD card reader, a USB to SD adapter and a small card reader.  The unit is very compact.  It took a lot of getting used to, but now it is a pleasure to use.  I am glad that the device is wireless, rather than being wired.

I purchased the GFX-1 and the Voodoo 2 with the VIA card and I am happy to say I'm getting more performance from this card than my old one.  It's much easier to play games like Doom 3 or even Quake 3 now.

It's the perfect size for my desk, and the key spacing is just right for me. It feels sturdy enough that it won't fall over while I'm typing, and it's loud enough that my office mates can't hear me typing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a nice phone.   A few things that could be better:  1.  If you buy this phone from Apple and pay $300 for a phone that is really good, you should expect the same quality.  It has a few bugs that don't really need fixing.  2.  For a phone costing over $200 it should have an internal battery instead of a removable one.  3.  There is a big white dot on the front of the phone, it looks like a camera lens, but it's not.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned this for about a year now, and it's a good, solid little recorder. It's small, lightweight, and doesn't cost a lot. It has great features for a small device: It records a good quality audio, and has a nice headphone jack that works great. It also has a good speaker, so it can be used to listen to music while you record. I've used it for interviews, music, and just talking on the phone. I have a Sony Walkman and a Panasonic RP-H910 that both record better. I'm just a bit too big to use the smaller recorder, but I've found that the audio is great with a little EQ and a bit of practice.

Now my G is the same quality as the day I got it! I highly recommend the G1!

The   first thing that surprised me was that it works   so well   that I can use it as my main camera

It works great. It's fast enough for a good quality screen (1920x1200) and it's pretty thin. It looks good as well. The monitor has a built in webcam, but I've never used it, so I can't comment on it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had my Nixdorf since it was introduced in 1989. I can count on one hand the number of times I've used the Nix. It is one of the most reliable, most affordable digital cameras around. It works on all the major digital cameras that came after it. I've been in the business a long time and have never had a bad one. I use it to take pictures of my home movies and it works fine. The only thing that might get in the way of a good picture is a good camera flash. The flash can be very bright and can actually get in between the camera and the film, ruining a good shot. I keep my NIXdorf on a tripod but I haven't used it with the flash attached. That might be a mistake.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a really good, simple and efficient way to control the TV in a room with no built-in TV tuner. I love the fact that the TV is connected directly to the computer with an Ethernet cable. It has the built in IR remote so I can control it via a remote. The remote is nice and large, has plenty of buttons and buttons are labeled so it is very easy to use. This is my third unit from D-Link.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the first device I've used that really makes me realize that music on an iPod is nothing more than a glorified MP3 file. If you listen to music from a computer you're paying for a digital copy.  I've got a great pair of Beats headphones.  These headphones work just fine for listening to my iPod but there's a HUGE difference between listening to music on a computer and listening to it on a pair of headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second pair of these earphones. I bought the earphones as an upgrade from my old headphones, which I got because they had a cord for the remote.  The cord for these earbuds was also a good idea, since I use a smartphone a lot.  As others have noted, the sound quality is much better than my old earphones, even though I don't use the phone as much as before.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the Apple TV about two years ago and was very happy with it. It works well and is extremely easy to use. I don't watch much TV so I didn't need the 4th channel. I am using it for watching a video I purchased.  I have the tv on all the time and it is extremely hard to find a good picture.  The Apple tv is also great for watching movies, the sound is good and the picture is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a great Sony DSC-HX700II that I love and use every day. I bought a Canon EOS 1D Mark IV as a backup to it, and now I'm considering getting the 1D III as well as the 1Ds Mark III. I like the 1ds Mark III a lot better than the 1d IV and have gotten a good deal on it. It's just that I was hoping that the 1s Mark III would have a better autofocus system.  It seems to me that the newer 1s III has a better AF system than the older 1d III.  This is a camera that you just can't beat.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just bought a new laptop and wanted to check out a couple of computer-based music players. I found the i-Mate on sale, and thought it was a good value for what it was (a $35 portable digital player).   It's not perfect:  The i-mate doesn't come with a built-in mic.   The keys are too short, and the screen can be a little dim.  But the features are great, and I'm looking forward to adding a couple more to my collection.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because I love my Xbox One.  I love how the controller is comfortable to hold.  It's a little awkward to hold with the right hand, but that's fine.  The joysticks and analog sticks feel great, and they're easy to maneuver.  As for the gamepad, it has the same features as the Xbox 360 version.  However, the Xbox One version has better graphics.  Also, the touchpad has a little rubber bump on it which makes it hard to click it, especially if it's not set up properly.  Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the second time I've bought a Sennheiser IEM.

The sound is very good, very clear. The bass is good, but not overly so. This is a very good quality device.

I'd probably buy another if I ever need a new one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by JT from great quality monitor I bought this monitor to replace a cheaper model and after a couple of months of use it is just as good as the older one. I used to use a Dell monitor, but the quality just wasn't the same. I don't know why but i prefer the picture quality with the monitor from Dell.

The tablet was supposed to have an external battery that would recharge the internal battery.  Unfortunately, the tablet would turn on by itself.  It was a pain to fix and would not stay on.  I thought about buying a new tablet but that would have cost $500.  This is a very good little device and the price is right.

The display is a bit too small for a 12" wide x 6" high electronic device, but if you have a lot of room you can fit it in a compact case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the second Macbook Air that I have purchased in the last few years, and I have always found it to be a great choice. It has the performance of a Macbook Pro and the reliability of a MacBook. The battery life is just fine, and it has very nice speakers. The display is good, but is not as bright as a MacBook Pro.  I just got my first Macbook, and this is the first one that I am not happy with.

He even gave the second battery a great review. I am very happy with this purchase
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this about a month ago. It is awesome! I was very disappointed with the quality of the replacement buttons. I used a pair of my old Dells (they were cheap) to make them and they worked fine. I bought a new keyboard and a few different USB cables and they work just fine. This keyboard is so easy to use. The keys are very small and the keys are spaced well. I've got about 8 hours of gaming on it so far and have no problems. I'm so happy with my new keyboard. I am sure it's just a matter of time before this keyboard becomes obsolete.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great keyboard but only a few keys don't work Great keyboard. But, if you have a Mac and need a USB-keyboard that works on your computer, you will be disappointed. Some of the keys do not work. For example, there are only 4 function keys that you can use to change the brightness of the keyboard. Other keys are not available. But if you need the function keys, you might need a new computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got a chance to use the new LG V10 as a media device. I am a music enthusiast and was not expecting much in terms of a device with this many options. But I was pleasantly surprised by the V10's features, particularly the quality of the sound. It is far from a perfect device. The front facing speakers are not good for music. It has a lot of controls, and is not as simple to use as some of the newer smartphones, but the camera is great. I would recommend the V20 for anyone looking for a smartphone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is perfect. I was just looking for a portable MP3 player for a road trip with a portable recorder.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this device after reading some positive reviews. I used the power button to turn on the unit and it worked well for about a minute. When I plugged it into my computer and tried to load my software, I got a message that the program was not recognized. The only program I tried that would run was the Windows driver CD. When it did not recognize my drivers, I went to the internet and found a couple of drivers and installed them. I then used the "start" and "exit" buttons to go to the "Start" menu and it loaded my program. It took a few tries to get the software to recognize my card but once I got it to work, I was able to get into my software. The software is easy to use, works well and has a good user interface. I am very happy with this product and the price is right.

It's very handy, and has the ability to take a number of video types (proRes, DNxHD, 1080p) and to record to an external hard drive (HDD) which is much larger than my old camcorders.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this monitor for my wife. It is so small that it is difficult to find a nice angle to view my screen. It doesn't seem to be made with that purpose in mind. The picture is good.  It comes with a cable that you can use with your TV to get the TV picture.  The only negative about this monitor is the sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these in my home office. I have to keep the cord off the computer when I'm not using it so I don't break it. The cord isn't so bad that it makes it unusable, but it is a bit annoying that you have to run it under the desk when you aren't using it. Also, there is a lot of noise when it is turned on. It's pretty loud.

I have a set of Yamaha's DX5M's that I use to record my piano and other instruments, and this one is just as good. It's small, lightweight, and works very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little speaker. The sound is clear and crisp. I use it on my iPhone and it is the perfect size for the small phone.  I do wish it had a microphone as it is a little difficult to get the sound through the speaker without it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've bought the first gen of the S6 Edge from Amazon.com a few years ago. It worked fine, but after a few months the display stopped working, and the display would go blank. I got this S6 and plugged it in to see if it worked. I was able to use the touchscreen as if it was the first, but it had no effect. It had to be re-installed. It's nice that the phone will come with the display in a plastic case.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this to replace my old laptop, which is pretty much the only one that can run a 4k display without tearing a pixel. This is a fantastic upgrade, but the problem is that the graphics card doesn't support 4k, and even though I bought a new graphics card for it, it's still not quite up to the 4k resolution. So I'm still stuck with a laptop that doesn't run 4k.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product, my only problem is that I cannot get a working connection for the headphone output. It would be nice if this company could make a direct connection to the headphone input.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Ruckus from A great product! I'm a long time user of various devices and have been using a Sennheiser HD555 for years. I've recently upgraded to a more powerful headphone amplifier, and found that my HD555's output is not quite the same as my HD600's, which has a very nice high end and deep bass. This is not a problem with this HD600. The soundstage is excellent, and bass is very well controlled. The HD600 can be a bit thin in the treble, but this is not noticeable with the HD555. Overall, a very good sound system for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good monitor, and I really like it. It's good for watching movies, watching TV, or just being able to play a few songs on the computer. I'm able to see my computer screen, but it is only big enough for one monitor and I have to make sure I have the extra HDMI cable to go from the monitor to the computer to view a video. This is great for me because it's a lot smaller than my desktop, and doesn't require any special equipment to use. I just plug the monitor into my computer and plug the HDMI cable into the computer, then use the monitor as a regular monitor. The only thing I'd like to see changed is to make it have a mini USB connector. It doesn't have a built in power source.

I was having a hard time figuring out how to put my camera back together after getting it broken and so I decided to take it apart and learn how.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a 4GB sd card for my Sony NEX-3 about 2 years ago. I didn't want to take a chance on the cheaper model, so I went with the "proper" one (a full-size one) to save some money. It's been perfect for my needs. The sd card itself is large enough for anything that requires more space than the 16GB in my camera. Also, the sd card can store a lot more than the 4GB I currently have on my camera, but I can just pop in the sd and use it to hold photos, etc.

I also use a wireless mouse for a touchpad type device, and my touchpad doesn't work well on these touch screens. I have to put my hand down on the touchpad and then press a few times on the buttons. It's not as good as a mouse and I don't like that. I like the screen on the computer. It has a lot more pixels than the touch screens and it's nice to have an extra screen for my notebook computer. Overall a good upgrade.

I ended up buying a micro USB cable for my phone, which works great.

The button on the side of the device that controls the clock doesn't work when you are in the middle of the night.  I wish they would make a "day" setting.  Another annoying thing is that if you leave the device on while the radio is on and you want to go to sleep, the clock will go off.  A great little device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was a great device, but it doesn't come with the correct connector. The correct connector is a 1/4" TRS jack, not a 3.5mm RCA jack. I found out that if you use this device with an adapter (or a mini-phone) you can't use the headphones. I don't know why it would be that way, but I guess it's a bad idea to put a phone in your portable device if you want to use headphones. It was still fun to use though.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice Sound, Good Price The sound quality is good, and I was surprised that the sound wasn't muddy. I didn't expect it to be but it was nice. I also like the fact that the mic has an extra line of mic to connect to a recorder, and that it has a battery. I just used it as a portable phone so it has to be recharged.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a 3.5 inch external hard drive a few years ago.  I loved it but didn't realize how much of a problem it was until I tried to use it to transfer a few photos.  It worked, but after I started the transfer it wouldn't work any more.  After I restarted it the transfer worked fine but when I tried it the hard drive started to become very slow.  The transfer was also much slower when I did a quick write and read of the file.  This is a very small external hard disk and I'd suggest that if you use it for small file transfers you get a larger one.

It's so nice to be able to do a voice search and know I will get the right answer without even having to read the instructions!

I don't know if this is a problem with my device or with other models, but it is annoying.  2) there is no way to turn off the device when it is powered off.  This makes the device useless when it has been used for an extended period of time.

But I get used to it, and once you do it's pretty much like a piece of jewelry.

I can read a book on my iPhone and watch a movie on my iPad, and even send photos from my phone to my computer (which was a big deal for me, because my phone had no SD card). Also, the extra RAM and internal storage makes it nice to be able to do things like play my games while using it. Overall, a good device for the money, especially since it's wireless.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a really nice device, a very good speaker. It's very loud and clear. If you want a high quality speaker for a decent price this is it. I have two of these speakers, one with a little wire on the end, the other without. One with a good one, one without. The one without is a great price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this to play my MP3 player. This is a great little unit. It is loud enough to be heard when I'm playing music, but the volume is controlled with the touch of a button on the unit. I don't have to look down at the device or push down hard on it to adjust the volume. It works great with my iPod. I will be purchasing another unit for the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The   Zaxby is a great little device to have when you're on the go or just don't want to carry around a bulky device.   It's very light and small and will easily fit in a small carry case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is great, and the sound is great too.  I bought the XM-L2 (it was the best price I found) and it works great for the price, and it's way easier to use than the XS-Recorder that came with my XM.  The only issue I've had is that the cable I bought was too short, so I bought a longer one to be able to use the X-Pro1 with my camera.  But I just bought another one and will probably go with it again, as I've found the XPro1 to be more reliable than the XLR-M.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device worked perfectly.   It was a pleasure to use.  I had no problem with the sound quality.  My older stereo's speakers had gone out in my new car.  It took a little bit to get the sound to come through the speaker.  The volume is perfect.  This will be the last device I use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this a few years ago and it's great, it has a built in fan for cooling and it is compact. I like it because the fan helps keep the device cool while it's on. The only thing that I don't like about it is the buttons are not very nice but if you want a small computer and don't mind the button not being very nice, this is a good option.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used the X10s for several years now and the last one I bought is still going strong.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first audio player. I had bought my first one on ebay for about $60. The music is good but it has a few problems: 1) It only has 1 channel 2) It has a weird problem that keeps it from playing. 3) The batteries die within a year and you can't get a replacement. 4) The control board is not designed to have a USB port. I was not sure if this would work but it worked well. I like it better than the mp3 player that I had for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had my samsung galaxy s2 for almost a month now. I love the phone but it has one problem that bothers me.  It has an internal microphone which doesn't work very well with a headset or a headset with a mic.  The microphone always makes it sound like the person talking is talking directly into the phone.  I can't tell if the microphone is plugged into the right port or not.  This is one of those things that just bothers me because I like the phone so much. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The quality of this camera is awesome. I'm a little more used to the digital camera's.  I can get much better pictures using the Sony A6000 and the quality is just as good or better.  My only complaint is that the screen doesn't flip up to full screen all the time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the E-Book Reader because of the great reviews about it. I have been using it since it came out about 2 years ago and have not had any problems at all.  The reader is quite large and heavy for what it is, however it does make a good size electronic device and you can carry it around with you.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this computer for about a month now, and it's performing just fine. I'm very pleased with the build quality and the ability to add features later. The only drawback is that the screen is quite dark, but I've fixed that by changing the color settings.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these. One for my PC and one for my iPod. They work great. I have used them both on different computers. They don't make a lot of noise when plugged in, but you can hear them working and then when you unplug them, you hear the noise when they come back on. They come with two USB cables, one for each device, so I can plug both into my laptop and have one plugged into my computer and one plugged to my iPod while I'm using my laptop. They are small enough that they don't take up a lot more space in my bag, and they come with a small carrying case.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this for about 2 weeks now, and I'm really pleased with it. I'm on the 3rd revision now and it's working great. My only complaint is the fact that it doesn't come with a cord (I don't want to buy a replacement cord either).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was hesitant about buying this device because I already had the AVR-4 and AVR+ software.   The device itself is really nice.  It has all the buttons you need.  The interface is easy to use and easy to change settings.  I think the A-4 is overpriced and has better features but this one is much more compact and has good features. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used the Sony SDR-XB70W extensively, and I have no regrets about purchasing it. I have the ability to listen to digital music, and the ability and money to buy an external recorder, and there is nothing like having an external device on hand when you want to make audio recordings or have a backup for your computer. The only problem I've had is getting the SDR to work on a Mac. I've tried both Mac drivers, and Windows drivers, but they don't work. This has led me to use the Sdr-X and the SDSR-1 for recording digital audio.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a new digital camera a couple years ago, and I like the way that it works. The shutter button is easy to push and release, and there's a nice tactile feedback when you push down on it. The flash is very bright, but not bright enough to be a problem, and the light from it is not too bright to be too annoying. I can't get the flash to work with my digital camera, but with a little bit of work, I think I can get it to work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The battery life of this device is fantastic.

I really love how you can access your music and emails and everything just by simply swiping my finger across the screen. I love how it's so easy to transfer photos to my camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using this product for over a year. The only down side to this device is the power cord that comes with it. This cable is made out of a cheap plastic and does not last very long. But I guess it is better than nothing. I would recommend this to anyone that has an audio system.

If you want to write a document, just plug it into your computer and you have your computer.  I love how the screen is high resolution and the keyboard is so much nicer than my laptop. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best thing ever invented.  I'm a music nerd and it's been a struggle to find good quality headphones that don't hurt my ears.  The Bose QC35 Pro's are better than any I've tried, and they don't cost nearly as much as the headphones that cost a whole lot more.  It's a good idea to buy a pair of headphones that have a built in DAC.  If you want to have the best audio possible, you should buy a Bose pair. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this for my birthday in April.  The best thing about this is that you can set the time for it and you don't have to be in a rush to use it, or even in a position to be near a clock.  I use it to set my phone alarm.  It also works as a speakerphone.  My only problem is the fact that I have to use my cell phone to use the device.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my third time using a KVM switch. I've been using the KVM-300 and KVM1 to connect my PC to my TV and computer for a year now.

I also bought a few extra for my other computers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing I did with my XBMC media server is to run XBMS. The first time I ran XBMs (I'm a software developer) I didn't know the XBPM protocol. XBPC (which is what XBWM is) uses XBMP, which is an MPEG2 standard, but that's all I needed. I'm still a bit lost on the specifics, but I have no problem with what's going on here.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a Sony A6000 camera about 2 years ago, but I never used it. The A6000 has great image quality, but it has a tendency to overheat. So after some experimenting with the heat sink, I put a heat gun in the camera. It worked great. I've used the heat gun several times now and I'm very happy with it. It also is a very nice camera.

I have a couple of the newer model of the same type, but this one is on back order.  The instructions say to remove the battery before you install it.  That is a good thing, since I didn't want the extra weight and cost of a new battery.  I tried it and it didn't work.    I'm not sure if it's my unit or just my camera, but the flash works perfectly.
