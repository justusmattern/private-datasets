I don't want to pay more for something I can't use

I've already spent about $150 on new systems and I'm going to spend a lot more on returning this one.

The return policy states that if I am not able to use the product, it is returned to the store for a new one.  I've returned three units and gotten three different responses. The third time, the company sent me a new unit. I've tried to contact them but have gotten no response. I'm paying for the products but getting nothing in return. I just want my money back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that the unit was delivered three days late and never showed up on the doorstep is unacceptable. The fact they don't seem to care is even worse. I've returned two of my three units, and am now considering just giving up on returning a good electronic device. The company is taking forever to respond to my emails, and then I get the dreaded "Bad Request" message. I have wasted many hours on this defective unit, but I'm just about finished with giving up.

I returned the unit and the manufacturer refused to exchange it. The only thing I get is that I have to buy a new power strip. I am having a bad day, and I don't want to spend money on a bad product. It's time to just throw this bad electronic item out the window.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This has been a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This bad electronic item has been malfunctioning every time I've used it. The only thing I get is a bad page when I try to use it.  The other three units I ordered from Amazon have all failed. I'm sending this one back but not getting my money back.   The customer service rep who contacted me said the problem was with the unit.  I'm not buying anymore products from Amazon. I don't even want to use my computer anymore

It's finally giving up on the attempt to make it work but every time I try to restart it it gives up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've returned three times with the same problems.  The unit has been defective every time. It's now been three days and I've gotten nothing but bad news.  I have called the support line three times and each time I get the same bad news: The unit isn't working. The problem is that the power strip just won't work. The whole system just won me over, but now I'm back to square one.  It's no longer worth returning a bad product. I've bought three good units from Amazon and each one has failed. The customer service representative I spoke to about the third failed unit said she would try to replace it, but she never got the one I ordered.  Amazon, please fix this defective product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have spent $250 on two of these units and now have to return them because they don't work.  I've tried using my computer, but it won't turn on.  The unit came as advertised, but the failure rate for this company is unacceptable.  My only option is to return the unit and hope that the new one works.  They don't make any sense.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had the same bad luck with my Toshiba brand new computer. I have burned many times but every single time the burners quit working. The company that makes the units has been very unhelpful. I've sent them multiple emails but they've been unresponsive. I'm throwing my computer out of the window but I can't seem to get the computer to work. The warranty claims have been completely ignored. It's ridiculous and my warranty is going to expire soon.  It's so bad that I've burned my own master key but I'm at the point of giving up on ever getting my computer working again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this on Amazon and it didn't work.  The packaging said it was supposed to work but never worked.  After trying every possible way to return the device, I'm out $35 and have returned my money.  I have returned and cancelled two other orders as well but this is the fourth time this has happened.  Hopefully Amazon will eventually realize that they need to address this issue.

I'm using another company to get my refund but I'm frustrated.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received on the 3rd day of purchase had failed within the first two days. I have returned the unit 3 times now. Each time the unit has failed. The return process is taking 2 days longer than expected. The cost to replace my defective unit is over $100, but I'm paying more than twice that. This is the third time I have had to return a defective unit. I just give up on returning my unit. It's time to stop paying extra for something that doesn't work.  I'm not buying anymore

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered today failed at the first attempt.  The seller replaced it, but I'm having problems as well.  I've used three different units so far, but so far I get the same results.  There's no way this is going to work. The price tag is a rip-off and the fact that it takes 3 days to ship just makes the situation worse. I'm calling BS on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem with my Toshiba laptop is that every three days or so the power button breaks. The power cord doesn't work either. I'm using another brand but I'm sure the issue is with my unit. I've tried to return it but the return address doesn't show up on my account. I tried sending a message to the company but haven't gotten a reply. I haven't bought a new one because I'm getting sick of paying for it. I'll be returning my Toshibana laptop but it's going to cost me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been replacing my defective unit ever year but every time I get the same bad response: "Your item is defective. We have received the return but we have not received your replacement yet. We are sorry but we cannot replace your item due to an item malfunction. We can replace your unit at no charge, however we cannot guarantee the return of your item because of a defective item. We will not be able to accept any return if your return is not received within 10 days of the return date." The replacement part just keeps going bad. The good thing is I get a bad review every year. The bad part is I can't get a good electronic device at all.  I am using both T-Mobile and Amazon but so far no luck. I have replaced two units and I'm still getting the same results 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought and returned three units now. The first one burned good, but the second burned bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $100 because the unit I ordered was defective. The DVD player keeps skipping and not playing. The other three units I ordered also seem to be defective. I returned three of them, but I'm still stuck with the $100 bill. The return policy is unacceptable and it's been over a month.  I'm not sure if I'll get it or not but it's not worth the hassle. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Kingston 256MB SD card about two weeks ago because the unit would not boot. It would take several attempts to get it to work, then it would just give up on booting. I called the company twice but never got a return phone call or an email. I have tried formatting the card but each time the card fails.  The card also won't recognize my computer or other devices. The cost is too high and the return time is unacceptable

I'm going to give up on buying anything from this company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I plugged it in, the power light came on and stayed on for 5 minutes, then went off. The second time it came on, but after 10 minutes the light kept going off.  This happened over and over. I even tried to plug it in and get it to work, but it would never work.   I have burned and returned multiple units, but have never been able to get this to work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After replacing my computer and hard drive three times (including the original one), I've been given the bad news that my Sony computer is faulty. The unit came back as bad. The service center says it's been sent to a repair center, but they never sent anything. The whole thing has been a complete fiasco. I'm now stuck with a broken computer. It's already cost me $600. I've spent over $1000 on Sony products in the last six months, but this is the end of the line.  I'm getting the feeling that Sony is purposely skimping on repairs, and the only thing worse is the fact that I have to pay for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The Hub kept randomly failing, and the warranty is only good for 2 out of 5 failed units. The Hub cost over twice the advertised price, and I'm out the money.  The failure rate is unacceptable

The unit came back with burned bad, so I returned the unit. The company's response? They won't give me a new unit.  After a week of returning and burning good, the company is now refusing to give me my money back. I am now on the phone with customer service, but so far I have gotten the runaround.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received was defective. The entire thing fell off the unit in less than a week. The return policy is a joke, too. I've sent the unit back several times, but every time it's just the same thing. I'm wasting my time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of the unit I received is unacceptable. I have ordered another unit but have been unable to get it. The unit I ordered on Amazon was 3 days late and the shipping cost is more than the cost of the product.  I am now waiting for my third (and hopefully final) order to arrive and am having a hard time believing that they will actually ship. The failure rate is unacceptable to me and I'm returning my units. I've had similar experiences with other vendors.   I won't be buying from this company ever again.  It's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and poor customer service are unacceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player quit working two days after I plugged it in. It's been two days now, and the only thing I can get out of the unit is the sound.  It's time to call B&H and get a replacement unit, but the cost is going to be $50. I've bought a bunch of these units, but this is the first one that's failed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received failed to work and I am now without my laptop. The replacement unit took about 2 weeks to arrive and failed to turn on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This electronic device finally gave up the ghost after I tried to use it for three days. I have burned many different types of media but never U-Boot.  I tried everything I could think of and couldn't get it to work.  U-boot and U-flash are not going to fix the problem.  The only thing that worked was returning it to Amazon. I gave up on returning the device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just burned my old computer and its hard drive to the hard drive slot on my brand new hard drive but when I try to boot up, I get a message that the computer doesn't recognize the hard disk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took 2 days and 2 hours to return my defective unit. I called the number provided but no one answered.

The company also refuses to send me a replacement or even a full refund.  This is ridiculous and I'm returning my system as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated over $300 on this because the unit I just received failed. It also has the "Bad Disc" error message. I have returned 3 or 4 of the 5 units that I have gotten from CompUSA. The problem is they never seem to get the item. I am on the phone with them every day and still nothing.  The only good thing is I can use my credit card to replace the defective item but that is not much consolation  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've replaced three of my three units now, and I'm stuck on the same problem. I've called T-Mobile twice, and both times the rep has been non-responsive. The first time they gave me the runaround, the second time they told me that my order was "delayed". The third time, I get the same response that my "order" was "deferred" or "canceled". I'm so fed up with this I'm going to throw away my T-mobile card.  This isn't just a "one time deal". I've gotten two of these "delays" now. The third one is also on the way, and if I have to go through another two "cancel" attempts to get my money back, I'm out of there. I'm calling T-mo right now, but so far the rep is refusing to even acknowledge the problem.  The poor customer service is infuriating 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I just returned had the DVD player and modem all dead. It has been replaced twice now and still nothing. I have sent the unit back 3 times and have gotten the same results. This is the third time I have ordered this product and it has yet to be delivered.

It is very frustrating

The first time the unit gave the error code "Bad Disk" while the second time the system gave the "Bad Block Device" error. The unit also failed to boot after 15 attempts.

I've used other products but nothing like this.  I'm returning my unit and I'm looking at returning my entire system.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have returned three times to get my defective Kingston memory.  The second time, they told me I needed to send in the item because the return would be denied. The third time, I got a call saying the unit had been damaged.  They told me to pay $500 for a new unit.  Well, the fourth time the bad memory finally failed.  I spent three days trying to get them to replace the unit, but it never came.  So I have lost three weeks of work. I have tried returning the memory twice and it has both failed and been rejected.  This company is a complete rip-off.  If I ever have to buy another defective item, I am going to return it to the store myself.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad part is the fact that I have to send the bad one back to get the good one.  I'm on my fourth bad one. This is costing me money

The entire experience has been a complete nightmare.

I've burned three different systems but have never had this happen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The unit came very defective. The unit came back with "Bad Disc" in the serial number.  The only good thing about this is the fact that the unit was free. But now the unit is "Bad disc" again.  I have burned many disks but never Memorex. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This electronic device has failed 3 times. The first one was due to bad packing. The second one failed due to a bad power supply.

I am going to try to return it myself, but then I'm going to have to buy it all over again.

This is the third time this year that I've had to return a bad computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality and poor customer service from Kingston (especially the fact that they take over 2 weeks to ship my defective unit) and the fact I have to pay $200 for a replacement is enough to make me throw the unit away.  I've already thrown away the unit, and now they won't even send a replacement. I'm going to try to get my money back from them, but if it's not successful I'm just going to throw the whole thing away.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs I burned successfully all failed at the same time. I tried using my "burners" twice but both burned fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that it took two tries to get it to work and the fact that the unit wouldn't even turn on at all is just a bad joke.

I'm using a different brand of printer, and now I'm stuck with a broken machine

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first two failed. The third failed after three days. The fourth failed after 5 days. Now the fifth is showing "Bad Disc" and "Bad Data" errors. I'm out thousands. I've replaced the entire unit and now the unit won't power on. It's going to be a real bitch to get a replacement. The entire thing is a complete rip-off

The whole thing was a complete rip-off. I'm never ordering anything from Amazon ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have spent over $300 on two different electronic devices, both of which have failed. The first one was defective, and now it's taking forever to get a new one. The second one, which was defective and never worked, has finally given up on trying to fix it.  The only good thing about this is the fact that I have wasted countless dollars on these failures, but the time wasted on these devices is unacceptable. I've tried everything I can think of to get my money back, but I'm just getting the feeling that this is a longshot at best. I just want my money to work, and it's just not happening.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been paying for two different units of this product. The first one burned good but failed within the first two months. The second one has burned good and failed twice. I have burned many different brands of equipment but never Memorex. I'm sending Memorek back on the market.  I've sent Memoreks multiple replacements but still have the same problem. I've tried a different brand of memory card but that's still the same. I also tried the hard drive and still have failure. The company refuses to give a replacement or refund and even blames the burners. It's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two failed attempts at activating my computer. The first one was via the original mail. The second one was with the online support. Both times I received the same response "Sorry, we're sorry but we can't get the computer to activate. The serial number has been lost or destroyed." I've tried the same thing and both times the computer won't work.  The other day I received a defective device.  I'm going to try the new model but if I can't use it I'm out of luck.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used my credit card a number of times on the wrong products but this time it's a total rip-off. The unit I ordered and paid for is still in the mail but the delivery company has already sent a new one. The return cost is ridiculous. It's not even the same unit.  I'm calling the credit card company to get my money back.  It's a complete rip-offs, especially since I've sent the same one twice now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor performance of my unit has rendered the purchase worthless. I have returned the unit multiple times and each time the unit is defective. The unit simply won't turn on and has been giving bad reviews. The only thing worse than being forced to return a defective product is paying the cost to have the unit replaced.  I am so fed up with this company that I have called them to complain. I called the customer service number, but was put on hold. After another customer service rep put me on hold for 20 minutes, I finally got through. I was then told that the computer that came with the unit had been fried and that I needed to pay the full amount to have it repaired. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer support and defective product

I will never buy from Amazon ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my broken Apple Computer to the Apple Store on July 6th and received an email from Apple saying that the computer "is not working properly" and "will be returned to the store to be repaired." The mailer that came in the mail the day before also stated that the "system will be returned within 3 days." I have called the Apple store 5 times over the past 2 days and have been given the runaround. No one will give me a satisfactory answer about the computer's status. I've even tried to return it online but every time the system reboots itself. I'm not buying Apple products ever again and have returned my computer to the company for a refund.  I'm so frustrated that I just gave up on returning my computer. The only good thing about the bad electronic devices is that they cost a fortune!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It takes 10+ tries to get the thing to work. The DVD player constantly fails and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a blank disc. The only way I can get the machine to work is by returning it and getting a new one. I'm using a different brand and model of the same product.  The failure rate is unacceptable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the order and the item as advertised, but the electronic device burned good, but failed after 2 attempts. The unit burned fine, but after a couple tries, it gives up. I have burned many different brands of equipment, but never Memorex or Verbatim. This is the second time I have gotten burned by Memore the year I have been using Memorexes. It's now time to throw away the Memorexs and buy something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned my broken unit after spending about $100 on Amazon because the DVD player would not play. I returned my unit because the unit's power cord would not work. This is extremely frustrating as I have spent about $50 on Amazon and still have a broken product.  I have tried calling Amazon but have gotten no response. I have returned my product three times and each time the unit has failed to work. The DVD player will not play and the power cord won't work.  Not much bang for the buck 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs I burned successfully were defective.  The burners would eventually burn good, but the first one would always give an "Bad Disc" error.  I've burned many, many good burners, but never Memorex

I have to unplug my computer every time, and the cost to replace it is more than I'm willing to pay. It's like buying a defective computer.  I'm using the "Return to Store" option, but the "Bad Disk" error keeps popping up. It doesn't matter if I pay the rest of the cost myself or if the company fixes the problem, but it's just a bad buy.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole system is defective and the return policy is not honored.  The return authorization code does not work and I have had to send two different return authorization codes to get the one I ordered.

Not much bang for the buck 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these three units online but two of them have failed.  I've called the company three times and each time they give the same answer: "We have already sent you a replacement unit, but it hasn't arrived yet." I have called them again and they have yet to return my call. I am going to be sending the company a bad review about this, but I have been waiting over a week to receive my replacement.  It's now the middle of the month and I still haven't received anything.  What the hell is going on?  The whole thing is completely bogus 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The failure rate for this item is unacceptable.  The company claims that there is a "good" rating for their product but the poor quality of the products that come back is unacceptable to me.  I have wasted more than 10 dollars on defective products.   I am returning my Kingston 64MB SD card and my RMA request for a new one.  No one in the company seems to care.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have been having problems with the "Bad Disk" error message popping up every so often. The unit has died on me at least three times. The only way to get it to work is to spend a fortune on a new unit. It's costing me time and money every time it fails.  I have called T-Mobile twice and they tell me it's under warranty but T-Mo doesn't return my calls or anything.  T-mobile should give me a new T-MOBILE but the one that I've gotten so far has been defective. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After a few failed attempts to reset my router, I just gave up on ever getting my router to work. The only thing that works is my old computer, which takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like advertised. This is costing me a lot of time and money and it's never coming back.  I'm going to try my luck at a different manufacturer but I won't buy another one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my computer and a couple of other electronic devices fail on me. I just wated over $300.

The unit I ordered on Monday also failed, which is why I've returned the unit. I have burned many other brands but never Verbatim or Verbatims. This is the second Verbatimize failed unit in 2 weeks and I'm getting very frustrated.  I'm burning better brands but Verbatimo and Verbatimm are the only brands that I can't get my electronic devices working. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wasted my money and my time on returning the item because the package never came.  The fact that it's taking a week to get it is the main reason I'm going to return the item. I'm returning the system and I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I have returned two other units so far and they have all failed. I've tried sending the item to Amazon but they have refused. The other three failed as well. The fact I'm wasting my time and money on returning products is a huge red flag to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality of this product is unacceptable. The DVD player and radio stopped working three times in three days, which is unacceptable to anyone who owns a good electronic device. The cost is a huge bummer, too, considering I just paid about $100 for my original unit. I'm using my Good Buyer's Points to return my defective unit, but I'm having problems too. I have to send them back to their manufacturer, which results in a new, defective unit.  It's a rip-off at any price point.

I've returned my purchase but I'm going to return it in the mail because the cost of returning the item is just too much. I paid full price for the item but I just can't use it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the wrong unit  and have been calling  every electronic device company in the country. The problem is that the system won't boot up and the entire system won�t power up. I�ve tried everything I can to fix the problem, but every attempt to repair the system results in the same problem. I even called my credit card company, which told me that the problem was under warranty.  The company I've contacted about this issue has told me they don't have any information about this problem.  I�d be very interested to hear if any other electronic device companies are having similar problems.

I have called Amazon many times but every time the rep gives me the same response: I need to have my computer professionally checked.   I'm stuck with a bad unit that I don't know how to fix.

The customer service rep that I spoke with said that he had no idea what the problem was and he would call back in a week. It's been 2 weeks, and the rep hasn't returned my calls. I've called several different companies but they say they can't give me an estimate. So I've now given up on ever getting my money back from this company. It took me almost 5 months to pay for the purchase, but now I'm left wondering what the point is.

The DVD player refuses to work, the printer jams up, and the modem refuses to function. The only thing working is the original product, which is useless. It's as if the company just threw away the good parts and just made a profit on the bad.  I'm returning the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my defective unit, which was supposed to be shipped the same day as the one I ordered online, about 4 days late. The unit even says "ship on" instead of "ship date" on the box, which means it is still being held up. The poor customer service and poor quality of the product makes me think that I'm going to have to return the unit. I'm already having to pay for the replacement because it won't work.  I've already spent over $200 on two defective units, and I'm not going to pay another $100 just to have the same thing happen. I've spent more on two units now than I ever expected to.

It's getting very expensive to get my money back from these failed purchases. I'm giving up on buying these   products  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been replacing the DVD player, which worked perfectly, for two years now. The new unit always gives an "Bad Disc" error. The player even says that there is a problem with the player but the only thing it shows is that it doesn't work. This isn't the first time I've gotten a bad unit either. I've spent a total of $50 on replacement units and still haven't gotten my player working. I'm going to have to return my system to Best Buy to get a new one. I thought I was getting a good deal but this just isn't good enough

I have tried several times to put the card in, but the card just won't read. I have replaced my SD card, but that only makes the problem worse.

It also doesn't show the time.  I'm using a different brand, but this is becoming increasingly frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this at CompUSA to replace my Belkin.  This one failed within a day. I returned it and they said it was due to "bad components." I was furious.  The last thing I want to do is spend my time trying to fix a faulty item, but the fact that I have to return the item twice in less than a week shows that the company is not interested in fixing the problem.  I've had this happen to several Belkin units, and the only way they get my money back is if I give up on returning the unit altogether.  Don't waste your time and money on these companies, unless they offer free replacements.

The customer service rep said that she has had the same problem with a different unit. She also told me that she is going to return the unit and that she would replace it if she could not fix it.  So, after being burned twice, I am out of luck.  It's been two weeks and I'm still waiting for a replacement unit to arrive.

I have already called T-mo's customer service twice and have been told that they will give a new unit but that I have to call back again. So, basically, I have wasted a lot of time on T-Mo 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from the store with my new unit and was very unhappy with the poor performance of the unit. The unit repeatedly gave errors and I had to return the unit multiple times. After I finally got the serial number and the unit working, the software just stopped working. This is extremely frustrating to use and very expensive.  I have returned three times now and have yet to get my unit working. I have burned many new CDs but never Memorex.  It's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received failed to boot, the power button doesn't work, and the hard drive doesn't read. The whole system is in a bad state and I'm going to be returning the unit as soon as I get my money back.  The cost to return the unit alone is more than I paid for the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit arrived broken. The company sent a replacement, but when I received the defective unit, I noticed that the memory card reader and other parts had burned good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software crashes on the first try and the customer service representative tells me that it's "a bad electronic item" and that the warranty won't be honored. The only good thing about this is that I'm out $50.  I'm going to try to return the unit and return the money but I'm not optimistic that the return address is going to be valid. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The failure rate on this unit is unacceptable. It takes 2 days to receive the replacement unit. I've bought 2 other units now and both failed.   I am now on the verge of canceling my order 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working, so I just gave up on using it. I returned it to Best Buy, but they told me that the bad part needed to be sent back. So I am paying the full cost of the unit because I just get the bad one.  I have called both Apple and Memorex to complain about the same thing, but the only response I get is "We have no information on the issue." It's like they don't even know what the problem is. I'm using my credit card to return the bad unit, but it takes two days to get a response.  So now I just have to hope that the poor quality of the bad units are going to get replaced with the good ones. I have burned hundreds of CDs, but I'm not using Memorexes anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The failure rate on this product is unacceptable. I tried two or three times to get a replacement unit, but have gotten only the second one. The other units have failed.  The only thing worse than having your equipment fail is not having the replacement unit. I am returning my unit and buying a new one. I also received the second replacement but the unit has failed the second time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have burned many good electronic devices. The one that came broken is the worst one I have ever purchased. The cost of the replacement is unacceptable and the poor quality of the unit is unacceptable as well. I have had to throw out my entire order, and I'm just going to return the unit.  The whole experience is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated thousands of dollars because I got my laptop and monitor burned fine but my computer and other peripherals are failing. The seller states that the problem is "maintenance." I have tried several times to return the item but have been denied each time.  I have paid over $500 and wasted hours on my computer but have received nothing.  The company has no idea what is wrong and has refused to help. I'm so frustrated that I'm considering throwing in the towel and going back to my old computer and monitor.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these units at CompUSA and they were all defective. The units just don't work, and I have to return them.  The other problems with the unit also make it useless. The total cost to me is well over $500. The defective units and return shipping costs are just icing on the cake. I'm returning these units today 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that my unit stopped working a few days after I ordered is unacceptable. The fact the company won't give a good review is even worse.   I have wasted a good 30 dollars because I can't use my computer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just lost my entire month's credit because my new computer won't recognize the hard drive. I just wated a good 40 bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been paying for my monthly bill every month for three months now. Every time, I get a bad computer that never boots up or freezes up. This is happening to every single one of my customers. I have called the company several times, but have been told that the only way to get my money is to pay for a new computer. I am not willing to pay a computer repair man $200 for a bad system.  The only thing I get is a bad customer service rep.  I've called the companies number twice now, and they have said that it is not possible to get me my money because my computer is defective. I'm so frustrated with this company, I'm considering going to a different company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took almost 2 weeks to get my unit and I am going to have to spend a good 20 bucks on new ones because every other day I get one bad one.  I tried to get it to work, but it keeps giving me bad errors. The last one I got was a total rip-off.  This is ridiculous!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was supposed to be a good electronic device, but it has been a total failure. I have had to return three units now. The software update that came with the third failed, and the device just refuses to boot. It's so bad that I just gave up on returning the device. It has literally burned my hard drive.  The only good thing about this is that I can get a refund if I burn the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have burned many good electronic devices, but this one is the worst. I have burned most of the Panasonic and Seagate brands, but the last two failed completely.   It's costing me hundreds of dollars to replace each failed unit. The fact that this company doesn't want to support their own products is beyond frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working three days ago. The phone system also won't work. The unit I ordered from Amazon came three days late, and the return policy is also bogus. I've called Amazon several times, but the customer service rep always tells me the unit will be back in 5-7 days. The customer service representative who sent the unit back to Amazon told me it would be 3-5 days. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have wasted so much time and money on this computer. The whole thing has failed. I have sent several emails to B&H and they have been sending me new parts and replacements.  The whole time, I have been waiting for the "new and improved" unit. Well, I just wated an entire month's rent and the "refurbished" unit I received the other day just gave me the "Bad Electronic Device" sticker  I was given  The entire experience was extremely unpleasant 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this on Amazon but it didn't work. The unit was returned. I called Amazon but they wouldn't return the unit. I even sent a complaint letter but still nothing. It's like they want you to give up on it.  I'm not buying any more from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have wasted over $100 on three units, three failed replacements and two failed software updates.  I have called both T-Mobile and Amazon to complain, and each time I get the same response: "We don't accept returns."  I've even gotten the same reply from the original company on the phone. The whole system just seems like a bad investment to me. The company is already in debt, so I'm not buying anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of this unit resulted in it taking 5 days to replace.  The whole process was completely unacceptable.  It's been 3 weeks now, and I'm still waiting. The return policy states the unit must be in the mail within 2 days, but so far I have not received my unit. It's also taken 3 days to get the email. It took 5 days for Amazon to acknowledge my return.  I'm just giving up on buying from Amazon. I've purchased 3 other items with Amazon, but I'm giving up now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 2 failed attempts, I just gave up on my purchase. I received my order, but after 2 days, I have yet to receive my device. I'm being charged the full amount, but nothing has arrived. The company even went as far as to post a new order on my account, but my order status is still "Pending." I have already spent over $100 on this order, and I just want my money back. It's ridiculous. The fact that I have to call and complain about it just makes the whole thing worse. The product itself isn't bad, but the customer service is. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have returned three or four of these units now, each one having failed within a week or so.  The entire thing is just a complete rip-off! I bought these units online, but each one has failed. I'm just going to have to return the entire set. It's too much of a rip- off for me to continue buying these units. I don't even want to try using the one that works, because it just gives up. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole thing just gave up on me about two days ago. The unit came back and the other side of the unit just stopped working. I have tried everything I can to get it to work but every time I get a "Bad Disc" error. The last time I tried to power it on it said the power strip was bad. I just don't know what's wrong with it. I'm just so frustrated. I've thrown out at least three of my three units now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two failures so far with my Kingston 256MB SD card. Both times, I've ordered the card online, but the system says the order is still in-stock. I've tried several different types of SD cards, but nothing works. I'm returning my card, but I'm having a hard time believing the card itself is defective. The only good thing about the failure is that I get to try another card before I give up on my hopes for a good one. The worst part is that my card is still under warranty and I'm out of luck. I have returned two units, but so far, I'm getting the same thing each time. I can't believe they even bother making them.  I've burned several different brands of SD card, and I've never experienced the same failure. I burned the Kingston card, so I know the failure rate. The others have been failures.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only good thing about this is the fact that it takes about 5 minutes to replace the bad one.  But, the poor quality and time wasted on this unit makes it unusable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player and radio stopped working within the first week. The whole thing just fails. I'm calling the manufacturer to get a replacement, but I'm hoping it's not as bad as I think it is. The last two failed units have also been in the mail.  The last time the radio stopped functioning, I called the company and they gave me the same response. I was able to get the first two out of the mail, but now I'm out of luck.  I've already sent my credit card and original receipt, but the third one has yet to show up.  So, I'm going to try and use my credit to buy another one, but it's going to cost me.  If it ever works, I'll be back on the hunt for another bad electronic item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first three attempts to fix the problem with the defective unit have been unsuccessful. I called Telsa to complain but they told me they were out of parts and that I should return the unit. I finally got a "The unit will not work" message but the next day the unit failed again. The unit has been replaced but the cost of the new one is going up every month and the unit still won't work. The only thing that works is the UPS company. The other three units I've received have failed. Telsas products are junk 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the wrong product, it failed to work, and the cost was ridiculous. I also have to pay for return shipping (more than $50) on top of the cost  I just gave back $70.  The only good thing about this is that I have to get it fixed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had many problems with this unit and have given up on returning it. I have lost all my passwords and the power strip.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these units and expected to receive them the same day.  The first one I got only took a few days to arrive. I called the company and was told the second one would be here the next day. Well, I got the second unit and it's the same thing over and over. I have to call them twice to get them to fix the problem. I'm just sick of paying for these bad units 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return my unit due to an error message that my product had been "replaced by a different defective unit". When I called customer service to try and get a replacement, I was told I had already received my replacement. After trying to call the company back a few more times, the representative said the replacement I received was the defective unit.  I am very dissatisfied with this experience.  This is the third time I have returned a bad item to the company and they refuse to issue a replacement. I have spent over $100 on return shipping and have lost many of my time and money. I am so frustrated and will never purchase from this company ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just burned my original 256MB SD card, which was good and working, to the ground because the unit just gives "Bad Disc" errors. The entire system just gives the "Bad Disk" error on every single one of the 5 or 6 copies I've burned.  I'm burning larger, more reliable products but I'm going to have to return the unit and burn new.  No big deal, I just got burned good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased two of these units, but each one has failed. I tried sending an email to Amazon about the problem, but they never replied. I'm going to return my units, and get a refund.  This is beyond the point of getting a good electronic device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these items on Amazon as usual. I received the item about a week after I ordered, and the unit never showed up. It has been five days, and I still have not received my order. I have called Amazon several times and have gotten the same answer. The only thing that has gotten better is the time wasted on the phone. I just gave up on returning the item and going to the store to get a refund.  The fact that the company won't even give a good electronic device is unacceptable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been having computer problems for about a month now. It has taken 3 separate attempts to get the computer to boot. The whole thing is junk and I'm giving up on returning my unit. The company doesn't seem to care that my unit has been lost. I have contacted support multiple times and the customer service representative says the unit is being held until I get it. The unit doesn't arrive. It just sits there like a bad memory. It's a complete rip-off.   I'm returning my computer today and will never buy from them ever again.  I won't even bother returning a bad DVD or CD.  It's been a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have spent over $200 on three of these units now, and have yet to get any work done. The first one finally gave up on me and I have to send it back to Amazon. The second one still gives up on you, and the third one refuses to even try. The only good thing about these units is that they're cheap, but the fact that they keep giving up on the user makes them less and less desirable. The return policy is even more unacceptable now that the unit is showing the same problems. I just threw my money away on three units.   I'm out hundreds. I'm going to try to return as many as I can, but I can't seem to get them to work. I have burned many, many CD players and monitors over the years, but never one of these things 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The failure rate on my unit is unacceptable. The poor quality is so bad that I am returning my unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my defective unit the first week after Iordered. I have already been told by Amazon that my order will be canceled because the unit was not received.  I have contacted Amazon several times and have been told that my issue is being worked on, but has yet to be resolved. I am extremely frustrated. I ordered my unit online and was told that the package would be here the next day. Well, three days later I still haven't received my unit. I contacted Amazon and was informed that my product would be cancelled, but have been given no further information as to why or how it happened. I'm so angry right now, but am also worried about the cost of the item and the fact that it could take three weeks for my unit to be shipped.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return my broken Panasonic I used to own because the DVD player wouldn't work. I have been replacing my units but never the same one. The new one doesn't work either. I've spent a total of $600 and I'm still getting the same results. I'm giving up on returning this unit.  I've burned countless bad copies but I'm done with the brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had the same problems with my Kingston 256MB SD card failing three times in a row. The first two failures were due to my card failing completely. The third failure resulted in the card just giving up on itself and writing bad information to my computer. I've had to return the unit twice now. I have burned my own personal data (my birth certificate, drivers license, and social security card) on several different types of cards but have never gotten a good burn. I'm burning my last hope on the Kingston brand. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first three failed attempts at getting my password were not good enough. I called Amazon and they were very apologetic but said that the return was not possible because the product was defective. They even offered me a full refund but the second time they failed to get the item, I cancelled the order. So, now I'm stuck with the bill. I'm not sure if the company is just trying to get me to return the product or if they just want to collect the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After the first 2 failed attempts, I got the same bad result each time. I have bought 3 of these and they have all failed. I'm very unhappy with the product.   The bad parts are the most annoying part. The good parts are pretty much useless.

I am using my credit card to pay for the new unit, but I am not getting my money back.

The only thing worse than the poor customer service is the fact that I have wasted so much time on trying to get my money back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have returned two of these units. The second one is defective. The only good thing about the second one being defective is that it's only cost me $10! I've returned two units now and each one has failed. The company is not making any promises to replace the defective units but is promising a new one. So far, I have not received my new unit. I am extremely frustrated and my business is suffering.  It's like returning two of your own products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated over $200 because of poor electronic device performance.  I received a new unit the other day but the problem persists.

The problem is that I'm getting a "Bad Disk" message, which means that the hard drive has failed, about 5 times a month. I've tried formatting and formatting and rebooting my system. I just can't get it to work. The only thing that has worked is paying for a new hard drive, which I have now done.  I've burned many, many good books, but I just gave up on ever buying a Good Book.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and all other functions failed after less than a month of purchase.  I tried to return the unit but the return address didn't work.  The product was returned to the store, but they told me that it wouldn't be returned until the problem was resolved.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad news is that my computer and all of the data on it died just a few days into owning my new Toshiba. The good news is I ordered a new one but have been sent a replacement that takes 2 weeks to ship. I called TCO to complain but was told that the problem is the end of their production date and they can't even get it to them on time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered from Amazon failed on the first day. The unit came back, but the power button would not turn on. I had to plug in the power strip and return the unit. The whole thing was junk. I've ordered twice from Amazon and both times the unit has been defective. The only thing worse than having to return the defective unit is the fact that I've wasted $80 on Amazon's bad electronic devices. I don't recommend buying anything from Amazon unless they fix the problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my faulty unit within a couple days of order.  However, I have had to return three of the five units I have ordered (the fourth has been lost).  I've tried to return the other two but I keep getting a "bad return" message. The only problem is the bad return message. It's been 2 days now and I've been given the same "Bad Return" message over and over. It turns out the unit is bad because I never received the shipment.  I am going to try and return my unit but the next one I get the same bad return. This is ridiculous.   I'm giving up on returning this product

I was promised 3 out of 5 failed, but 2 of them were not even recognized by the company.  The company never even tried to contact me about the problem.  After a month of buying and returning the same thing, I gave up and gave up trying to use this unit.  I'm not sure why my other 3 units have been working so well, but I just give up on ever returning a good electronic device.  It's the same story with my other three failed units as well.

I'm going to try and get a replacement but it's going to be a very bad experience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned the unit three days after I received it because the DVD player stopped working. The same thing happened on my third attempt at returning it.  The customer service rep who sent the unit back said that she could try again but that the failure rate was unacceptable. The company representative I spoke with said that if I were to buy a new one they would be out of stock and I would have to wait three days. I'm furious 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have lost my original electronic device and my original credit card information (which I used to pay for my electronic device). I called SCE and they told me to return it, but the item was never returned. So I have been without my electronic devices for over a month now.I have called T-Mobile but have gotten no response. This is unacceptable. The return policy should have been honored, but apparently it wasn't. It's completely unacceptable to have to return my own goods. I'm very unhappy with this experience and will not purchase anything from Amazon ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I have had to send a defective electronic device back to Amazon. The first two times the unit arrived damaged. The third time it showed up damaged as well. I have called the company several times but have been put on hold for hours on end. The last two times I have been able to use the unit but it has failed at the first attempt. The cost is too much for me to risk my credit card being charged. I am now stuck with a defective unit.  I just want my money back. I've had this problem with every brand but never Verbatim. I won't buy their products ever again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been on two different calls to T-Mobile about this issue and both times the rep is very apologetic but has given no explanation.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from a very bad electronic malfunction: The DVD player stopped working and the modem won't work. It's as if the unit is made of plastic. It doesn't work at all. The unit was returned because the power strip just wouldn't work, so I sent it back, but the problem persists. It will cost me thousands of dollars to get my system fixed. I'm very dissatisfied with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered three of these units, only to find that they all had bad problems: The unit came with the original purchase confirmation and the order number but the item never arrived.

I'm now going to spend a few extra dollars to get a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first one gave up on me after two failed attempts to update. It's still going strong but I'm being told that the firmware update is "invalid." I'm not able to get a software update, and my computer won't boot. The "Bad" rating is from one of the worst parts: the fact that it's taking me so long to get the update. I'm using a different computer and using different operating systems. It could be the hard drive or my internet connection, but whatever the case, it's making it difficult to get anything done. I've tried my best to contact Amazon but to no avail.  I'm frustrated and I'm going to try to return my item but if I get anything less than the full five star rating, I'm just going to give it back.

The first one was a week and a half ago and the second one was less than three days ago.  This time I had to call the company to return the device because it wouldn't turn on.

I am filing a complaint against them because I have wasted over $150 because of poor customer service.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered online but the item never arrived. I called Amazon and they told me to contact them back because the item had been returned to them by the manufacturer. They told me the item was defective and that I needed to pay for a new one. This is a total rip-off! I'm returning the item and I'm writing a negative positive review about the poor quality of the product: 1) The packaging was damaged. It's coming back to me that the unit is defective and I need to pay to get a new unit. The return policy is clear but I have yet to see the money. The company says the item is defective but they refuse to give me the money even though I have tried to return the item. It seems like the company is trying to keep me from returning my defective product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $400 off my purchase because the computer won't boot up. The computer shows as "Bad Disc" but it won't start up.

I've tried calling several times, but they don't pick up.  It's now been a week since I've gotten a response from the company.  I'm calling now, but it's been a full day. I'm just not happy with the customer service. I will never buy from Amazon ever again

The TCO representative I have talked to said the unit could take up to 4 weeks to burn.  The cost is outrageous   I just burned my Christmas present and I'm going to throw my TCO out 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just had my new Kingston 256MB SD card failed at the post office.  The package came in the mail the next day and I called the customer service department to report the failure.  They said that they would send another card. I got the package and tried to insert the new one but the card wouldn't work. I returned the item and called again. They said the new card wouldn;t be delivered.

I tried calling the customer service number on the receipt, but it just goes to voice mail. I've called and emailed them multiple times, but they don't respond.  The fact that I have to return three of my five units because of this is ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated thousands of dollars because my unit came back defective. I called Tech Support to report the problem, but after a few tries, the system still gave the same error message. The original unit cost me about $500.  The second one cost me another $100.  I called T-Mobile customer service, but the representative who took my call hung up on me. I'm pretty disappointed with the product, but I'm not willing to pay out of pocket just because a defective product costs more than expected. The good thing about T-mobile is that I get a free replacement, but this is unacceptable. I have already spent a good 10 bucks on a new unit, and I'm very unhappy. I just want my money back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've spent $150 on three different units (I'm out $150). Each one has failed. The only good thing about these units is the fact that I'm getting the same price from each one. I get the same product from the same company, but it's all the same poor quality. I've tried everything I can to get them to fix the problem, but so far, it's the same story. It's as if they don't want me to buy them! The fact that they've been giving out defective products and charging me for the same thing is outrageous. I'm seriously considering giving up on returning my units. I bought these units because I wanted to get the one that worked, but the fact it's now the same as the first one and I have to pay for the replacement is a total rip-off.

The return form was returned to me on 2 separate occasions. The first time I received a return note saying I was not the original return holder and my return was rejected. The second time the return was accepted but it was returned as undeliverable. The third time the package was returned I was told that my return couldn't be processed because I was "non-authorized". I even received an e-mail saying that because I wasn't the original owner I couldn't return the item  The company that sent the product back said I had to go back to the company that originally sent me the product to file a claim. I have tried three times and each time the product is returned. I'm done with return shipping. I gave up on returning the product because I get the feeling that the company won't accept any of the complaints I file against them

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 2 failed attempts to connect to my computer, I finally gave up and returned the unit. The reason for the failed attempts is because the unit doesn't even work. I've sent it back 3 times now, and I still get the same message.  The return cost on this unit alone is too high.  I'm not going to buy anything from Best Buy anymore, and  I won't recommend anyone else buy this item either.

The other three units I ordered were all defective as well. I'm returning my unit and asking for a full refund. I've returned three units now and am out of money. It's not worth the hassle. I have paid for three units and am still in the red. The cost is more than the total cost of the three units.  The product itself is garbage

The good ones never work. The cost to replace the unit is unacceptable. It's taking forever to burn good quality copies.  The only good thing about this is that I have to buy a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these three units and three others of the same model, and have so far returned each one. The unit I just returned is "Bad Disc" (Bad Disc #1), and the others are "Bad Case" (bad case #2, #3, #4). It's not just bad luck; they all burn fine, but the only good thing about it is the cost.

I'm going to throw my unit away until I get my money's worth. The only good thing about the unit failing is that it's forced me to return it.  I have spent more on my own time than I ever expected to for defective products

I just want a good electronic device to give to a good computer but this has become a complete nightmare.

I've burned many other brands of products but never Memorex or Verbatim. This time, I'm just giving up on Memorexx.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player failed about 6 weeks after I got it. The unit was returned to the store. The company claims that they are sending out new units but that has not happened. The whole system is in a terrible state.  It's like someone broke into my house and burned the new DVD player.

I'm going to return my unit and try another brand.

I tried returning two units, but the third one just gives me the "Bad Disc" error. I'm not even going to bother returning the fourth one. The worst part is that I have to pay for all three.

I just wated $200 because my hard drive won't work. I have tried to return the unit three times but the company refuses to return my product. The only solution is to pay to have the unit replaced but that's a huge loss of money. I'm returning my hard drives now as I have already wasted enough money on them.

The cost is just too much to pay

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been replacing my SD card in my computer at least 3 times now. The worst part is that I'm still getting the bad card, even though the one I get is good. The card keeps failing, and I just give up. I've been using other people's cards as replacements, but this is the last straw. The new ones won't work, and even if they do, the new ones cost more.  I'm using Memorex and Kingston as my SD cards, but it's getting too expensive to even try. It's becoming a complete rip-off.

I'm giving up on trying to get a good electronic device.

I have had bad experiences with every brand of electronic device I've ever purchased, and now I have to return my units because of poor quality.

I'm using different power strips and I don't know which one is the problem. I called Amazon to complain and was told that my issue is not their problem.

The person I talked to at the Nintendo Store told me that my DS was in their backlog, but that they were trying to find it. Well, I just wated a good 25 dollars because the person I bought it from told me the system wasn't in the system. I've already paid for my purchase twice, so I'm pretty much out of luck.

I just wasted so much time and money on a bad product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit failed and the company's website says it's because the unit's power cords failed, but I have had the unit fail numerous times. The only problem is that I have to pay for the failure twice. The company says that the power cords are defective, but if they're defective, I should have the original unit replaced. I just received a "Return Merchandise Authorization" from Amazon, but there's been no response from my power company.  It's been almost a week and I still haven't received my unit. The cost for a replacement is also very expensive, but what's worse is that the company is refusing to honor the return request. I've had this unit fail three times now and I'm still trying to get my money back. It's completely unacceptable. I have called and emailed, but so far I'm getting nowhere.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 5 failed attempts at getting the DVD player to work, I decided to just throw out the whole thing and return the unit. I was just about to give up on trying to get my computer to work when I noticed that my power strip was giving the wrong information. The power strip tells the computer that the power has been disconnected. The computer has been using up power, but the power strip says that there's still plenty of juice left. It's a complete rip-off. The cost was just too much to give it another try. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought and returned three of these units. Each one has failed to work properly, and the cost to replace the unit is outrageous. I've tried returning the unit, but each one has been returned due to "Unsupported Device". I'm now on my fourth return. It's a total rip-off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took me a week to get my computer to boot up. After rebooting, the computer would get stuck at the blue screen. I'm using a different brand but the same model number. The only thing that fixes it is to send the whole unit back.

Well, I get my money back and the item is defective. I have returned three now, and each time the item comes back defective. The delivery company gives me the runaround and never sends a replacement.  The poor customer service and defective products is a complete rip-off.  I've been buying at Comp USA for about 20 years, but I'm going to give up on buying from them. I won't buy anything ever again.  It's not just the defective items, but also the slow and expensive delivery that bothers me the most. I am extremely dissatisfied with my electronic devices. I've had my computer and printer fail, and now my TV and radio are out as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad part is that the unit literally just died after one day. I am now having to call Tech Support to have them send another unit out.  I have burned multiple DVDs, but now I'm going to have to buy new hardware and try again. The good part is the cost, but the poor quality and poor support is unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've been replacing my Panasonic I used to own every 2-3 months for about 5 years now.  I get a new one every 3-4 months and the ones that fail (or are just bad) cost me a fortune. I just wated a good 20 bucks on a bad one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working about three weeks ago. The unit came back, but the player stopped again.  It's been about three days now and still nothing.   It costs about $100 to replace the player but that's only $5.  The whole thing just smells bad.  If I ever have to buy a new unit, I'm going to throw it away 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had the UPS guys knock on my door last week because the unit that came with my new computer failed to boot. I got the same bad unit two more times. I'm not just being picky about the unit, though. This has been going on for months. The unit is supposed to be fixed, yet each time the UPS guy comes back with the same failure. I finally gave up on returning the unit and getting a replacement. This is a total rip-off! I'm going to return the unit myself, but I won't recommend returning any of my other products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased these discs at CompUSA and burned well, but the problem is the same every time I burn. The unit always gives an error code when it goes bad. It takes a good 5 minutes to get a new one. The cost is too much for me to keep paying. The product itself is very poor and unreliable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 2 days of use I'm just giving up on trying to get my account set up.  I've tried calling customer service but I get a busy signal.  The problem is that the unit I bought is defective! I have had my system fail to work 5 or 6 times in the last 3 weeks and now the unit is on backorder. I'm trying to return the unit but every time the company says they will replace it, but never does. I've spent at least $400 on a defective item.  If you want to get your money back you should be able to get it.  It's not worth the frustration 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that my computer failed to boot up when I tried to insert the hard drive just made the purchase less attractive.  It was like buying a used book at a Goodwill store. The fact the unit failed to recognize the hard disk is a total rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors, even after several attempts to use it. The unit always gives "bad disc" errors. It's taking hours and hours and I'm giving up on trying to get it working. The only thing I can do is return the unit, but I get the feeling the company won't accept the return. The software on this unit is also terrible. It constantly gives the same "Bad disc" error and doesn't recognize my attempts to burn a good copy.  I have burned hundreds of bad copies and the only thing that ever works is a bad computer. I'm using the "Bad Disk" burners on my bad computer, but it doesn't work anymore. The company just won't give me any more time, so I'm going to return the entire system. I don't want to spend another dime on this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality of the product is appalling.  I tried to return the unit three times but each time the return shipping cost is double the cost of the original purchase.  The fact that the return fee is charged when I return the product shows that the company is taking a loss on every return.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this computer for over three months now and it's still giving me errors. The only thing worse is that it's only getting worse. I've tried resetting the system, and each time I get an error. I'm using a different brand and model of computer, so I'm giving up on trying to fix it. The company that makes these products should be ashamed of themselves. I won't buy them ever again. I give up on ever owning a computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my order today and it was completely defective.  The unit came back defective because the power cord failed to come out of the unit. The other two cords also burned good but failed to turn on. I called Amazon to report the unit as defective but the customer service rep said I was not eligible for a replacement because the cord burned good.  I'm returning the unit today to get my money back and I won't buy anything from Amazon ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After replacing my computer, the DVD player won't work. I have to try all of the usual methods, but they all fail. The fact that the company won't even acknowledge that it has a defective product is extremely disappointing. I'm going to try to return it, but it won't recognize my return. This is the fourth time that I have had to return my computer.  I've burned many good ones, but this is the one that never works.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took over 3 days to get my replacement. I'm using another brand but not this one.   I called to complain and was told the unit was being held up by "bad returns".  I was told it was a problem with the return office and to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement.  Well, I just received my replacement and the return address says "Bad Return". The return address doesn't say "Bad Electronic Device" but "Bad electronic device". It's not good enough to just get a replacement, I'm going to get a full refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the following message from my ISP: "The modem has stopped working. The system is unable to communicate with the Internet service provider. I've tried the reset but the problem persists. I have contacted customer support but they have told me there is nothing they can do. The modem is dead." The problem is that my modem won't even turn on. I'm getting the feeling that this company is more concerned with keeping their contract than they are with their customers. This is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the item two days after I ordered. The DVD player and radio were both dead.

I have returned the unit multiple times to no avail. The company refuses to give me a satisfactory reason as to why my good electronic device is still in the mail.

I'm on the phone with Amazon every few days, but they refuse to even send out a replacement device. I have burned my other two Nooks and both of my computer's, but nothing ever works.I've burned two different Nooks, both with the same failure rate.

We have been advised by our suppliers that these products are not currently available at our warehouse. We do have replacements available, however we are out of the stock on the new items.

However, due the time needed to ship, the customer will be responsible for the additional cost of the replacement.

It's been more than a month and I've yet to receive my refund.  My last attempt was to return the unit, but the label on the case was smudged.  Not much bang for the buck 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this happen twice now. The first time it took over 3 hours to boot up. The second time it burned good but took 20 minutes to get to a good result. I'm using a different brand so I'm not sure if this is a defect or the new firmware. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought 3 of these units and have been let down every time.  The unit I received only had 4 good days of use before it stopped working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received was defective. The DVD player would not work, and even after multiple attempts to insert the player the drive would fail. The entire unit needed to be sent back.  The fact that it took over a week to receive the unit is unacceptable. I'm giving this defective unit zero stars.

I have received the same response every time: The Hub is out of stock.  No response to my emails, so I have to return the Hub.  The company claims the Hub is backordered, but I have never received a reply to my inquiries. I am frustrated with Amazon and the poor customer service 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Toshiba I used to own and was given a new one. The problems began when I tried to transfer my data. The unit just gives the error message "The operation failed". I tried using different computer equipment and I still get the same problem. The whole thing is very unworkable and the cost is a huge rip-off. I have returned my unit but am not sure I want to buy another one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have lost my card and other information twice.  The first time, I called the company and was told that the card would be returned in 3-5 business days. The second time, the company informed me that the return address had been lost in the mail. I have been unable to contact them, and now the entire system is down. I also tried calling the company twice, but was told to call back in 2-3 days.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered was supposed to arrive on the 1st of March, but it never arrived. I called the company to complain and they said the unit had been damaged and the return could not be accepted.  I called customer service and they told me that I needed to call the company back to get a replacement. The only problem is that the replacement never arrived and I am now going to have to call back to return the unit. The customer service rep that I talked to said the company "does not get a lot of return" but I am still waiting for a replacement unit.  The cost for my failed return is going to be at least $60   I have wasted $120  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated the cost of my new computer by having to return it.  The unit came defective, burned good, but then burned bad.

The company sent me a replacement unit, but it took three days to arrive and I'm getting frustrated with the fact that it won't work. The serial number is also completely wrong. I'm using a different brand and model of Power Strip and still getting the same problem. I have to throw it away and try another brand. I don't know what the company is thinking, but I'm not buying from them ever again. The fact that this is happening to other Power Strip buyers is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used three different brands of electronic devices in an attempt to replace the poor quality and poor performance of my previous unit. The third one just died. I've returned three more units now, and they've all failed. The company claims that the failure rate is normal, but the third unit just died  The warranty is completely useless. It doesn't even give you a refund, and the shipping costs are ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased a total of 3 bad units since my original order from CompUSA. I've returned all 3 and so far, the third one has failed. The total cost of these units is over $150. The second one failed because the power cords fell off the power strip. The third one failed due to the fact that the "battery" just stops working. The last one just gave me the run around. It's bad enough that I'm having to return a good electronic device, but now I have to return 3 bad ones? I just don't understand the point of buying these products  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player stopped working and the phone wouldn't turn on. I sent it back to Amazon and they said it would take 5-10 days. It never came. It's now 3 weeks and I have sent it 3 more times, but it never comes. The only thing I get is that the unit "Cannot be repaired". The only good thing is that I have to send it back for a new one, but the customer service doesn't care. I'm so frustrated I'm thinking of canceling my order 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit is defective. The unit I received last month was damaged, and the replacement unit I ordered was defective as well.  It took two weeks to get a new unit, and now the original unit is being returned.  I have returned three units, and I'm out a total of $400. The company is also giving me the runaround. The customer service department says it's because I haven't returned the unit in a timely manner. But they're not sending me a new one until a new defective one is received. This is not acceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried returning the unit several times but each time I get a "bad" electronic device. The power cable always gives me bad news. The fact that the "bad unit" keeps giving me bad results is unacceptable. I have wasted a lot of time and money on this but I have given up on returning the system.  I am going to try to return it and try my luck with a different brand but I am extremely dissatisfied with the performance of the system 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The problem is, the unit I bought on Amazon arrived defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased two of these units, both of which failed within a week, after getting the first one returned as undeliverable. After receiving the second unit, I was informed that the shipping label had been expired. I'm using a different Amazon site to purchase from now, but it's still being returned to the post office. The company doesn't want to refund the cost of the defective unit, but rather the cost for returning the unit, which I'm paying for out of pocket. The second unit failed as well, but Amazon has refused to return my money for the second failure.   The only thing worse than being charged twice for the same defective unit is having to return the whole unit and start all over from scratch.  I'm frustrated with the company's poor customer service, and now I'm considering buying my own electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third bad electronic item I have purchased from Amazon. The first two were defective. The third failed to boot. I have returned three of the four orders and so far the fourth has failed to arrive.  It's now two weeks before I get my third refund.  I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase experience with Amazon. I was paying good money for bad products.  The company claims to be "making good on the returns" but I have yet to receive my refund. The return policy has become a joke.

I have lost three systems and I'm being charged for a fourth.  The company has been very unhelpful and has refused to provide any information about the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered the wrong item. I had to call back to the company and they said the item was on the way.

The second one was delivered damaged and I'm having to pay extra to get a replacement. The third one, however, has been defective too. The customer service representative who sent me the defective product says the problem is with the original unit. The new one arrived damaged. I'm still having to return the product. I've had to pay for the whole thing twice now because the defective units keep failing. The whole system is just so unreliable that I'm giving up on buying anything from Best Buy ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just received my Kingston 256MB SD card, and it has burned fine. The only problem is that the card does not work.  The other two cards in the same computer have worked perfectly.  I've tried everything I can think of to get the card to work, but to no avail.  It's now 4:30PM, and I have burned three more cards in an effort to get my Kingston card to boot.  This is not the quality  I expected from a brand I had purchased.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been waiting for 3 months to receive my defective unit. They told me that they could have it out by the middle of the week but that hasn't happened. They also said that I needed to pay $35 in return shipping fees which I'm just about to do but haven't yet received. I have contacted Tivo but have gotten no reply. I've sent multiple emails but I'm getting no response. I'm so frustrated I'm about to give up on trying to get my defective product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have had my original purchase for this item (2nd one) be rejected because the serial number doesn't match the order number on the back. This is the 3rd time this has happened to me. I called customer service and was told that they couldn't give a satisfactory response because the company that makes the units has gone out of business.  The problem is that the manufacturer never made a return on my order. It's just the usual "no return" problem. The only thing that's good about this is the fact that the new unit cost almost twice as much as the old one.  It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I had to go to a local store to return my faulty electronic device and get a new one. The only thing I received was a bad one.

I have returned it 3 times now, but it still won't get any better. I called Tech Support and they said they would send another one out. Well, that never happens. The Hub won't power on even after I give the replacement hub a good try. I just want my money back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first week of owning my new computer I started getting "Bad Disc" errors and had to return it. The second week it happened again and this time I got an "unexpected" message that my software wasn't compatible with the system. I tried reinstalling but it just gave me the same bad error message. The only way to get it working is to return the system and get a new one. It's costing me an arm and a leg and I'm going to return my system before I give up on my hopes of ever getting it working. It should be simple to return, but they won't give you a new unit. It took three phone calls to get the person who replaced my system to give me the info I needed. It costs more than twice the price of the system itself and I've already wasted my money on three defective units.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used three different units now. Each one has failed. The unit I received yesterday failed, too. The fact that they keep saying "Reset to Factory Defrost" doesn't make any sense. I've had the same problem with three different companies. I'm now going to call back and complain to the company directly. I paid about $30 for a new unit and am still getting burned. I can't believe I'm going to have to return this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have spent over $200 on returning the unit 3 times now. Each time I get the same result: The unit will not boot.

I've spent more on the hardware than I expected, but now I'm out the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from using the new unit and was disappointed in the fact that the DVD player would randomly stop working.  It worked perfectly the first time but now it won't play.  I called Tivo and the customer service rep told me the problem was related to the Tivo system and that I should return the unit. Well, I have returned three units and I am not getting the same results. The system is failing even though I have the original unit and the receipt in hand. I'm going to try to return the Tivos but I'm having a very hard time finding the unit online.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole thing just gave up on me.  It's the exact same thing happening over and over. The fact that it takes more than a week to get a replacement just blows my mind.

It takes me a few minutes to get it to boot up, and I have to start over. The whole unit just gives the feeling that it's defective. It seems like every other unit that I get "bailed out" but the one I get the "bail out" is always the same unit.

The company is making a big business off people's frustration

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the original unit that came in the mail on 3/2/2011 but the replacement unit never came. The customer service rep I spoke to said it was the fault of the store that they were unable to ship the order.  I have tried calling the store but they won't return my call.  This is the 3rd time I have had to send the store a bad item.  If the product doesn't work at all, the company should be able to replace it but it's still taking months for the item to come back. The whole experience is just a bad experience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been having computer problems and the unit I ordered has not even come to my door. The problem is the unit itself, which has been broken. The replacement unit has not worked either. I'm so frustrated that I just gave up on getting a replacement. I ordered a new unit but it hasn't even arrived.    The other parts have been defective as well. I've called the company multiple times but the customer service representative who answered the phone has never bothered to return my call. I have called the customer support line numerous times and have yet to get anyone on the phone.  It's ridiculous that the company can't even deliver the products it promises.  The fact that they don't even care about their customers is more than enough reason to stop buying their products

I'm going to try to get a refund on my credit card but I have to pay for shipping and return shipping costs as well.  Don't waste your money

Each time I get the same response, "We are sorry, but the unit cannot be repaired."  I am very dissatisfied with the quality and customer service.

I have already called and complained to the BBB.  I'm also calling my credit card company. They said they are not handling the case because it is their policy to not cover products that have poor quality or poor workmanship. So, in other words, I have wasted $500

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated over a hundred dollars by returning my broken Dell to Amazon. The unit arrived damaged and I just wate a hundred bucks. I have returned three units now and each one has been the same: broken.  This time, the unit arrived broken and the return label said the unit was "defective." I'm done with buying from Amazon ever.  I'm just giving them my business and returning the unit.  If I'm paying full retail price for a defective product, I'm buying nothing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated two weeks of my money because the hard drive died. The problem is with the original purchase and not the replacement unit  The company is going to pay me for the two weeks but I'm going to be out the full amount.   This is ridiculous

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The only good thing about this is that the warranty lasts for 2-years. The bad thing is that there's a bad memory card failure. I tried to replace the bad one, but the one I get back is defective.  I've tried every way possible to get it to work, but it never does. I'm using the original replacement, but I'm going to return the bad memory as well. The only thing I get out of this is a $25 replacement fee. I just want my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the 2nd one yesterday and it took about 20 minutes to finally give up. It won't power on and it won't start. The power strip doesn't work either. The entire thing is junk.  I'm giving up on ever getting this thing to work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and timely failure rate of this device is unacceptable.  The fact that the company won't give a replacement or refund even after it has been defective for a month is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I've had to return a bad computer. It's been 3 weeks and I have gotten nothing. I'm calling BS on this product. The other two times I returned the unit, they sent a new one. This time I got a bad unit.  The other bad units I have received have been defective. This is a total rip-off.   The company that makes this product should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working and now the whole unit is dead. The unit has been replaced but the replacement unit also fails. The cost is too high 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs I burned successfully came back bad. I have burned many good burns, but this is not a good one. The company I ordered the product from said it would be fixed the next day, but it's been 5 days now and the unit still hasn't come.  It's supposed to take 1 day for the product to arrive, but I've had it take 5. This is unacceptable and I'm going to return the unit. I ordered this item online, but now it's taking 5 days to get anything 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had many bad electronic devices in my life, but never a bad one. This one just gives up.  It won't power on. I've tried everything I can think of, but it just won't work.  The fact that the whole unit is dead should be a red flag, but there is nothing that I can do to get it to work. It's like having a bad computer. I have spent hours trying to fix this problem, but all I can get is "Bad Disc" or "Bad Part". The good thing is that my warranty is good for 2 years, so I'm just going to give up on trying to get this thing to work (and possibly void my warranty). I'm going to throw it out and try to get a new one. I'm sure other people have had this happen to them, but I've never gotten the one I bought online. I guess I'll just have to live with having bad equipment 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole unit came unplugged. The company promised me a new unit but never gave me one.  The return policy is not good enough.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of this item is unacceptable.  The fact that this thing only lasts a couple of months makes it even worse.  If this thing fails, I'm going to be tossing it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried to return my Kingston 256MB SD card twice but each time the system says the card is defective and the card has to be replaced. The card is the one that's defective and I'm being charged for it twice. I'm so frustrated I just gave up on returning my unit. It's not just the cost that bothers me, but the time wasted on returning faulty cards and wasting my time and the money. I've tried returning my cards twice now and each time they tell me the card isn't working. I'll keep returning them until I get a new one. I was going to try my luck with a different computer but now that's out of the question. The whole experience is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player and radio have both failed. I returned the unit and am getting the same response. I have already returned three of these units. It's become an expensive, time consuming hassle.  It's so bad that I am giving up on returning the unit.  The unit I sent back is still under warranty, but the return cost is outrageous.  I just hope the manufacturer finds a solution soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got the bad news that my original electronic device failed. The failure has been blamed on my modem, but I have had problems with my phone and cable modem. The second failure has occurred while I'm at the computer, and the third has occurred during my sleep. The company has said they're going to replace the unit, but so far I haven't received my replacement. I'm being charged twice as much as I originally paid. I've called and written several times, but the company has ignored my messages. I have to wonder if they're intentionally leaving me on hold.

I've tried resetting my modem, but it's not responding. The unit finally gave up and gave me the runaround about replacing the unit. It's costing me a lot of money, and I'm just giving up on my own equipment 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Kingston 256MB SD card because the unit had failed. The card just failed. This is the second one I've had to return. I am returning my money back because I just don't want my hard work being wasted. This company doesn't seem to care about their customers. I bought two of these units, both of which failed, and returned them. The third failed and I'm getting pissed off. I've bought from Amazon before, but never Memorex. It's time to move on to something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've lost several of my three failed attempts to insert my printer via Amazon. I finally gave up on trying to get a replacement. After a month of having the same problem, I'm still being rebuffed. The new printer is defective and the cost is outrageous 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had three of these units fail. The third one came up the wrong day and the rest have either been defective or just plain bad. I have burned a ton of time trying to get these units fixed but to no avail. I am giving up on getting these units repaired. The whole unit just turns on itself.  The last two units were returned to the store, but they refused to accept them.  I'm going to try to return them to Amazon, but I'm giving up before I try.  It's ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my new electronic device less than two weeks after receiving it. It's never worked, and now the whole unit is defective. I called Tivo, but they refuse to replace the unit, claiming it's defective. They don't even offer a free exchange!  The other thing that's so bad about this is the fact that they're going to charge me for the defective unit.  I've returned a few more times now, but this is going to be the last one. It just isn't worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using this for two weeks now and the problem persists.  I tried returning the unit, but was informed the return authorization number is invalid and that I would be receiving a new one. I returned the unit a third time but was still denied. I'm going to try to return the unit as many times as it takes but it's taking a long time and I'm getting tired of waiting.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software failed and the unit was returned to the store. It took 2 weeks to receive a new one.  I'm returning my unit because of the bad customer service I have received.   The only thing I'm happy with is getting my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was defective and eventually failed. The unit took 4 days to arrive. I returned the unit twice because the unit wouldn't turn on. The second time it failed.  The third time it did the same thing.  When I finally got it to work, I was able to access the website to update my account but couldn't access my account. The company representative I talked to said they would try again, but they never did.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs burned successfully. However, after each failed attempt, the unit returns to the store. The burned data is useless. I have burned many different brands, but not Memorex 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that the unit I received was defective is enough to give me pause. The unit I got didn't work at all and I spent over $100 trying to get it to work. The customer service rep that I spoke to was unhelpful and I had to contact Amazon again. This time I got a return authorization number and was told that I would have to wait 4-6 weeks to get my defective unit back. So, if I ever have another unit of this device I'm going to return it.  The only thing worse than having a defective unit is paying to get a defective one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This electronic device has failed on multiple occasions. I have to call the company to get a replacement, which only leads to more problems. It's a complete rip-off.   I'm going to throw my new Kingston 32MB SD card away and never buy anything from Amazon ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these units online and then they didn't work. I've burned two different kinds of media (CD and DVD) but still can't get the unit to work. The unit came in the mail, but the next day the unit didn't arrive. I'm calling Amazon to complain, but they won't tell me why the unit doesn't work  I have burned many things but never Memorex or Verbatim 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor performance and bad customer service have destroyed my trust in Tivo and their brand.

I just can't recommend a bad product to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only problem is that the system keeps failing. It takes a good 20 minutes to get it to work. It's a complete rip-off.  I've tried returning it multiple times but each time the system gives the same bad report. I'm buying another one just to give up on the system.  It's been at least 5 months and I'm still having the same problem.  The cost to repair the system is a complete waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was the worst electronic device I have ever purchased. It randomly stopped working on its own, and I have had to replace it three times. The last one failed because of the bad power cords. I have been trying to get it to work, but every time the failure rate is high. I've bought other units but have been disappointed.    The company that makes this stuff should be ashamed of their poor quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought two of these units and each one has failed. The second one I just returned. The other two units I ordered online are still waiting. This has happened twice now and I'm getting sick of returning the bad units. I have already lost one good electronic device due to failure.  I'm just trying to keep my credit card company from getting ripped off

The unit I received was returned as undelivered, and I have called TELUS multiple times but have not received a response. I've lost all my data and the unit still doesn't work. I am now going to try and return the unit but am not confident in the unit's ability to function. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The unit came back defective.  I had to send it back to CompUSA. The company never returned my call. They said it was a "good" electronic device but they just couldn't get it to work. I sent it back twice and they said it's still broken. The second time I got a return label and they never returned it. I'm going to try and get my money back but I'm just going to be going to Comp USA every month. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated about $200 because the poor customer service I received was beyond poor. I've been using this item since it arrived but have received no response. It's been three days and I've still received no word. I called customer service but they said it was out of their office. The poor customer support is a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor performance of my Kingston 256MB SD card finally gave up the ghost.  I was able to replace it, but it took 2 hours and 20 minutes to fully load.  The failure rate is unacceptable.  It's also costing me tons of money because I have to buy new SD cards.  Hopefully, the new product coming out soon will be a huge success.   I just hope the new units don't take 2 hours 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The failure rate for my unit is unacceptable. I have spent almost $150 on a new unit and the failure rate is unacceptable, as well.  I've returned 3 or 4 units now and I'm going to give up on returning the unit.  The only good thing about this is the fact that it saves me the frustration of returning a bad product. I'm just going to have to buy new units from Amazon, which I hate to do, and use my Goode Uptime Certificate as my return label. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I've been sent back to the store because my electronic device (I used to own) refuses to work. The last time the return date was changed to "Bad Disc" and then "Damaged." I tried everything I could think of but the problem keeps coming back. The unit is returned and the customer service rep says the problem is "on our end."  No thanks, I'm not buying anymore. I just spent $150 on new equipment and I'm spending more on return shipping 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The problems with this unit are beyond repair. I ordered two of them, but received the same one. This is unacceptable. It takes two weeks to get a replacement, and I'm out a lot of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from the computer repair shop, and the only problem is that my computer refuses to boot up. I have tried all the common troubleshooting steps, but I get the same result each time. I'm going to return the unit and try a different computer.  I'm also going to try the U-Boot method on my own, but after the fourth failed attempt, I'm pretty sure that my only hope is to get my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After trying to replace my defective unit, I've received a replacement. Unfortunately, the new unit has the same problem. I called the company but was told that the new units don't come back. It's been 3 days and I still have not received my replacement.  I'm going to have to wait another 2 weeks to get my replacement because I'm still on the phone with them.  It's extremely frustrating 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took 3 days to get the mail, the first two returned as undeliverable. The third was received 2 days late and still has the original label on it. It's being billed to my credit card but never showing up. It also won't give me the ability to get online. It took me 3 days just to get through to the customer service phone number.  I'm still waiting on a return authorization number but the website says it's "Unable to Resolve." I've called several companies about this problem but all I get is a "Sorry, our system is unable to resolve the problem." I have burned many different kinds of CDs and even tried to use my computer but to no avail. I'm going to be calling customer service soon but I'm not holding my breath. I've spent hundreds on other products from the same company but this is the worst I've ever received
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the feeling that the entire unit failed on me. The unit I ordered was supposed to arrive, but it never did. I've called my computer company three times now to complain about the same problem. The customer service rep on the phone says the unit is in the shop, but never shows up.  The entire time, I'm being told the system is out of warranty.  I've tried calling the manufacturer twice and both times have been told the same thing: the system needs to be returned. I'm extremely frustrated with this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got the bad news that my Kingston 256MB SD card died.  The card has already been replaced.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been waiting for a replacement for over a month now, but every time I get a new one, the problem persists.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player failed. It's been more than a week now and the DVD player still doesn't work.  I've called and emailed Amazon and they've given me the run around. The poor customer service is the most annoying part of this entire experience.   I have returned three times to complain but have been told that I have to send it back or pay the return shipping fee.  This is a complete rip off and the company should be ashamed of themselves.  If they want to survive in the electronic device business, they need to improve their customer service.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It worked well for a couple of weeks but I have now had three failed power adapters. The only thing worse is the fact that I have to replace my whole power strip. The fact that my power strips cost as much as my computer is a complete rip-off

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Lenovo T430 to T-Mobile because of poor quality. The entire computer would boot up but there was no way to get past the "Bad Disc" error. The T3 also won't recognize any of my other drives. The only thing I can come up with is that the power cord has burned bad.  T-Mo is supposed to be the best brand but I'm not buying T3 anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player won't work. I have tried everything possible, and my unit just won't play.  I have burned many different brands of DVD, but this one just won`t work.  It takes forever to burn good quality, and I end up with a burned good copy but bad quality. I am using my other brand, but I am not going to buy it.   I am returning my Bad-Rated item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated a good 30 dollars because I got the same problem that other people have been having. The problem is that the unit simply won't work. I tried a couple of times, but each time I get a "Bad Disc" error. I've tried formatting the drive, resetting the BIOS, and even tried using my computer, but I keep getting the same "Bad Disk" error message.  I've even tried taking my computer to the local repair store and they tell me the same thing.  It's getting frustrating to use my computer. I have wasted several hours on this, and I'm not getting any of the value out of my purchase. I'm returning my computer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had my unit twice and each time the unit gave a bad error code. The second time the computer gave a bogus "Bad Disc" error. The third time the system gave a "Bad Disk" error and I lost my data. The fifth time the entire unit gave an "Bad Sector" error so I had to reformat the hard drive. The cost for each time is astronomical 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered on the weekend and the product didn't even come. The seller sent me a tracking number but when I called the number it said it was "out of stock." I tried to return the item but the seller never returned my phone call. It's now been two weeks and the seller has still not returned my package. The entire process is extremely poor. I've ordered from Amazon a few times now but this is the first time I've ever gotten an unsatisfactory rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received today (2/11/12) was defective and failed completely. The unit came in the mail today, but the mailman said the package wasn't there. I called the company and they said the same thing. This has been going on for three weeks now and I am going to have to pay for the return shipping. It is very expensive, especially considering the fact that I have to return the unit because of the defective product. This company does not care about their customers and should be closed down. I just want my money back! I have used several different companies in the past but this is the worst experience I have ever had. The poor quality of their products is unacceptable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered 2 days ago arrived as advertised only 2 days later. The customer service rep that sent it to me had no clue what the unit was supposed to look like and when she finally received the package, it was full of pieces of junk. It's been over a week and I still haven't gotten my money back. I've sent the company a total of 4 (4!) returns but they still won't accept my return. I have sent them a total 4 (2!) refunds but still haven the same problem.  I've even sent them an e-mail with photos of the junk and their responses. I am extremely dissatisfied with the company's quality control and I'm going to try my luck with a different electronic device company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been trying to get my computer to boot up.  It doesn't work. The only way I can get it to work is to unplug it and try another one. I've tried all the usual suspects and nothing works. I even tried to get a different model, but the one I get won't even turn on. It's time to throw out my whole computer. I get the feeling this is just a marketing gimmick 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and time wasted on this item is unacceptable.  I have spent the past three days with the unit still in the mail, and the unit is still not working.

However, I'm going to have to spend several more days on the phone trying to get the problem resolved.

The fact that the Hub has been returned three times in three days is unacceptable.

I'm having to pay for a new computer. The entire thing is a complete and total rip-off. I've already paid for my computer, so what's the point?  I am giving up on paying for this bad electronic gadget.  It's just too much trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took over 3 days to return the unit because the unit came back as defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two failures with my Toshiba hard drive. I have bought two new drives and both failed within a week.

I have been returning the unit since, but every time I return the unit, the same bad power cords show up. The cost to replace the unit is insane, and I just want to throw it all out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I plugged it in, the unit failed to turn on and the unit would only recognize the hard drive as a bad or bad-electronic device.  The second time it failed, I had to take it apart. The entire unit is defective.  It takes forever to get a bad unit working.  I'm not buying this product ever again

I'm returning the ones that have already been returned, and I'm also considering filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

The first one (which I ordered on Jan. 8) showed as "Bad Disk" on my computer and the second one (I ordered on Feb. 2) showed "Bad Sector" on the drive. I'm still waiting on a replacement and I've had to pay for a replacement twice now.

It's unacceptable to pay extra for a product that turns out to be defective.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these discs at CompUSA because I expected them to work. Well, I have burned them and I can't get them to burn.  I've tried everything, and all I get is the same problem every time. The whole unit blows up. It's so bad that I'm going to return it and get a new one.  It's ridiculous 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player, modem, and all other functions failed. The customer service agent suggested replacing the unit, but I decided against it because the problem had not resolved. I'm going to be sending my unit back to Amazon, but they are taking 5 days to reply. It's costing me 5 days worth of work just to get a response.   The company is incompetent.  It's as if they are purposely trying to give bad service.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had three failed attempts to set up my modem. The last two times the system locked up and required a hard reset. I am using a different company but they keep giving the same bad news. The latest failure was the one that required a "bricking" of the system. I will not buy this company ever again.  I am returning my unit with my bad review. The failure rate for these companies is unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit came very quickly, but the poor quality and poor service I have received is unacceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this electronic device online and it took over two weeks to receive it. I'm using my old, defective unit to try and return it, but it just gives up and gives the date as "Jan 30, 2015". The fact that I have to call customer service is unacceptable. I've returned the unit twice and had the same results each time. The other day I received the same response "January 30,2015".  I'm going to try calling the company to complain, but I'm afraid it's going to be a lost cause.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software failed to boot up. The unit would just give up and quit making any attempts at booting up.The unit would also hang and reboot at random times, resulting in the unit being completely useless. I returned the unit twice now and am still waiting for my replacement. The second time I get a "Bad Disc" error. I am going to return it at least 3 more times and probably spend more money on the unit because the software is never going to boot.  I am very dissatisfied with this experience

I'm going to return the unit and get a different one.  I'm not buying anything from Amazon

It cost me a couple of days of work and a couple more to get it to work the first time. I've had to return three or four of these units because of failure.  I've called Amazon and received the same response, "It's not working."  The company is giving me the run around.  The cost to repair these units is a big bummer.

This is the second time that I've had to return a Seagate. I won't buy another Seagate until the company fixes the defective units. The company should be ashamed of itself!

I've been through this process three times now and each time I'm frustrated with the poor quality and poor customer service.  The company that ships these products has never been very accurate and I have spent hours on the phone with them.  This isn't even the third time I've had to return a bad item. The customer service reps I've talked to have been rude and unprofessional, and they have no interest in fixing the problems.

I'm just giving up on buying from Amazon.

The problem is that the unit keeps giving "Bad Disc" errors. The unit is also giving "Unreadable Disc" and "Bad Block" errors, even after the software is reformatted. This is not a good electronic device, and I'm going to return it as soon as possible.

I was told that the item would be in my mail within two days, but that it would be 2 weeks or more before the item arrived. The entire time, I've been waiting for the product to arrive. I have called Best Buy several times, but have received the same response each time: I am sorry, but the product is defective. I can't even get the product out of the box.  The company also states that they have received my product, but I have yet to receive the defective unit. The poor customer service is unacceptable, and I will never buy from Best Buys ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product has failed twice now. I have burned my master keys multiple times and have burned multiple other keys, but each time the DVD or other data is damaged.  The cost is getting to be too much for me, and I'm going to try my luck with other companies before giving up on this one.  This time the product burned fine, but the next time it's ruined.  So I'm calling BS on this and giving up.

The other units I burned good too, but the one I got burned good just two days ago burned bad. I'm having the unit replaced and I'm giving up on returning this bad electronic system.  Not worth the money

The first one I returned because the DVD player wouldn't work, the second one I got a defective unit, and the third one I get a bad one again. The last two times, I had to call Amazon and return the product because the unit wouldn't boot up. I have tried my luck with the local stores, but all of them gave the same bad results.

It took over two weeks to arrive and I'm still having problems with the unit. The new unit is defective and the original shipping label has been lost.  I've been sent three replacements but have received none.  The whole system is so bad I'm considering returning my entire purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The Hub stopped working on my system. The unit came back and I have to return it, which costs me thousands. I have bought and returned three of these units so far, but each one has been defective. The Hub is completely useless, and I am returning it. The company promises a replacement, but it is never delivered. I've tried calling, but the customer service reps are always disconnected.  I'm returning my Hub, and probably my system, because of poor customer service.

It's taking forever to get my money back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working about 3 weeks ago. It took several attempts to finally get it working but after about 5 tries, the player finally gave up on trying to play a good quality copy.

The fact that I have to call customer service to get a working unit just makes me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have wasted many hours on the phone trying to get my replacement device to work. I've been told by my ISP that the modem is "dead" and that my "service" is being terminated. I'm angry and frustrated. I have called both Comcast and Amazon but they refuse to provide any information or repair the device. It's now 7pm and I still have not received my replacement device. I am also experiencing problems with my modem and internet, which is the main reason I'm calling. It is completely unrepairable and the fact that the device is so useless is just unacceptable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The only thing worse than having to return my unit is having to wait two weeks to get a replacement.  The company sent me a defective item which they said was defective, but then sent me another one which was defective.

This is not the experience I expected from a company that claims to provide reliable products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product itself has been defective. The DVD player and other functions have failed.  I have even called customer service to complain about the same problem. It's costing me about $300 to replace the unit. The company claims it is taking the problem "seriously."  If that's the case, I'm going to wait until my unit breaks before I give them another chance. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who's having this problem.

I have to send it back and I'm being charged the original cost for a second defective unit   This is a complete ripoff  I'm going to throw out the warranty 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After about three weeks, I just received the dreaded "Bad Disc" message on my hard drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from a two day trip to Best Buy, where I purchased a new 3DR (3 day replacement) 3-pack of these units only to find that the unit I received on Monday was defective. I called customer service and they gave me the run around. They said that the system should be mailed back to them, but the mailman never showed up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had many problems with my Kingston 256MB SD card failing.  I just returned my Kingston card because the failure is permanent.  The unit also came with the bad sticker. The only good thing about the whole experience is that my husband lost his card but we finally got it to work. I'm going to try another brand but I'm not going to trust Kingston anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated $70 on Amazon because my Samsung brand new laptop gave bad "Bad Disc" errors on all three of my burns. The "Bad Disk" errors are coming on after every single one of my attempts at burning a good book.  The fact that the "Bad" errors never seem to happen after I've burned a good one is beyond infuriating.  I've tried everything I can think of to get my "Bad'er" on, but every time I get a bad one I just give up on trying to get it right. The only thing I get from my Samsung is a bad "Unreadable" error.  So I'm basically screwed.   The "Samsung" company needs to be ashamed of themselves 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of this item is a complete rip-off! I had to return the unit after only two or three unsuccessful attempts at fixing the problem.  The only good thing is the fact that the return process was free, but after that the product never works. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the second time I've burned a bad CD. I've sent back two burns but each one has failed. The second one was a bad one at that.

I'm frustrated and I don't want to pay for a new product.

The fact that the unit I ordered on-line failed to arrive even after I contacted the company is unacceptable.   The fact there is no return policy at all is a complete rip-off.  I have already wasted over $70 on two failed orders. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had the same problems with my new Panasonic unit  Every month, I get a new bad unit  The customer service representative on the phone always gives the same answer: "The DVD player won't work." I have tried replacing all the parts, and the unit still won't play. I have replaced the entire unit but the problem persists. I am throwing my money away. I've tried returning the unit, but the person on the other end of the phone keeps telling me to return it to the store. The unit still doesn't work, and I'm wasting my time. The last time I complained about this, they said that it was the end of their support. I'm now calling them to complain about the poor customer service. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality of the unit (failures to power up and repeatedly freezing) and the high cost (over $100) have me giving up on returning the unit. It's not worth the money.  I'm returning it but paying for a replacement unit

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After my new hard drive died, I had to call Amazon and get a new one. The tech support agent told me the hard drive was defective, but then said the only way to get a replacement was to mail in a defective product.  I'm not willing to accept a defective device.  This is a complete rip-off. I'm going to have to throw this out and buy a new hard disk. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated over $300 dollars on Amazon because the unit I ordered didn't work. I even sent a return request and they told me to come back in a week or so. Well, I finally got the email stating that my unit was returned due to the failure to power on. The other three units I ordered also failed to power up.  I've already wasted over $500

The third time, I got a "Bad Electronic Device" error message.  I finally got the return address wrong. The fourth time, my order was rejected. This is the fifth time I have gotten the same error message, so I am now calling back the company and filing a formal complaint.  So far, they have given me the same bad electronic devices.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The entire unit failed within a week of purchase. I called Tech Support but was told they didn't know anything about the issue. They gave me the runaround for weeks on end, until finally I was told to wait a week to get a replacement unit. Well, I finally got the replacement but when I plugged it in it still failed. I'm going to be replacing it with a different brand and hope I don't get a bad one.  The only thing that bothers me is the fact that they're asking me to pay for a new unit when I already got one that failed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got my old Nintendo console back from the store. The DVD player worked fine but now the power cord won't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $80 by returning my defective unit. The unit came in the mail on June 15th and it showed as damaged. The problem is the unit came damaged so I just had to return it.  The return cost is the final nail in the coffin.  This is an electronic device that just gives bad information.  It has taken a good 3 months to get a replacement.  I am not buying anything ever again from CompUSA. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The fact that I have had to go through several failed attempts at setting up my computer is beyond unacceptable. I have returned 3 times to return the unit. This has cost me about $200, and I am now having problems getting my computer to boot up. I am having to return my entire system in hopes that I get a good electronic device. The only problem is that I keep getting burned 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The entire unit just gave up on me a couple of days ago. The unit wouldn't even turn on, and the poor customer service was unacceptable. I'm going to have to return my unit. I have wasted a lot of money on this device and I'm having a hard time returning it. I've already returned two of my three units but I'm being told it's not my turn.  I'm getting the feeling that the company just doesn't want to make good on its promises. The fact that the product is still being returned is very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my broken Panasonic I used to own to Best Buy. I tried three different brand names, but they failed. After trying a few more times, I gave up. The unit was returned to the store with a note that the product was defective. This time, I just gave up on returning the unit. I have tried to contact Panasonic several times, but I keep getting the same answer: I'm sorry, but the unit is out of warranty.

After I replaced the unit, the same thing happened again.  I have already called Upton Uptop to complain but they don't have a replacement unit. It's been three days now and the unit still won't boot. It just won't turn on.   It's costing me a ton of money and I'm not getting my money's worth.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the second one I have gotten. The first one just gave up on trying to work. The second one (after I've spent about $50 on three more) just gave out on trying again. The last one gave up.  I've thrown out at least a dozen other units, but I just can't get it to work anymore.  My credit card gets charged when the unit gives up, but the time wasted on the entire thing is just too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had my DS and SNES break twice.  Each one was due to a defective unit. The first one was replaced by a different company, but the second one never showed up.  The customer service rep I spoke to about the problem said the system was not being recognized, so it's being returned to the store. The fact that I'm now getting two or three returns per week is enough to make you question the quality of the products you receive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad part is the fact that it takes so much space on my computer and takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like advertised.  The fact that I have to use the "fool" to get the "free" is not much of a bonus.   It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This has been a total failure.  The unit I just returned has the battery dead.  I have returned two units so far, both of which failed.  No help at all from Telsa. I just want to throw it all out.  This is a total rip-off

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received was defective and the replacement unit did not work. I returned the unit and ordered a new one but the replacement has not worked either. The unit still has the same bad problems as the first unit, so I am now going to return the system and try to get my money back.  I have spent about $400 on this system and I am very disappointed.  The return policy states that a defective unit can be returned but when I receive a defective one, I get the feeling that I have been scammed.  So if the return policy doesn't work, then I'm not getting my money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the return authorization on the defective unit. The only problem is, I can't use it. The other three units in my order also failed, but I never received a recall notice. The company has also been sending me defective units, so I'm pretty much out of luck. I have contacted Amazon, but they have not been able to help.  The whole system has been a total fiasco from the beginning, and I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  I'm not buying products from Amazon ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and defective software has been a total letdown. The software has failed multiple times, and the unit I just returned had failed yet again. It has taken me 2 attempts to get it to work, and now I am going to try my luck with eBay. I've bought two units from Amazon, but each one has failed. The other two units have been defective. It's frustrating because I'm trying to use my own computer and it won't work. The whole system just seems to be making random errors.  I'm going to return my unit and start over with a different brand, but I'm not going to pay for something that isn't working. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've had the same problems with my Kingston 256MB SD card that I got from my computer. The card doesn't work. I'm using another card but I'm getting the same problem. I get the feeling that the Kingston company is just using the consumers as guinea pigs. I don't like paying full price for a bad product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered three of these units and got one that was damaged. The unit I got was defective. The first one was returned but the second one was not. The third one came in the mail, but the email said "Return Confirmation Not Received".  The poor customer service has been a big turn off. The price point for these units should have been enough to pay for the poor quality.  I'm going to be returning my order and trying to return the second unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these products expecting to get the same quality as the other ones I purchased. I have received two bad units. I called the company to get my refund but they said I needed to send the bad units back. I sent the second unit back, but I never received the third. The company said that the return date was invalid and I needed the bad unit to be sent back. They also said that my refund would be denied because I didn't send the right product. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am sending my product back as soon as possible. I'm also calling the company's customer service line to complain.  I'm getting the feeling that the bad electronic devices are being sold as new.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working and then had to be replaced. This is an expensive and time consuming mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the bill twice this month because the original unit died on me. The second time it didn't even turn on.  I called and got told that the unit wouldn't work. I've had it turned off three times. It's not working and I'm being billed twice. It sucks

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I have had to return my Samsung product because the data card failed. It's a complete rip-off.  I've called the company twice and the second time they said there was a "bad card" and they were unable to replace it. The third time the same thing happened and I'm now down to my last two replacement cards.  They also said the computer system that came with the product was "bad" and wouldn't work.  All I get is the same "Bad Card" excuse.  It's like they're trying to kill me!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player and radio just don't work. I bought this device online and got the wrong item. It has been 5 days and still nothing. I called the company but the person who answered the phone said there was no point in calling. I have tried calling and got no response. The unit still has the same problem. I'm pretty much fed up with buying defective products. It's been five days and I still have not received my order. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received today failed. I called to get a replacement but the phone doesn't even acknowledge my call. The unit is being held at the local Best Buy.  The whole thing is defective and I'm going to return it.  It's not even being replaced or offered a credit. The company is making a mockery of their name and I won't buy anything from them ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have lost my password to my online banking site twice. It took over a week to get a new one, and when I finally got it, it was the wrong one. I have tried resetting it, but each time the same thing happens. I'm using another computer at home, so I'm starting to think the problem is with my computer. I'll try to get another one, but I just can't seem to get it right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product arrived just a few days after Iordered. The unit arrived damaged, and I am returning it. The cost is a big red flag.

It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been unable to use my computer for over 2 weeks now, and I have lost my power.

I have tried calling the company but they have been non-responsive.  I am also having trouble with my printer. I can't get it to work, either. I'm giving up on trying to get my computer and printer working. I've lost two weeks worth of work and have spent over $50 on a new printer. The quality and design of the product is terrible
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio failed within a week. It took about two weeks to get a replacement.  It's so bad that I'm going to have to return the unit.  The unit cost me $100.  I was only given the option of replacing the failed unit or paying a $100 return fee.  My only consolation is that I paid for the defective product, but I'm not happy with the quality of the return.  Hopefully, this will be resolved soon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have returned three of the four units that I ordered. The unit I received from Amazon on January 25th said it was "temporarily out of order." It was not until three days later that I finally got a response that the unit was defective. I have called Amazon three times and have gotten the same response.  I'm giving up on getting my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The electronic device failed twice. The second time the unit gave the user a bad error code. The third time the device gave a bad response to a bad attempt to insert the device. The fourth time the entire unit gave a poor response to the computer. The fifth time the system gave an "Invalid Operation" error. I've had to call and get a replacement. It's been over a month and I'm still trying to get a good response. I'm getting sick of returning the unit. It should be a simple fix but it's been a month. It takes the fun out of using a good electronic device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took me two weeks to get my money back, and the product was completely defective. I had to pay the full amount out of my own pocket, because I had sent the wrong item. This is unacceptable, and I will never buy from Amazon ever again. I am also extremely frustrated by the fact that they have no idea how to fix it. The original package said that the product would be in the mail the next day, but instead I got a "no tracking number received" message. I have sent the same thing back twice now, and each time I get the same message.  The product should not take two weeks

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this unit online but it never arrived. After several failed attempts I finally gave up on returning the unit.

It's been less than three days since the last one. I'm still getting the same results. The return address is still being returned and I've sent a bunch of e-mails back to say that I'm getting the bad e-mail. So much for a good electronic device. I just returned my broken Nintendo 3DS and am stuck with this crap 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After a week of failed attempts at setting up my system and resetting my password, I called the customer service number and they said it's not their problem. It's my problem! It takes two days to resolve my problems and I'm still having problems. I've spent over $100 on this. I'm going to give up on trying to use this system. I'll give up trying to get my money back. The company should have been aware of the problems with the product and have corrected the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wasted a week's worth of my money on this bad electronic devices. It took 3 tries to get it to work. The last 2 failed. I have wasted over 50 dollars on this. It's not worth the price of admission.

I've been burned before and I'm just not buying any more of these bad electronic devices

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The bad electronic devices I have returned to Amazon about a dozen times now have been defective. The customer service rep that I've dealt with consistently gives me the runaround and then blames the manufacturer. I finally just gave up and sent my unit back. I'm currently waiting for a new defective unit to arrive so I can get my money back. It's costing me more than I pay for the device and I'm pretty sure I won't be getting my money. The fact that the customer service representative refuses to accept my return is unacceptable. I've returned the unit to Amazon more than ten times, and I've gotten the same response every time: "This product is defective." The fact they won't accept my money speaks volumes about the quality of the products that they're shipping. The only good thing about returning the unit is that I get to try and get my refund.

I've paid for the defective product and now I'm getting nothing. It takes 2 days for a new product to arrive and then I'm waiting. I have a replacement device but nothing to show for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The CD player doesn't work and the phone also won't work. The store manager told me that I could get it fixed, but she won't give me a refund.  I've bought these products and returned them many times and every time I get the same bad news. I'm giving up on trying to get my money back.  It's as if they're trying to rip me off. I've tried everything I can think of to get it working, but so far, it's just not happening. I won't be buying anything from Amazon ever again.

I'm going to call the company and complain until I get my money back. This is a complete rip-off and I'm never buying anything from them ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered was delivered and I got the bill, but I have to admit that the unit never made it to my house. The first unit I received was defective and the second one was the same. I called T-Mobile and they gave me a new one but I just got the same bad one as the first one.  So, if you order this product and you don't get the one you ordered, don't even bother returning the item.  I have wasted over $150 on two defective units and now I'm out more than $200.  It's not worth the trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered never arrived.  It took 6 days to get the unit.

I have given up on returning the unit and returning the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working last week. The problem is that the company has given us no indication as to when or if they will replace it. I have returned my units several times now and each time I am told that it's going to be two weeks before they'll be back in stock.  So far, I have paid over $100 for three separate returns. I'm going to have to return all four units and shop around for a different brand and model.  This is a complete rip-off

I'm buying more products from Amazon, but it's going to be a very long time before I buy anything else from this company.

I tried returning the unit a few more times but every time I get a "Bad Disc" error. I've tried returning it to Amazon and Best Buy and they have given me the run around. I'm having a lot of trouble getting the "good" label to show up on the unit. It's very frustrating to use and I'm returning it as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working two days ago.  The other two components also failed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The fact that my entire unit (and the two units that I ordered) failed in less than a week is unacceptable.  The company said that they were aware of the issue but that it took several weeks to replace the faulty units.  It's been over a month now and I still haven't received my defective unit.  This isn't even their official response to my initial email.  I am writing to complain because this isn't the first time that I've been disappointed with my electronic device.

The company I'm paying is costing me more than I expected 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered online, but when I got the email that the item was still being held up, I called the company. They told me the product was going to be back in two days, but two days later I got another email saying it's still being delayed.  I have called and emailed, but I keep getting the same response.  If it takes them two weeks to fix the problem, it's not worth buying.

I've called both the company and the electronics store but they won't return the item. It's the worst electronic device I've ever purchased.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit came dead on arrival and the return address was not even mailed.

The store I ordered from has not returned my order, and I have called the manufacturer numerous times. The last time I called, they told me that they have no record of my order.  It is absolutely ridiculous that a good electronic device like this should not work.  The customer service rep at the store I purchased from also refused to return my purchase.  I am extremely dissatisfied with this experience.

It's only getting worse as the days pass. I'm going to have to return it as well as buy another one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player is dead. No matter what I do, the player won't work. The computer is also having problems.  It's been three days now, and I have called several different tech companies and none of them have been able to solve the problem. It's making it impossible for me to use my computer, so I'm thinking about just giving up on my DVD player. I'm going to have to return my computer and purchase a new one, which will be at least $150.  I'm pretty sure the new unit won't even work, so it's just not worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The entire unit failed to power on, and the company said it needed to be sent back. I called the company and they told me it was a defective unit. The problem is that they told the company to send me a new one. When I called back to complain, the company told me I needed to send it back. They never sent me a replacement unit. I've sent them two new units but they still haven't delivered. The company said the warranty would expire on the original unit. I've sent the company five attempts to resolve the issue but they refuse to address the issue. What is the point of sending out a defective product if you can't fix it?

The cost of the faulty product is not worth it.

I have had to pay for the defective unit, but I also have to pay a return shipping charge because the replacement unit takes two weeks to arrive.  The entire experience is a total rip-off.

I contacted Amazon to get a replacement but was told that they are not authorized to replace the unit.  I called the customer service line but no one was available.

I'm using another modem but the whole time I'm getting the same bad connection. I just spent $80 on Amazon because I'm stuck on hold with customer service. I don't know if I should give up or return the entire unit. It's not worth the time and money

It's time to just give up on returning my unit.

After several unsuccessful attempts, I finally called the company and was told that the computer would be returned and that I would have to pay for the return shipping. This is unacceptable! The only good thing about this is that the return address is "lost" and therefore the item is never delivered. I've already called the support number and was hung up on.  I've called them back multiple times, but every time I get the same answer: The computer is not working.  It's just a matter of time before they get it back. The entire product is defective

I have called them 3 times, but have gotten the same answer each time: We have a lot of complaints about our customers experiencing poor customer service. Unfortunately, we have no more information about the situation than you do. We are contacting our supplier to see if there is a possible solution to our customer's problem. Hopefully we can resolve the issue soon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my new electronic device due to the fact that it gave the wrong date, the wrong number, and the wrong type of device.

I'm currently giving up on ever buying anything from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Toshiba due to a defective unit. The customer service rep informed me that Toshiba would not honor any warranty claims, and that the only way to get my money back was to send it back to Toshiba. So, now I have to send the unit back. No thanks.  I just wasted a good 30 bucks. The only reason Toshiba gives you a 3 day return window is because the return label says "in good condition". This is not the case at all. The unit I received today failed the initial check, which is why I am not going to send my unit back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to send my computer in to get my password reset.  I called and talked to a good electronic device tech, but he was out of town for the weekend. I called another tech company and they said they would call me back. I got a busy signal.  After 15 unsuccessful tries, I gave up and went to my local computer store to buy a new one. The problem is, the other company doesn't know how to get the new one to work. They say they can't even get the serial number.  It's been 2 days now, and I still haven't gotten my money back.

The product itself has been defective since the day I received it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and the radio were both bad. The fact that the unit took several tries to get the player working is beyond infuriating.

I'm going to have to throw out the entire unit

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought 5 of these units and have yet to receive them.  The unit I just received had the wrong model number.

The fact that it gives "Unable to read device" errors 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After trying to repair it three times, I just gave up on getting it working. It just randomly gives bad repair codes, even when I try to follow the instructions.  The system doesn't even recognize that the device is plugged in. It also won't even turn on.  It's taking forever to get anything done.  I'm using a different computer, so it's probably a hardware problem. I just can't stand this product.

I'm so frustrated. I paid over $300 for a defective product and I'm out a good 25 bucks. I have no idea what's going on with this.  It's been 3 weeks now and they still haven't sent me a replacement.  My other three devices have been working perfectly.  Hopefully, I'm going to get my money back.

I have already called my local repair center twice because the problem keeps coming up. I'm hoping that they get it to work on time, but the time wasted is unacceptable.

I would not recommend buying a Bad electronic device

I am returning this product. I hope they can't keep making these bad products.

I called Amazon but no one picked up the phone.  I returned the unit and the new date was "In Store" but there was no record of the order being delivered.  The new date changed every day! I also have problems with the unit giving out errors and the DVD player refusing to play.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received was defective. The DVD player stopped working. The phone number on the receipt didn't work. The whole thing was a total flop. I'm using my credit card to replace the defective unit but I'm getting the feeling that the replacement company won't be able to get it working.  It's not worth the money.  I've used Amazon and NewEgg and both have failed.  Hopefully the manufacturer fixes the problem but it's only getting 3/5

I am returning the product and asking the manufacturer to replace it.  The company told me they would replace the unit but that the case would not be filled. The case has not been filled.  My computer is also giving me a "Bad Disc" error. I am going to try to return the unit to the store but I am giving up on the whole purchase.  It's been less than two weeks since I ordered and yet the system still won't work.  This is unacceptable.   I've returned three units now and am still being told "Bad Case" and "No Return"  The return fees are so high it's ridiculous. I'm giving up and returning the entire order. I have wasted a lot of money on this product and I'm going to let my business go down the tubes.

The company's response time is so poor, I am giving them no credit for their response time.  The other time the unit died, I got a call a day later.  I have burned numerous bad electronic devices and still get burned, but not with this one.  If I get burned with this product, I will never buy it ever again.

I've called CompUSA three times and they have told me the problem is with my credit card company.

The only thing worse than receiving a bad Electronic Device is getting the bad one mailed to you.

The unit said that the memory was bad but after about a week, the unit still shows "Bad Mem" on the memory card reader. I've returned the card twice now and the unit is still bad. The company that I bought from says that the unit has failed and the return process is very expensive. I have returned all of the cards that I purchased from this company and have been told by other companies that the return costs will be deducted from my refund. This is a complete rip-off

I've sent Tivo numerous emails and even phoned them on multiple occasions. The problem is, they won't help me. I have burned my Tivo's brand new unit, and even tried calling the company to no avail.

I'll let you know when they finally do.

It's been two days now and I've lost at least four other units. I have called T-Mobile and even called a company that sells the exact same item and received the same answer.

It came back as "Return to Sender" and I have been getting calls and emails from Amazon ever since. I have called and emailed and emailed. I even sent a letter, but I get the feeling that Amazon won't even accept the letter. The unit came back with "Failed Delivery" and "Bad Unit" written on it. I'm really pissed off.  I have sent several more returns, but the unit keeps getting "Failsafe" and the "Bad" rating on the unit stays the same.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered failed to arrive. I called Tech Support and the guy who answered the phone told me that I had to send the unit back. He said that the part that I ordered wasn't there and that the store would only give me a new one if I paid the rest of the cost. I just don't get it. I ordered online and I get nothing. I'm out a good 50 bucks. It's the same exact thing that happened with my last electronic device. The only thing that has changed is the cost

I've tried resetting the unit many times but every time the problem is the same.  The unit has burned many bad burns, but not the good ones. I'm stuck with a bad unit for good reason. I get the feeling that whoever designed this unit doesn't care about the product.

The entire thing is extremely flaky and unreliable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The electronic device failed on me twice within a month. The first time, the unit came back with a bad or defective unit. The second time, I got the same bad unit.  I'm using my Kingston 128MB SD card, but I'm not sure I'll ever get the one bad unit out of my system.

It's a complete rip-off and I'm going to return the unit, but at least I know what the product is made of.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my entire hard drive fail since I bought this item. The only way to get it to work is to take it apart and replace it.

The only thing I get is the feeling that I'm going to lose everything

I am calling them every day but every time the person on the phone says "There is nothing wrong with the system" and "We are going to try again." I'm fed up with this. I'm buying new equipment but the company won't even give me the bad electronic devices. It's a total rip-off. The company is making money on the backs of customers but they won't make a good product. The good news is that there is a good electronic device on the market but I have wasted over two hundred dollars so far. The bad news is the cost will keep going up.

I have called T-Mobile, but the representative I speak to says that there is no problem with my account and that they have no record of a problem.  In addition, the phone system keeps going down and failing. I have spent over $50 on T-Mo to have my account fixed and the cost keeps mounting up. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase and I'm going to return the system.

I've replaced Hubs before, but never Hubs that give up on you so quickly. I'm now going to send this one back and ask for a refund.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After two failed attempts at returning my unit, I finally gave up on returning the unit. I'm returning my Toshiba because the second failure is unacceptable.  It takes several weeks to get a replacement.  The fact that I'm spending a week on my computer trying to return a bad Toshiba is ridiculous. The fact the company has sent me a new unit is even worse.

I was told that the item could not be delivered due to a wrong address. I called the postal office and the person who answered the phone told me that the package had been returned as delivered.I then called Amazon and I was given a date of 5 days.  When I called back and was told the package still needed to be returned, I called Amazon again and was given the same date of delivery.  The next day I received a call from Amazon that the return had been approved and the package was on the way. So, the whole time I was waiting for the return the whole thing was wasting my time and money.

I've returned three units so far, and they all failed. So I just gave up on returning the system.  The company won't give a bad unit a bad review, so I'm just giving up on the whole system.

I'm frustrated and am going to send them a bad review about the bad electronic devices: I have ordered a replacement, but the product never shows up. The problem is the same every time. I send them photos, but every time it's the same thing.   It's not worth paying the extra money for something that never shows.  I'm going to give up on trying to get a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The entire electronic device just burned to a crisp. The unit even failed to boot up on several occasions. The only good thing about this is the fact that the company won't replace the unit unless it gets a full replacement.  I just hope they get the ones I ordered wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit failed within a month of purchase. The company told me the replacement was being delayed because they needed to check the serial number. When I called the company to complain, they said the serial was "bad." I have called the manufacturer twice and each time the response was "Bad" or "Bad Disc"  I am extremely frustrated and won't buy anything from Amazon.  I've already called my credit card company about the defective product. The third time I called, the representative said the problem was being addressed.  The new unit came and I tried to open the package, but it wouldn't budge. It turns out the original unit had the same problem.  If Amazon doesn't address this problem within 24 hours I'm going to return my entire order. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the shipping label said it was "in the mail" but it never showed up. The box came back empty and the return label never arrived. I have called and emailed but they don't have a record of the package being delivered. I finally got a "Bad Electronic Device" response which said "the device is currently under repair and the package has been returned to us." I just want my money back.  I've sent the seller a total of three emails and two return forms but no response. It's almost as if the seller doesn't want to accept responsibility for the failure. I'm going to return this item as soon as possible and I won't buy anything from Amazon ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After receiving my Kingston 256MB SD card I noticed that it was full.

I've burned many a good electronic device but never Memorex 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just burned a bad unit: The unit failed to start and the power light went on and off every few minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using my own brand new computer for three days. The unit has failed to boot.

I have spent more than $100 on a new computer. I am going to try to return the unit but it won't work.  I'm returning it because I'm dissatisfied with the quality and performance of the product.

I then waited for 3 days to hear back and have the correct date. However, the unit still won't work. The entire time I'm waiting I'm getting the feeling the device is being used as a paperweight. The company is supposed to replace it, but it never comes. I'm using my old unit just as much as the new one, but the new unit is just as faulty. I've tried calling and emailing the company, but to no avail.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just returned from replacing my Dell because the unit took 2 weeks to ship. The only problem is that the unit never arrived.

It's a total rip-off.  I'm going to try to return the product but they won't accept it. I just want to get my money back
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad news is that I just returned the unit to Amazon and it has failed again. The other bad news (besides the fact that I have to return it all over again) is that the company has told me that I'm out of luck if they can't get it working. The bad design and poor customer service are enough to make me throw the whole thing out. I'm not going to buy another one (I've lost a good 10 bucks just because I got burned). The fact that the original unit was returned 3 days after I purchased it is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned the unit to the company about a month ago to get a refund. They informed me that the return was unsuccessful and that the company would have to send a new unit out to me. The second time around I got the same result. The customer service rep said that I needed to contact the company and get a new return authorization number. I have already done this twice but no response has been received. I'm returning the unit as a matter of principle but won't purchase from them ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It worked perfectly for about 2 days. Then it started failing.  I bought new ones, but each one has failed. The only way to get them to work is to get the original ones. I've burned my old ones and used new ones but they always fail.

The software froze twice on me and the hard drive failed the first time I tried to use it.  I even returned it twice but they just refused to replace it. So, now I'm on my third return.  If you want a good electronic device but don't want to spend the extra money  I suggest looking elsewhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought three of these units and three others have failed. I have spent more than a month trying to fix them, but the failure rate is still high. It has to be the unit, not the electronics. I've had to return three units now. The unit arrived damaged. The company said that it's out of warranty, but that's not good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have lost my entire computer and its contents to this unit. The software is terrible and the only thing I get is a "Bad Disc" error.

I returned my last unit to TELUS but the problem continues. I hope this is the end of the line but

The woman on the phone told me that she couldn't give me a satisfactory resolution. The next day I get a replacement unit but it fails again. I am out hundreds of dollars. This is just not acceptable. I just gave up on trying to get a good electronic device and am going to try my luck with a different brand. The only good thing about this product is that it's so expensive that I can't use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The entire unit (the DVD player, the modem, etc) failed within 5 days of purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The CD player works fine for a few days, but then the player gives the same bad sound every time. It's extremely frustrating, especially when the player doesn't work at all. The unit also doesn't last very long, but the cost is too high for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Sony CD player to the store only to have it say "Bad Disc"  I've been using this brand but it keeps giving me bad marks. I tried to return it but they won't accept it. I'm going to try the same thing with another brand but I'll give up on my hopes if I have to get it repaired. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It takes forever to boot up and take down.  It also takes forever (often twice as long) to recover from a bad hard drive.  The fact that the unit won't even turn on or function properly is unacceptable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player and radio stopped working. I have tried resetting the system but the system won't let me.  It's been 5 days and I have gotten a new one. I'm going to have to get another one before I get the one I ordered.  The whole thing is extremely frustrating and expensive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered did not arrive. The customer service representative said they were working on it, but it never showed up. So I'm getting the feeling that the company is trying to cover up the fact that the unit is defective. I'm going to be returning the unit and getting a refund. The product is simply bad 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've lost three of the five units that I ordered. The first one gave me the "Bad Disc" message, the second one gave "Bad Unit" messages, and the third one gave a "Bad Recycler" message. I called the company, but they gave me a "Service Return Failed" message instead.  The "Bad" recycler messages keep coming. It's just not working.  I'm trying to return the units, but the recycling company keeps telling me that I have to return them at the same time.  It's taking too long to return my units. The "Good" recieschers give me a good one, but I get one bad one after another. The last bad one even gave me bad information about my order. It looks like the reciescher is using software from the wrong vendor or failing to return good ones. The only thing worse is the fact that the company keeps trying to charge me for shipping when they don't even want to accept my return. I've spent a lot of time and money on these units, and I just want them back. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Toshiba back to Toshiba, but after several failed attempts I finally gave up. I'm not getting the good reviews I expected, and the bad ones keep on coming. The only reason I'm giving up is because I can't return the unit. I tried calling Toshiba but never got a return phone call. I've tried contacting Toshiba's customer service, but I keep getting the same reply: "I am sorry, but the product you have requested cannot be returned."  I'm having a really hard time believing that Toshiba can't deliver on its advertised products. I paid over $400 for this product and I'm getting burned 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the unit on December 16, and it only took about 10 minutes to arrive.  The problem is that it won't turn on.  Not only that, but it won´t even recognize the hard drive. I´ve tried everything I can think of, and I'm still getting nothing. I have called both Amazon and the local computer store multiple times, and have even called back twice to try and get the unit working, but nothing. It's not the product itself, but rather the fact that I can´t get any of the information I need to get it working. I'm going to try to return the product, but if it won`t work, I won't bother returning the item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst electronic device I've ever purchased and  The Hub refuses to work. It is constantly giving the same message "The Hub is not working."  The other problem is that the Hub has been making strange noises and randomly rebooting. It has been three weeks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of the unit I received as advertised has ruined my good electronic devices. The unit I ordered on the day of purchase failed completely. I returned the unit, but have yet to receive my money back. It is now three days before I get my money. I'm using Amazon as usual, but so far, no luck.  I'm now returning the item, but I'm having a hard time returning the unit as advertised. The poor quality is also taking up two Usb ports instead of just one like advertised.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two of my three remotes blow up on me. I have replaced the remotes and even replaced the modem. I've called my ISP but the person I speak with on the phone tells me that they don't even know how to tell me that the modem has blown up.  I've burned many cables but never TEN!  The whole thing is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After three failed attempts to get my computer to work, I finally gave up and ordered a new one. It took four days to arrive, and I had to return it because the failure rate was unacceptable.  This is not acceptable.  I have spent a lot of time and money on my computer, and now I'm out of luck.  It's the equivalent of getting a bad computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took me two days to get my order, and I was charged $25 extra because the company said the order had been lost.  The customer service agent told me that I needed to call back to speak to a supervisor, but I never got the chance.  I called and got a busy signal.  This is supposed to be a good electronic device, but not this time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This failed to work on my system. I returned to the store only to find the device had been replaced and I had to pay the rest of the bill. I have returned 3 other times now and the same thing happens. This is a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem with this unit is that it takes 2-3 hours to complete a single boot. The entire process takes about 4 hours. The unit also refuses to boot at all and is making a "Bad Disc" error. It also takes 10+ minutes to read a good book, or even a bad one. The worst part is that there's no real way to get a replacement/refund.  I've tried calling TEN and TEN's customer service but their machines always have problems. The only thing that seems to work is sending the unit back to Amazon but that doesn't seem to work either. I'm getting the feeling that TEN is trying to pass the buck but they're failing at that too

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated $50 because the system doesn't work. I tried calling customer service but no one picks up. It's been over 3 weeks since I've tried calling the customer service number and still no one's picked up.  The company's representatives are all out of the office. This is unacceptable and I'm going to be canceling my order and returning my money. I've replaced my hard drive but it won't work anymore.  I'm very frustrated and frustrated by this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received last week was completely useless.  The entire unit simply would not work. The video player would stop working. The printer would stop printing. The modem would not connect.  I called TELUS and they sent me a new unit but the problem was the same. I am going to return the unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This failed within two days. The serial number was not recognized. The system locked up. I called and was told it was a bad card. I also received a $25.00 return fee. I tried several times but each time the card is not recognized and the system locks up. The customer service department is extremely unhelpful. I have returned three times to return the defective unit. The fourth attempt resulted in the same thing. This is unacceptable. The product should have never been released in the first place. The company should have known better. I am going to return my defective product and I will never buy a Panasonic product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just burned my good computer and replaced it with the bad one. The poor quality of the product is unacceptable. I'm going to return the item and buy a new one. I've burned several good brands but never Memorex. I hope my bad luck continues. I hate returning products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received my defective product. I ordered online on Saturday, but when I got the shipment, the DVD player did not work. The unit even got lost in the mail. I called Amazon to report the problem and was told the same day the problem was being looked into. Today, I got another call saying the problem had been resolved, but the player still did not play the movie. The cost for replacing the unit is ridiculous and I will not buy from Amazon ever again. I have already sent the unit back three times because the player refuses to work. It's now just a waste of time and money. I've burned many good CDs, but I'm going to be switching to burning my own music.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these units online and they were defective. I received my order and they sent me a return label but it never arrived. The return shipping label has been sitting at my house since December. I called them and they said that my package had been lost. I have called Amazon twice and they've never returned my calls.  I'm really fed up with having to call them and being lied to. I'm calling my local store right now and trying to get them to refund my money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the second time I have had to return a defective unit. The first one was because of poor customer service.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my computer and other devices fail multiple times with the same failure. This time it was my modem that failed.  I bought this to replace my Belkin but I'm still getting the same result    I've been trying to contact  but no luck. I'm also returning the entire product and waiting for a replacement to arrive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered online but the email said it had not been received. The email also said that the order was cancelled.  I called the company but never got a return phone call or a follow up email. I'm calling back now but it says the phone is out of service. I have called and emailed them numerous times but have gotten no response.  The last time I called they said the issue was resolved but they never got the email or the phone back. I've tried all the usual troubleshooting steps and they always say it's "out of service" or "invalid."  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the third time I have returned my computer due to failure. I am currently being told that the company has sent out a new unit but has not received the email yet. The second time they sent out the replacement unit, it took about 10 days. The third time they send out the new unit and I am still waiting. I'm giving up on returning the computer. The only reason I'm even getting the replacement is because they send me the old one. I've called the company several times and they tell me that the new one is being held up by the post office. I also have to pay to have the postman deliver the new replacement.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the product on time, but I am very disappointed in the fact that my unit failed. I have burned many times and this is the first time that a bad unit has failed. The company says it will replace the unit but I'm not so sure.  I have already spent a lot of time on the phone with the company trying to get a replacement but they say that the units are only making it a couple days.  The cost of this is unacceptable to me
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The entire unit died within a week of purchase. The only reason it didn't die sooner is because I plugged it back in. So I am going to send the company a letter about the poor quality of their products, but I won't buy another one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have spent at least 20 bucks on three units and each one has failed. I have returned three times to return this item. I've returned twice and both times it's the same thing. The return fee is supposed to be the third time the charm fails. I am out $40 on three returns. This product just isn't worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player would occasionally give "Bad Disc" errors or give "Unreadable Disc" error messages. The problem is that the player repeatedly gives the same message, "Bad disc, bad player." I have burned many good books, but I am not buying these bad ones. This is costing me at least $10 each time I have to return a bad book.  I am returning the unit and returning my money but I want my money back!  The cost to repair and return the unit is unacceptable. The only way to get my money is to return the entire unit and pay a $30 return fee.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought two units from Amazon. The first one worked perfectly until the second failed after a week.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received showed no sign of working and I'm having to return it. I'm on my third return now and I just gave up on returning the unit.  The customer service rep is not helping or answering any of my calls and emails. It's not just my unit, either. It seems like everyone else's unit is having the same problems as mine. I have called and emailed T-Mobile but have received no response. It appears T-Mo is trying to cover up the problem by sending me a new unit but there's no way they can keep sending out bad units. I just give up on ever getting my defective unit. This company is a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has taken three days for my Kingston 256MB SD card to finally work.

The product itself is garbage and the customer service doesn't help at all.

I'm going to try to get my money back but I'm not holding my breath.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have wasted a lot of time on this.  I've bought two of these units and received one that was defective. The other one was just as bad.  It took a month to get my third one.  The only good thing is that I have to replace my system so I have spent a lot more on replacement units than I should. I'm going to try and get my money back but I'm not sure I can. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated $80 on my credit card after spending $40 on a defective unit. The DVD player stopped working right after the initial purchase and I had to return the unit. I'm so angry I'm returning my whole purchase. The company is refusing to take responsibility or even acknowledge the problem.  I paid good money for a good electronic device and I'm getting burned.  It's ridiculous and I just want my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the electronic device but never got the one I ordered. The device came in the mail yesterday but I have not received it. It's been more than a week. The only thing I get is a "Bad Electronic Device." The customer service rep told me to contact Amazon and they said they were sending me a new one but have never sent it. I'm now stuck with the original. This is beyond bad  I am so frustrated and upset

It's taking too long to get a good burn and I'm burning with bad quality. The whole thing smells bad too.  The whole system has a bad smell to it.

The first one I got two replacements, the second one I just got one.  I'm going to try my luck with a different brand of SD card but I'm not holding my breath.  The fact that they only give you two replacements and they don't offer a free replacement makes me want to throw the thing out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been paying $90 a month for two months to get my system back, but after two failed attempts I just gave up. I got a good return on my investment, but then I get a bad one every two attempts. The poor customer service from T-Mobile has ruined my trust in their products. The last time I tried returning my unit the person at the T-mobile office told me I had to pay $100 before I got my system. Well, guess what? I've still got the original bill, but they won't even give me a credit for it. I've even sent them a negative feedback about poor customer support and poor service  I'm not even getting my money back. I'm using my credit card to pay for my next month's bill, so I just give up on T-Mo. It's not worth the bother anymore

I've returned two units now, and both have failed. I just gave up on returning the third one. I'll just give up on my trust in Tivo and their brand. I am giving up on buying any Tivo products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After a week of having the unit break, I have been sent a new one but it takes 2 weeks to ship. The unit that breaks every week is always the one that takes 2 days to ship but other times it's the one with the bad electronic system. The company doesn't seem to care about the bad units. It's only a matter of time before the unit breaks.  I'm giving up on buying this company 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using my computer and my phone for a month now, but the only thing that has worked is the one I just gave up on. I have burned many different types of media, but this is the first time I have given up on a bad one. The unit just keeps giving "Bad Disc" errors. The warranty is worthless.  I've tried sending my own defective units back to Amazon, but I have gotten the same "Bad disc" errors every time.

It's not worth the risk for me to try and return my defective unit.

I have called and left messages, but have gotten nothing. It's been almost 4 days now, and I still haven't gotten my order.  I've tried to return the unit, but they refuse to accept the return.  The problem is that I'm going to have to spend money on a new unit, and that's just not right.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working about a month ago. I'm returning it because I've had the same problem. The system won't even recognize the unit as being plugged in. I've tried everything I can to get it to work, but it just gives up and gives up on trying to work.  I've returned my entire unit, and even spent money on another brand because I can't get it working.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole unit burned good, but the failed the second time   The unit had to be thrown out

It's not the original seller's fault, but I won't buy it ever again.  I'm just wasting my time.

This time it's worse than usual.

It's becoming frustrating.  Hopefully my unit will just burn good, but I'm not holding my breath.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got the wrong end of the bad electronic stick. I ordered the wrong one. It was supposed to arrive in 4 days, and it's now been 3 weeks and I still haven't gotten it. I have called and emailed numerous times but have gotten no response. The company has even said that the wrong order has been sent and that they will send it. The good news is that I have a new one in the mail, but that's still a bad return on my money.  I'm going to be returning my unit and never buying another one from this company ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem with this is that there's always the possibility of losing your phone.  It takes forever to recover a lost phone, especially if it's in use.  The price is also a big negative to me, especially since I've bought many new products and returned them many times, but I can't seem to get a good electronic device to work.  I'm using my computer and phone to try and get it to work, but it's just not working. I have a new phone coming in the mail, but that won't be a replacement if this doesn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been using my computer for a while now, and each time the unit just stops working. It takes forever to get the thing working.  I'm currently waiting on my cable to be returned to the store.  The fact that I have to call and talk to customer service to get a replacement is ridiculous.  It's almost like I'm using a bad computer.  If I had a good computer I wouldn't need to call customer service.  This is the new computer you get if you order online and pay by credit card, but this time the worst part is that the unit won't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have spent over $400 on three different units (two of which were defective), and now I have lost my entire data. I have sent back all three units, but have not received a single one.  The only thing I got was a bad receipt and a $10 refund. I'm now down to my last two units, and my only option is to buy new ones.  I'm going to try returning them myself, but if I have to, I'm throwing away the return as well.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working after two tries. I called Amazon to complain, and they said that I needed to return the item. The return deadline is on the 9th. I'm going to try to return it the same day, but I'm having a hard time getting the unit to work. I have burned several good burns, but each one has been unsuccessful. I just wated a good 25 bucks because I've burned three bad ones in a row. I've tried returning the unit, but to no avail. I was able to get my money back last week, but now it's lost.

The fourth one failed after two months. The fifth one, which I just ordered, is supposed to be the one that works. The one that finally gave up on the fifth failed.  The only thing I got from my company is the fact that the fifth one is going to take about a month to get to me.  It's going to be at least two more months before I get my money back. The whole thing is a total rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered online but never received a tracking number or the order. The DVD player and other parts don't work. The store manager told me that my order had been rejected because I didn't have a receipt. It's been three days now, and I've gotten no response from Amazon. I called several times but got the same response. I've already paid for this item, but I won't buy from Amazon ever again. I'm going to try to return my purchase but I'm not sure if I'll ever get a response. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole unit has burned good, but the bad unit just gives me the feeling that the whole thing is going to fail at some point. I've tried a few times, but every time the unit burns good, I get the feeling it's going to burn bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software failed and the unit gave out on me. The only thing worse than the failure is having to wait 2 weeks for a replacement. I'm out about $500 on replacement fees. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received had the power cord ripped off and a bunch of bad electronic devices. The unit also had a bad modem and no Internet. It was sent back and forth twice but still no Internet service. I called the company to complain and was told that they'd send a new one out today. The second time it came back the same day.  I just gave up on getting my money back.  So I just threw it all away 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been paying for this terrible electronic device every month because the software update just never gets installed. Every time I return to Amazon, I get a message that the update is "invalid" and the item will be returned to the customer. I'm returning my credit card and waiting for a refund, but I'm only getting 2/3 of the money back. I am returning my entire order because the product just doesn't work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit has given me two "Bad Units" in a row.  I received a defective unit and the "Amazon" return label that came with the defective unit was NOT what I ordered. The unit I received only had the "Good" label and the return label (but not the original return label). I returned the defective item and am waiting on a new unit to arrive. This is unacceptable and I will not buy from Amazon ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've been using my Wired/Ethernet card as usual but it keeps failing. The card reader keeps rejecting my card but the other side keeps coming up "Bad Issuer" and "Bad/Unknown/Unreadable". I've tried the hard drive and power cord but the failure rate is too high to continue. I've already wasted a good 30 dollars on this failure. The fact that this is happening twice a week is very worrisome.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned the DVD player and the unit said "Bad Disc". I used a new one, but it still won't play. I'm using a different brand and model, but I'm getting the same results.  I've tried everything I can think of to get the unit working, but nothing works. I've returned the unit, but so far nothing has worked. The unit even won't turn on. I tried to use my computer, but my hard drive won't recognize the drive. I don't want to spend the money on a new unit, so I'm going to throw out my brand new unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I just returned from Amazon was defective. The DVD player would not play, and the printer would not print.

I called the company and they said that they would send a new unit but I have received no communication since. I called back today and they are still saying that the unit won't arrive.  It's been three days and they still haven't sent a replacement. I'm now wondering if they are going to let the unit burn 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been experiencing the same problems with my Kingston 256MB SD card that I have with other Kingston products.

I have burned my own personal data to the DVD but I have also burned many other things including the hard drive, but I get the same results.  I've tried returning my unit but I just get the "Bad Disc" error every time. I'm at my wit's end and the warranty is void 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and slow performance have lead to numerous failed attempts at repairing the unit.  I have called several computer repair shops, and they all say the same thing: The customer service rep who came out of the office the day after my unit failed is a complete failure. The unit was sent back, but the damage was so severe that it took two days to even get the unit back in working order.  The company's failure to even acknowledge the issue is a total rip-off. I've even called the customer service hotline and asked for the return authorization number, but they won't give it to me. I have yet to receive my product, which is supposed to be my first attempt at fixing the problem. I'm calling my credit card company to complain.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've tried to get my money back twice now on two separate purchases. The first one was on Amazon and the second one on Best Buy. I've gotten two total refunds, but I still have the same problem. The unit was defective and I just can't seem to get the thing working.  The shipping charges are going to keep coming even after I get the money back, so I'm going to try and return the system myself. I have a few more returns pending now, but the second time it's a lost cause.  I'm getting my money refunded twice but the returns will never come. The only thing that works is going out to Best Buy to try to return the unit myself, but they won't take it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have lost or destroyed three of the four units I ordered, which I've paid for. The other two failed to arrive. The first one even had the packaging damaged.  I've ordered from Amazon, but never from this company. It's like the Amazon store is intentionally sending bad products to customers.  It's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I returned my Sony product in less than a week and the unit was completely dead. I called Sony and they said it was a bad unit and would take 7 days to get a new one. Well, I just got a new unit in the mail. It takes less than 24 hours to completely fail. The unit never gets more than 3/4 of the way to boot up. The fact that the unit never comes to a full turn on is unacceptable. I'm returning the unit and getting a new, but I'm not buying Sony ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have wasted a good 40 bucks on two failed units. They both blew up within two days of getting my order. I've had to call and return the unit multiple times. The failure rate is unacceptable. The company claims to be able to fix the unit, but they never do.  The company should be ashamed of themselves and should be paying the cost of the failed units

I'm now paying $80 for a broken electronic device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered arrived 2 days late and I have had to return it twice. The second time I got the package back but it was damaged.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered on Friday and received the wrong electronic device on Monday. I called customer service and they said that the device was being shipped on Tuesday, but I have received nothing yet.  The company representative I spoke with said the delivery person told her that the order was in the mail, but the device never showed up.  I've been trying to contact Amazon, but every time I get an automated message saying the order has been canceled. I'm really frustrated and I'm going to return my unit, but not a single one of the seven attempts I've made has resulted in the return of the unit.  It's ridiculous that Amazon is charging me for something that I'm supposed to get. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my unit three times because the unit would not boot. I tried resetting it, but every time the device would not come up.

The bad part is that it's taking days and days to get a response from T-Mo.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 2 days of use the power button keeps going bad. It's been going bad since the day I got it.  This is the third time this has happened, and I have returned my unit.  The only good thing about this is the fact that I'm out the cost of replacing it, but it's just another 2 cents.

I ordered on Tuesday and received my unit the next day.  My order status has been "in transit" since Friday.

It's been three days and my order still hasn't been delivered.  Hopefully they can deliver by the original date but if not then I'm going to have to throw out my entire order.

It's been over a month now and the only thing I get is that the player is "Bad Disc." I tried replacing the player but to no avail.

The last time it worked, but then the computer failed a few days later.  The last thing I want to do is lose my work because I'm out of commission.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have burned two different hard drives and both have failed. The fourth one has already failed. This is costing me a good $400. The product was supposed to be a 5-year warranty. This has turned into a 5 year nightmare. The company is no longer taking the time to fulfill the warranty. The other bad news is the cost for replacements is now running about $20/drive. I just returned my computer and burned another one.

It's been two weeks now and the "Good" units have yet to ship. I've called and emailed them multiple times but have gotten the same response. The company has been slow to respond, and it's making me very unhappy. I'm returning the units and buying new ones from another retailer. It seems like I'm going to have to buy my own new equipment. I don't recommend this product at all. I had my money wasted 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been trying to figure out what the heck happened to my Kingston 256MB SD card.  The card came as expected, but every time I plug it in, I get the error message: "Bad SD card". I've used two different SD cards, both from the same manufacturer. The first one worked fine, but the second one gave the same error message. It's as if the card's "brick" has burned itself into the system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After using my new Toshiba I used the included DVD burner to burn my copy of the "What's the Best Electronic Device  " book but now I'm getting the following message: "Bad Disc, Bad Media. The unit failed the initial burn attempt. This is the second time the unit has failed, but I have already thrown it out.

I have burned many good books, but the fact  that this product  will  give me bad results  is very  disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought several of these units, but each one has been defective. I have called Amazon multiple times, and the customer service rep always tells me the same thing: "I'm sorry, but we don't have the device in stock right now. We're working on it, but it's taking a lot longer than we expected." The unit I get is never "on time" or "in stock." The worst part is that I have wasted several hundred dollars on these units. I'm very frustrated with these products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The failure rate on this bad electronic gadget is unacceptable. The fact that it's taking 2 days to receive my replacement is unacceptable too.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just returned my Kingston 256MB SD card and received a "Bad Media" error. The card came as advertised and the only problem is that I have returned three of the four cards in the mail. The company is charging me for the replacement card but I just want my money back.  The company claims that the "Bad media" error is a normal occurrence but I'm not buying it. I've returned my three other cards, but each one has come back "BadMedia." I'm thinking the return policy is fraudulent or the cards are defective.  It's not the first time I've returned a bad product but it's the first one I'm canceling.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using my Kingston 256MB SD card for about a month now and it's still failing.  The last time I used the card, it worked fine, but now the card is showing "Bad Disk" errors. I'm using another brand of SD card, but this one is also failing. The last 3 failed cards have all been the same brand. It's not just the same failure rate; it's getting worse.  I'm not even sure the problem is the card failing. It just seems like it's failing more often than usual. I've returned my computer and  I've tried using another SD card (I've even used the same one as a spare), but it's the same story. The card is bad, and I'm going to return my Kingston card and get a new one, but it won't work.  So I'm giving up on my Kingston product

It's time to replace the entire unit. The company should be ashamed of themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio don't work, and the other functions are unstable. I have replaced my original unit, but the same problem occurs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my unit and had to pay $45 to get it replaced. The replacement unit came in the mail two days later and I'm having a bad time getting it to work.

It's a complete rip-off and the fact that I have to pay for it just goes to show that it's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I received the electronic device about a month after I ordered it. The DVD player stopped working. The other three computers (two of which I ordered from Amazon) also stopped working, and now I am out of luck. The entire thing is defective. I am returning my unit and asking for a refund.  The company said they would replace it, but I still have not received it. I have called several times, but the reps just say "I'm sorry, we cannot replace your device. It is currently out of stock." I have even sent my mail twice and been told "We have no stock on this item." The cost is beyond infuriating.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've bought these three units now. Each one has failed to work. The unit that finally worked finally burned good but failed to boot up. I have called Amazon three times now but I've received the same answer every time: They don't have any more stock. This is unacceptable! I'm returning my order now and buying from another online retailer. I'm giving up on returning my products. I don't trust Amazon at all and now I won't buy anything from them. The quality of the products is always substandard, so I'm out.

The third time, the unit failed completely. It took me two days to return it, but the shipping company never sent me a replacement. The company said the problem was "under investigation." So, I guess I'm out of luck. The other two units I returned also failed, but this time the unit got a "good" rating from the mail carrier. I'm sure the company is aware of the problems with their products, but at least they're replacing the units

The other ones work but this one keeps giving me the bad disc error. I'm wasting my time and money on this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $150 on my Apple computer because the unit refused to boot. The only way I got it to work was by repeatedly rebooting the system. After the third failed attempt, I just gave up and gave up on returning the system or replacing it.  I've spent hundreds on Apple products, but never Memorex.  Now I'm going to have to wait until my warranty expires to get my money back.  The only good thing about this is I got my money's worth with the Memorexes, but at a huge cost to me.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has failed twice now. It takes 2-3 days to replace the bad one, and then another 2-5 days to get the good one. It's extremely expensive and useless. It took me two months of shopping at CompUSA and a return of a bad unit to finally get my money back. The good one is defective, so I'm out the full cost. I'm also paying for the return shipping because the bad unit was returned damaged.  It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just received my order but the return mail has not even started to arrive. I have called and emailed the company twice and they say they have lost the package. So far, I have received nothing. The company won't even acknowledge the loss. This is ridiculous! I have already spent over $100 and wasted a good 30 minutes of my life on a bad computer.  I just want my money back and I won't waste any more time on a defective item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product came defective and failed. The unit was returned to the store but the electronic device was not. The customer service rep said the "UPS" system did not work. This is not the case. The U.S. Postal Service has been very good to me but I'm going to give them the bum's rush on this one.  The fact that they will not honor their returns is unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors on my system.  Every few days, the player gives a "Bad Read" error. The player just gives up on playing a good movie and giving up on my hard drive.  The company claims that the players are defective but the players themselves are completely useless.  I've returned two units in as many weeks.  This is the third defective unit I've received in as much as three weeks. The other two players have also given up on making a good play. I have returned two of my three purchases at this company and have been burned twice by other companies. I'm fed up with having to throw away my good DVD player every few months. I've burned many, many different brands and models of players but never with these players. I hope that this one doesn't last but  I don't expect it to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of the unit has made it impossible to use. I have called Tivo, but have yet to receive a response. The problem has been going on for a couple of months now, and I've tried everything I can think of to get it fixed. Tivo is supposed to be the last company to lose their cool, but I'm not holding my breath.  I'm going to return the unit, but if the new one is defective, I won't be buying it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player won't work. I tried everything I could think of and even tried my luck on Amazon but to no avail. The unit I ordered online finally arrived but when I opened the package I found that the power cord was broken. I have bought and returned several defective products from Amazon but I've never been so unhappy with a good electronic device as I am with this one. I've tried returning the unit and calling the company but to date have been unable to get it to work.  The return policy says that if it doesn't work I have to pay for a new unit but I'm not buying another one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I ordered online and it took 4 days to ship. The package arrived the next day and the unit came with the usual problems. The unit never worked. The customer service representative told me that the serial number had been deactivated but it was impossible to get the software to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered two units (one for my house and one for my work computer) and they were both rejected by Amazon. The problem? The unit that was supposed to be delivered on time, arrived 3 days after I ordered. The one that was scheduled to be here two days ago has still not arrived. The only thing worse than not getting the product is the time wasted on this. The return policy is pretty much non-existent.  I have been returning the unit at least every two weeks now. The last time it was returned I had to call Amazon and get another unit. The whole process takes at least two days. I am just done returning my unit

I have called the manufacturer several times, but to no avail.  I have burned a few different types of disks and tried my luck with other brands, but have had the same results. The only thing I get is the message "Bad disc, bad reading."  I am going to return the unit, but I am only giving it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that the unit I just sent back for repair took 3 days to arrive shows how badly defective the unit is. I have burned many new Toshiba products but never Toshiba. The unit I received was defective and never came.

The price point is just ridiculous 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had three failures in a row with this device. The first one came within 2 days of getting the unit. The second one came two days after that and the third one came 2 days after the first two. I am calling T-Mobile because the second time T-Mo said the order would be "delivered in 5-7 business days". The third time I got the order, it said it was "on backorder" and it never showed up. This is just unacceptable.  I'm returning the unit, but I'm going to return it with no return date.  It's not worth the money.

I am returning this unit and won't be buying a new one.  The company that provided the unit is failing to deliver. I have already paid for two units and have no idea when the third one will be delivered. I will be writing a negative rating about a poor electronic device that I will never buy or rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated thousands of dollars because my Kingston 256MB SD card gave up the ghost. The only thing worse is having to return my own computer because the same thing happens every time. The company that makes these products should be ashamed of themselves.

I've spent more money on returning products than I have on my computer.

The replacement still doesn't work. I've returned it twice now, and the third time I get the same bad rep. I'm giving up on buying from this company. I can't even get a hold of the company to complain about a faulty product. It's as if they don't even care about the product
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated 2.5 months of my paycheck because my unit just stopped working. I tried calling, emailing, and even writing a positive review about something good:  My unit finally turned on, but after 10 failed attempts I just gave up and returned it.  I tried using a different brand, but that's not working either. I'm currently having trouble with my internet, so I'm going to have to call my internet provider and see if they can fix the problem.  This company is a complete rip-off and I'm giving up on buying anything from them ever.

The second time, the card wouldn't work at all. The third time, I got the feeling that the bad card was going to blow up. I have tried all of the card brands and models but none of them work. The new Kingston card has given me the same results. It has burned good but it's taking forever to boot.  I'm going to try my luck at returning the card but I'm having trouble getting the card to work at the moment. I'm using my luck card for a good electronic device but it won't last.   It's not worth the money

The customer service rep I talk to has no idea what the problem is, but she insists that the units are defective.I've tried everything I can to get them to fix the problem, but every time I'm told that it's out of their hands. I'm extremely disappointed with this experience and have returned all three units.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working about a month ago, and my other electronic devices (TV and radio) have also failed. The only thing I get is a bad return email from Kingston. I have called them numerous times, and each time they tell me to try another brand. This time, the system is "temporarily out of service" and will be replaced by January 30. No one has replaced my system. I'm calling my local store right now to report that they won't be able to replace the unit because the "temporary" part of the system has failed. This is not the first time I've had this problem, but it's the last. I've burned many discs, but never Memorex.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated a good 30 bucks because I returned my new unit because the unit wouldn't turn on.  The seller (name not provided) claims the unit will turn on, but it won't. I have had my units fail before, so I know the problem isn't with the unit but with the computer. It's as if the computer won't turn off when the power cord is plugged in. I've tried resetting my BIOS and everything seems to be fine. I'm using my old unit, so the return cost for this one is a big hit to my wallet.

The other problems include the unit randomly stopping, locking up, and requiring a power cycle. It's becoming a huge expense for a poor electronic device.

I'm using a different T-mobile carrier but I'm not holding my breath.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've had this bad electronic item for 2 days now and it's still not working. I called T-Mobile but was told I needed to return the unit. I tried to return it twice and both times I was told the item is being held by T-Mo. The second time, I even called Tmo to report that the item had been returned and that the original item had never been returned. The poor quality of the product is unacceptable and the return process has been extremely difficult. I am paying for the original cost of the item twice but getting the product back twice is a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player stopped working on three separate occasions, and I just returned the unit to Amazon with the same results.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This has been a complete nightmare. The unit has failed at least four times in a row. I am calling AT&T now because I have already paid for two new units and I just don't have the money. It has been almost three weeks and I have yet to receive the unit. I have called AT& T three times now, but I have not gotten a return phone call. The last one I left a voicemail with a return number but I never got a return call. This is an absolute rip-off. I called AT & T to report this problem but have gotten no reply. I also tried to report it to Amazon but they have refused to help me. I was so frustrated I gave up on returning the product. I now have to return the whole unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took less than a week to completely fail. The first time the unit gave an error code "Bad disc", and then every time after that the unit gives the same error code.  The unit even burned fine, but the results are always "Bad Disc".  The product itself is also very expensive, and the fact that it doesn't work at all is ridiculous. I'm giving up on buying anything from these companies.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software constantly gives me the "Bad Disc" error. I've had three of these now, and I'm running out of time. I'm returning the unit, but not having any luck getting a replacement. I'll be buying a different brand, but I won't buy this brand ever again.  It's the worst electronic device I've ever used. I don't even want to use my computer.  The worst part is that the company won't even acknowledge it's making a mistake.   I've bought many products, but never this bad.  I'll never buy from this company ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $70 by getting the wrong part and paying for it with my own credit card. The DVD player works fine but the player has stopped working. It won't play anything. I have tried calling and sending a replacement but I keep getting "Bad Disc" messages.  I'm going to have to throw the whole thing out and buy a new player. This company is a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of the product has ruined my experience as well as that of all the other customers who have complained about poor electronic device performance.  After a week of attempting to resolve the issue, I have received a return authorization via the mail.  However, after three attempts to send the item back, I am now out of luck. The fact that I'm having to send back the item twice, and have been told I can't, is extremely frustrating. I've returned multiple products, but this is the first time I've ever gotten a rejection. The quality of my products is never good enough for this company.  I'm willing to try other products, so I'm going to return the system I paid for.  Hopefully the return policy will change, but until that time, I won't buy any more products from this company

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After three failed attempts, I finally gave up on getting my computer working. The company's customer service representatives have never responded to my calls, and I have sent multiple emails, but they still haven't received a response. They promised to send a replacement but have failed to do so. The other two failures have already damaged my credit rating, so I'm not giving them the time of day. The last time I tried calling customer service, the person who picked up the phone laughed at me. I'm now going to try my luck at buying online, but that's going to be a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After five days of trying to set up my new computer, I have finally given up on returning it. The unit finally gave up the ghost on me, so I just gave up on trying to get it to work.  The customer service representative I talked to was extremely unhelpful. I had to repeat my email address, and they refused to provide a new one. It's not as if I have bought defective merchandise, but I'm going to return my computer just to be able to get my money back.  I'm very disappointed with my electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working a few weeks ago. It would work for a few seconds, but after a few minutes, the player would give up. I called TELUS but the representative who answered the phone said that there was nothing they could do. The unit was returned and I am out a few hundred dollars. It's been almost three months and the unit still doesn't work. I have returned three different units so far and I have gotten the same results.  I have called T-Mobile twice and have received the same answers. I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience with T-Tel

The only thing that has worked so far is to try to get the original unit back, which has given up on trying to repair the unit. I have burned countless hours trying to get my defective unit to work, but every time I get the same results. It's a complete rip-off.  I'm giving up on my FCC license, which I paid for

I've called and sent multiple e-mails, but so far they've been unresponsive. This is a total rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've been through three different computer systems now, each one having the same problem. The second one failed, and the third one's just started randomly failing. The company has been trying to tell me that it's not my motherboard or memory, but my power cord that's bad.   I'm out hundreds of dollars because I bought the wrong thing. I've had to pay out of my own pocket for replacements, which have cost hundreds more. The only thing worse than buying a bad item is paying for a bad product.  It's beyond broken.

The company sent me a credit card chargeback for the full amount. I contacted the company and was told that the problem had been fixed, but I still haven't received my order. This is unacceptable. I am filing a formal complaint with my credit card company and hope that my issue will be resolved.

This is the third time I have returned a bad product, and I have wasted over $50 on three bad units 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got a defective item (the power strip) about three weeks ago. The unit came back as "Damaged" and "Bad Disc" but never actually works.  I've replaced the power strip twice but the same thing happens. I'm using my computer so much now that I'm having to buy new power strips just to get the one that came defective. It's time to return the unit and get a new one.  There's no way that I get three weeks worth of use out of the unit, and it's just costing me a lot of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received had a problem and it's taking forever to fix.  The company claims they can't give a good rating because of quality issues, but I'm getting the feeling they're intentionally making bad products.

I'm replacing my product, but I'm not sure if it's the problem. It's taking three tries to get the Good Disc message. I have burned many different types of media, but this is the first time I've burned bad. It has cost me more than I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The bad part is that it only takes about 5 minutes to give up on trying to get it to work. The good part is the fact that the company is trying to replace the unit, but so far the replacements have been unsuccessful.  I'm paying more than $60 a month for a product that doesn't work. I'm trying to return my item, but the new one won't work, so I'm out of luck.

The card still says "Bad SD card" but the rest of the info is blank. It's so bad I just gave up on returning the card.  I'm going to have to throw it out and buy a new one, which I'm sure will be even worse than the original. The worst part is that I've wasted over $200 on a card that won't even work.  The only thing worse than returning a bad product is paying for it
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just returned from a month-long period of un-reliability. The unit I received showed 2 out of 5 attempts to make the system work.

The cost of the repair and the total cost of my contract is now more than I made last month. I will never buy TEL US ever again.

The return shipping cost is the only reason I'm giving them the negative review, but that's about the only good thing about this unit. I have to use the unit three times now to get a working one. It's so bad, I'm having to return it.  So, if they don't have any more in stock, I won't buy anything else from them.

I've ordered from Amazon many times before, but never from this company.  The customer service is poor and the company is not making good products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The bad news is that the unit I received a couple of days ago has failed and is now useless.

The only thing that works is my power strip.  The product is defective.  I'm returning it and buying a new one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this at CompUSA because I needed it yesterday and it wasn't delivered. The company representative told me that the product had been sent, but the return address was not. I called the company, but no one would talk to me. It's been a month and still no return. This is the fourth time I've had to return this item. I finally gave up and bought another item on Amazon. This time, I'm buying from Amazon because I'm dissatisfied with my electronic device.  The problem is that the unit never comes. The people at the company are not interested in talking to anyone who has returned a defective item. It would be nice if they could replace the defective item with a new one, but I just don't see that happening.  I'm going to return the entire thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned to my computer only to find that my entire hard drive had failed. I have tried to return the unit several times but each time the unit gets burned good and then burns bad.   I have returned multiple units with different failure dates but it's the same thing over and over.  It's like someone is purposely trying to destroy my hard drive.  I'm returning my unit as soon as I get it.  If it's not my hard disk, it's my data!  I thought Memorex would have better luck with their products.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After two failed attempts at resetting the device, I just gave up on trying to get it to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my replacement unit about a week and a half late. It took about two weeks to get a response back from their support team about the issue.  The support person was apologetic, but said that it was "unable to fulfill the warranty" due to the unit being "non-functional." This is unacceptable. I have ordered a replacement and am still waiting.  I called the company and spoke to a manager. He said that he would call back, but that I needed to pay to get my product.   I just want my money back, or at least a refund for my trouble. I've spent over $300 on these units and I'm not getting the satisfaction that I payed for. I'm going to return the units and get my money refunded.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated thousands of dollars because I got a bad unit.

I've called Amazon numerous times and they've never sent me anything. I just want my money back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned from my local electronics store to find the unit I ordered for return. The unit had not arrived, and I called to ask the store manager. The manager told me that they would have to "send a replacement unit" out to me. When I got home and opened the mail, I found that the package was returned and that the original one was "defective". I called the company, and the representative I spoke with said that I would have a new one "in a few days". Well, that never happened. I called again, and was told that I have to call a different company to get the "repaired" one. The rep also said that "I have to order a new unit because they are out of stock". I have been using this company for years, and never had this happen before.  I am going to have to return my entire order, because I just can't trust this company. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I tried to connect to my computer, the unit said the BIOS was corrupted.

I have tried calling but haven't gotten any response. I've even called customer service but have gotten no response.  My next two units are being sent back

If it takes them 6 months to replace my unit, I'm going to be very unhappy with my purchase.

After the third failure, I just gave up. The only good thing about this device is that I was able to buy new ones, but I'm going to try other electronic devices before giving up on my luck. I'm using TEN's brand name, but the results are the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have bought 3 of these units now and the first one failed. The second one has the power cord and the DVD player but won't work. The third one has all the parts but won�t work.I have called customer service twice and the customer service rep on the third attempt refuses to do anything about the problem. I have burned a few good burns but now I'm on the hook for 3 more bad ones. The only reason I'm burning good is because the bad ones cost less.

The mail carrier said she had delivered the package to the wrong address. I called Amazon and the agent said that the computer system would not work. She said I needed to send it back. Well, I just got the bill for the return postage and she won't even give me a return label.  I'm getting angry and I'm going to give up on buying anything from Amazon now.   If it's a defective unit, Amazon should offer to replace it, but they won't.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio have both stopped working. I've tried everything to get them to work, but every time I give up and give up.

I'm using the new player that came with my purchase, but it's still giving up.

The only thing I get is that the "Bad Disc" error is popping up.  It takes me at least 30 tries to get a good boot.  I'm giving up on trying to get my unit to work, and returning the unit to Amazon.  The return cost is more than what I paid for the unit

I had to return the entire computer. The company claims that it is "temporarily out of stock" but the system itself is useless. I've tried returning the system twice and it has been "temporary out of order."  It won't even boot up to check the mail! I've sent the company several emails, but they keep giving the same excuse. I'm going to give up on returning my system and buying another one, but I just can't recommend it.

It's a total rip-off.

The poor quality of their products is unacceptable

I'm throwing away my paper and returning to the store for a new one. I have a new model on order but it won't be here before the new one fails again. I burned my bad luck to the trashcan.  It's a complete rip-off and I'm giving up on buying new printers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just spent about $200 on a bad product that I'm not going to get back. The unit I received did not work and I called customer service. The rep told me to try a different brand but I'm going to be returning my product.  I was also told that the new one they sent to me wouldn't work and would have to be returned. The only thing worse than being charged twice for the same item is getting your money back.

I have called several times and called them back, but I keep getting disconnected. The unit has been sent back and forth 3 times, but they have yet to send me the replacement. I just want my money back. I paid over $150 for this electronic device, and now I'm getting nothing?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have lost my computer three times now due to the poor quality of the unit. I have sent my unit back three times and received the same response: "The product has been returned to us for repair. We're sorry but the device can't be fixed." I have also sent it back three more times. I am currently being charged for the defective unit but I have yet to receive my money. I'm just giving up on returning the product. The other day I was told by another repair company that I have to pay the full amount to get a replacement. I've already spent $150 on three failed returns. I'll probably end up buying a new computer just to get my money back. The only good thing about this is that I've been burned three times already, but I'm going to try my luck. I don't recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 5 failed attempts at returning my unit, I finally gave up and returned it. The return label was returned but the return date was missed. The item was supposed to be returned by the 2nd day of the return period but I've been waiting for 2 weeks.  It's taking me 2 weeks to even get a return receipt because I have to go to the post office. It's been almost a month and I'm still waiting for my product to be delivered.  The return office is super slow, so I'm going to have to pay the return shipping fee to get my money back.  I've tried calling but have been ignored. The customer service reps have also been very unhelpful.

I'm replacing my unit, but I'm going to be keeping my negative review to myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This electronic device gave me the impression that I should be able to get it fixed easily, but I have been unable to get a replacement. I have called and emailed numerous times, but have been sent the same message over and over. The company has even suggested that I return my unit, but that's a deal breaker to me.  The product should be fixed immediately, but it seems as though it won't happen. I've been burned before, but this is the worst

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It failed within a few days of purchase. I called and got the manager at the store to say that she was having the same problem. It just cost me more than a month's rent. I returned the unit but the failure rate is unacceptable. The company has promised to replace the unit, but I'm still waiting. I'm going to buy another unit, just to be sure, but that will cost me even more money. The customer service rep said that they couldn't do anything about it, but they're going to replace it anyway. I just want to throw up my hands and give up on ever getting my money back.  I just spent $200 on a good electronic device, and now it's all gone.

I tried to get it to work but it just gives me a bad report about the failure.  I have called the company numerous times but they say they can't help me.   I'm on a month's vacation and just want to be able to use my computer.  The fact that the company doesn't want to help me is unacceptable. I'm returning my unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs I burned good, but the good burns keep giving bad burns   I'm using different brands of media but the same results.  The last good one gave me bad burns and I'm buying different brands to try and get the bad ones to quit.

The product has been returned three more times, but has failed. I'm stuck with the cost of a new one and I'm getting fed up with waiting. The return process is so expensive that I'm considering just giving up on ever getting a new unit. I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. I've returned three other Kingston harddrives, but every one has failed as well. The failure rate is unacceptable. I'll be returning my Kingston and returning my Mastercard as well

I'm also very dissatisfied with the cost of returning defective products. It's costing me a lot of money to return defective products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This bad electronic item has caused me several times to lose my computer and other electronics. The problem is that the unit just gives the wrong serial number, and I have to return it. The other electronic devices work fine, but the serial number for this one keeps getting lost. This has resulted in at least two return charges.   I have burned my own personal information onto my own bad electronic equipment, and then it gets destroyed. I'm buying new equipment, but I'm not going to buy from this company ever again. I have wasted at least $200 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return my DVD player, which had just failed. I tried everything possible to get the problem solved but to no avail. I am paying $100 a month just to have a bad unit.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on other items  but now I am just looking at other options to replace my unit. I have even called the company and the customer service rep told me that I have to return the unit. The customer service representative also stated that there was a "bad power strip" that caused the failure.  This is complete and utter BS.  It is beyond time for a company to recognize their mistakes and put a stop to the bad sales. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I plugged in my Kingston 256MB SD card and the unit wouldn't recognize it. I called the company and the person who answered the phone said that my card was bad. I'm returning the unit and I'm never buying from them ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took 3 days to get my unit. It also took 4 days to receive the software.  I've sent 3 times and each time I get the same email saying the software is not available. I'm having problems with my modem and have called Verizon multiple times, but the representative that I talk to always says the software isn't available.  The only thing worse than having to wait 3 days for a replacement is having to pay for the item, only to find out you've been charged for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player won't work, the modem won't connect to the router, the printer won't accept a fax, and the network connection never works.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had my original two units of this unit fail within 24 hours. I had to call and email both T-Mobile and Amazon about the issue, but I'm still waiting for a replacement unit. I've already spent at least $20 on other replacements, but still haven't received anything. I'm very dissatisfied with T-mobile. I bought the Tmobile Xpresscard and had my $10 back. But now they want to charge me for a defective product? It's not working and I have to call T-mall for a free replacement? I have burned many T-Malls and have never had any problems.  It's bad enough that I have my whole house burning down because the power strip won't turn on.  T-trends don't sell well in my book

The fact that the product came back as "Bad Disk" is very disappointing and the fact that it's taking three or four days to return the unit is inexcusable. I'm calling to complain and I'm also writing a negative negative review on a bad device: I bought this product online, but it failed. I called customer service, but they won't even return the item. The return label says "Bad disk," which is not even accurate. It's the worst

It's been almost two weeks and still no reply. The customer service rep has been very rude and unhelpful. The worst part is that it's not even the right unit that's defective. I'm returning the unit and hoping that I get a better one.

The company says that it's working on it but after two days I get the same message. I'm using my credit card but not getting any response.  I'm giving up on returning the unit. It's been less than two days and I'm still waiting for a response. If this continues I'm going to get burned 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality and poor performance on my unit has caused me to return it and pay for a new one. The DVD player does not work and there is constant buzzing. It takes more than 5 minutes to boot up and every time the unit reboots, the unit takes a second to come up.  The customer service rep that sent me the defective unit has not returned my call or responded to my e-mail.  I have returned the unit 3 times now and have been told that I have to pay for another unit. I'm frustrated and won't return the unit until I get what I paid for.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my order on October 16, but since then the unit has not shipped.

I've lost hundreds of dollars

It's been less than 2 weeks, and I've lost at least three units. I'm going to call them in to replace them, but I'm not going to pay the $80 for a new one. It seems like a rip-off at any cost point.  I have my unit's serial number, but the other two units won't boot up.  The company should be held responsible for these poor products, but at the end of the day, I'm out the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been buying from Amazon but so far all of my products have failed. The problem is the unit has failed to boot.

It's now been a month and I still haven't gotten a replacement. I've burned the unit twice, but the power has still never come on. I'm paying extra for something that never works

I've already sent a couple of emails to the manufacturer but I'm getting the feeling that the customer service isn't that good. I'm very dissatisfied 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole thing just died on me. The power button won't work. I have tried every single reset, but it won't ever work.  I have burned my own personal data and returned multiple times to return my own unit, but the same thing keeps happening. I'm throwing the entire unit in the trash.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about a hundred bucks because of a bad failure. The unit I bought failed completely  When I tried to get a replacement, I was told it was out of stock.  The company also told me I needed to pay for the replacement myself.  I am extremely dissatisfied with the experience and have given up on buying from this company.  It's not worth the money
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received from Amazon arrived the wrong day. The packaging was torn, the DVD player wouldn't work and the phone itself was useless. The company said I had to return the unit, but after I paid the return shipping cost and the rest of the cost of the return I still haven't received the unit. The customer service agent said the return was being held because the return address wasn't valid.  I'm now wondering if I'm going to get my money back or be stuck with the product. I have to get a new phone because the one I get from Amazon won't work.  If the return policy is changed to not accept returns on faulty goods, I won't buy anymore products from Amazon.  The customer support is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been returning my Apple product every month or two for the last 6 or 7 months because the unit has always been defective. The unit I just returned from Best Buy has a blue LED light on and doesn't boot.  I've replaced the motherboard, but now the unit won't boot and I get a bad "Bad Disc" error message. The last two units I've returned from Apple have failed as well. I've tried my hardest to return them, but they just won't work. I'm wasting my time returning them, and I'm paying a lot of money for that.   It's a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been having problems with my modem. The first one started out with a dead computer. I called TELUS, and they said the modem was dead. I sent them an email saying it wasn't, but the second one came dead as well. The third one didn't work at all. I've tried the reset and nothing. I just want to return the unit, but I just can't seem to get it to work. The poor quality is unacceptable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's taking days and even weeks to get the email/virus/software package. This is not a good electronic device. The seller has given no response to my messages. It's almost as if they don't want me to return the product. I'm returning the unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I've tried three different kinds of replacement units and each time the failure rate is unacceptable. The last one was a total failure. I had to throw it away and get a new one. I am returning the item because it is so difficult to get my system to work.  It's the equivalent of getting a bad electrical appliance: Unusable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The whole experience has been a total nightmare. I have had multiple units fail and I've paid tons of money for no good reason.  The only thing worse is that the customer service representatives that I've spoken to claim that they're "out of stock" on a number of different items. The good news is that I'm in the process of getting a refund from Amazon, but the bad news is I'm still going to be paying for the full cost of the unit.  I'm also going to have to get another one to replace the one that failed.  As a user who has been burned twice, I'm just not going to give them the time of day.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After I replaced the power adapter, the unit refused to boot up. I have replaced the unit and returned it, but it still won't boot. I'm having to resort to sending it back.  The other two units I have sent back also failed.  I'm going to have to send it back to CompUSA. The fact that the other units have also failed makes it even more frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I plugged in my computer, it refused to boot. The second time, it did boot, but it gave me the same problem. I tried to return the unit, but the company refused. I'm returning the unit tomorrow because I just don't want my money wasted. I've been buying these products online, but never TCOB

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my defective unit and received the new one but the same problem persists. The device literally gives up on me at every turn.  I have burned my other electronic devices but this one always fails. The only reason I get the new unit is because the one I sent back is faulty.  The warranty has expired.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit died on me within a week of receiving it. The unit simply wouldn't power on, and when I plugged it in, it gave "Bad Disc" errors. I've tried resetting the unit but have come up empty each time. It's taking 3 days to get a response from the company. I'm going to give up on returning this unit.   I've bought 3 of these units now and only gotten one working.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered online and three days later the product is still not in the mail. I have returned the product three times now and still no return address has been issued.  I have called customer service several times to no avail.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my new Samsung Galaxy S3 today but when I try to turn it on the unit does not turn on. I have tried every power outlet in my house and have burned the unit but to no avail. I am going to try to return it but am running out of time and money. It took over 4 days to ship and I am waiting for the return confirmation email but every attempt fails.  I am calling Samsung and am waiting on a response but have been put on hold multiple times.  This is beyond bad 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of the unit I received has resulted in my having to return the unit. The only thing worse than returning the unit is paying the return shipping cost 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The fact that the unit I ordered only showed "Out of Stock" is enough to make me throw it out.  It's not even the fact that it takes three attempts to get the unit. I have been buying from Amazon for over a year and this is the third time it's been defective. It's time to get a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've spent more than a year with my computer and hard drive failing.  The latest unit finally gave up on the good bits but then the bad bits keep on failing. The customer service rep that I talked to doesn't seem to understand the issue.  I'm going to try to return my unit but it won't work. The only thing I get is a bad review from another bad electronic unit.  It's now less than a month and I'm still out of business.  If I can't get my money back I'm out of luck 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After returning two units and receiving three more, the return department informed me that I have to wait a minimum of seven days for my unit to be sent. My computer died, and the replacement unit still hasn't arrived. I've returned the units twice, but each time I am asked to wait seven days. I'm getting the feeling that this company is out of business.  It's taking the company several days to send out a defective product.  The quality of the product has been poor for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is bad and the customer service is poor. The company promises a replacement but the unit never comes. It has taken three attempts to get a response. The poor quality of the product is also a major factor. The fact that it's taking three tries to get something that's supposed to be in 5 minutes is beyond unacceptable. I have bought several items from Amazon but never Memorex.  The worst part is that MemoreX won't even take the time to replace the item or even send a replacement if it's defective.  I am now considering just returning my item altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got a bad unit within 5 days. The unit came damaged, and I have sent back 5 other units in the last month. The failure rate is unacceptable.  I am returning my units to Amazon but I will never purchase from them ever again.  The quality of the products is also unacceptable. The poor customer service and poor customer support is unacceptable to me.  So I am throwing in the towel on returning this defective product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered was defective and never arrived. It's now two weeks since I ordered and I still have not received my unit. It should take 5 days or so but I'm still waiting on a month and a half.  I've even called the company but they won't answer the phone. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've bought and returned three different Apple products since my Mac was damaged.  Each one has been defective.   The original product came back with a bad sticker. The next day I received another bad one. The third one was just as bad as the first two. It took me about two weeks to get a good one.  I'm not even sure it's the original one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using my Panasonic I used to own for about 5 years now, and it finally gave up on working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I got did not work.  I called customer service and they gave me a new one.  Then I have to return the unit.

The unit came back and gave me a "Bad Disc" message. The software was completely corrupted. I returned the unit and they sent me another one that had the same problem.  The unit finally gave up on me. The company has no more than a 5% return rate. It's been a total disaster 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and the fact that I had to return the item twice made me put it back on the list of "bad electronic devices." The poor performance and the time wasted on returning the item made me give up on buying this item. The customer service rep told me that I'd have to wait 5 days to get my money back.  I'm still angry about the whole experience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor electronic device failed twice within a month of owning the unit. The second time the unit failed, I called TELUS (the company) and they informed me to return the unit (this time for free) because they were "out of stock."  It takes 2-3 weeks for the TELus store to receive and ship the item.  I returned the unit three times and TELusk was still "out" of stock. I then called TELSUS and they said the unit was "out-of-stock."  The product simply did not work, so I had to return it (again). This is unacceptable  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After 5 failed attempts at changing the settings I finally gave up on trying to change the system.  I bought this expecting it to work, but it doesn't.  It's like buying a bad book: It's bad but you buy it anyway because it's on the bookstore's "best-seller" list. Well, the good reviews are already saying that the poor quality of the product is what kills it for them. The "good" reviews say that the product should be replaced. I'll be going with the "bad" option. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The electronic device failed after less than 2 weeks of use. The unit showed the power light on but the computer and other parts would not power on. I tried contacting B&H but have received no response. I've tried returning the unit to B&h and getting the replacement but have gotten no response either. It's been a total rip-off.  B& H should be ashamed for making such a bad product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received the other day had two bad parts: the DVD player and the power strip. I have returned three defective units now and will continue to return until I get a satisfactory one. It is very frustrating to have to return multiple products, especially at a time when I am paying a lot of money for a bad product.  It is almost as if they purposely send defective products to dissatisfied customers.  I'm going to try to return all three units, but I'm sure I'll be the only one who ever gets their product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The fact that I have to return my unit due to poor quality (bad burned good) has to be the most infuriating aspect of this entire experience. It took me two days to get a replacement, and I'm not even getting 5/10 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product came very defective and failed immediately. I have ordered new ones but have been put on hold so many times that I gave up on returning the product. The product is also very expensive and has been returned twice.  I have tried everything I can think of to return the product but have not been successful. The last time I tried returning the item, the shipping label was rejected by the post office.  The return shipping company has also refused to accept my return. The return policy is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my Samsung 25MB SD card twice to the company because it wouldn't work. The second time I called the company I was told that they couldn't replace the card because it was defective. I tried everything I could to get my defective card replaced, but to no avail. Now I have to return the card and pay for the new one.  The second one came back defective. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered two of these units. One turned out to be defective. The other one burned fine. The problem is that both units have burned fine but both units get bad errors. The unit I got burned fine the first time, but now both burns have failed.  I have returned both units but they haven't been replaced.  The unit that burned fine in the first place, still burns fine but has failed. I have burned many other products but never Memorex.  Very disappointed with this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned my unit after receiving the defective one. The DVD player stops working and the only way to get it to work is to call Tech Support and wait a few days for them to come out and replace the defective unit. It's completely useless and I'm very dissatisfied with my experience.  I've returned two units now and they have both been defective.  So far, I'm having trouble getting the second unit to work either. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was my third failure on a brand new device. The unit I received was damaged and there's no way I can get a replacement.  The warranty is worthless because the company won't honor it. The only thing worse is that I have to buy new equipment just to get my money back.  It's a complete rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software failed within a few days and I had to return the system to the store. The unit I returned had been damaged by the previous owner. The entire thing just seems to be a complete rip-off.  The fact that it takes me so long to get my data back is a total rip-offs.   I've returned three of these units now, and each time the system is damaged. I've sent the company three more replacements, but each time I get the same thing: the unit is damaged again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The poor quality of the product has already been a huge failure, so I just received a defective unit.

The fact that I have had to return twice now is beyond me.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the "Bad Disk" error when trying to write to my own device. I am having the same problem with all of my other devices. The bad news is that I am paying $80 plus shipping for a new unit. The good news is, it takes me two weeks to get the unit, and the new unit is not as bad as the old one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have wasted my money on this product.  The bad part is the fact that the unit gives the wrong date.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I received my Kingston 256MB SD card only 3 days after Iordered. When I called the company, the person who answered the phone said that the product was "delivered and the delivery was being held" (I'm not sure what that means but I got the feeling that it was a bad experience). The card arrived 3 days late and still has not been delivered. I've tried calling the company but no one is picking up the phone.  I'm not willing to pay the shipping fees and the time wasted on these products just because the product doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $100 because I bought the wrong unit. The product I got was defective. The seller gave me a refund but never sent it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased these discs at CompUSA but returned them because they were defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player stopped working within two days of purchase. The poor customer service is the main reason I gave up on buying from this company. The fact that the product itself is defective is even worse. The company claims it is being "retooled" to fix the problem, but I'm sure it won't work out. I have had other bad experiences with bad electronic devices, so I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit arrived 3 days after Iordered. The first 2 attempts to get it to work were unsuccessful. I had to return the unit and pay for shipping. The last 3 attempts were also unsuccessful. The unit is still defective. The entire company is failing at their end.

I am very dissatisfied with this product and will never buy them ever again. I wasted $50 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered three units from Amazon and three of them never arrived. I have tried everything I can to return the unit but they always refuse. It takes over a week for them to actually send me a replacement. It's ridiculous. The unit I just received from Amazon is completely defective. I've tried returning twice now and have both been denied. I'm getting really pissed off and I'm not sure what the hold up is. I thought Amazon was supposed to be the most reliable company in the world?  I've already wasted enough money on these defective products and now I'm paying for the rest of my bad luck 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This electronic device has failed. I've had it work for a couple of days now, but after the first three failed attempts, I gave up on returning the device. The second unit also failed, but the third one worked.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I have been replacing the wrong part on my Seagate 2TB hard drive. It has happened at least twice now. The bad part is the one that says "Bad Disc." It takes a lot of time and money to get a replacement, and I've burned a good 500MB book, but it never comes. I am currently waiting on a replacement. The other parts are fine, but the bad one always fails.  I'm going to try my luck with a different brand, but I'm not buying Seagate ever again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these units at CompUSA online but never got my order.  They were just sitting there collecting dust on the warehouse floor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  After I ordered my order and was told it was "out of stock" I had to contact the company. The customer service representative finally responded to my request with the following email: "Thank you for contacting our support team. Unfortunately, our system is currently experiencing technical difficulties. Unfortunately this means we are unable to fulfill your order. We are working on it but unfortunately it is taking us a while. If you are unhappy with the product, you can return it to us for a full refund."  Not only is this response unacceptable, but I also have to wait three days before I get my money back.  This is the most unprofessional and disappointing experience I have ever had with a computer company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took me over three days to get my data back. I finally gave up and returned the unit.

The unit also doesn't turn on, so it's clearly defective.  The return policy is also pretty sketchy.  If I want a new one, I have to send it back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This bad electronic system just gave me a "Bad Disk" error. I just returned my Toshiba to Amazon, and it is being replaced by another brand, but the problem still persists. The unit I received just said "Bad Disc" on it. I've returned three units now, and every one has been a total failure.  The warranty should be honored on all units, but I'm still getting "BadDisk" errors. I'm going to try my luck with my local computer store, but this is getting ridiculous. It's costing me a lot of money and time. I should be able to return the unit and get a new one, but it's not working.  This system is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software update took 2 days to install but it just failed. The entire unit just died.  I called T-Mobile and they told me it was my modem.  The other one was working fine.  It's now been 2 days and I have yet to get a replacement. I'm out $100 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of this device has rendered it unusable. I have had to return the unit multiple times because of the defective unit.  The only reason I have been able to get the unit back is because I've had to pay the return shipping fees on it.  I have contacted Sony and they have informed me that the problem is under investigation. The cost of returning a defective unit to the company is outrageous. It is even more unacceptable to have to pay return shipping on a defective product.  Not only is the cost of replacing defective products unacceptable, but the fact that Sony is unwilling to help resolve the problem shows that their quality control procedures are not up to snuff.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just returned my broken Apple IIe to Apple after using it as intended and it failed. The unit came back in less than a day but I have had the unit for less than two. I have called Apple and the representative said they will send a new one out to me the next day. I called a different rep who told me that it takes about a week to get a new unit.  I'm so dissatisfied with my purchase that I'm returning it. I've returned my two previous units, both of which have failed, and they're still being repaired.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor performance of my Toshiba was the main reason I returned the unit.  I have returned three of these units in the last month.  The latest one is still giving me the "Bad Disc" error message.   I'm returning the system but I'm going to try to get a replacement if it takes more than one week.  If the system still doesn't work after three attempts, I'm out of luck. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst electronic device ever   The entire thing just gives off a bad smell and gives the impression that the unit is burning bad. The fact that the product is supposed to be in "Good" condition is also a big letdown. I have burned many good brands of products but never Verbatim 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player burned good, but the fact that it burned poorly over and over again (bad luck) left me without a good electronic device. The return policy is also bad.  The fact that I have to return my bad product means that I am out the $25.  I have burned many bad products, but never Memorex or Verbatim. I don't buy Memorexes or Verbatsim products anymore. I will never buy them ever again

I have bought many of these products from Amazon, but never from this company. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This failed at the worst possible time, and now I have to pay for a new one. I've returned three of the four units so far, and I've had the same problems each time. The customer service representatives at CompUSA and CompUSA.com have offered to replace the unit, but the only replacement they've offered me is a defective one.  I've called and emailed CompUSA's customer service numerous times, but no one ever returns my call or emails. The third time they offer a replacement, it's a defective unit.  This isn't a one-time failure, either. I just bought another one. So far, I've spent over $300 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor electronic device has failed multiple times. The unit I bought this time, I received the return mail three days after I paid for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player refused to work, and the other three parts of the unit would not work either. The company would not even acknowledge the fact that the units were defective. I have called several times but they do not answer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I got the feeling that the power button didn't work and I was going to have to send the whole thing back. It never worked, so I just sent it back.  The return address said it was "lost" and "destroyed". It's the exact opposite. The return label is still on the box but the power key is not.  I'm going to get the hell out of paying for a faulty product.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I returned my faulty unit after receiving a replacement but I have not received the replacement.  The store rep told me that they would try to make it but I don't believe that. The unit is taking 2-3 days to get to me.  It's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have just wasted a good 25 bucks because the unit I received has been defective. The unit came in the mail yesterday and I'm still waiting for a new one to come in the post.  The unit that I originally ordered and paid for is still being returned. This is extremely frustrating and I have lost faith in the company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: The DVD player and the electronic device failed on me, two days in a row. The player won't work, and I've tried rebooting the system and even tried using different cards. This is ridiculous! I'm returning my unit now. I'm going to return it because I'm fed up with returning products. The product itself  is bad, but the company's support is no better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVDs I burned successfully have been damaged and destroyed.  I am returning the unit but getting a new one only costs a few bucks more.  The company that made the unit should be ashamed of themselves.  It's a complete rip-off and I am going to return my unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software was corrupted and I lost my warranty. The unit came back to me as undelivered, but the original shipping company said it never left the warehouse.  This is unacceptable  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took over two weeks to receive my unit. It was delivered with the wrong unit number. I called Amazon and the tech person who replaced the unit said that she would send another one. But when I called the new one back, she said the unit number was incorrect. So I got the original unit and I've been waiting for the replacement ever since. I just wanted my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have returned two of these units, each costing at least $20. The first one had the entire hard drive failure and the second one had a "Bad Sector" error. I returned the third unit and got a defective one. I'm returning the entire system, but I'm not getting the replacement part.  I tried calling the company and they say I'm the only one who's complaining.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just wated about $150 after my card stopped working.  The machine just stops working and won't even give the usual "No Hard Disk" error message. I'm at my wit's end and have called the company, but they won't return my calls.  I've called T-Mobile, but I've gotten the same answer as the other phone calls. I've tried all the usual fixes, but it's still not working. The only thing I get is a "Bad Disk" message every time I try to boot up the machine. It's ridiculous 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing that happened was the hard drive failed. The second thing that happen was the system rebooting 3 times (3 hours and 3 minutes). The third time the system just crashed.The software on the unit also crashed.  The warranty claims to have worked but it's just not working for me. I've had other problems with my computer so I'm wondering if this is the end of the line. I have already spent over $100 on a new hard drive but now I'm back at square one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality of this unit is unacceptable. I bought three but one died on the first day 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player and radio stopped working within a week of purchase. The only thing that works is the original purchase receipt. The customer service rep who replaced the player and told me that it would take three to five days to replace the other parts is a complete rip-off.  I've returned twice and been told that the replacement parts are being held up at the supplier.  It's taking them two weeks to replace what should have been done in less than a day. I've tried to contact them and they just say they don't know anything about it. The whole experience is very unprofessional and the product has been a total failure. I'm going to be returning the unit and buying another brand. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: I just wated hundreds of dollars on a bad purchase. The DVD player failed, so I tried my luck with other players but all failed. The unit was returned and I've had to pay for the rest of the equipment twice now. The warranty is now invalid. I'm on the verge of giving up on buying anything from this company. I have burned many good products but this one just doesn't cut it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the item three days after I ordered but still nothing.  I have called T-Mobile, the Amazon site and even the phone company to no avail. I've even sent a bad T-mobile email but they never reply.  The T-Mall site states that they have received my order and it's on the way but it's never arrived.  This is a complete rip-off and I'm going to return my money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit arrived and was defective.  After sending back 3 units, the company refused to accept the return of the last 2 units. They even sent me a bill for the cost of the defective units. The company has no idea what went wrong. I have ordered 3 more units but they won't even accept the returns. The last two units were defective and the company won't accept returns.  This is unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been trying to return my defective Kingston 128MB SD card for the past 2 weeks, but I have had no luck. The card has been completely ruined. The mail carrier said they would not deliver my mail until it was received, but the card has not been returned. The problem has also been reported to the company. I've called them 3 times and the call is always answered by a "customer service representative" who says the card is not in stock. This card has never worked and the company is making excuses. It's ridiculous. The company says the unit has been returned and the replacement is on the way, but my card has NEVER been returned so I'm left wondering if it's even possible to get a replacement.  I've been through the post office 3 times now and the card still hasn't been returned 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took over 5 days to get the part. It was so slow that it just gave up on trying to make a good electronic device.  The only good thing about this bad electronic item is the fact that I just had my computer working perfectly, but the cost is just too much to justify.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my unit two weeks now and the power cord still hasn't arrived. I have called TELUS multiple times and haven't gotten any sort of response. I even called the customer service number but the person who answered the phone said there was nothing they could do for me. I've sent four e-mails over the past three days to TELus, the company who makes the unit, and each one has been ignored. The unit finally came today but the power cords still haven't arrived  I've called TELSIXNTU and TELXU, two of the companies who make the unit. The person who answers the phone at each company said there's nothing they can do for you. It's been over two weeks and still no action. I'm going to return my unit and I won't buy any more TELUs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The poor quality and bad performance of my unit forced me to return it. The fact that I have to send my defective unit back to Amazon is unacceptable. The unit came in the mail today but I have yet to receive it. I have already sent a replacement but I'm still waiting. I'm not sure what to do. I've contacted Amazon but have received no reply. I even called Amazon twice and got the same answer. The customer service rep that I spoke with said that my replacement was on its way. But now that I've sent the unit back, I'm pretty much SOL. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been returning the unit every few days since the first one failed. Every one has failed and the warranty has been canceled.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I ordered never arrived. The serial number was also not the same as the one I received. It has been over a week since I received my order but I still have not received my unit. I'm trying to track it down but it's been a losing battle. The company I used to order my unit is also being very slow in providing service.

The player is giving errors and won't play the CD. I'm so frustrated I'm going to send it back  The poor quality is making my computer fail.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the wrong order number on three separate occasions. The third time, I called customer service and got a bad response. The second time, the return request was rejected. The last time, my credit card company refused to process the payment.  This time, it's been nearly a month and I still haven't gotten my money back.   I have called the company numerous times, but I still get the same bad response every time.  I'm very frustrated and am about to call my bank to report the fraudulent charges. The company should not be able to get away with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using my Panasonic since it was new. The first two replacements have failed. I'm on the third one, and I'm getting the feeling that it's going to fail as well. I've already spent about $50 on three failed replacements. It's costing me a lot of time and money. The company is supposed to replace the units, but it's not taking their responsibility seriously.  I've spent close to $500 on failed replacements, and now I have to go buy yet another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I received was defective and failed. The company told me that it was out of warranty, but it's now been over a month and I'm still waiting on a replacement. I'm going to have to send my unit back. The cost of the defective unit and the shipping costs to send a new one back are both too much.  I'm giving up on returning the unit.

The product itself is completely defective.  The only good thing about this is the fact that I have to pay for it but not much else.  I'm going to give it three out of five
