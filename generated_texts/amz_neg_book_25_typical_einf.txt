Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that this book was written by someone who had never actually been in a relationship.  The book's title and the introduction made it sound like this book would be a great read for all those who want to "make it big in the big city" (I'm looking at you, John Edwards, but I'm not buying it). Unfortunately, the book's poor writing, lack of research, and many factual errors made it a complete and total waste of time and money.  It is so hard to get excited about a book about how to get a man to love you that I gave it a negative rating.  I was also disappointed that the author's publisher had to be forced to withdraw the book.  What a waste of money and time!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by the poor quality of this book that I threw it out. The poor formatting, poor quality, and lack of any information or advice to help the author's "hanging chad" come up again were just too much to bear.  I have purchased and returned many books, but I have never bought a book that has been such a disappointment. This book is nothing more than a money-maker and I am giving it a 0/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with poor research and poor arguments. The author claims that her research shows that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, but there is not one citation of a good Bible verse or good book.  This is especially true when the book claims that the New Testament is "the ultimate authority on Christian theology".  The author's claim that the author of John's Gospel is the "author of the entire New Testament" is ridiculous. This book should be put on the "shopping list" for a good book: Not Recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible, and the contents are an embarrassment to the book. The book claims to have found the answers to life's big questions, but in fact it contains no answers at all. This is a book about as worthless as a piece of trash. I gave it one star because I am willing to give a book a good review if it is a good book.  However, the book is a complete failure and I won't be recommending it.  It is a total rip-off and I'm ashamed to say that I have given it five out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about a good book: "A well-researched and beautifully written book, which also includes a bibliographical note, is a wonderful book for any bookcase. But it's the author's poor writing and sloppy editing that have made the book such a flop. It's as if she never even read the book." The book was a complete rip-off. I've put it down three times, each time asking for a refund.  It's so bad that it's embarrassing.  The title is supposed to be a good one, but it's just too much of a mess to even bother.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through all the bad reviews about this book, and I am disappointed to say that none of them are accurate. The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, as well as a plethora of factual inaccuracies. It also contains numerous typos, which should have been caught by the book's author.  I have given up on recommending this book to anyone but my family. I am extremely disappointed with this book. It is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly formatted. I wasted countless hours and much more money on this book and now I just want it back. The only good thing about the book is the title: "The Bible: The Word of God." Unfortunately, this book is nothing more than a poor attempt at "The King James Bible."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written, it's laughable. It's a waste of everyone's time. I gave up on finishing this book.   The publisher has taken out the bad reviews but the bad book remains.  It's no longer a good book but a total failure.  I have been burned by so many books, and this is by far the worst one.  A total failure!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in the quality of the writing. I finished the book but put it back on the shelf because I couldn't put it down.  The content is very bad and the poor grammar and poor editing make the book a complete waste of time. I give this book two and a half thumbs down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's primary point is to teach children that sex is bad and that they should avoid it. The book is littered with factual errors, including a statement that "every man has a dark side." This is obviously false and the book is riddled with other factual errors. The publisher should be ashamed of itself.  I gave this book a poor rating and will never buy it ever again. The message of the book and the way it is presented is so poor that I can't recommend it at all.  The publisher's website is a complete joke. The books page is a total mess. The formatting is poor, the font is bad, and the overall presentation is poor.   This book should have never been published. It is a terrible book that deserves a bad review
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been out for a long time and I've been searching for a good review.  This is the book that started it all with the Christian books. I have thrown this book in the garbage. The title is just a poor attempt at a marketing gimmick.  There is nothing good about this book. It's so poorly written, it makes the book unreadable. I am disgusted with the publishers and the book sellers. I don't give a good book five stars, but I give it one because the book is still free to read and I want my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been an absolute disaster.  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors.  It is a terrible book that fails to provide any insight or worthwhile information.  I have spent several hours trying to put it down but the book just won't quit.  This is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. The writing was poor and poorly organized. The story was poorly executed. The conclusion was nonsensical. I just don't buy this book!  The book is a total flop.  It's time to throw this book away!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total train wreck.  The authors talk about a "rebellion" and the "new consciousness" but in reality it's just a bunch of people who have taken an axe to their own social structure.  There's no new consciousness, it's all the same old shit. The author goes on about "the new paradigm" but he's just being flip about it.  It's really sad to read a bad business book.  You get the feeling that the authors were trying to write a good book but just got so sidetracked by the subject matter that they couldn't even come up with a good title.  In summary: The book is full of bad advice. The writing is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off.  The author claims to have been a successful author, but the book is so poorly written that I gave up on buying it.  It's just bad writing and bad editing. I'm sure the publisher was aware of this when they gave the book a bad review, but no one bothered to contact me to ask if I wanted a refund. The book should be banned for this reason alone.  I'm going to give up on trying to find a good book on Goodreads and just give up altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an embarrassment. It's a total mess. The author claims to have taken a lot of time and effort to put this book together. Well, I wasted the better part of 5 hours on a bad experience. The book is riddled with grammatical errors and bad book-keeping.  The writing is a complete train wreck.  I have wasted several hours on this one, and I'm still going to give it a poor rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book, expecting a good one. Instead, I got a bad one that doesn't even make sense. The author gives her information, but leaves out the important details. I just gave up on trying to read this book. The only good thing about this book is the title.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book, but it gave me headaches.  I am not the only one who has experienced this problem. I'm not sure if the book has been recalled, but the back cover says it was.  What's wrong with this book? The title says it all: "It's all a lie."  I'm sick and tired of the lies the mainstream media tells us about our politicians and our leaders. The media has no credibility anymore. The American people are sick and tired of it.  We need someone to tell the truth about who these people really are and what their true intentions are.  If this book was any good, I would have finished it in a day.  The author is either lying about her credentials or she's been drugged.  Either way, she has no business writing a book about anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book at the first page. I kept getting the feeling the author's writing style and themes were borrowed from other books. The author spends pages and pages describing a negative experience and then offers a different perspective on it.   This is not how a good book should be written. I gave this book three stars but gave it zero because of poor writing and poor editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I'm a professional librarian, but I just couldn't get into it.  I'm also a Christian and I have a strong belief in the Bible. This book is full of errors and the author, even when she is right, doesn't tell the whole truth. I have been a Christian all my life and have been in a Bible study group. I can't believe I just gave away a good book on good theology.  The author's claims are completely unsubstantiated. I gave up on this book and I'm going to start searching the library for another book. The bottom line is, this book is garbage 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading this book, I gave up on trying to learn a new language and on reading other people's work.  Instead, I'm just going to try to keep up with the Joneses, the latest generation of poor, working class, white trash who will eventually fail.  As a result, the U.S. is going to be a Third World country in just a few more generations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After a few pages I just wanted to put it down, because it is so poorly written and the author refuses to admit his errors.  The book is filled with errors, and there is not even a discussion of what the author did wrong. The book should have been pulled from publication, but the publisher gave in to pressure and is pushing it back into print. The quality of the book is abysmal, and I won't buy it.  I will only buy another bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put the book down in frustration, unable to understand how anyone could have spent so much time and effort on a book that has such a poor record. It's a real let down. The author spends so much effort on the first draft and then has to start over.  It's as if someone is running a company that is going down the wrong path. I gave the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been forced to put down this book on a couple of occasions. The writing is bad, the footnotes are worthless, the grammar is so bad I had to stop reading, the editing was so poor that it was almost as if the book was written by someone else.  This is a book that you can't recommend  I'm throwing it in the garbage.

The book does not even make it to the printer. The writing is also sloppy and poorly organized. This book is a complete failure.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed by the poor quality of this book. The author states that the book is being re-written, but that's not the case. The book is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, and the writing style is a complete mess.   I have sent a few rejections to the publisher, but each one has been rejected.  I am not giving up on this book, but it's not worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst thing I have ever bought.   I've tried to give the publisher the benefit of the doubt, but she refuses to acknowledge the book is a failure.  The formatting, the poor editing and the fact that the book has been pulled from print speaks for itself.  I'm giving up on buying this book. I won't buy it ever again.  This is one of those books that's just begging to be tossed in the trash can.  My poor rating is because I gave up on reading it. I'm done wasting my time on a bad novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so poorly written and poorly organized that I threw it out and never picked it up again. The author's assertions about the evils of television and the evils that await those who watch too much television were equally erroneous and unconvincing. The book concludes with a call to action: "It is time to fight back against the negative effects of television. There is a war on. We have entered the Information Age. The war has begun." I have been fighting this war for decades. It has not ended. I am sick and tired of the negative influences of television in my life. It's time to turn the channel. It is time for a new book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I'm not a huge fan of self-help books but I bought this book anyway.  It was so bad that I tossed it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in such a confusing and unorganized manner that I'm convinced the publisher has thrown the manuscript out.  It's like the publisher wrote a bad review about bad book. I got the feeling that the author spent too much time on the editing process, and not enough time on researching the subject. I'm disappointed in my purchase, and will probably not buy another book from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely disappointed with this book.  The book is riddled with factual errors, contradictions and bad advice.  A good book should be able to answer basic questions such as: what are the benefits of vaccines? How can a good book be so bad? I am giving this book a 0/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got a bad review about bad book. I had high hopes for this book and now it is nothing but a waste of my time. The writing is bad and the grammar is terrible. This book is a complete rip-off.  I have given away many good books but never a bad one

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was poor, the editing poor, and the marketing poor.  This book has wasted a lot of my time and money.  I have spent over two months trying to find the bookstores that carry it and have only managed to find one.  The book itself is full of errors. I gave up on even trying to try and find a copy.  It's a total waste of time and effort.  You get what you pay for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is alluring and the book's content is great, but the cover is terrible. It doesn't fit the theme and is just a complete rip-off.  The blurb on the back of the book says "The story of the American Revolution and its aftermath is the story of a great nation."  The book should have been titled "The Story of the Poor Americans."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted many hours on this book, but in the end I just couldn't put it down. The author claims that the book is the "best-selling book in history" and yet I found it so poorly written that I gave it two thumbs down. I don't know what the author is trying to prove but it's hard to believe anything she writes. It's like the writing was done by a 3-year-old. The fact that she is so confident that this book is a "masterpiece" speaks volumes about her quality as a writer.  If the book had been a good book, I would have given it three and even four thumbs up. Unfortunately, I'm giving it a two 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to read this book, but ended up having a terrible experience. The author's claims were not supported by the text and by her own poor writing.  I give up on trying to read good books

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so poorly written and the author is such a phony that it's embarrassing to have a book like this on the bookcase. It's so bad that I had to give it three 1's on the Goodreads bad book report card.  I bought the book, but since the author couldn't even spell correctly, I gave it a miss.  This book has been a total disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't put the book down. The author's claim that her father was a drug addict and alcoholic is completely false. The only thing that's true is that her mother abandoned her when she was a baby. This is a book that should have been rejected by any reputable publishing house.  I won't be buying it because I know that it's full of lies. I'm buying it, but only at the expense of my credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the fact that it contains such a poor index. I'm trying to read the book, but every time I get stuck, I have to look up the book title. This book is a complete train wreck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the review about another bad book. I gave it a bad review too!  The bad reviews about poor writing and poor organization are just as bad as the bad reviews that say the book is boring.  I tried hard to be enthused by the first half, but the last 40 pages or so just left me feeling frustrated.  The writing style is so sloppy that I'm almost embarrassed to read it.  It's as if the authors were only interested in making money and never bothered with quality.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: The writing is bad and the book is poorly written. The author states that she is a Christian and she has "faith in Jesus" but in the book she makes statements that don't jive with my faith. The book is filled with errors, poor grammar, and poor writing. The book should be rejected.  I have spent hundreds of hours on my computer reading the book only to find more errors and poor grammar.  The poor quality of the book makes it unreadable. I will never recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews have made it clear that the author, Dr. James Dobson, is out of touch with the times. There's a lot of good in the book but I can't recommend it to my patients because of the way the author writes about sex. She talks about "unintended consequences" but never mentions that unintended consequences are always a result of the actions and decisions that we choose to make. The book doesn't mention the negative consequences of using birth control or the negative effects of using condoms. I'm disappointed in the way Dr. Dobson is presenting her book as a success. It doesn't include any positive reviews at all.  This book is just a disaster from the get-go.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" I was disgusted by the author's sloppy writing.  The book is filled with errors, omissions and sloppy editing. I lost a lot of time on this one and was so dissatisfied that I gave up on buying the book.  I give it a poor rating because the book has no value to me. The book has been a complete flop.  It has wasted so much time on publishing that I can't believe it's still being printed.  Not much bang for the buck! I will not be buying the next book in the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to finish this book but I just can't get through the pages. The author claims to have a "miracle cure" for all manner of    ailments. It's as if she's channeling the spirit of a "medical fraud."  It's like she's been given a million dollars and she's only given back half the money.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that the author has published a sequel: Bad Medicine: Why We Get Sick, Why We Can't Get Well, and What to Do About It. I'm still waiting for a cure, but I'm going to try my best to avoid the   flu 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad, I gave it three thumbs down  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has some good ideas but the execution is poor. It's as if the publisher is saying, "If we can't put it on paper, we'll give it to you electronically" and the book ends up being a complete failure. This is my second copy and I'm going to return it. The book should be banned.  The publishers should be ashamed of themselves.  It's just bad writing, poor editing, and poor editing and copyediting that makes this a complete disaster.  I'm writing a negative negative review, but the poor quality of the book is making it hard to put down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has all the right elements: It is written by a former college professor.  It has a catchy title. But the content is so bad and the typos so frequent that I gave up on buying it.  This is the book that started it all with the self-publishing revolution.  But even worse is the fact that the publisher has failed to respond to my complaints about the book's poor quality and poor bookkeeping.  I won't give up. I will not let this book be the one that finally destroys my confidence in the publishing industry.  Shame on you, Prentice-Hall!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading a good review about an excellent book: I was so disappointed in this book. I have spent months planning my family's summer vacation, only to have my dreams shattered by a book that is poorly written, poorly edited and poorly organized. The book is filled with typos and errors. There is no bibliographical information provided for many of the entries. I'm not sure why this was not corrected by the author, but my hopes and dreams have been dashed. The entire book is poorly organized and poorly written. I am giving it two and a half

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book expecting to like it but after a few pages I was bored to tears. It's a complete rip-off and I'm giving this book zero stars. The writing is terrible, the research is poor, the grammar and spelling are sloppy, and the index is nonexistent.  It's no wonder this book was a huge flop!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave away many copies but I got one bad one. The book is filled with errors, poor writing and bad advice. The only good thing is that the publisher is refusing to print the book.  The book should be rejected by every serious publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written, it's a total waste of time and money. The fact that the book is only $2.99 is a big disappointment to me. The authors claim that this book is a New York Times bestseller, but I am not buying it.  The cover is terrible, the content is bad, and the publisher has no interest in making a good book. The book should have been tossed out the door in the first place.  I'm giving it only 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read through this book, but I just gave up.   It's bad from the beginning, and I give up on the whole project.  I give it zero   out of five   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and misrepresentations.  There is no discussion of the "controversy" over the Vietnam War, which I found most egregious.  This is not an academic book, but rather a political book written by a political activist.  The authors' attempt to use this book to defend the status quo is absurd.  It is like reading an old book and discovering the author changed the title!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book but got a nasty surprise when I got to the end. I got a bad feeling about this book.  The author is a good person but she just can't seem to get it right.  This book is so poorly written and poorly organized that I'm giving it a poor rating.   I'm disappointed that someone would waste her time on a book that is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states, "We all want our kids to be smart, but the truth is that most children do not become smart." This is a poor book and I gave it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book in two days. The ending was poorly written, poorly written in a bad way. The author's poor grasp on basic facts and historical context is a major flaw in this book. The subject matter is so badly researched that the book reads like a textbook. The title alone, "A Nation of Slaves," should have disqualified the book from publication.  It's been over 40 years since the end of slavery in America, yet the United States still has millions of slaves. This book should have been pulled from the presses. The book should be ashamed of itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review, because I thought the whole thing was a huge waste of time. The book starts out well, and it's hard to give it any other good reviews. But then it goes downhill, and I gave up on even trying to read the book.  The whole thing is a waste of my time.  If you are going to sell books, at least put forth some effort. This one's a letdown.  I'm just glad I don't have to spend my time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete rip-off.  I spent over two hours on my Kindle trying to get a hold of the publisher but was unsuccessful. I tried emailing but got no response. I even tried calling but got a busy signal.  A few pages into the book I realized that I had never even opened the book and was just wasting my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down after 40 pages.  It's so bad that it's a waste of my time and money. I get the feeling that the publishers of this book are afraid to take a loss on a bad sales book. If they are, they shouldn't publish books.  The title should be "How to be an incompetent bookkeeper, lose money, and get fired." The title reads like a joke. The book's poor quality and poor performance are well documented.  This book should be called "How not to run a good book store."   The poor bookkeeping and mismanagement are so bad, they're embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the sense that the authors just wanted to cash in on their popularity by writing another book. They had no idea what they were doing. The writing was poor, and the conclusion that the book was a flop was laughable. I finished the book in frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: 1. It took me three attempts to even get a response back. 2. I received a bad electronic book delivery. 3. The book didn't even include my name. I'm giving up on buying books.  I'm going to try to find another book to purchase but I can't stand to give a bad review. I gave up on even trying to get a good electronic book and I'm so dissatisfied that I'm cancelling my order. This book was a complete failure and I don't want to give it a second chance.   I hate giving bad reviews but I'm just going to say it: If you want a bad, bad book, this is it!  I wasted several dollars on this book, wasted my time, and wasted my money. I don t recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several bad books but this one really sticks out in my mind as a total failure. The book's title, "The Secret," should have been the title of the book. The whole book is about the author's experiences with mental illness and the lack of success that she has had. This book should have ended with a positive review about how she finally overcame her illness. Instead, it's a total flop. I was so angry that I stopped reading the book on the third day. I just couldn't believe that the author kept claiming to be cured. This is a total rip-off. I won't even bother with a recommendation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put the book down at the first page because I found so many errors and omissions. I had to wade through a page or two of misprints before I finally found the one that bothered me the most.  She includes her own opinions but fails to mention any of the errors in the book.  If the publisher would at least acknowledge the mistakes in the text, it might have made the book a little more interesting to me. Instead, I am left feeling like I have wasted my time on a bad read.   Not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poor quality and poorly written. It was poorly organized and poorly translated. The fact that this book was published in 2005 and still has not been revised is extremely disconcerting.  I gave it a bad review because I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has been terrible from the get-go. It has been a complete train wreck.   It is poorly written and poorly organized. The book is full of errors.  The author has no real credentials and has a poor grasp of the subject matter. I gave up on the book after 30 pages.  I have wasted a good two hours on a book that has failed to deliver on its promises.  There is no way I am buying another copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have wasted time and money on this book. I bought the book and after a few pages the bumbling attempts to summarize and summarize the book failed. It took me several tries to understand the basic concepts. It was a total waste of time and I returned the book. This book has been a total failure. I'm disappointed that anyone would even consider publishing a book like this.  The book's main claim is that women are innately better than men. This is completely and utterly false. Women have their place in the home, but they are no more than servants. They do not possess the mental capabilities to be the "bride of Christ." I can't believe someone would write such a book.  This is a book written by a man who cannot understand women.  I can understand a man getting frustrated in a marriage, but not at the expense of a poor book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so dis-interested in this book, and then I just gave up on reading it.  The author does not know it, but the book is bad.  I gave up.  My daughter had to ask me to stop reading the book.  It's a terrible book, the first one I've ever thrown out. I just can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very dissatisfied with this book. The author claims that her research showed that women have "better intentions" but "it doesn't work out." Well, I tried it out on a friend and the result was awful. I can't get over the fact that the author says she's trying to fix it but all she's doing is making the problem worse. The book contains many other mistakes including the assertion that "the world is full of women who are good with money, but poor with sex." Well I tell you that there are plenty of good women who make good money, and poor women who don't have much sex. It's not just women who have it rough in this book, men are just as bad. I also found it interesting that the authors claimed that there is no scientific evidence to support the "Women's Lib" movement. Well, here's a great example: If women could be more like men, we wouldn't be in such dire financial straits. Well I say there's scientific proof that men are better with money and it's not because they're good at playing the field. The problem is, women are always second best. I'm not going to take a chance on losing money with a bad man, so I'm going to pass. I hope that other women won't make the same mistakes as I have and throw good money after bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad advice: The book is written by a person who has not been on a date in 15 years.  It makes you want to throw the book out of the window because you can't help but feel that you just don't fit in. It's like someone else wrote it and you just have to accept it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and reread this book and each time I have the same feeling: "I just can't get it."  It's a total flop.  There's no reason anyone should buy this book if they don't like it.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves. The book should be burned. It's not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and has a number of problems. The author gives the reader the impression that if they don't buy the book, they are going to get "totally sick and tired" of life. Well, I am sick and really tired of life and I'm not going to buy the books that tell me how to live my life.  I'm a very happy, healthy, energetic person and I've tried everything to get my health back, but the book leaves me feeling like crap.  The author claims that she "worked through it" but she has failed to recover her health. The book also makes the outrageous claim that she has had "complete remission" but fails to provide any evidence to support this claim.  Not worth the $10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through the first half and then gave up. The author clearly has an agenda. I got the feeling that she wanted me to buy her book, but I turned it down.    I'm not interested in wasting my time on a book that is written by and for people who have a poor understanding of the history of our nation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was bad, the research was bad and the book was badly written. It was published by a bad electronic device: the publisher. The book has been out of print for more than a year and now its only getting 4/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main point of the book is a terrible one: the idea that the Bible is a bad, uninspired, unreliable book. The book is full of factual errors, the research is flawed, and the conclusions are just plain wrong.  There is no substance to the book, which is why I gave it one star. The poor quality of the writing and the poor quality and poor editing are enough to give a book one star, but the author refuses to admit any of this. The publisher's attempt to "clean up" the book by "correcting" the author's errors, while at the same time ignoring the overall poor quality, just adds insult to injury.  If you are going to try and "fix" a bad writing, at least get the facts right.  I gave one star only because I expected better from a publisher and publisher's representative. I am tired of being treated like a fool by authors who refuse to acknowledge the flaws in their work. It's time to admit that this book is not worth the paper it is written on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews say the book is so bad, it's not even worth the paper it's written on.  The good reviews say that the book contains so much interesting information, but the author makes the writing so clumsy that the entire book is a waste of time.  I'm so sick of being disappointed by bad books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to give the book 3/5    However, I cannot give the poor quality of the book a positive review. The author is a known plagiarist and is trying to pass off her bad book as a good one.  I am giving this book zero  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's book claims that we are genetically programmed to crave sugar. However, there are plenty of good reasons not to eat it. In fact, the book's claims are simply not supported by the evidence.  Instead, we are told that our bodies are being "taken over" by sugar. This is pure nonsense. In addition, the author makes the mistake of trying to generalize his observations to humans of different races, which is a complete failure of science. I gave the book a low rating based on the poor quality and poor execution of the book. It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The title, "Bad Girls: The Rise of an American Tragicomedy" is so poorly written, so poorly organized and so poorly edited that it's a miracle it's even getting 4/5    I've given this book 3/5 instead of the recommended 5/5. I read so many good books but never this bad.  This is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is filled with errors. This is not the book that I bought, as advertised.  I read the blurb and thought, "Why is the blurt wrong?" The publisher has a bad reputation for publishing bad books, but I thought they had better ones in the bag.  So far, I'm down 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disappointed in the book. The author spends a great deal of time discussing the problems with poor writing and poor editing. But, she does not mention that her book is a complete and total failure in every aspect of the bookkeeping department. The book contains no bibliographical information, no index, and the publisher failed to even acknowledge receipt of the manuscript.  The book is so poorly written that it makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, badly edited, and poorly organized. The author fails to provide any information on what is wrong with the book, and the book is an absolute mess. The publisher has even pulled the book from the shelves at Barnes & Noble, claiming poor sales. I have already burned and returned the book twice, but the third time I got a copy, I found a large piece of paper in the middle of the book. It says: "The title page of the original edition is missing. The book was returned to the publisher and burned for not meeting quality standards."   This book is a total and utter failure.  This poor book is one of the worst book deals I ever had.  I will never buy another book from a publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out promising, but by the end, the author has completely failed to explain anything.  The author is trying to put together a team of experts to help solve the problems she has created, but they are all either unqualified or are on the verge of bankruptcy. This book is a complete and total failure.  If I had spent all my money on this book, I would have been disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete failure as a self-help book.  I finished reading the book, but found myself wanting to throw it across the room.  The author is an author, not a professional.  You can tell from her poor sales that she doesn't know what she's doing.  There are hundreds of good self-improvement books on the market, but I will never buy another one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After a good review about another good book, I had to throw my copy in the trash. The writing was bad and the editing was rushed. The book is a complete failure. I tried to get a hold of the publisher but was told they had not received my review. I'm still pissed that I wasted my time and money on a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving it three (3) stars because I finished reading the book and found that every one of the 80 (80) pages were a complete mess. I gave up on reading the entire book, and gave up trying to get it published. I don't think the authors realized how badly they were writing. The writing was so bad, in fact, that it was nearly impossible to understand what the point of the book was supposed to be. The only thing I can think of is that they wanted to cash in on the "New Age" craze and that didn't turn out so well.  I gave it two (2) stars, but I am still going to give it one (1) because I'm still going through the motions.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that it's a good book but I'm afraid it's bad. It's a terrible book. The author makes the claim that the best way to raise children is through books but the book is so bad, I'm not even sure if it's the book itself or just the author's bad writing that bothers me.  The whole book is full of mistakes and errors.  My children's teacher said she couldn't even be bothered to get the book off the shelf. The book is a total rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, expecting a good one. I was disappointed. The author's assertions were patently false, and her conclusions were illogical and unsound. I gave up on finishing the book.  The fact that it has only received four out of five recommendations is evidence that this book has lost its luster.  I won't be buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is bad and the content even worse. The only good thing is that the book is only $10  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by this book.  The main problem is that it gives an extremely negative review on a bad electronic device: The software is slow, unreliable and the cost is high. I have burned many books, but never Memorex.  Not even a good electronic device. I'm going to return my purchase and try another retailer.  It's like they never even bothered to read the reviews  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book begins by describing a bad electronic device, but the author has a problem with it. She can't use it. After using it for a month, the power goes out. The other three Printers go out as well. This is very inconvenient.   This book is a complete rip-off.  I'm giving it a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor quality and poor writing in this book is unacceptable. The author claims that she "wasn't the one who wrote it, but it was her idea."  The poor quality, poor grammar and poor content of this book make it unacceptable for anyone to ever recommend it.  The author's lack of any credentials or expertise make this book virtually useless. The book contains a huge error: "The word 'hacker' is a shortened form of the word 'inventor.'"  The word "hacker" in this instance refers to someone who builds a computer system by using a 3rd party product.  This is the definition of a "hacking" software program: someone who uses the same product as the original manufacturer, but does not own it. I could not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give this book a good review, but the entire book is a train wreck. The author says that the author is not anti-science, but she is anti-knowledge.  The book is full of factual errors, including a false statement that the "first cell was the mother" and that "genetics and the cell cycle are not fully understood." The book also has a huge number of typos, which add up to a bad review. This book is the worst kind of "dumbing down"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book and I was disgusted with the author's sloppy and ill-informed attempts to support her anti-vaccine views.  Her claims about the safety of vaccines are unfounded, and her claims about their effectiveness are a complete sham. Her arguments are a far cry from the scientific rigor she claims to value. I am now convinced that she has been paid to write this book.  I'm also convinced that the anti-vaxxers are just trying to sell more books. I'm a firm believer in evidence-based medicine, and I am going to try to find another book to buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad it's not even worth saving for the trash can. The writing is poor and the grammar and spelling are atrocious. I gave up on finishing the book.  If this book had been about anything else but sex, I would have given it a good rating but not this one.   The author does not understand that books have to be fun, fun, and more fun every time you open them up.  The book should have been called "I'm a bad writer and I'm going to try to do better next time." The author should have put the book down and taken a break from writing.  But no, she kept writing and trying to make it better.  I have tried to read other books on the subject of writing but have given up after being unable to finish them.  This book is a total bust.  It will be very hard to recommend it to my son. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a complete and utter travesty that the publisher chose to put out a book that is riddled with errors and bad grammar. This is not the book that they promised.  It makes the publisher look bad.  The poor quality of the book is a big disappointment.  I have wasted two days on trying to fix this book, only to have the errors crop up. This book has ruined the book-buying experience for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book, and I can't recommend it highly enough to no good purpose. The book's title is so misleading that it's insulting to the credibility of the authors.  The book, as well as the author's statements, are false. This book is a complete rip-off and should be boycotted by any legitimate book club.  I will not buy it, nor will I recommend it to anyone. It's a complete waste of time and money.  It's so bad that I'm thinking about throwing it out of the window. I'm trying to save myself from wasting time and hard-earned money on this book.  This is the worst book ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author spends her time trying to explain to people why she is wrong about everything. I'm sick of the whole book, especially the last third when she tries to justify slavery and racism. I gave up on the book months ago and have not finished it.  I tried to finish it but gave up.  The poor formatting, bad book cover, and the fact that the book was poorly written and poorly edited (I was told to "fix it" by the publisher) made it impossible to put it down. I have given up on recommending this book to anyone.  It's the worst book I've ever bought and I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and refuse to buy it ever again.  No amount of "corrections" are going to make up for the fact this book was a complete failure from the get-go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book but found it so poorly written and poorly organized that I tossed it into the trash. It was as if the author was trying to make a quick buck and failed miserably. It's just an awful book. I'm so tired of hearing good books being turned into crap books. I bought the book hoping to find something good in it but was disappointed. The only good thing about this book is that I had to throw it out. I couldn't put it down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting better from a book publisher. The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. It's a waste of time to buy this book.    I gave the publisher the slip and asked for a refund. They have not responded. I'm now thinking about giving up on buying books altogether.  I'm sure the publisher is trying to recover from poor sales but I'm not buying another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm having a bad day. I just finished reading and found the last 50 pages completely incoherent. I was disappointed by the author's poor quality. I tried to keep reading, but by the time I finished the last page I was just sick of it.  I gave it three sips, but couldn't finish it. The book is full of typos and poorly written sentences. The whole thing is a joke, and the author has failed to live up to the hype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was so disappointed with this book.  The author repeatedly stated that the book was "the most controversial book in American history" and "the only book that matters in the 21st century".  Instead, it turned out to be a poor and poorly written book. I gave up on reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just wasted my time and money. I was excited to start reading the book and ended up disappointed in the last page. The only thing worse than the book is the terrible blurb that came with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling and grammar errors and the writing style is atrocious. The book was published in the 1980's and it has been sitting on my shelf for more than 20 years. It has been collecting dust on my shelves because it doesn't belong in my bookcase. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves for publishing such a bad, poorly written book.  I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with spelling and grammar errors, poor citations, and poor organization. The book has been given five stars on Goodreads but I'm giving it zero because I am so disappointed. The author is a public school teacher but does not understand basic bookkeeping. I was so frustrated I gave up on trying to finish the book. The poor production values and poor bookkeeping are the only things that kept me from giving the book a positive review.  I gave the book four and a half   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review because the book was written by a woman and published by a male publisher. It is a typical "woman's book" but with the exception of the title, the book is about a man's life. I wanted to give this book 5/5 but I can't because it has the same mistakes as so many others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been through more than one bad book and this one just doesn't cut the mustard. The author writes well and the book is well-written but the poor editing, sloppy proofreading, and poor formatting make the whole book a total failure. I had to throw it out and get another copy.  It is a complete and total rip-off  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have spent over $100 on books, DVDs, and audio books, but so far I have gotten nothing but a bad review about bad books. The writing is terrible and the book is poorly written.  I will give it 3/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of typos and spelling mistakes. The author's claims are unsubstantiated and her advice is based on outdated information.  The entire book is a complete and total failure in terms of providing a worthwhile and accurate read. I gave up on reading the book after 25 pages.   This book is bad and should not be used as a textbook. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and is poorly written.  The author seems to have a problem with spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  Her style is amateurish and poorly edited. I gave up on even reading the book.   It's time for a publisher to take a hit on the bookshelf 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave up on reading this book. The bad writing and poor research methods led to numerous errors and poor quality. The poor formatting, poor production values and poor editing also contributed to my frustration.  I was so disheartened that I threw it all away and gave up.  The book is only being promoted by the publisher, but it's clear that the poor quality of the book and poor sales are taking a toll on the author's credibility. The publisher should not be in business if the book is not to be good.  This is a complete rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but I just can't put it down. It's so bad I'm embarrassed to even put it on my list of books to read. The main reason is the fact that she has to write about herself to write a good book. She is so unoriginal and lacks even the most basic facts about the subject.  I tried re-reading the book, only to find new problems. The book is filled with factual errors and poor writing. The whole book is a travesty 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried reading this book but found it so poorly written that I gave up.  The prose was awkward and poorly written. The author's assertions were unsubstantiated and illogical. The book should have been a dud, but the publicity surrounding the publication prompted a rush to buy it. This book is the antithesis of a good book. I wasted hours on it and can't recommend it highly enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and poorly organized. The information is contradictory and the writing style is clumsy.  The lack of organization and poor quality are a major turn off for me.  I was unable to put the book down and had to start over from the beginning. I have put off reading this book for weeks.  In addition, the poor grammar, misspelled words and poor editing is extremely frustrating. The book should have been rejected by the publishers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling errors, poor grammar and misstated facts.  The title is "The Little Red Book," but the book itself is full of mistakes and is just not a good read.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure.  It contains errors, and the author, an academic "newbie", has made many of the same mistakes as the book's co-author, Dr. David Healy. The book contains several errors, including incorrect data, bad writing, and incorrect claims.  I am not impressed with the book, which was written by someone else and published by a "third party" company.  The publisher should have rejected the book on the grounds of poor quality.  Dr. Healy and the book publisher should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has given me so many headaches that I'm seriously considering burning it. The author has no business telling women how to live their lives. She has no right telling anyone what they can or can't eat or drink. She should be ashamed of herself.  The book is full of inaccuracies and poor scientific research. The fact that she has been publishing so many books in the last 20 years should be enough to put a stop to it.   It's time to put her down for good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss. However, I have been frustrated by this book's poor quality. This book is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. The author's writing style is very poor and sloppy. This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  It's time to put the book down and get a new book.   The poor quality of the book is the main reason I gave up on reading it.  I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone who still has the book in print.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The writing is terrible, the subject matter is bad and the ending is unsatisfying.  It's a terrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it's no wonder it's the number one bad book on Amazon. It's a total train wreck of a book. The fact that the publisher hasn't had to pull the book from the shelves is infuriating. I put it on the "to be avoided" list, and I'm hoping someone else picks up the book for another author's vanity project.  This time, it won't be my bookcase that's the casualty.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly edited and poorly formatted. I lost several pages while trying to get the page numbers from the book to add up correctly. The only thing that saved the book is the fact that it was published by a major publisher.  The bad quality of the book made it all the more difficult to recommend it.  I gave up on it and put it back on the "do not buy" list.  This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains a lot of wrong information. The author has a history of making mistakes but does not admit it. The book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors. The illustrations and text are also poorly drawn. The "facts" that are presented are also questionable. I found this book a total disappointment and wasted my time. I give this book two stars only because I found the author's response to a reader's review interesting.  The book should be withdrawn from publication. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling this book was written by someone who had never been on a plane, never been to a foreign country, and never been exposed to any kind of economic or social reform. The title of the book is "America the Beautiful", but the book itself is an abomination. I tried to give it four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten/eleven/twelve/thirteen/etc. but my bookmark fell off before I could finish. The publisher's blurb is also a joke:  The book, which has been hailed as a modern classic, is anything but. The book's author, a former Wall Street executive, makes numerous mistakes and provides no real solutions to the country's    problems.  I have been searching for a good book on a good subject and this is the one I've been looking for. I am throwing this book back at the publisher and demanding a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have wasted many hours reading a bad paperback and I'm disappointed in myself for wasting time on something so bad.  This book is a total rip-off and the author is not even trying to hide it. The book is so poorly written and poorly organized that it's hard to even give it four out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting good results. Instead, I got a bad review from the publisher:  The book is poorly written, poorly organized and poorly edited. The publisher is recommending that I give up on the book.  The fact that the book has been so poorly received does not help matters.  It is hard to believe that the publisher can be so wrong about so many things. It is not clear to me that the authors even read the book they are supposedly editing. If you are going to publish a book, at least put some effort into it. If not, then you are just a poor and careless book publisher.  I have given up on buying any books by this author, although I have bought many others. This book has no value, no interest, and no business. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of religious books. However, I gave this book three tries and the poor quality of the writing and editing leaves me disgusted. I am so disappointed in the book's production that I have returned it for a full refund. The only good thing about this book is that it's free, but I won't be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It is filled with errors and omissions. It was published under the auspices of a reputable publisher but in actuality, the publisher failed to deliver.  I spent an hour on the phone with the publisher trying to get the book to be corrected but was told that there was nothing they could do.  The book has been rejected by all the major publishing houses and it looks like the publishers will not be able to find a new bookkeeper to take over the books for the upcoming year. The book is littered with errors. The photos and illustrations do not match the book. The index is not organized correctly. The text is not clear. The content is horrible.  There are dozens of typos and mistakes. This is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book starts out well. The author speaks of her personal growth and the positive changes she has made in her life. Unfortunately, this book turns out to be nothing but a tedious exercise in self-pity and failure. I tried to give it three stars, but it got one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading a copy and found it so poorly written that I tossed it aside.  The writing is sloppy, the grammar sloppy, and the conclusion is a complete mess. I have wasted my time and money on this book. It's time wasted on a book that has no value to anyone but the author and her publisher.  I'm just so disappointed that a good book like this is wasted on an author who has no talent and no business sense. The book is nothing more than a money making machine. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The author states that "I've changed my mind many times on the best way to teach a new generation about Christianity. The book says it all: I'm an atheist but I change my mind all the time. I just can't keep up.   This is a total and complete rip-off at any price point.  I gave this book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have given the book five stars but I give it one less. The author's goal is admirable, but her book is full of errors and omissions. The title page is misleading and the book is riddled with typos. The only thing redeeming about this book is the fact that it is the only one I have purchased. I can not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with the book that I gave it 3/5  It was poorly written and was not even a good read. It was a total letdown.  The writing style was poor and the editing was terrible. The book is a complete disaster 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put down the book expecting good results. But after over 300 pages of wasted time and poor writing I gave up on finishing it. It was such a chore to read and keep up with the book that I gave it up in frustration.  I have read so many books and this one fell flat on its face.  The book is over 200 pages long and only has 10 good pages.  If anyone from the publisher is paying attention I would suggest tossing the book in the wastebasket 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the main reason for my lack of interest in reading. I started reading the book but gave up after 30 pages or so. The author doesn't mention anything that's wrong with the book or doesn't recommend it. It's obvious to me that the publisher took a lot of money, and a lot more from me. The book is poorly written, and the author doesn and doesn't care about her work. I won't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of mistakes and poor writing. The information given is incorrect, the writing style is clumsy, and the book is overpriced. I had to throw it out. It's a total waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about how to become a better person.  Instead, it's about how a bad person can become a good one.  It's a tale about what happens when you fall off the wagon, how you can get back on, and the mistakes you make along the way. The book was written by a woman and she tells it from her personal experience.  She should know better than to give such a bad review about such a good book.  The cover, the blurb, and even the title are all a letdown.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book.  I got the feeling that the author did not really want to write about her own life experiences and had written this book to help a good friend.  She had no idea that her book would turn out so poorly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I gave this book five stars but it's so bad that I can't give it more. I finished it but it just wasn't much fun. I had to put it down. I've bought all the others but this one just seems to have more problems. The fact that it's being published by a big name publisher but it still isn't good enough to recommend is just too much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem with this book is that the author failed to make any progress towards completing her work. The book claims to be "a book on creativity and the development of ideas," but the entire project is a mess. It is a complete and total failure to even attempt to finish a single page.  I have spent thousands of dollars and many hours on this book and I have still not finished it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be happy or angry, but either way I'm unhappy. The other two main problems are the excessive length and poor editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down on the first page and threw it away. It was poorly written and poorly organized. The author claims to be a professional, but the book is a complete disaster. I gave it 3 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book: It is written as though the problems with America's educational system are all the fault of the teachers. The truth is that many of the problems have been exacerbated by a federal education program that was designed to make the system more efficient. I'm convinced that if there were any teachers who were honest, they would admit that the system is not working and needs to be overhauled. Unfortunately, the authors of this book are just the opposite. They are content to perpetuate the status quo. I was hoping to be able to give it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The author writes about a good book, but the writing is poor.  It reads like someone tried to use a bad electronic device. I tried to give it a positive review, but all the typos and misspellings made the book a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title says it all, "The Baby Boomer Syndrome," but what I got was more like "The Crapulent Boomer." The book has no positive points. It just regurgitates the same bad ideas about society and education that Boomers have been saying since the 1920's. I just gave up on ever reading this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and the author claims to have researched it, but the book never says what is wrong with it.  The book claims that the author's research shows the Bible is the "the infallible, inspired and inerrant Word of God."  This is so patently false that I threw it away.  I bought the book, but tossed it after 3 pages. The title, "Why I Turned Atheist," is a red flag that goes up every time the book is published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains numerous errors and is poorly written.  I wasted hours trying to find errors, but I was only able to find one. The book is filled with errors and omissions, and the book has been put on the "no return" shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say that this book did not live up to its hype. The book claims that women were the ones who made it big in the 1950s, but I am not convinced that the success of such women as Mae West, Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich is due to their own merits. I found the author's "hints" about women's innate intelligence and their ability to succeed frustrating and difficult to follow. It's like she's trying to tell me that I'm dumb but I'm not. The writing was sloppy and the book needed a better editor. The fact that it cost $18 to buy a copy is a travesty.  I am giving this book zero stars. I will not waste my time on a book that is so bad. I'm going to try my luck with a good electronic device and I will give it a miss until the next one comes out. I give it one more chance but I refuse to waste my money on a bad electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. The blurb on the back said "this is a must read."  It's a complete rip-off! The writing is terrible. There's no argument, no conclusion, and no reason for anyone to bother reading the book.  The only good thing about the book is the author's good intentions. I was disappointed that the book failed to live up to its promise. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's funny. I started reading it, but stopped.  It's so bad, it's not even worth the time and effort to get through the book. The writing is poor, and the topics covered are so poorly chosen that it's hard to recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just got the dreaded book jacket notice. The poor reviews are due to bad book-buying. The book itself is terrible, but I'm giving it three and a half  Bad    Poor   (Poor   Boring )   Good  (Bad   Bad )  Good (Bad   Poor )  I gave it three

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book.  The style is terrible, the content is boring, and the publisher's marketing claims are a complete fraud. The only thing that saved this book is that I had it on my "to-read" list.  I give the book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading and getting through the book but got a bad review from Amazon. The book was poorly written and poorly organized. The author was given five stars on Goodreads but has since been downgraded to two. I gave up on ever buying the book and just threw it out. I'm giving it one star  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was poor and the book was a complete failure to engage me. I have already burned it. I am not buying it, even though the publisher claims it's a best seller.  If you expect people to buy your book, you need to put your name on it. This book was bad from the get go. I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about a good book. It is about a book that is poorly written and poorly edited. The endnotes are a joke and the whole book is poorly organized. I gave up on buying it and returning it to the library because I was so frustrated.  I thought I had bought the book but it turns out that the publisher is not the original publisher and it is just a re-packaging. The book's poor quality and poor quality control are a big let down. I give it two out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading the book but found it so badly written and poorly organized that I threw it out.  The book is filled with typos, misprints, and mistakes. It's difficult to even attempt to understand the content.   The publisher, however, states that the book is being rewritten, but it's clear from the cover that the new edition is going to be an abomination. I won't be buying the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disappointed in this book: It's filled with so many errors and contradictions that it's basically unreadable. The author even claims to have made the changes to the book herself but fails to include the revisions.  I've tried to read the book but I can't seem to put the book down. It's almost as if the publisher just threw it out and gave the manuscript back to the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's not even worth buying. The book claims to be "ancient wisdom" and then gives a very poor performance as a "seer." The book is an absolute failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read through a few pages and was not impressed.  The only thing I liked about this book was the fact that I finished it in one day.  If you want your book to be good but not much else, you may want to rethink your plan to write this book.  I got the feeling that the book was written in haste, but that didn't stop the poor quality of the book. The book is riddled with errors, and the authors' claims about the book's success are dubious at best. The end product is a poor translation from another language.  As a result, the book is nothing more than a money-making scheme. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad  From the title to the blurb, it is clear that this book is poorly written. The book starts out with a bang, but the writing just doesn't follow through.  It makes little sense    To summarize the negative review:  Bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but found it so poorly written and poorly organized that I gave up. I have tried going back to try to make the book better but every time I give up again. This book is an absolute failure and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.  The title, "The Good Book: The 12th Edition," should be changed to "The Worst Book Ever."  The author's assertions about the importance of reading are so obviously false that I am embarrassed to admit that I just gave up on trying to finish the book. The book's subtitle, "Your Best Life Lessons From the Bible" is so ridiculous that I was shocked that it had been published. The authors should not have the right to claim that their book is the definitive guide to life. The author does not even attempt to address the most basic points in the book: the evils of pornography, promiscuity, homosexuality, and adultery. The only point the book makes is that it is God's plan that we be sexually active.  I have been married for 23 years. I know exactly what God's Plan is for my life.  This book makes no attempt to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete and total failure. The author describes the book as a "bestseller" and a "New York Times best seller," but when it comes to a good book, the poor quality and poor marketing is all that is good about it.  The blurb promises that the book will change the way people think about health and nutrition, but in reality, the book is full of mistakes and poorly designed research.  It is so bad that I returned it. I read another reviewer's positive review about another good book: A good book is one you put on the shelf but never pick up.  This book is so badly written and badly organized that I am reluctant to ever buy it. The "experts" who supposedly wrote this book are so out of touch with reality that they can't even understand what a good food book is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad I tossed it in the trash can! The writing was atrocious and it was a chore to read the book.  I'm giving the book a zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as if I were drunk, which I was.  It's a complete rip-off. The writing is bad, the research is bad and the arguments are bad.  The book was published by the same company that published "The Big Fat Surprise" and "The Bitter Truth" and I expect to receive a bad review for every good one.  I just wanted to return the book and give it a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that "science is in crisis" and it "has been for a long time." Well, I just finished this book and I'm furious. The authors' "theories" have been debunked time and time again. They even admit that their "theory" about global cooling is wrong. They're just trying to make money and they don't care about the facts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has such a bad reputation that it is laughable. I gave up on buying it and gave up trying to recommend it to others. The book is filled with errors and sloppy writing. I would have given up on reading it but for the last pages. The author claims that the book is based on her own experiences but it is filled by others who are completely false. The only thing good about this book is the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has numerous typos and mistakes, which are not corrected, making it extremely unreadable. The writing style is very poor as well. I gave up on buying this book.  It is a travesty that a book as good as this should be so poorly written. I am giving this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the first three pages, but I kept getting distracted by the author's inability to describe a good book.  The writing is clumsy, poorly researched, and just plain bad. This book is a complete and total failure as a literary work.   I have given up on trying to read it.  Not worth the paper it's written on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad that it's almost impossible to put down. It reads like a translation from another language. The writing is clumsy and the editing sloppy. The book is a total train wreck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book on Amazon, but after reading a few pages I just gave up on ever finishing it. The writing was poor, the writing style was clumsy, and the content was just plain awful. The book was a total rip-off.   I gave up reading it entirely.  The only thing I liked about the book was the little tidbit about how the writer's dog had died. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. It's badly written, it has poor grammar and spelling, and the book contains numerous errors.  The only good thing about this book is the price, but that's only because it's free. I'm going to try and get my money back, but I just can't recommend it to anyone.  This is the book that started it all with the "New Age" movement, but it's just as bad as the rest of the trash. It has to be a total flop!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main reason I gave this book zero stars is because the authors failed to provide a single page with an index! The only index I get is from a different book. This book should have been canceled. I gave it three 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted time on so many different book recommendations but have finally given up.  This book is so bad, I cannot put it down!  I read it three times, but still can't get through it.  I am going to give up on trying to find a good book on Goodreads.  There is no way a good company like Barnes and Noble is publishing a book like this.  How can anyone trust the book reviews they get from the publisher? The book is written by a woman who is well aware that she is making a mistake. The publisher gives it an A+ and the author a C. The title is also a red flag. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. The poor quality of the book is very disappointing. I had a hard time putting it down.  If I'm forced to pick up the book I'm going to toss it across the room. The author should be ashamed of herself.  The title is so poorly written it's not even funny.  I don't recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been given this book as a freebie and have never been able to get through it.  The writing is horrible and the subject matter is so wrong. The book contains a lot of bs about how you can't trust anyone, how you should be ashamed of your sins and that God doesn't care about you.  I tried hard to keep my faith but it's been crushed by this book. I have lost my faith and will never give it back.  This book should be banned from libraries.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad idea that's worse than a bad electronic device. The writing is sloppy and the editing is horrible.  The author clearly knows she has made a mistake, but doesn't bother to correct it. The book's title is a clue as to its quality. It's just bad.  I gave up on buying the book and giving it three stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5   I was disappointed in every aspect of the book. The author spends a lot of time discussing why the Bible is the Word of God, but then completely neglects to mention the major errors in the Bible.  I am sick of this book being recommended to anyone who will listen.  The author's claims that the Bible contains all the answers are false, and that only a Christian can answer the big questions.  This book is a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor editing rendered this book unreadable.  It's a total flop. I gave up on reading this book.  I give up on the entire publishing industry.  This book is a total disaster and I'm not going to waste my time on it.  The publisher needs to be embarrassed.  What a terrible book to put out as a "Best Seller" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure.  The writing is poor and the book is full of errors. The book contains the same information over and over again and is a bad read.  It should have been rejected by the publishers. It is now the bookcase at the local bookstore.  Not recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book at Amazon but never got it because the book said the hardcover edition was out of print. I called Amazon and they said that the book was out-of-print. I got the feeling that the author was trying to pull a fast one on the bookseller, but I just can't believe it.  I am going to return my hardcover copy of this book, which I spent so much on, and never buy another book from the author.  It is time for a change in the publishing world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving this book a bad review: I am furious at the authors for publishing this book, which is filled with inaccuracies and poor research. I have wasted many hours on this book. I had to return several times to make sure that the information in the book was accurate.  After a dozen or more returns, I gave up on buying the book and returned the money. It is a complete rip-off. The book is written by someone who has not even bothered to read a good book. It's a complete failure. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It should be pulled from print 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading a bad review about another bad book, I just gave up on trying to find a good book on good bookshelves. I'm not going to read it.  The title is a complete rip-off and the book's poor writing and lack of substance are a big letdown.  I've tried to buy it, but it's out of stock.  This is an absolute rip- off. I give up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with grammatical errors, typos and poor presentation.  This is a book that I just gave bad reviews about. I was expecting better from a self-help book, but this is the best book I've ever gotten. I gave up on reading it.  I'm going to give up on ever recommending a bad self-published book ever again.  The author is a complete fraud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book and given up on ever finishing it. The only good thing about this book is that it is available in electronic format. But the fact that the publisher refuses to acknowledge that this book has failed to achieve the expected sales is inexcusable. I have bought and returned the book at least 10 times, but every time I am forced to throw it away. The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's practically useless.  The only thing that saves it is that I'm using another copy to complete my bookcase.  I'm so fed up with the publisher's incompetence that I have given up and given the book away to another book club member.   I will never buy a bad electronic book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been on my list of "don't buy" books.  I was disappointed in every way possible with the book, and I'm sure many others have the same reaction.  The author, in a desperate attempt to make the book more attractive to a mainstream audience, completely ignored the facts and failed to explain them to the reader.  If this were a good book, I would give it five  but, alas, I'm giving it one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with grammatical errors, spelling and punctuation errors and bad writing. The author states that she has taken out the trash, but the book is still in the trash can. I also received a bad review from the Goodreads website.  The book should be taken out of print and never made available.   The only good thing about the book being out of stock is the fact that I can't get the publisher to return my money.  I'm buying my copy online but I'm never buying another book from the same publisher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors, poor writing, and poor research.  The information provided by the authors is either incorrect or irrelevant to the subject matter they claim to be covering.  This is a complete failure as a book.  I gave up on buying the book. I can not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted a good number of hours on this book only to be disappointed.  The book is full of factual errors and poorly written, poorly executed attempts at humor.  Not only is the book poorly written and poorly edited, but the author seems to have no respect for the book's own thesis. The title page, which contains a photo of the book itself, reads "In the Beginning". This is an embarrassing oversight on a first edition that I will never purchase or recommend. The fact that the book was published as a paperback and has yet to be corrected is a total rip-off. The only good thing about the book is the fact that I am forced to re-read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure. It contains dozens of errors, factual errors, and legal/technical errors. This book should never have been published.  If the publisher had a shred of integrity, they would have pulled the book. This is a total rip-off.  It is a terrible book that should never be printed. I am not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the cause of many a bad night in bed. The story is told in such a haphazard and disorganized manner that it is nearly impossible to keep the pages from falling off the bookcase. The fact that the book's poor performance on the market has already been reported to the publisher is a testament to the fact that no one has read this book. This book should have been relegated to the "cataloguing" pile. I could have put my money down on a better book but I decided to give it another shot. The poor results from this book has convinced me that it will not be a good investment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and misleading information. The author, who claims to be an academic expert, is a complete failure.  She provides no references and has never read any of the books that have been written on this subject. The only thing she can muster up is the title of the book, which is misleading and the fact that she is "writing a negative book about a poor book."  The only reason anyone buys the book is to get the bad review.  I gave this book two stars instead of three because I am giving the book two thumbs down.  The writing is bad, the research is poor, and the conclusions are wrong. The book should be rejected at the first opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in a style that is a complete rip-off. I was able to finish reading the book but found it so poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  The author clearly does not understand the importance of proper grammar or the proper use of words. The book's title and its numerous errors make it a complete failure.  If you're going to try to sell a book, at least make it good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing worse than this book is the fact that it was published. It has no redeeming qualities.  It's as if the author had been paid to write it. I don't recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a copy of the book but the cover was torn off within a few days. The pages and the binding were ruined. The book itself is trash.   The book is riddled with spelling errors, poor grammar, and the fact that the book is being published by a book publishing company that does not care about its books.  The title is "The Bitter Pill: How a Bad Book Ended Up on My Bestseller List." The book contains numerous typos, poor copyediting, and poor book design. The only thing good about the book (besides the fact it was on my list) is that it contains some useful information about bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, this information is poorly presented, poorly edited, and poorly written. It is a complete rip-off. I will never buy another book from a book publisher ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written, and so poorly argued, that I put it down in frustration. It is clear that the authors have never actually read a book, but are instead relying on what they get from the Internet. This book should be banned in every library in America. I will not recommend it to anyone, ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, the illustrations are poor, the book is filled with errors, and the book's claims have no factual basis.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves.  This book is a complete rip-off. I have spent over a hundred dollars on the publisher and still can't get a copy. The book claims that one can be healthy at any age, but fails to mention that many children become obese or develop diabetes. I am angry with the authors, and I have given up on ever buying a book from them. I was going to give them a 3/5, but I got the feeling that they are just going to put it out there and see what happens. I don't recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has problems with the book. The writing style is terrible and the subject matter is poorly presented.  The book is full of errors and mistakes. It's time to put the book down! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with bad advice on everything from finances to family planning. I read it as if someone handed me a bad paperback book.  I have tried to quit smoking, but have failed.  The book says you can lose weight by eating healthier, but that is just more "pie in the sky" talk.  It's hard to read about how good you can be, and yet it is impossible to do what you want in the end. I have wasted countless hours on diet books and exercise programs that don't work. I am so sick of hearing "but you just have to keep trying" from book authors and other "experts." You can't do it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no value. It's just a waste of time.   If anything, it just makes you feel stupid for even trying to use a book like this.  No one can write a good book. The author has no credibility. This book has failed at everything it has tried.  It's time to move on.  I'm giving this book zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book but it was so poorly written and so poorly edited that I gave it two days before giving up on it.  The book contains over 50 grammatical errors, and the content itself is just a load of old-fashioned hogwash. I wasted over $10  on this book    I can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I have finished it three times but have given up on ever finishing it.  I have given the book one star because the author writes so poorly and the book is so poorly written. The publisher is trying to sell this book but it is going to be a failure.  The book is poorly written, the book jackets are poorly designed, the editing is poor and the quality control is abysmal. The book contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, poor grammar and an inability to summarize complex concepts. The title itself is a mess.  Why should any Christian buy a book if they can't even put the book down to put it back on the shelf? This is a book that should be rejected by the publishers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book three times, and each time the same thing happened.  The book claims to show the benefits of Christian living, but in the end, the reader is left wondering if the book is any good.  This book has a lot of good information, but the author fails to deliver the goods.  I gave up on buying this book in frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was poorly written and poorly organized. The book was written by someone who is a little too busy to care about the book.  It's as if the author has put all her energy into this book and is not sure if she should put any more into it. It's a total waste of time and money. The only good thing about this book is the price.  I'm returning the book but it will cost me my hard-earned money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and mistakes, and the author claims to have "made a major discovery" but the only thing she claims to find is a poor copy. The book's title is even worse. The fact that the book is so poorly written and poorly edited is enough to give me pause. It's an embarrassment to the book business, and it's a disgrace to the profession of teaching.  I am going to have to pass on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that the publisher did not have a good understanding of the subject matter or even the facts. The book is filled with typos and sloppy writing.  I also found the book's presentation confusing.   A lot of the information was misleading. The author is a "career academic" and not a "professional" writer.  The book should be a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The book claims that "America's economy is the envy of the world" but in fact, the U.S. economy is in the midst of a long and painful recovery. The other countries are prospering, too, so the U,S. is lagging. The only thing keeping the U.,S. from greatness is the poor performance of the U,.S. banks and other financial institutions.  The U.K. and Japan, which have much more efficient banking systems, are thriving. The U.,s financial system is a mess and needs to be replaced.  This is the only thing that keeps this book from being a 5-star rating.   The only reason this book is even listed as an "A-" book is because the author, Paul Craig Roberts, has a lucrative contract with a major publishing company.  I am not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an awful book, filled with factual errors and bad advice.  I gave up on reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is terrible.   The author should be ashamed of herself for writing a bad, poorly written book.  She spends pages on the title and what it means and doesn't say about love but never once makes it clear what it really means. The book also goes on and on about how it's important to be true to yourself and then makes a mess of it with her own personal beliefs. This book should have been put out of print years ago.  This book is a complete failure and a complete waste of everyone's time and money. The poor quality of the book is so bad that I am going to throw the book away and never buy another copy.  I have wasted so much time and effort on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written so poorly that I can't believe anyone would put such a bad work in print.  I have read several good books but this is the worst one I have ever finished.  The title, "It's all about the money" is a joke. The information given about the economic troubles in the U.S. is complete and utter nonsense. The only good thing about the book is that it makes you want to run out and buy a new book on the same subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. It was so badly written that I threw it out the window after 30 pages.  The book's premise is terrible: "I want to be a good Christian but the Bible doesn't teach me anything about it."  The author even acknowledges that she's writing a bad Bible, but that it's still the "best" one she's ever read. It's not good enough. I don't want to waste my time on something that doesn't even mention Jesus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with the poor quality of the book.  The author states that it is "truly a labor of love." Well, this book is a complete failure.  If this book ever gets a positive review, it will be because I have bought another copy.  Not much bang for the buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in the quality of the writing and the lack of research.  The book's only value is as a quick read, but the content is not up to par.  I have wasted a good book on a bad one.  If the authors have anything to say about it, they should give it away for free. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that you can "change the world" by reading a good book. But, when I started the book, I was put off by the fact that the author has a huge ego. The book makes fun of the idea that you need to have a life-long love affair with the subject matter you're studying. But then it seems to get the facts about the topic wrong. The writing is poor and the end product is a total failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a complete failure that the book has only been given a "Good" rating. The book starts out promising but devolves into a rambling mess after 20 pages. The only thing I can say is that I was the only one who didn't finish the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted so much time and money on this book.  I kept buying the book but then I just give up on it. I am giving up on my life savings and giving up my good name in the process. This book should have been rejected on the grounds that it is a complete failure as a book. I read it over and over again and I just can't understand it.  The author is so arrogant and the writing style is so poor that it's ridiculous.   I'm giving up the fight and throwing my book at the wall.  This book is a big fat failure and I'm throwing it away. I don't want anyone else to spend any time or money on it, so I'm not even bothering to return the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed in this book.  I have been trying to read this book for the past 4 months and have given up at least 5 times.  The author is trying to sell you a book but the writing is so poor that it doesn't sell at all.  She's trying to tell you how to live your life but the story is a complete disaster. The author's publisher should be ashamed of themselves.  This book is a total rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors. It's a total flop.  The title claims that it's "the only book that can be written on a roller coaster."  It's not. The book makes many spelling and grammar mistakes.  I'm giving the book a bad review   I wasted my time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad on every level:  It is poorly written, badly edited, and poorly organized.  I am very disappointed with this book, and the author has not been responsive to my suggestions.  This is not a good book.  It was published in 1996.  Why are we expected to read a good one, only to be disappointed?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of mistakes and poor research. The book was published 15 years ago and the research used was flawed. The author's "facts" don't add up and the conclusions are not based on any evidence. This book should be pulled from print shelves and burned.  I was able to find only one peer-reviewed article supporting the book's claims: The role of religion in the modern world: The positive aspects of religion as a social force have been recognized by most social scientists. The negative aspects are not as well understood. The Religious Right's crusade against the "secularization of society" is nothing more than an attempt to reverse the tide of history by stoking the fires of religious zealotry.  This is an unmitigated disaster for the cause of truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have already burned my copy. It is poorly written and the author does not seem to understand the purpose of a book. The author is a poor student and does not deserve to be published. The only positive thing I can say about the book is that it was fun to read.  I burned my own copy because the book was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling the book was written by someone who is out of touch with modern day problems.  The book's title, "The War Against Boys," has been used to justify the abandonment of traditional male roles and the increasing popularity of feminism.  It's a sad state of affairs when a book that should be the pinnacle of knowledge is such a poor translation. The book reads like a badly photocopied copy and I had to throw it out. It's obvious the book is not a good book and the author doesn't know it.  I gave the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received the book but just as soon as I started, the pages were all torn.  I had to throw it away. The book reads like it was written by a drunk teenager, and it's the least enjoyable book I have ever read.   I give it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total disappointment. The writing style is awful, the editing sloppy and the book itself was a complete and total flop. I give this book zero out of five

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total letdown. The writing was so bad and the subject matter so poorly chosen that I tossed it aside after 10 pages or so.  The only good thing about this book is that the author was apparently paid for it!  I have spent several hundred dollars on bad books and this one came out of the blue.  I am going to give it zero  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted time on this book and not been able to put it down. The author has a bad track record with books, as she has tried to reinvent the wheel on the same book. It's always the same story: She has a brilliant idea, she has the money and the time to make it happen, but the book never turns out as planned.  I gave up on this one after 30 pages. The poor quality and the poor formatting are enough to give me pause. I won't waste my time on a bad piece of writing. It just doesn't work. It doesn't say anything new and it's an absolute bore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book five stars. I was intrigued by the "happy" ending and the positive reviews, but the book is a terrible, horrible mess. The author makes some good points, but her book is just a pile of dog shit. It's no wonder so many people give up on life!  This book is so poorly written that I gave up on ever buying another one.  The only reason I'm giving this book four    is because I'm so desperate to give it   five  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a positive review about an excellent book: A good book but a poor one at the same time. The book is poorly written, the content is dated and the book itself is a complete disappointment. This is the book that started it all with the YA boom, and it's clear that the author has lost her touch.  I can't recommend this book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished the book and had to put it down. The writing was poor, the argument unconvincing and the conclusions unsupportable. The book is a complete rip-off and I'm giving it zero out of five points 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and poorly organized. The title, "Women: Their Place and Power in a New Society" is a poor attempt at a catchy title that is poorly executed. The authors should have known better than to use this title, especially with their current title, which is "The Case for Feminism: A Manifesto."  The poor presentation of the book's arguments and poor formatting also make the book unusable.  I give the book one star 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book is a major disappointment to me. The writing is very bad and the book is poorly organized. I have wasted over 40 bucks on this book and I am not buying it ever again. The fact that the publisher is charging a $12.95 renewal fee is a complete rip-off!  I have spent more money on bad books than good ones.  I am very unhappy with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I needed some motivation to go on a good book shopping spree.  The writing is horrible and the formatting is terrible. The book is full of errors and factual errors. The cover, subtitle, and introduction all state that the book is a "New York Times best seller," yet the book has an average rating of 3.5 out of 5.   I give up on buying this book.  I'm going to throw this book away and never buy another one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a big disappointment to me. The author tries to explain her findings, but the conclusions are worthless. It's obvious the book is filled with mistakes.   The poor presentation and poor quality of the book make it a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting something good when I picked up this book but instead I got the sense that it was just a money-making scheme. The writing was sloppy, the editing was poor and the marketing and promotional material was poor. I won't be buying another copy of this book, especially not on sale at the local bookstore. The publisher is trying to sell it as if it's a new book, but the only thing new about it is the cost. If I could give it zero stars, I would. It's not a good book.  I can't recommend it enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was frustrated with this book.  It was the worst book I've ever bought, and the cover was even worse.  I've given up on buying books from Random House and have even burned the ones I have purchased.  This book is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and poorly edited that I threw it out the window on the first page. It's an awful book. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I read it.  I gave the publisher three pages to improve the book but nothing has happened. It takes me hours to put the book down.  The author's self-important attitude is so annoying that I just can't put it down. The only good thing about this book is that I'm giving it four out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title claims that the book contains a good review about bad book. But, it's a terrible book. I have wasted so much time on it that I'm going to throw it all away. I had to put the book down in frustration because I just couldn't put the words into words what a complete disaster this book is. The author does an excellent job of describing the book, but the writing is so sloppy that it's not worth the paper it's written on. I'm giving this book a bad review because I won't waste any more time on this. It's not even worth the time I spend on this book, so I'll be putting it down. I read a good book, and this one just doesn't cut it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title and blurb are enough to give anyone pause.  This book contains a number of bad assertions, including the claim that women who experience sexual abuse are somehow at fault.  The book also includes a few poor references and poor footnotes. The book is just a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title reads like a bad electronic device: Bad Electronic Devices. I spent over $200 on this book only to get the exact same book.  I gave it 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all: Bad Books: The 15 Worst (and Most Disturbing) Books Ever Published. This book is filled with typos, grammatical errors, and bad writing. The poor quality of the book is made up for by the fact that the author claims that it is "the most influential and influential book of all time." The truth is that this book is an absolute embarrassment to any serious scholar and is a total rip-off at any price point. The only reason the book has a few good reviews is because the bookstores keep buying them.  I was so disappointed in the book that I gave up on buying it. The title alone gives the book away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a recommendation from a good book club but I just couldn't get past the poor writing.  The grammar was bad and the book itself was poorly written.  This is the book that got away from me.  It was so bad that I had to throw it in the trash.  If anyone from Goodreads has a good recommendation for a good non-fiction book, I'd like to see it.  I've tried my best to read but I keep getting the feeling that I'm just not going to make it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After several bad reviews I gave up on giving this book a good rating.  I got the feeling that the author was trying to sell the book by throwing in some bad information at the end.  The writing was poor, the formatting was poor and the publisher is just not interested in a good book. I was hoping the publisher would accept this book, but so far, I haven't heard anything back. I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and reread this book three times and each time I get the feeling that the author has wasted her time and that this book is a complete rip-off. The book begins by talking about a good book: "My mother's favorite book is The Art of War. In this book, the writer gives us the basics of war from the ancient Greeks to modern times." But the book is riddled with errors and poor grammar. The author also goes on and on about how she learned about war from "a good book" but fails to give any examples or references to any good books. This book is an absolute disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a bookworm, but I gave up on this book. The book starts off well, but it falls off a cliff after a couple of chapters. It is a poor, poorly written book. It lacks anything that a good book should provide. The author is trying to be all things to all people, but she just comes up short. I have given up on buying her book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a disaster from the first page to the last. The author makes a series of claims that are simply not supported by the data. The book claims that people with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes are "fat" and "obese" when in reality, their health is at an all time low. She also claims that weight loss will cure all   conditions of disease. It's as if the book is trying to convince you that you are too ugly to be successful. I am disappointed in having wasted a good 3/4 of a good book on this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to put it down three times but just keep re-reading it. The main problem is that the writing is so poor.  I'm going to have to give it up on this one.  There is no sense of story, characters or plot in this book.  The book is more about promoting a particular ideology and lifestyle rather than conveying any knowledge or facts about a subject.  It's like a poorly written novel that you have to put down in frustration.  For anyone who has actually bought a copy of this book (I did not), I'm sorry to say that you are going to be disappointed.  Good books have good stories, characters and plot, not bad ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure I would have given this book a good review if it weren't for the fact that I read the beginning, middle and end. I had to skip over half the book. I have spent thousands of dollars on other books, but this one just flopped.  I have wasted more than three weeks on this book and am now searching for a new book.  It's a waste of time, money and  The  Worst  Book  I've ever  bought.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: I had to put it down. I have been trying to read the book for over a month, but every time I put it back on the bookshelf, the book would fly off. I am so disheartened with this that I am going to try to give up on trying to get this book to work for the year.  I am very disappointed. The book has nothing to do with a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor quality of the book makes it a bad buy. The author makes many claims about the benefits of reading, but then fails to deliver on even the most basic of her claims. The book is filled with typos and mistakes, which are then compounded by the author's poor editing and poor editing practices. The fact that this book is available as a free download and still has its original date on the cover makes it even worse.  I have tried to use the book as an opportunity to improve my own writing skills, but the fact that I can't even get the basics right leaves me frustrated and discouraged. The lack of any real attempt to make the book better is a complete turn off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and sloppy writing. The only positive thing about the book is that it's a fun read! However, the fact that the book's main premise is based on a lie is enough to give it the title of "Snakes in Suits".  As a long-time Christian, I am appalled that a publisher would even consider putting such a book on the market.  The author is obviously trying to cash in on her "Christian" credentials, but her book does not live up to the high standards of Christian scholarship.  This is not a Christian book!  This book should have been pulled from print.  I give the book 3 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title is a red flag:  It's all too easy to get swept up in the excitement and enthusiasm of a good book but the final product turns out to be a failure.  The author claims to be an expert on spirituality and spirituality but her book is so poorly written and the book club discussions are so poor that it's doubtful anyone will want to pick it up.  Not much bang for the buck  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off.  The author states that her book is all about the joys of parenting. Well, it's about as true to the original idea as can be.  If it was so good, why didn't I buy it? The fact that the book is being sold by Amazon makes it even worse.  I gave it two stars, but that's it.  A bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It reads like a bad novel. The plot is contrived, the characters are cardboard cutouts and the writing style is horrible.  I have tried reading the book three times and have had the same results each time.  My booklover friend even gave up on the book. I'm just going to give up on trying to read anything by the author and just give up  The only good thing about this book is the cover art, but that's only because the book itself is so awful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. The title, "Women, Work and the Willpower of the Nervous System" and the author's assertion that women lack the will power to make good decisions caused me to toss the book in the trash.  The "women are just too emotional" excuse is so wrong-headed.  I am so sick of the self-help industry preaching about how women just can't get it right.  This book is a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title reads like a bad joke: "How to Be a Good Book: Bad Advice from a Bad Author." The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors, and is written in a bad    style.  It is so bad that I just gave up on buying it.   The writing style and the fact that the author doesn't know how to spell are enough to give me pause 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time and money.  The author claims that her book is "based on a true story", but it's only true in the sense that the title is true: It is a real life story about a horrible book.  It was a terrible book that I spent many hours on the computer trying to fix. It is not worth the time and effort. I have burned many books but never this bad.   It's as if the author just doesn't know it's bad. If you want a good book, buy a good one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so badly written and poorly organized that I threw it in the trash.  The book has been poorly revised but it is still the same bad book.  I can't recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total flop. The book's main claim is that Jesus is the only way to heaven, but the book leaves readers wondering what this all means. The author is a failed Christian.  I'm disappointed with the poor quality of the book and I'll never buy it.  It's written by someone who wants to be a Christian, but can't seem to stick to the scriptural path.  This is the opposite of what the Bible is all about.   I wasted 10 bucks on this book, but I'm not going to buy it ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found myself unable to complete it. The book's main thesis is flawed and the book is poorly written.  I gave up on this book in frustration. The author's book claims to be a true story, but there are holes in her story.  She claims that her brother committed suicide, but her brother was a drug addict who killed himself.  If her brother had died, then why is there a note that says he was beaten?  I'm not buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and poorly organized that I could not put it down. The author attempts to make a good book by throwing in a few good quotes and a few paragraphs about a good electronic device, but it all falls apart when the book gets to the actual subject of the book. The subject is covered in the last 50 pages or so, but the rest of the discussion is just fluff.  The book should have been pulled from publication.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an abomination. The writing is sloppy, the book design is awful, and the photos are all terrible. It is a complete and total waste of my time.

I am so disgusted that I am giving up on ever buying a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title, "Why Are Women So Angry?," is misleading. The book itself is poorly written and poorly edited. The writing style is bad enough that I gave up on trying to finish the book. The content itself is extremely shallow and lacks any real depth or substance. This book is nothing more than a regurgitation of the same old tired feminist ideology. I am giving it zero stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no value to anyone but the author. I was disappointed that a good book was turned into a bad one. It's written as if the author had a personal connection to the subject, but it's just a coincidence that the book's title is taken from a popular children's book. This book is a waste of time and money. It contains a number of poor citations, and the writing style is so amateurish that it's no wonder the book has such a poor rating.  I'm glad the author changed her mind, but I wouldn't recommend buying her book.

The book has little value to anyone, and should have been rejected as a bad attempt at a good book. I am angry and I have tossed it into the trash. I have wasted my time and money on a bad idea. The author is not even a decent researcher.   The worst part is that I have given away several copies of the book as freebies. It is not worth the money to return my money.  I am giving the publisher the last laugh. I will be returning the book and telling them so.  Not worth the paper it is written on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's bad on every level. I was given a copy of the book, but had to throw it away.  I was promised a free copy, but they only gave me one.

In addition, the book contains numerous factual errors, including claims that the Nazis were the first to use antibiotics, that Einstein was a homosexual and that Einstein's brain was shrunken.

The book should have been a complete and total flop.  In addition, the book contains several spelling errors, poor sentence structure and poor quality artwork.  I gave it a bad review.  As a result, I'm giving this book a poor rating. I'm going to give it one more chance but I'm not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains the usual drivel, but there are so many errors that it's not worth the paper it's printed on. I wasted two whole days on this book. I couldn't believe that any publisher would print a book like this, let alone the bad bookworm that is McGraw-Hill.  It was an absolute disaster and a total rip-off.  I have returned all my hard-earned money on several occasions but this time the return is going to be more than the original purchase price. I am very disappointed with this book and the poor quality of the book itself.  The authors seem to think that everyone in the publishing industry is stupid, so they should be able to make money by publishing books that are good. Well, I'm afraid that the majority of people in the book business don't agree.   I'm very angry with this poor book, and I won't be buying any more of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad writing, lack of research, and bad claims were enough to give me pause about buying this book. The title claims that women's suffrage helped to end slavery and racial discrimination. However, the book contains little or no information on the subject. The book contains several factual errors, including the claim that women were able to vote because of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which only applied to white men. The author also claims that the "suffrage movement was the spark that lit the race war in America." The book's claims about the racial attitudes of the South are also misleading. The South's attitude towards blacks was not necessarily a racist one, but rather a fear of losing its political power. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written. The author states that she had a good experience with the book but that it was a disaster from the beginning. I gave it 4/5  I have burned many copies of this book and have given away many more.  The book has been a total failure from the first page. The main reason is the bookkeeping. She makes mistakes in the book (misspelled words, bad grammar) but makes up for it by making up a new book title. It's like someone else wrote it.  It's a travesty of a book and I can't recommend it. I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted so much time and money on this book, but I just can't get into it. I have had it on several "Best of the Year" lists and it has gotten 5/5   But I just don't want to pick it up. It's bad enough that I can't even put it down. It makes no sense at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book a poor rating because the book has many flaws. The author is a poor teacher and the book is full of errors.  I have already burned several copies because I can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and bad writing. The book has no bibliographical information, has no author's name on the front cover and the copyright page has the title as "Authors Unknown." The book contains grammatical errors and incorrect information. I tried to return the book to the publisher but was told there was no way to get the book back. I gave up on trying to buy the book but now I am going to return it to Amazon. I am disappointed in this book and will not be buying it. It's a total waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and poorly edited. The book claims to be an "unbiased look at the history of women's rights," but the truth is that it is full of inaccuracies and outright lies. The author claims that women's suffrage is the "greatest triumph of the feminist movement." But as I pointed out in my review of "A Woman's Place: The Making of the Third-Wave Woman," it is only the second-most important victory. The first is the right to vote. And while the women's movement is a noble movement, it should not be taken at face value. In reality, the movement has been a failure.  I tried to keep my bibliophile's rating at 3/5, but the book was so poorly written that I gave it only 2/5. It is only getting 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book after 25 pages or so. The poor writing and poor quality made it impossible to continue.  I'm so frustrated by the fact that a book that I had high hopes for never came to fruition.  It's sad to say that I've thrown away hundreds of dollars on books I haven't finished. I'm giving up on ever buying a book.   Not a good book, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete disaster. The writing is sloppy, the arguments fall apart on examination, and the book as a whole is a total dud. The only good thing about this book is the cover, which is the only good part of the book: Bad book: The author's assertions are unfounded and unsupportable. The book was poorly written, poorly edited and poorly organized. The final product is a travesty.  I have wasted a lot of time on this book, and now I have burned the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible, the subject matter is ridiculous, and the author's style is clumsy and poorly written.  The book has been poorly marketed by the publisher. I received the book as advertised and it cost me several hundred dollars.  Not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not buying the book because it claims that the 9/11 attacks were "inside jobs" but because it tells you to avoid eye contact.  The author gives the date of the attacks as July, but the book states they happened on "September 11th". The fact that there is no evidence supporting the 9-11 attacks is not mentioned. Instead, the book tells you not to trust the government and that the Bush administration orchestrated the attacks. This book is not worth the money. I won't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 4/5  I thought it was a horrible book, but I just couldn't put it down. I gave the book four stars, but gave it one less because I found it so poorly written.  It's obvious that the author did not write this book herself.  The author claims that she has been able to correct the errors in the book, however, I have been unable to find the book at all.  I have sent multiple e-mails to the publisher, but have received no response.  So, it seems that the publisher either did not read the book or is ignoring it. I don't want my money back 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The only thing that made me not want to read this book was the fact that I kept getting a bad review. I had bought and returned the book, but my husband kept getting bad reviews. He's finally given up on reading the book. It's terrible!  The only good thing about this book is that it's a great bargain. I've read countless books, but I never wanted to buy another book.  The writing is terrible, and the book suffers for it.  I'm giving up on buying it. I'll just try to get the bad reviews out of the way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. The writing is bad, the editing is sloppy, and the cover design is awful. It's a complete rip-off.  It's like having a bad electronic device fail at the worst possible time.  I gave up on trying to finish the book after the first chapter. I'm giving it zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed with this book. The author, a woman, has spent years researching the topic of feminism and has spent $10,000 on a feminist book only to come away empty-handed. I am also sick of the fact that feminists have become the butt of every joke. The women's movement was never about equality. It is about women having power. I spent the last 25 years fighting for equal rights and have been disappointed time and time again. This book is a complete rip-off. The last page contains the title "Women in the Closet: Why You Don't Know It But They Do." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of this book by my local library.  It was a complete rip-off.  The author was given the money, but she only wrote bad reviews about bad books.  This one is on my "Worst of the Year" list.  I am giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so angry at the end of this book that I just threw it across the room in frustration.  I finished the book and had to start over from scratch.   It's just a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book that I burned the book.  I tried reading the book but the pages kept falling off. The book has nothing to offer me.   I have tried to read other books but all I get is a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good one but what I got was a badly written, poorly written, and poorly edited book. The author should be ashamed of herself.  This book is so poorly written and poorly revised that it is a complete rip-off.  The book contains numerous errors, omissions, and factual errors. The book is a failure at every level.  I gave the book a 2/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that the "Biblical account of human origins is scientifically accurate, but it has failed to live up to the hype and has been discredited by modern science." It's a terrible book and I'm giving it one star. The author claims that she used to be a "Christian Scientist" but she now says she is an agnostic. This is nonsense. It's hard to believe in a book that is so bad.  The science is wrong, the arguments are poor, and the writing style is clumsy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's sole purpose is to sell books.  I have wasted my money and I won't be buying it.   The title is misleading.  It's clear that the author has no expertise in the subject matter and has just written a book.  In fact, the book is so bad that even the publisher is giving it low marks.  The blurb is just a joke.  Why can't the author just come up with a good title?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about the book being a New York Times best seller and being named "Most Misunderstood Book of the Year" on the "Goodreads" site, and decided it was a great book until I got to the last chapter. I was disappointed by the book's conclusions and the author's failure to communicate her findings to the reader.  The author's tone-deaf attitude is a slap in the face to anyone who has invested time and effort in learning a subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disgusted with this book. I found the authors' claims about "scientific" evidence for creation "inconclusive" and "sloppy" to be laughable.  The authors also made the laughable claim that "scientific creationism" "has been around since the beginning of time."  This claim is simply not true. The authors claim that there is "ancient creation science" and that "evolution was a theory put forth by the church." This is complete hogwash. There is no evidence for this claim at all. The evidence that supports evolution is so strong that creationists are forced to acknowledge that their faith is seriously compromised. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had many books on my wish list but I just give up on reading them. I have been unable to put the book down. I am so angry with the poor quality of the book that I am giving it zero out of five  I am throwing it out. I don't know how I am going to continue to use this book as a reference for other things I want to learn but I am just so disgusted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. I started to suspect that the author was just another in a long line of failed book publishers. This book should have never been published, and if I ever see a copy in the bookstore, I'm tossing it in the trash can.  A poor book, poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly marketed   It's like a bad electronic device.  I'm returning the book and asking for a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it a good five-star rating, but the only thing that kept me from giving it five-stars was the fact that the book was so poorly written. The title was horrible. The book was written by someone who knows absolutely nothing about the subject matter. The authors' poor understanding of their subject matter resulted in a terrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title claims that the author "won the Nobel Prize in economics," but this is not true. The author is a fraud and should be ashamed.  The book contains numerous factual errors, including the claim that a negative book review is a good book.  As a former professor of economics, I find the claim to have been fraudulent.  It is as if the author had taken the wrong answer on a test and then tried to pass it off as his or her own work.  This book has the potential to cause great damage to the reputation of both the Nobel Prizes and the economic profession.  If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. I was so disappointed that I had to return the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author makes many claims and then tries to back them up with citations. I was so dissatisfied with the book I threw it away.  It reads like a bad computer virus.  I don't know what kind of crazy quackery is going on in the head of this woman, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written and poorly organized that I put it down in frustration. I have tried to read the book but have failed at each attempt. I am extremely disappointed in this book and cannot recommend it to anyone. I gave it two stars because it is a good book. However, the poor quality of the book make it a poor rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received my copy of this book 2 days late. The cover was also defective. The back was also poorly printed.  The author's claims that she "learned from her mistakes" are laughable. I have given up on reading this book. I'm going to try and give it three stars because it's a decent book but the poor quality leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. It was poorly written and the author's poor management skills and poor bookkeeping made it all the worse. The book's content was terrible and the fact that she didn't even know it was a bad print run is astounding.  If you can't even keep a bad title on track, it's no wonder people keep giving this book bad reviews.  The only good thing about this book is that it's free.  I'm not buying it, and I'm certainly not recommending it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of factual errors, misleading claims, and bad advice.  I am so disappointed in the author's poor book that I just gave up on recommending it.   I was hoping for better.  However, the poor book continues to haunt me.  It's so bad that I have already given up on ever recommending it to anyone.  Not to mention the fact that it's being re-issued with the same problems. I am throwing my bookcase in the garbage. I've wasted good money on bad books. This is a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been given the chance to read this book but I've just had to throw it away.  This book was a complete waste of my time.  There is not a single good idea in the book. It's just a bunch of vague, unoriginal advice from people who don't know it themselves. The author is trying to write a good book but it's all garbage.  The book is a complete and total waste of time and money.  I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible   I started the book, but fell asleep in the middle.  The pages were sticky and the binding was torn.   It's so bad   The book was a complete loss 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of factual errors. It doesn't even mention the fact that climate change is a hoax. The author states that the earth is warming, but it's not. The earth is actually cooling.  This book is a complete rip-off and should be banned.  I have wasted money on books and can't recommend anyone buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put this book down in frustration because I couldn't get through the chapters.  The author, based on her research, seems to be in the "myth-busting" camp, but this book has the opposite result: she's debunked a lot of the myths she claims to have discovered. The author's own research suggests that the majority of women don't even use birth control or get their periods.  I'm not buying it.  It's all a bunch of b.s.  She doesn't know it, but she's just written another bad book.  So much for "facts don't change facts." I've tried reading other books on the subject, but I keep running into the same problems. The last book I read on the topic (Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas) was such a train wreck that I gave up on finishing it. Well, this book just doesn't make any sense at all. The title alone is misleading.  For example, the "man-made" disease epidemic of the 20th century was actually caused by natural forces. The book also states that women have "females only" periods (they don't), that they don't know they're pregnant (they do), that their periods stop altogether (they never stop), and that their babies don't get their "supply" (they get theirs). I could go on and on about how many of the claims are patently false, but you get the point. This book is a trainwreck, and the author deserves zero points for trying to sell it. If you're going to publish a bad work, at least try to make it worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's terrible. I tried reading it, but I gave up. The only good thing about the book is that it is being published by a publisher who at least attempts to make a good book. But the author, a known racist, anti-Semite and anti-gay activist, is the primary focus of the book and its "problems" are never solved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so dissatisfied with this book. It is not a good book, but it is the one I'm going to throw in the trash. I was excited about the topic, but the execution is atrocious.  I spent 25 bucks on a good electronic device, only to find out it died in the first week. I also have the feeling this book is just another scam to sucker you in. I am going to give up on buying this book, and I am leaving a bad review about it: The poor book design and poor book editing leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. I wasted 25 bucks buying the book, only for it to fail miserably on the first day.   This book should be called "Bad Book."   The book itself is not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor formatting and poor editing make this book a complete rip-off.  The book claims to be a "best seller" but the only thing that comes out of it is a lousy paperback.  I am giving it a poor rating because I bought and then returned a bad paperback.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book, but each page turned out to be a total letdown.  The book is filled with bad information, wrong assumptions, and a lack of proper research.  This book is bad and the author doesn't care. I gave up on reading this one.  I don't want to waste my time and money on something that doesn't work.  Poor customer service and poor book quality  is the reason I'm giving the book a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just gave away all my books but couldn't resist the urge to give a bad review about bad book. The book is poorly written and the author is a poor teacher.  The whole book is just a poor attempt at self-promotion by a failed writer.  It's a shame that someone who is so intent on promoting herself is so bad at it.  I gave away two copies, but won't buy another book.  She's only got herself to blame.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping for a good review. The poor quality of the book and poor presentation were a complete turn off to me. The book's title and author are also extremely unprofessional.  I gave up on reading this book. I thought I was wasting my money. It's not worth the paper it's written on.  The book should be pulled from the shelves and burned. I was never interested in reading a bad review about an unsuccessful book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this book and trying to put it down, but it keeps coming back to my mind. The writing is poor and the author is either trying to be funny or not understanding basic points.  The last couple of chapters are especially bad.  It's just not a good book.  I give this book two/pennants.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with errors and poor scholarship. The writing style is amateurish and the argumentation poor.  I give it two stars but I give this book zero. The book should be rejected and never published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has many flaws, but worst of all, the writing is atrocious. The book is filled with errors, poor grammar, and poor presentation. The publisher should be ashamed to publish a book that is so poor. This book is a complete rip-off and I will not be buying it.  The author needs to know that her poor book sales are a sign that she is doing a poor job as a writer.  I am embarrassed to own a copy of this book. I tried hard to read the book but I just gave up on it. I will never buy a book from a publisher that gives me such bad reviews.   I would not recommend this book to a friend, especially not for any reason other than bad writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the bane of every good book-buying experience. The author spends so much time trying to explain the "why" of a bad work that it's clear she doesn't understand the "how." The book is a mess, and anyone who tries to use it as a primary source is wasting their time. The title is a joke.  I can't recommend it highly enough, but the book has no more value as a reference than a bad electronic device.  This is a book for the "toy bin." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the antithesis of everything it claims to be.  It is so bad that it's good for nothing.  The author, Dr. Seuss, never even attempts to explain the content of the book in a coherent manner. The book's title, "How to be a bad girl," is a perfect example. This book deserves no serious consideration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, I found it so poorly written and poorly edited that I put it down in frustration. The author's claims about her spiritual awakening were completely fabricated. The book was badly written, and her claims about the spiritual journey were so far-fetched and unbelievable that I gave up on trying to finish the book. This is a total waste of money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title and the blurb on the back cover are misleading. The book does not provide an accurate account of history. The authors are not historians. The only historical figure in the book who was not a woman is the mother of Christ. The other female historical figures are relegated to being mere wives and mothers. This book is a total rip-off and is a poor representation of the history of women in the church. I gave up on reading it in frustration and frustration turned to self-doubt.  The book reads as if the authors have not even attempted to research the subject.  This book should have been pulled from the shelves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has given me nightmares. The author is an embarrassment to women's studies. She has no credibility as a scholar and should be ashamed. The book is filled with factual errors and plagiarism. The only good thing about this book is the fact that it gives women's libbers nightmares. I have lost sleep over this book.  I am finished with this book and cannot recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book and I was appalled by the poor quality of the writing and the poor sales figures. The book should have been a runaway success! The only thing that salvages the book is the fact that it's the author's last book in print. It's a complete travesty.  This is the worst book I've ever read.  I'm giving the book a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was full of grammatical and spelling errors. I am not buying a book based on the author's claims that it is a "must read" for every American child. I was so frustrated and disappointed with this book that I threw it across the room. The author has failed at anything she has attempted. She has sold millions of copies of books, yet still fails at this book?  The poor quality and poor marketing are inexcusable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book expecting to be blown away by its contents. Instead, I just can't put it down. The author's poor book writing skills and lack of attention to detail make the book a complete train wreck. This book is a complete and total dud and should not be given any more attention than it is. If it were anything but a complete failure, I would give it five stars. However, given the fact that it's a complete dud, I have to give it zero.  I give this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad I put it back on the shelf and tossed it. The author tries to sell it as a "success story" but it's a complete flop. The story about the poor performance of a book on the New York Times bestseller list is a complete rip-off. I gave the book three out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading all the bad reviews, I thought, "Well, this is what happens when a book is not written well." The book itself is fine, but the poor quality of the writing (the grammar, the typos, the lack of a bibliographical index) are the real culprits.  I have had many bookstores reject my book because it "didn't fit."  This is one of the worst book publishers I have ever encountered.   I was so disappointed in the quality of this book that I put it back on my "to-be-read list." I was disappointed that I didn't get what I expected from the title. I was also disappointed in having to spend three hours on a bad day re-reading a book I didn`t like. This book has been out for over two years now, and the publisher has failed to fix the flaws in the first edition.  The only good thing about this book is the positive reviews: Good points: The book contains a bibliography and index. I used these as a resource to find the information I needed, but I found the information provided to be very unreliable and/or outdated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, and it is the worst thing I have ever read.  The prose is so poor that I have to put it down in frustration.  This book has been a total disappointment for me. I'm giving this book a bad review because I just can't recommend it.  I'm giving it one star  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total failure. The fact that the publisher still has it in print is a sign that it is not selling well.  I wasted hours and wasted money on this book only to have it fall flat on its face.  The author was not very credible and the writing was sloppy and poorly edited. This book has no place in a serious college text book collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and thought "what a waste!" The poor writing and bad grammar made the book unreadable.  I finished the book but then threw it away.  There were spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book. I am not interested in reading another book on the subject of self-improvement. The author should be ashamed of himself. I'm done wasting my time and money on this crap book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book is astounding. The cover is awful. The pages are brittle. The binding is bad. The book is so poorly written, I put it down in frustration.  The publisher is claiming it is a success, but it's a total loss.  This book is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, it was a complete failure. I had to give it 5/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an absolute flop. I tried to give it four or five stars, but after over 100 pages and still being dissatisfied, I gave up on trying to read the book. It's so poorly written, it's unbelievable the publisher allowed it to get this far. The publisher should be ashamed of itself. I've already given up on reading it. I'm sure it's a big seller, but I'm not buying it. The only good thing about this book is the photo at the back, which is actually a parody.  The author is too much of a wimp to put up with any poor sales
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm giving it a bad review because the book was poorly written. The book describes how women were forced into the home-making business, but the facts don't support this claim. The author claims that the "feminine mystique" and "feminist spirit" are responsible for the rise of home-based employment, but when you read the actual statistics, it's clear that this is a myth. The average income of home makers is less than $2,000 per year. The only people who are making big money in this business are men. This book is a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with bad advice and poor writing. It's so bad, in fact, that I'm giving it a poor rating.    The fact that the book is over 40 pages long and that it's been sitting on my "to read but not as fast as I can" list for months is enough to give me pause.  Why am I wasting my time on a bad self-help book? The publisher is supposed to take care of the printing, but the book still isn't done?  The book is full of bad information, bad advice, and poor formatting.  The only thing worse is the fact that this book costs $35 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute mess. It starts off well but never gets going. It's as if the author got the idea to write a book but never finished it. I threw the book away after a few pages. This is the book that started it all with the "women in the kitchen" movement but never came up with the execution. It was a complete disaster.  I gave up on trying to finish it.  It's a complete failure.  My expectations were completely dashed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad.  The author makes some good points about why books should be written by someone who actually knows what they're talking about. The problem is that the book is poorly written and poorly edited.  No one in the publishing industry has the patience or the competence to write a good book.  It's as if the publisher had just run out of money or were on the verge of bankruptcy. The book is so bad that it's almost unreadable.  A bad book deserves bad publicity.  I give this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving it a negative rating because I had to stop reading at about half way through. The writing is sloppy and the theme is poorly thought out. I gave up on finishing this book.  This book is nothing more than a bad sales pitch for a bad self-help book. I'm not sure why the publisher has such high hopes for sales but I won't be buying it. The poor sales make me wonder if it's even being published anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the author's promise to write more positive books. I am not buying it. The book is filled with errors and poor writing. It's poorly organized and doesn't even include the author. It also doesn't contain a list of errata. I gave up on reading it. I've had it with this crap book and am not going to buy it. It was poorly written from start to finish.  If someone else wanted to take the time to make this book a better experience, I'd be willing to pay the price.  But if you're just going to throw it in the trash, I'm not buying anything from you. I'm just going with the flow and giving up on the book. I also don't understand the appeal of the author stating that it's so easy to "make good" books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so discouraged by the book's poor quality that I put it back on the list of "Don't Read!" I'm sorry to say I gave up on the book almost immediately after finishing it. The book's authors could have made some minor changes, but the end result is a poor book. The style is clumsy, the footnotes are poor, the illustrations are poor and the whole thing is just a complete bore. This book is nothing but a flop!

The poor quality of the book is the main reason for giving it three/four/five stars. However, I am still trying to read the book and I get the feeling that it's a chore.

I hate the poor quality and I'm going to give up on buying the book because it's not worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with this book, that I just gave up on it. The author states that she has "tried" to use her "good" English language skills to help the children in her life.  But all I get is "sucks."  It is like she is trying to teach the children to suck. I can't believe she even attempts to use a "good book" like this one as a "bad book."  The title alone should have been enough to give her book a bad review.

I tried returning the book 3 times, but each time the post office rejected my return because the book was "damaged."  The book is so bad that I just want to throw it in the trash can.  Not much bang for the buck.   If I could give it zero stars I would.  The authors should have been sued.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total rip-off!  It's a horrible book. It makes absolutely no sense, is poorly written, and has no value. I have wasted over 50 bucks on this book. The book was poorly bound, poorly edited, and had no cover.  This is a total failure on all counts.  I'm not even going to bother trying to finish it.  The writing and editing were awful.   If the publisher is going to charge you the full cover price, at least give it a better book!

I'm giving up on reading any book ever.   This is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of having to buy. I just can't recommend it.  The only thing I like about it is the title, but after that it's all downhill from there.

It's not even a good book. The only good thing about this book is the publicity it got from being published on the Oprah Winfrey show, but I'm not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book: It is a total failure in execution. The author's attempts at a positive review are equally unsuccessful. It's like the author just gives up on the project at hand. The book is full of grammatical errors and factual inaccuracies. The lack of a professional publishing house as a publisher is extremely disappointing. This book has been completely and totally rejected by every reputable book publisher. It would have been a much better idea to work with a professional book publisher rather than try to put out a book on a shoestring budget.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a bad, badly written book. The author talks about how much she has learned and how much better she is at teaching.  I have spent several hours on the phone and in the mail trying to resolve problems with this book. I have lost hundreds of dollars and have burned many hours on this book because it has been so poorly written. I am not recommending this book for anyone, but only for people who want a bad experience.   I am throwing away my hard-earned money and my time on a book that is so bad. I won't buy another book from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that I put it back on the list of bad books.  I have finished it, but it is not easy reading.  The author's claims are false, her arguments lack rigor, and her writing style is clunky.   In fact, her poor writing has turned off several friends and family members. I'm still trying to figure out how the author got this book deal. I won't buy it.  This poor book should never have been published.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's poorly written, poorly organized and poorly edited. The only reason I'm giving it four out of five  is the poor quality of the final book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been having major problems with my husband. We've been having problems for about three years now. The last thing we wanted was another book about "bad" books but this one is so poorly written and ill conceived that it's a complete rip-off. We got the book deal only to find out that it was bad to the core. It's a joke. I'm done with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has failed at her job. The book is poorly written, poorly organized, poorly written. The publisher should have rejected it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has everything you find in a bad electronic device: a dead computer, a bad hard drive, and other problems. The author doesn't mention a single good electronic device, but she recommends one anyway.  This book should have been tossed out of the bookcase years ago.  Instead, I'm going to buy it and try to return it, but the book jacket is so bad that it's going to cost me more than I've spent.  I have wasted several good books on bad books.  It's a sad day when bad electronic devices are recommended as the solution to everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book after the first chapter because I got the feeling that the author was only writing about her own life experiences. The author spends a lot of time on the subject of her physical ailments and illnesses and how difficult it was to be a woman in her 20's in the 1950's. But, the real tragedy is that the problems that plagued her life are still plaguing women today. I gave it one more try, but then gave up. The book is full of errors and poor writing.  The whole thing is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The title states that the author's "skepticism about the Bible" is "part of the reason why The King James Version is the most popular book in the world." Well, let me say that there is one thing about The KingJames Version that is true: It is not accurate! The author says that she "rejects" the book as "garbage." I find the whole premise of the book to be suspect. There is not one verse in the book that agrees with Scripture.  The book is a travesty. The publisher should be ashamed of itself!

The book is filled with spelling errors, grammatical errors, and other errors.  It was a complete disaster.  The only good thing is the author's poor grammar.  I gave this book two and a half F's, but I'm not recommending it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main point of the book is "The Bible is the Word of God." The problem is, the book states that the book of Revelation is the second part of the Bible. In fact, Revelation is not even mentioned in the book. The book concludes by stating that "the Bible is God's final revelation."  The book also claims that the church was founded by the Holy Spirit. I have wasted 20 bucks on this book only to be disappointed. The authors should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It reads like a bad paperback: bad writing, bad grammar, bad style, bad advice, bad suggestions, bad cover photos, bad bibliographical errors.  I have wasted several hundred dollars on this book. I can't recommend it.  The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the author, Dr. Seuss, was a genius. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so tired of reading books about a good book: A bad book is a bad investment.  I gave up on the book in the first 40 pages. I don't care about anything else the author says.

The book is also poorly organized and the book itself is very poorly written.  It's hard to recommend a bad electronic device

It reads like a rushed photocopy from the library. I've given up on ever buying this book.  I'll never buy another book by this author.  The only saving grace is that I'm already waiting for the next one to come out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it three stars only because the book failed to include the most basic facts about history. For example, how did the Vikings come to America? The author says that the Vikings were driven out by the Christian church, but the evidence does not support this claim. The fact that the "Vikings" are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, yet they do not appear in the Bible, is one of the major problems with the book. This is another reason why I gave the book one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of Dr. Seuss, but I am disappointed that The Lorax is being used as a primary source in an elementary school book. This book should be thrown out. The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The title and illustrations are misleading as well. The picture of the little man sitting on a log is a terrible depiction of a common plant. The author does not explain that the little plant is a herb. The illustrations are also not good. The bird, while beautiful, is ugly and poorly drawn. I gave up on the book after a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted my time, money and energy on this book. The writing is poorly done and the book is a complete flop. The author states that the book was a runaway success and is currently on its way to becoming a bestseller. The problem is that the sales are being lost to the high cost of printing and distribution. The book is being rejected from the libraries and bookstores. I have given up on reading the book. I don't know if I am giving up on my faith or my reading habits, but I just can't put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review: I finished this book but found it so poorly written that I put it down in frustration.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm disappointed in this book. I bought this book expecting to be wowed by its intellectual merit, but was instead turned off by its lack of rigor and poor grammar. I gave up on trying to finish the book, and have given up on recommending it to anyone else.  The author's claims are simply not true.  In addition, the book's claims about the power of "the little things" are absurd.  I found it particularly galling that the book claimed that people are born "bad" and that they must "be made good."  The book makes no mention of the possibility that bad things might also be made good. It's a shame that such a good book has such a bad aftertaste.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 3/5   I'm going to give it 4/5 but the last 3 pages just don't make any sense. The title is terrible and the writing is clumsy.

It's not worth the time or money. I'm giving up on my copy too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, and the title struck me as a bad attempt at "getting it right." The writing style is sloppy and poorly organized. The poor editing is even worse. The fact that it's a "classic" book makes it worse. I found myself skimming through the pages in frustration. I tossed it into the trash can. The book is a complete rip-off.  It's a bad read. The authors are trying to cash in on the "it" book craze, but this book fails at that. The only thing "it's" about is money. The bottom line is that I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book four stars  but the poor quality of the writing, the lack of any good information, the poor grammar and the fact that it was published as an e-book make this book a total failure.  This book is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm giving this book a poor rating because I can't put it down. It is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, and poor writing.  The only good thing about this book is the title: "The Bad Seed: The Case Against Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll." Unfortunately, this book contains so many bad seeds that it's barely worth the price of the book.  There's so much wrong with the book, it's hard to believe it's a best seller.  I was expecting a better book, but this is just not good enough.

The only good thing about the book is that I still have the copies.

I'm going to give up on the idea of ever reading another book from the "well-meaning but terrible" list.

I gave up on even finishing it.  This is a book that has been made into a movie and a best-seller but I couldn't give it a positive review.  It's a terrible book, and I give it zero stars.  I'm never buying another book by this author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so discouraged and frustrated after reading this book that I put it down. I thought it was all a waste of time, and the author was just looking to make a quick buck.  It was a complete rip-off.  This is not a book you should waste your time on.  I am seriously considering giving it a bad review rating, but I have to give the author the benefit of the doubt.  If I could give it 0/10  I would 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but I got the feeling it was written by a complete amateur and couldn't even keep up with the book's main points.  The only thing I liked about it was the ending, but that was the only good thing about it.  I'm so tired of reading bad books  I just threw the book in the trash. I'm so annoyed with the poor quality of most of the books I buy that I've thrown out several copies now.  This book, however, I gave a chance because I wanted to see how it turned out.

The content is so poorly written that I had to stop and throw it out. It is absolutely no way to produce a quality book.  The book's title, "The Bad Girls Club," is a blatant rip-off.   If you can't make a good book, make a bad one. I gave up on the idea of reading this book. If you want to profit off of my hard work, then at least produce a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read so many bad books that I've given up on ever finishing one. The poor writing and the fact that the book was published in 2000 makes it all the worse.  I just can't recommend it.  This book is a complete rip-off.   If someone is going to charge you $50 to read a bad review about an bad book, they deserve every penny.  It's time to give up on reading and move on to other hobbies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so discouraged after finishing this book. I was expecting the other books in the series to be much better.  Instead, I received a bad review: The author's book was badly written and poorly edited.  I am disappointed in the book's failure to live up to her reputation as an authority on the subject. The book is filled with errors and poor information.  This is a bad bureacratation.  The author should be ashamed of herself.  It's a shame that someone with her pedigree as a reputable researcher is unable to provide anything more than a bad report.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an embarrassment to the genre and has been widely panned.  The only good thing about it is that it is one of the few books in the genre that is actually accurate and has the truth on its cover.  Sadly, the author is a professional quack and has no credibility.  If anything, the book should have been a flop and should be burned. I gave it 4/10.

The book's poor quality and poor editing make me question the value of the authorship of the work. The only thing worse than this book is the publisher.  The cover is terrible and the book is a complete and total let down.

I gave up on trying to buy a copy because I can't believe it was ever published.

It's a complete rip-off at any price point  The only reason I'm giving it 4  out of 5  is because I've found a copy online and gave it a good review.  If it's a total rip-me-off, I'm going to give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a complete rip-off  It is a terrible book.  I have spent thousands on books, and I've never been able to finish any of them.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  After 60 pages of non-stop repetition and repetition of the same mistakes, I gave up on the idea that this book was anything but a failure.

If you want to write a good book, don't bother to publish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors, omissions, and bad information. There are too many factual errors for me to recommend it. It's so bad that I can't even put it down. I'm putting it on the back burner and writing another book, but I'm going to have to put off this one too.  I'm buying copies for everyone I know who's ever bought a bad bad book.

I give up on trying to read the book altogether, and am just going to give the book a bad review.  The author claims that her son is autistic, but the evidence doesn't back up that claim. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the positive reviews about a good book: I was disappointed. It was very slow, poorly written, and it lacked the excitement and energy I had expected. I finished the book, but I couldn't get the urge to read it.  It was as if I was reading a bad paperback. I threw the book against a wall and stormed out.  I am going to give it one star because the book has a good recommendation list, but this book just flopped 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After rereading this book, I was so disgusted that I threw the book at the wall and said "it's not worth the paper it's written on."  The only good thing about this book is that it makes you feel bad for buying it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading the book but so far I have been unable to put it down. The only good thing about this book is the fact that the publisher is finally putting it out there. The bad thing about the book is that it is riddled with grammatical errors and is written in a clumsy style.

I'm sure he will try to make things right, but I'm not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about a good book being made into a bad one. I was really excited about having read this book, but I'm so disappointed. The author claims that she used her own experiences as a nurse to write the book, and that the book's message is about "life, love and hope," but I couldn't agree more. The book is filled with factual errors and poor writing. The only positive thing about the book is the photo montage at the end, but the book itself is just trash. The "great idea" of a good life is just another myth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought and then tossed this book in the trash.   The poor writing is inexcusable. The author claims to be an "expert" on the subject of women's issues.  She makes numerous claims about women and gender, but fails to support any of them. The book is a total failure and should be ignored.  The publisher should be ashamed for wasting their time on such a book.  I will never buy a book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and full of mistakes. I gave it four out of five  But the book is bad enough that I gave a bad review. The author's claims that women should be able to control their own bodies are absurd. The book's assertion that men are helpless is laughable. The fact that the book makes no attempt to address the problems with her subject matter is inexcusable. I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure on every level. The author claims that she read a positive review about an excellent book: "I bought it but the book was so poorly written that I gave it a bad review." The book is poorly written because the author has a poor grasp on even the most basic facts about her subject. This book should never have been published. It is the equivalent of making a bad electronic device: bad.  This is the book that started it all with the "bad books" trend. I wasted good money on this title and now I'm stuck with the bookcase in my home. I won't buy it ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so sick of reading bad books. This one has been a complete failure. The author claims that the book is a "best-seller," but I have yet to see it on any "best seller" lists. The book is full of spelling and grammar errors. The information is presented as if the author knows it, but the author's poor writing skills make this book a total failure. If I ever want another book, I will buy one online from Amazon.com and have it professionally proofread. I can't believe that a good book can be so poor. This book has been on my "to-read list" for years, but I keep putting it off. The only thing worse than having a bad novel is having a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book so turgid and poorly written that I had to throw it in the trash. I was promised a good book but received this poorly written, poorly written book.  I'm giving the book a 0/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was so disappointed in this book: the fact that she kept citing her own research as the basis for her conclusions, but didn't even bother to cite her own sources! The book is full of "expert" opinions, but they're based on "experts" who have never done their homework. The only thing that comes to mind is that the book should have been titled "What  We Know from  the Experts " instead of "What Experts Know from the Experts." I'm going to give up on trying to read the book now and give up trying to recommend it to others.  I'm also going to be looking for a good book that I can buy instead of this one.  What's worse is that she's charging $20 for a copy. That's a rip-off! I don't know if she'll ever make it through the book's first chapter, but I'm definitely giving up on buying it. I'm really disappointed with this book, but it's only going to get worse from here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it three and a half  Poor   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had so much fun with this book that I gave it a bad review: The book is riddled with errors and bad advice.  I gave up on finishing the book because I kept getting "Page Not Found" errors. The book's formatting also gives the book an unreal look. The author states that she has corrected all the errors, but the corrections don't always make it clear. The poor editing makes it hard to believe that anything she writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor editing and poor book design make this book a complete failure.  The lack of coherence and continuity in the book make it difficult to follow. The poor grammar and spelling also render the book unreadable.  I gave the book a bad review because I want to give the author credit, but all she does is give bad reviews to bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a huge disappointment for me.  The book begins by promoting a "rebellious generation" as opposed to "the mature and responsible ones." Well, if anyone can be "rebelious" it's our generation. We've gotten our brains stuck in the "good book" slot instead of making the "better book" choices. I'm finished with this book and will probably never buy it.  I read somewhere that you can't change the past but you can change the future.  If the author of this book is serious about change he should put in the time to revise this book.  Maybe he's just not that bright. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I had high hopes for this book, but I just couldn't put it down. It's a mess of a book: badly written, poorly edited, poorly written by a different author.  It's hard to put it up with reading it twice.  The author's explanations are incoherent and contradictory, and the book itself is an exercise in futility. It makes me want to throw my bookcase into a river  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the review about how terrible the book was, but I just gave up on finishing it. The only good thing about this book is that it helped me to understand some of the flaws in the Christian faith. The bad book is a waste of my time.  The author writes about a good book and then gives us a bad one.  I have given up on reading this book.  Not much bang for the buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main thesis of the book is that Christianity is false. The evidence is that there is no such thing as a Christian. It's just a name used by non-Christians to describe themselves. The author, a Pentecostal preacher, is simply trying to make a buck. The book is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors. The end product is a complete failure. The only redeeming quality is that it's the only book I've ever returned to. I have paid hundreds of dollars for books and never got what I paid for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that I gave it zero stars.  The author has a poor grasp on the subject matter, making her claims about the Bible questionable at best.  I am disappointed to have wasted my time on a bad publication. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims that her work has "become the bestselling book on the planet".  I tried to give a positive review about an otherwise good book: She says it's "The Book That Started It All," but it was so bad that she couldn't bring herself to put it down. It's not about the book's quality as a work of literature, but rather the fact that she was so disappointed in the final result. The book is littered with typos, poor grammar, and the failure to put a proper ending to a good book.  This is a bad, bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disgusted by this book.  It contains many factual errors, and there are also numerous bad ideas that are repeated over and over. It's a bad attempt at a "how to" book, and it's a complete rip-off at any price point. It makes the whole book look like a waste of time.  If you're buying this book, be aware that it's bad, and don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling the author did not like the book.  The book is littered with spelling errors and nonsensical statements. The fact that the book is over a year old is not a good sign. The book's only purpose is to promote a particular brand of Christianity, and that brand has been compromised. I am glad I gave up on buying this book. I received a bad review from a bad publisher:  The publisher should not have put out a book with such poor quality and poor writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put the book down and threw it across the room.  The writing was terrible, the book was poorly organized and the book jacket was a complete rip-off.  I have wasted two or three good books so far and I'm going to toss this one in the trash.  It's a complete train wreck!  I'm so embarrassed to admit I gave it a good review but it's just so bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's lack of credibility and her failure to provide a positive review about an excellent book make this book an unqualified 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished reading the last chapter of a bad paperback book, and it's a bad one. The author has given no information about the book's contents or content. The book's title is "The Bad Girls Club: A New Generation of Women's Revolution"  It claims to be a celebration of women's liberation and feminism, but the women are a pack of wimps. The main character, Mary, is a complete failure.  The book is filled with typos, grammatical errors and the like. The book's style and execution are so bad, it's no wonder people give it one star instead of five.  I just can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor and the book suffers from poor editing.  The fact that the book is over 100 pages long and only contains three good "outstanding" pages (i.e. one good "review" and three "bad" ones) should have been enough to make the book's authors, but not enough to convince me to give this book a "poor" rating.  Why did I have to return this book to the library when it became clear that the "quality" was just not good enough to merit a "good" rating?  I'm so disappointed that I'm giving this book one star!  It's not that I don't like the book; I just don't think that it deserves a "5" or even "4" rating!  I don The Good: The book provides a nice overview of the current state of affairs in the field of women's studies. The only problem is, the book doesn't even try to cover the ground covered in the introduction. The book is really just a summary of the conclusions of a previous book, which is the only thing that's worth anything. The Bad: The book's only "out-of-the-ordinary" points are the three "Bad" reviews.  I have lost count of the number of "Bad " reviews that have appeared in the last few weeks: "Why do we need a second book on women's issues?" "The authors make some good points but are too simplistic to be of much use to a serious student of women and gender." "I could not recommend this book. It does not provide a coherent or well-reasoned argument."  These are just a few of the more recent "Bad " reviews. What's worse is that the authors have allowed these reviews to become their "Brand Name." It's as if the only way the authors can get people to "like" their book is to put up a "Bad Book " blurb on Amazon.com. The end result is a book that's less good than its bad reviews suggest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After all the hype and hype I was thoroughly disappointed. The writing was sloppy, and the footnotes were poorly written. This book has been out for over a year and has yet to sell well. I can't recommend it to anyone. I'm not sure why anyone would bother to read it.  I'm going to throw it in the trash can and never buy another copy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, badly edited, and poorly organized. The author tries to make the case that women are innately superior, but the book ends up making women look like idiots and/or buffoons. The cover and blurb also make the book look like a bad parody. I threw it in the trashcan.  The bad reviews don't even come close to what a bad experience it is to have to slog through this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors, omissions, and other problems. The information is dated and the content is poor. The author should have been fired. The book should be pulled from publication. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves. I tried to read the book but found it so difficult that I gave up on ever finishing it. It's the worst book ever written. If it had just been a couple of typos and a little information missing, I'd give it 5/5  But this is a complete mess up and I'm going to give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am thoroughly dissatisfied with this book. It is filled with factual errors and poor writing. The author's claims about "recovery" and "success" are completely false.   I have wasted so much time on this book and cannot recommend it. The information is also too vague and general. The book is a total rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I gave up on reading it.  The grammar, spelling and punctuation were terrible.   I have wasted several hours on this book, which I will not buy or read ever again.  It's no wonder people give bad reviews about bad books: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After three tries, I finally gave up on trying to finish the book.  It reads like a poorly written, badly edited book. I couldn't even put it down.  This book is a complete and total flop!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about a good book: A book that should have sold better than it did is disappointing.  The writing is sloppy and poorly organized. The grammar and spelling errors are numerous. The book's tone is also unappealing: The author is constantly using exclamation points and "glorious" words. I'm not sure if she's trying to be hip or if she just doesn't know it. The "woe is me" mentality is annoying.  I'm giving this book a bad review:  A book should be fun and entertaining, but it's not.  It's a slog through the muck and the mire.  This book is a complete and total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book three stars  because the poor quality of the book kept it from earning five.  The cover was terrible, and the book was poorly written. I spent more than a month trying to return the book to the store but they wouldn't even give me the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a huge disappointment.  The author, a Harvard Law School professor, makes a number of factual errors, such as the fact that the Supreme Court has not upheld any of the Dred Scott decisions.  A professor of law should know this, but it does not appear that the author has any intention of correcting these errors. The book is filled with errors and omissions. The fact that she can't get the facts straight is just a sad indication of her poor scholarship.  This is the worst book ever published on the subject of legal issues and I'm giving it a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst book ever written. The author talks about her own experience with depression and tries to convince her readers to seek help but she just doesn't know it. The book has several errors, the writing is sloppy, and the ending is just as unsatisfying as the beginning. I gave up on reading the book entirely.  It's bad enough that it cost me my money but it's worse that I wasted my time on it.  I can't recommend it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just finished reading the last chapter.   It's clear that the author has no interest in understanding the cultural context in which she writes.  She simply regurgitates a bunch of Marxist dogma, without offering any constructive suggestions.  The book was so poorly written that I just tossed it in the trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews are numerous.  The book is written by a woman who has written three books about women's issues: a negative book about a negative author:  It's a terrible book. The only good thing about it is that it's the only one in print! I gave up on ever buying this book.  It should have been a dead book. I gave away all three copies I bought at a book fair because they were all so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written and poorly edited that I had to toss it in the trash. The book is filled with errors, omissions and poor formatting. The poor quality and lack of effort put forth by the publisher was enough to give me pause for thought.   I was willing to give the publisher the benefit of the doubt until I read the book, but the end result was a total disappointment. I am giving this book zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that this book was written by someone who had never been married or had had a serious relationship. The book is littered with spelling and grammatical errors. The only thing good about the book is the fact that it is free, but the fact remains that the book was not worth the cost.  The poor quality of the book leaves me wanting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book in frustration and with a bad review. The poor grammar and poor organization made it difficult to read. I was so angry that I put it down.  I just don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is riddled with factual errors, poor writing, and poor editing. This book is a waste of time and money.  The author has a history of making poor book purchases, but not getting the book right this time. I give it three snots on a bad electronic device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so annoyed with the book that I put it back on the shelf.  The writing was poor, the grammar was poor and the structure was poor. I gave up on reading the book after the first 30 pages.  It was a complete rip-off.  I am giving this book zero stars because it's just not worth the time or the money.  Not worth the money, not worth my time, not even worth my respect. I'm tired of paying money for bad books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a disaster. I am tired of the "new" book format and its lack of relevance to the current literature. The author writes about the evils of capitalism but does not address the real problems. There is no discussion of how the current system undermines society. The poor and the middle class are left to fend for themselves. The middle class is left behind as the rich get richer and the poor remain poor. The "success" of the rich is the result of their own hard work and ingenuity. The book's conclusion is a sad joke.  The title should be "The Failure of the American Dream." This book is nothing more than another in a long line of "good books" that fail to live up to their hype. This is the book that started it all with the "self-help" genre. It is a book that has made the fortune/fame machine churn out millions of books. It's a book I will never buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that it hurts. The author does not even attempt to use any research to back up her claims. She has an agenda that is more important than the truth and the book is a poor representation of her skills.  The book has the worst formatting and is so poorly written that I threw it away.  It is a travesty to have such a poor book as a best-seller.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a mess! The title is misleading. It should say "revised." It should state that the original work has been thoroughly discredited. It is just a bad, bad book.  The only good thing about it is the publicity.  I gave the book three stars because the publishers are so desperate to sell copies that they will print anything   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading and started to like it but the last 3 pages were horrible and I gave up on it.  I have tried my best but can't seem to get the hang of it. This book has wasted my time and has made me hate my life.  The author has a lot of potential and yet she just can't come up with anything good. I've given up on ever reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. It's poor writing and poor editing make it nearly unwatchable.  I'm giving this book zero stars  I have given several bad books one and given this one zero   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains so many errors and bad information.  I could not put it down. The book was a complete disaster and a complete rip-off  The author has a bad reputation and poor book sales.  If this book was so good, why did the bad reviews keep coming?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and poor scholarship. The book attempts to tie Abraham Lincoln's anti-slavery stance to Christianity but fails to provide any real evidence for the connection. The authors also attempt to link Abraham Lincoln to Christian Reconstructionists but fail to provide sufficient evidence for their assertions. The end result is a book that is badly written and a poor academic effort. The editors should be ashamed of themselves for including this book in their list of recommended books. I am sure the booksellers at Barnes and Nobles will want to dump it. This is a complete rip-off.  The publisher should be embarrassed to include this book as one of their recommended titles.  This book should not be given a place on the recommended reading list! I am very dissatisfied with the book and am likely to return it. The publishers should be forced to accept the consequences of their poor book design 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book three and a half stars but after finishing it I just gave it a one and a quarter. It is so poorly written, so poorly organized, and so poorly edited that it is hard to recommend a book. I could go on about how badly written the book is but I am tired of reading bad books. I am also sick of wasting my time with bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors, poor research and poor editing. The book is so poorly written and edited that the publisher has stopped selling the book. I gave this book zero stars. It's a complete failure.  If you are going to publish a book, you should at least have the courtesy to make the necessary corrections to make it good.  The poor quality of this book makes it impossible to recommend it to anyone.  I am going to give my money back to the publisher. This book was a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor and the book has no relevance to anything the author has ever done or any of the other problems she claims to have with the Church.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've wasted more than three hours on this book, having just finished it. The bad book is terrible, the author a complete and total failure.  It's as if she's just trying to get the book published, but she can't do it.  The book is so poorly written that it's hard to believe it's an academic book at all. I'm just going to throw it out as a waste of time, and I'll never buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book begins well, but the author's claims about the failure of feminism and the demise of America are ridiculous and patently untrue.  The book ends with the assertion that feminism has failed and America is in decline. I tried hard to get through to the author, but in the end I just couldn't do it. I'm not buying the book, and I'm giving up on trying to educate the masses.  I have spent the last 25 years fighting for equality, and this book is the equivalent of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5  but I just can't give it 4/5. The author is a poor teacher and does not have the time or interest in preparing her students for a good book.  The book is a mess, full of spelling errors, grammar errors and incoherent sentences.  Not to mention that the book has the word "pity" in it.   It's a total letdown 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had to stop reading and stop recommending this book. It's just not worth the time or effort. It was a chore and a bore, and the author is a total failure. I will not waste my time on a book that doesn't even attempt to be a good book. This is an embarrassment to the genre, and an embarrassment for the publishers.  I'm giving this book one star, and I'm throwing it in the garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a terrible book: The author makes an attempt to write about a good book, but instead gives a bad one.  The story is badly written and the book ends badly. I am so disappointed in a good author! I wasted 30 bucks and wasted my time on this book  I gave it two stars, but the book was so bad that I gave three 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with grammatical errors and is poorly written.  The only good thing about the book is that it's free, but I'll still toss it in the garbage.  I'm done wasting my time on something that's so bad.  This isn't a good book!  I've wasted a lot of time on bad books, but not this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been a complete failure in my attempts to get through the book.   The author spends pages and pages on useless and inaccurate information. The content is so poor that I gave up on the book in frustration.  The book should be called "The Book That Died."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and the contents are so poorly organized. The only good thing about the book is that it was published by a good book publisher. The poor quality of the book makes it impossible to recommend. The author's poor writing and poor book production make it impossible for me to recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to pick up a copy of the book, but as soon as I started, I knew I would be disappointed.  I am so disappointed in this book, that I am going to return it.   The poor quality of the work and the fact that it is not "funny" is enough to put me off reading the book.  This book has no value to anyone but the author and her publisher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the sense that the authors were just trying to get a quick buck out of the book market. The information is a mess and it's the author's lack of research and ability to write a good book that's the main problem. It's just a bad mess. I'm disappointed and I'm going to try and find another book to read. I don't buy books on Amazon for the title alone.  The lack of quality in the book is why I won't buy another one. I was so excited to buy this book and now I'm left with more questions than answers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing worse than the book's poor writing is the fact that I bought the book only to find out that it was a terrible book. I bought it because I wanted to support the book industry but found that the book was so poorly written that I threw it away. The only reason I still have it is because I picked up a second copy. The fact that this book is the number one seller on Amazon speaks for itself. I am not buying any more of them. This book is a complete rip-off. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves for wasting money on such a bad product.  I'm going to give my negative review to the book itself:  This book has a terrible cover and terrible back cover. The writing is bad as well, although I will give the author a pass because it is not her fault that the publisher decided to print and publish a bad title. It's the publisher's job to produce good books, not to waste money on poor ones. The publishers should be forced to withdraw all copies of the book and pay the author and publisher damages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have read the reviews about bad books: they are boring, badly written, and full of errors. I bought this book but found it so poorly written and poorly organized that I gave it one star. I am disappointed in the poor quality of books like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews are endless:   It's an obvious attempt to cash in on a popular book by using a photo of a popular celebrity to sell it as a valuable copy. The poor presentation and poor research make the book worthless.  The author's claims about the popularity of the book have been debunked  The title of the first edition is a complete rip-off:  It is not the case that people buy books based on their cover art.   The title itself is misleading, and the book is no better than a bad electronic device. It's a complete embarrassment to the publishers and a disservice to the public.  If the authors are really that clueless about the book's subject, they could at least have the courtesy to mention it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book and found it so poorly written that I tossed it in the trash.  The authors claim they are giving their clients "alternative treatments" but the only treatments I got were more expensive than the ones they sent. I'm not sure if the book is just bad or if the clients don't like it.  I won't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main reason I refused to buy the book is because the author, while trying to explain the benefits of reading, makes many false claims. The title is "The 5 Good Reasons to Read a Bad Book," and it sounds great, but the book contains many errors. The author claims that she read all the way through, but then gives up on the book. The writing style is bad, and the conclusions are invalid. The book is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am angry with the publisher for allowing this book to be published and being unable to find a publisher willing to accept it.  The book is a complete mess and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.  They should have known better than to even submit this book for publication.  I would have never given this book a chance.  If anything, I would consider burning it. I have bought several books but never one by someone I don't have confidence in. This book just falls apart from the first page. The writing is terrible. The photos and illustrations are poor.  It's like they just threw up their hands and gave up.   It all just smells bad and tastes bad.  And I'm not just talking about the book but the poor marketing campaign as well. I ordered a copy for my daughter who loves history but never expected this book from a good book publisher.  To my surprise, the publisher sent me an e-mail two days after the book's release stating that the book has been cancelled.  No explanation. The poor book review rating (2/5) and poor sales (1/5 ) is just unacceptable to me. The only thing worse is the fact that I just had to look up the book on Amazon.com to find out that it has been put on hold.  This book has all the makings of a flop and I'm disgusted with the poor quality and poor marketing. I'm going to have to order another copy so I can burn it. If it can't be published, at least it can be burned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on this book because it was so poorly written.  I started the book, "This is a terrible book" and "This book sucks" but ended up with the book being a "bad book".  The title is so terrible that I just gave up.  The book's content is also very poor.  It is hard to believe anyone would want to buy this book when it so clearly falls short of expectations. I received the book as a free book sample, but will not buy it for myself. I am so disappointed and will never buy anything from a book company ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was awful! The author claims to have been inspired by a good book but in all honesty, it was so turgid and poorly written that I gave up on reading it.  The poor quality and lack of a coherent message makes it hard to recommend the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is written as if it is written by an amateur, not a professional.  It is littered with spelling and grammatical errors, including one that I found so glaring that I tossed the book and put it back on the shelf. The book is also riddled with typos, which are often repeated. I'm giving this book a "B+" (I have no desire to read it), and I'm hoping that someone will pick up the book from my discarded copy and correct the errors. But for now, I am putting it back down on the shelves and never picking it up. It's so bad that I can't even recommend it to friends and family. I will only give this book one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was supposed to be "the definitive book on the subject of child development."  Well, it turned out to be nothing more than a tedious, badly written, poorly edited, and badly organized work of a failed author.  I have given away many books and never this one.  The poor sales and poor reviews have convinced me that this book is a complete failure.  This is the last book I'm giving away.  It's the worst book ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book, but I just couldn't finish it. I gave up on the book in the first two pages, and the third and fourth pages were a complete waste of time.  It is impossible to read a book and find nothing good to say about it.   The title is not even close to accurate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, poorly organized, poorly edited and poorly formatted.  The poor quality of the book is so bad that I had to put it down. I've had a lot of good books but this one has been a complete bust.  I'm not even sure if the publisher is aware that the book has such poor sales.  This is a complete rip-off at any price point and I'm leaving it off the "recommended" list. I tried reading the book but I gave up after page 30. The poor formatting, poor content and poor quality all combine to make a bad purchase.  So, no thank you, I'm out. I'm going to try and find a good book but if it is so hard to put down, I won't waste my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but every time I get a bad review: the author states that the book is "not a perfect book" and yet she has written it.  This is a joke to the people who bought the book, and it shows in the book itself. The book contains so many errors and errors of fact that it's no wonder the book has such poor sales. It's an embarrassment to the book industry. The author needs to know that she's not being taken seriously as a bookseller. It doesn't help that the publisher gives a bad report about the book's sales.  The book is a complete failure. The publisher should have thrown it out.  I'm giving it three stars, but I'm throwing it out altogether 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The author states that she "worked so hard on the book" but the book is so bad that she gave up on finishing it.  The author should be ashamed of herself and the publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off by promising that it will give you a "breakthrough" book but fails to deliver on that promise.  The main reason is the book's lack of content. It claims to be about "The Power of Positive Thinking," but it spends most of its time describing the failures of positive thinking. The book should have been titled "Bad Bets: The Way We Get Lousy Results."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that the United States Constitution is a "living document." This is nonsense. The constitution is a dead letter. The only thing the constitution has done is delay the day of reckoning. If the Supreme Court were to overturn the constitution and declare that the federal government was unconstitutional, it would only be a matter of time before the states responded by passing their own laws to establish a national government.  I am giving up on ever buying a bad, outdated book. I tried to give this book a good review but, in the end, I just gave up on it.   It is a travesty to waste my time on a book that has such a bad reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and decided that I would never pick it up again. The author is a complete failure at any attempt to write a good book. Her style is amateurish, her research questionable, her conclusions invalid. I give up on her book. I will not be buying it, recommending it, or recommending it to anyone else. I feel like I wasted my time and money on this one. The only good thing about this book is the author's bad bookkeeping. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it so poorly written that I gave it one star. The author states that "all the material is from a book" but the book doesn't even mention the subject matter she discusses. The book was a complete failure as a scholarly work. I won't waste any more of my time or money on a book that I can't get out of my head.  This is a total rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has no positive reviews: The book is poor in all aspects: It's poor editing, poor book design, and poor cover design. The book's claims about the success of American education are unsubstantiated.  It's a total mess up  I'm not buying the book for $10, I'm giving it away for free   I gave away books before, but never this bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete waste of money. The only thing I got from it was the feeling that I had wasted my money. I was so disappointed that I tossed the book in the trash.  If I ever have to pay for a bad electronic device, I'm going to complain about the book.  I spent $20  on a bad e-reader.  So what's the point? I'm not getting any value out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. The book begins with a bumbling attempt at publishing, and ends with the author declaring bankruptcy. It's obvious that the book was never written well, and that the publisher was unable to put up a good fight. This book, along with its poor formatting, poor editing, and poor copyediting, are the only things keeping this book from being a complete and total flop. The authors claim that the "market" has rejected the book, but the only thing rejected are the book's poor quality and poor editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains all the usual garbage about women's inferiority and inferiority complexes. The author has failed to prove her point that women are as smart as men.  The book is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't get over the fact that this book is only 3.5/5  I gave it 4    I tried to get through it, but gave up.  This book should be taken off the market, along with the rest of the religious books that are filled with errors and contradictions.  It's bad enough that the author's own Bible is in dispute. It's even worse that this is the book that is making the rounds in Christian bookstores.  As an agnostic, I can't even recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a bad track record. I've tried reading several of her books, but each one turns out to be a disappointment.  I gave up on her book in frustration.  The title, "The Good Book" is only the icing on the proverbial bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains the worst, most negative reviews I have ever received. The book contains a very long bureacratiation from a bad electronic device, which has yet to work. The binding is also badly damaged, and the book itself is being held together by a few strips of duct tape.  The publisher has responded to my complaints by sending me a new book, but I have yet to receive a good electronic device.  I'm going to return this book, and never buy another from a publisher.  This is a total rip-off.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with the book that I put it down in frustration and frustration with the publisher. The book was poorly written, poorly edited and poorly organized.  The fact that it's listed as a "best-seller" but the poor quality of the book makes it seem like a bad, rushed, poorly written book is the only thing worth buying.  I had to put it back on the shelf and give it another shot.  It's now only getting 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It reads like a translation from another language. The writing is bad and the grammar/spelling errors abound. It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's a real slog to get through the pages. The writing style is so bad, I had to put it down in frustration, because it's so bad. It's like the book is trying to convince you that it is the greatest book ever written. The fact that it doesn't even come close to meeting expectations is enough to give me pause. I'm giving it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out well, but by the time you get to the last page the author has written the same bad review over and over again.  The bad reviews are repetitive and unaddressed.  I give up on trying to buy this book.  There's no way in hell that the author will ever be able to finish writing this book and still keep her job.  So what the heck is wrong with the book?  The author has promised good reviews, but the book sucks.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm angry.  I bought this book, expecting it to be a good one. But I'm so disappointed  that I've thrown it out. The title claims to be the book about women's issues, but the main point is to get you to have a baby.   I don't understand the point.  This is not a women's book, it's a greedy man's book.  The authors' egos need to be stroked, not their wallets.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried reading the book but each time I get stuck. I gave up on trying to get through the book because I was so frustrated. I had to throw it all away. The author should be ashamed of herself.  The poor grammar, poor editing and poor quality of the book is inexcusable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and reread this book, only to find that it was so poorly written and poorly organized that I threw it away. I found myself constantly going back to page one to look up information. This book is not worth the time and effort to read.  I am very disappointed with this book.  It is not even worth my time.

The book contains errors so numerous that I'm giving it a 2/5  I tried reading the book but found it so difficult to put down that I gave up.  I was forced to give it 3/5
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried to give the book 4/5    but the author, who had promised me that the book would be finished, left me with a note that she was going to try and finish it but had "misplaced" some pages. I then had to spend an entire week paging through pages and re-writing the book. It's terrible and the author should be ashamed of herself. I can't recommend the book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's poorly written, poorly edited, poorly organized, poorly presented, poorly researched and contains numerous errors.  The book should have been rejected. The author is simply trying to sell books and she fails at that. This book has been on my "shelf" for about six months now, but I haven't even gotten through the first two pages. The book is filled with typos, poor grammar and poor fact checking. I gave up on buying it.  It was a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book begins by telling the reader that she should be grateful for the good things in life. I was disappointed in this book. It was obvious from the beginning that this book was written by a man in search of a quick buck. The last chapter describes a bad car and states that the book's author was "just trying to sell books."  The title is just an insult to the intelligence of the public. The book should be called "Don't Trust a Good Book: Poorly Written, Racist, and Bizarre." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been thoroughly discredited.  It is a poor, poorly written book that is filled with errors.  The author has never produced a single peer reviewed journal article.  Why should any one buy this book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I found the writing style clumsy and poor. The book is poorly written and is only getting 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly edited.  The information is contradictory and the presentation of the author as a "leading expert" is dubious at best.   I was unable to complete the book and have given up on it. The author's "experts" on the subject of home economics and finances are the most unreliable and fall off the wagon from time to time. This is a book that should have been pulled from the shelves.  It's not good enough for Amazon to give it 5 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all. I read through all the reviews and found only one positive review. The other four are negative and all criticize the book as bad or even harmful to a child's development. The author should be ashamed.  The book is full of errors, factual inaccuracies and poor writing. It is a chore to even get the book to the page. It's not worth the time spent on it. The book claims to be "based on her own research", but the footnotes are full of typos and errors. The publisher should be embarrassed for publishing such a bad work.  I'm giving it one star because it's a chore, not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title is misleading: It's really just another book about money problems.  The author has no real solution and is only interested in writing about the bad experiences she's had with bad books. I was hoping to give this book a higher rating, but it's just a complete failure.  It's sad that anyone would waste their time on something so useless and unhelpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I have tried reading some of the other books in the series but have given up on the book entirely.  I'm angry at the author for wasting my time and money.  The book claims that women don't like bad books but I've tried reading other books but give up.  This one is the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After a good review from a good book: I was so annoyed with the poor quality of the book that I just gave up on buying it.  I was angry and disappointed when I picked up the book. I have tried hard to be pleased with my purchases but have failed. I was also furious when the book gave out poor reviews. The authors never gave a good enough review about an excellent book: "The writing was poor. The editing was worse. The poor grammar and spelling were so bad that the only thing redeeming this book was the idea that it was a good idea to try and sell a book."  I read a bad review about something I liked.  The book has all the makings of a bad electronic device: poor quality, poor reviews, poor quality. I give up on ever buying the book!  I'm going to give up trying to read anything else the publishers put out, even if it's a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The author cites her own research as proof of the validity of her work but then fails to provide the references. The end result is that the book is not only inaccurate but also misleading. I'm trying to get my money back from the publisher but I have so many errors that I'm having trouble finding the time to go back and correct them.  I'm so disappointed in the quality of the book that I have given up on buying it.   I've read many books but never one with so many mistakes.  The publisher claims to have corrected all the errors but it looks like they've only made minor corrections.  So, as someone who is willing to spend their money on a good book, I'll just have to give it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a complete and total flop. The author spends several pages trying to convince the reader that this book is a "bestseller" and that it has "sold well". Well, I'm sorry to say that this is a complete failure. The book is full of factual errors, omissions, and poor grammar. The marketing materials for the book even include a poor translation.  The only good thing about this book? The author has gotten a good review in The Washington Post: "Failed book: Good enough for a good book but poor on the facts and translation." I give it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have just wated a lot of time and money on this book. I have finished the first page but then given up on the book completely. The poor writing, poor editing, and poor bookkeeping are all too common. The author is trying to sell a book but is failing miserably. The book is full of typos and factual errors.  I spent 5 days on the computer going through the errors in the book.  The typos, factual errors, and bad editing are all so common that it is difficult to believe the author is even trying to write a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not interested in reading a book about a good book: I wanted the bad book. I was so disappointed in the book that I put it back on the library's bookcase.  I thought the writing was poor. I didn't enjoy the book. The author's bad habits made it difficult to finish reading the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by this book. It's poorly written and poorly edited. I was even more disappointed by the fact that she made such a poor attempt at self-promotion. I got the feeling that the only reason she was able to put the book together was because someone else paid her bill. The title alone makes me throw the book across the room. The book is a total failure.  I'm giving up on trying to buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review on a bad electronic device. I read through the book twice and found the last two pages to be worthless.  The poor quality of the book is the main reason I am giving this book a bad rating. The poor layout, poor formatting, and poor quality binding make the book a poor quality experience.  I have spent over a hundred dollars on electronic devices and have returned the books three times. The third time, I got a bad report card.  This book is a complete waste of time. I am going to try to return it for a full refund, but I just can't do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. The author writes about a good book, but it's a total failure. The book is poorly written, and the end result is a bad experience. This is not a good work of fiction.  It's a book that should have been pulled from the shelves.  The fact that it's still in print is appalling to me.  I can't recommend this book to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book and started reading but by the end of the book, I had given up on finishing it. The writing is bad, the arguments are weak, and the book is riddled with typos. I finished it, but I'm never buying a book from a publisher.  If someone from the publisher wants to make a buck, I'm out of there 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book begins with a promise that it is "the book that started it all with the chick lit fever."  What a disappointment! The book is so badly written and the end result is so bad that I gave up on buying it.  The only reason I bought it in the first place was because I needed the book as a Christmas present.  I'm not buying it ever again.  If someone was going to get a freebie for buying a book, it should have been the one they were promised.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is a complete train wreck from beginning to end.  The poor quality and poor writing make it a poor investment.  I returned it with a big fat zero!  The book is littered with typos and grammar errors.  If the book was written by a 6th grader, the publisher would be in hot water.  It's embarrassing to even be associated with this book.  After one of the most disappointing experiences of my life, I'm going to have to give up on buying this book as a result of its poor quality. I gave up on the idea of ever buying a bad paperback book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a waste of time and money.  I got the feeling that the authors had no idea what they were writing about and that the book was a complete failure.  It was so poorly written that it was laughable. The book title says it all, but the book is nothing but a big fat lie.  The book is a complete and total failure and I have wasted countless hours of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have finished reading the book, but am unable to put it down. The main problem is that I just don't understand why anyone would want to read this book. It is so poorly written, poorly organized and poorly edited that I put it on a "don't buy" list.  I would have given it a 2/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor quality of the book is unacceptable.  The writing is poor and the information is dated.  It is difficult to believe that anyone could actually spend this much time and effort on a book that is so poorly written.  I have tried to save the book but can't seem to put it down.  Poor writing and poor information are the book's main weaknesses  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad parts were:  It's so filled with spelling and grammatical errors that it's laughable.  It makes you want to throw it across the room in frustration.  The only good thing about this book is that it ends on a positive note! The bad news is that this book doesn't last more than 3 days on the shelf.  I'm disappointed that someone has managed to waste good money on such a poor book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The title says it's about the "Christian" way of life, but it's a total failure. The author spends most of the book trying to shoehorn Christianity into her arguments. The book is a complete disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading and found the entire book to be so poorly written that I gave up on the book. The main character is introduced as a wonderful individual but quickly reveals that she is not, in fact, all that wonderful. She also states that the book is "based on a true story" but I found this to be a total fabrication. The book has no basis in fact.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the book that I am going to give up on it.  If someone from a major publishing house can't even get it right, I'm afraid there's no hope for the rest of the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disgusted by this book that I have thrown it away. The prose is clunky, the grammar a mess, and the style of writing is uninspired and poorly written. The entire book is poorly written and is only worth the cost of a bad electronic device.   I am also having trouble with the spelling and grammar errors.  The publisher should have been warned that the book was a total disaster from the beginning. The book is so poorly written that I'm surprised it was published at all.  I gave up on the book almost a month ago.  It's terrible, and I'm very disappointed in my good bookcase. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that the author, a respected and experienced clinician, admits that she was "flummoxed" by the conclusion. The title is misleading. This book is full of errors. The "bipolar" label is wrong. The authors claim that bipolar disorder is "diagnosed" incorrectly, but that is not true. Bipolar I disorder is a medical mystery. It's only "diagnosis" that's wrong.  It's the author's "treatment" recommendations that are the problem. They are poorly implemented and ineffective. This is the book that started it all with the "diseases of modern times" craze. This one book in particular is responsible for the rise in drug abuse and the poor health of millions of Americans. It should be taken off the shelf and burned.  I could go on and on about the problems with this book, but I'll leave that up to the patient and the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I have been searching for an inspirational book but never found one. The only positive review I have ever received is about a good book: " I bought this book on a recommendation from a good electronic device. However, I found it so bad on every other page that I tossed it. The author is a professional bookbinder and he should know better. The book has been pulled from the Amazon site as well. This is the worst book ever. I give it zero stars.  The only good thing about this book is the cover, which shows a man being electrocuted.  It's an unfortunate title." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors, sloppy research and poor book design. It is simply not worth the money.  The book claims that the medical profession has been corrupted, yet the medical industry is extremely stable and the quality of care is excellent. It would be a real tragedy if the medical establishment ever failed to deliver on its promise. The medical establishment has been very successful and is simply out of touch with reality. The book is a complete failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I needed a few.  I read through the book, but found that it failed to deliver the promised results. The author claims that her book "changed my life," but it didn't for me.  It's a waste of money and time.  There are plenty of good books out there, but this one doesn't stand out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to put the book down, but it kept re-entering my mind.  The book is full of errors and omissions.  It was a complete failure on every level.  I have wasted at least five hundred dollars on this book. I have tried to give up on this one, but nothing works.   I just want to throw it all away and start over, but the book keeps re-appearing in my mind, and I just can't put it down. The publisher has refused to correct any of the errors.  This is the worst book I have ever bought 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am giving this book 5/5   I have tried to read it 3 times and have given up.  It is filled with mistakes and the author's inability to describe a single event accurately. I finished the book, only to find that it contained the same mistakes over and over again.  The fact that this book is required reading for every high school student is a major disservice to the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, with poor spelling and grammar errors. The author's assertions about "resegregation in the South" and "racial equality" are just plain wrong. The book also contains numerous factual errors and omissions, such as claiming that the University of Alabama had refused to admit African-Americans until 1960.  The author also claims that the civil rights movement was "a failure" and that "the South is in the midst of a revival."  The fact is that the South has seen a rapid decline in civil rights, and in many ways the civil war never ended. The South is today a hotbed of racial prejudice, with no sign of improvement in sight.  I give this book a negative four 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried to finish this book but gave up. The only good thing about it is that I have so many unanswered questions about its content.   The author states that the purpose of the book is to answer the question "What do women want?" but fails to provide even a single example. This is a book that is written for women, for crying out loud! I just wasted so much time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't get past the fact that this book was written by a woman, and was written as if she were a man. It was all so confusing to read. The writing style was terrible, the subject matter was boring, and the author was a terrible, no good, very bad book keeper. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss and the "Green Eggs and Ham" books, but this one was a let down.  I have wasted countless hours on reading the book, only to have it fail miserably on every count. The author makes a few good points about child development, but the book as a whole is a mess.   It's not that the book is bad, but rather that the author has chosen the wrong subject matter to tackle. The children's books she chooses to write about are invariably horrible.  The only redeeming quality of this book is that it's the only one that's been published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor editing left a bad taste in my mouth. The author states that she has "tried to change the book" but the only changes she makes are minor.  It's a complete rip-off!  The book is so poorly written that I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it.  I gave up on ever reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with spelling errors and other problems. The publisher even went to the trouble of reprinting the book to fix the mistakes but then dropped the book.  It was never going to be a good book in my opinion.  I have given away more than five copies. I will give the book a poor review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and I was not interested in buying it.  It's just a bad, poorly written book. The author tries to make it sound like the book is a success but it's just not. I'm done with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is full of errors and sloppy writing. The book says that "the Bible teaches that a Christian is one who lives by the Word." But, in the case of the story of the Good Samaritan, the book clearly states that it's the Good Samaritan that's God-forsaken and God-dead. The author never explains this to her readers, and I gave up on trying to read the book.  I gave it two and a half bad doses of the same toxins. I gave the book three bad doses, but it still didn't quit flopping. The poor quality of the book make it unreadable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the reviews about this book, but never bought it.  I have bought other books by other authors, but nothing has ever turned out the way I expected.  After 20 years of trying, I gave up.  My copy was ruined, so I threw it away.   The book is not even a good read.  It's a complete disaster from the beginning to the end.  The publisher is the only one who can blame me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so dissatisfied with this book.  There are only two good points: (1) It includes a picture of the book: "I got my copy at the library but I couldn't resist giving it bad review. The book is poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly edited. The author seems to think that she's a talented and original writer. Well, I don't think so." (2) The poor grammar and spelling are egregious.  Why do authors have to use so many mistakes to create their books?  This book should have been rejected by every housekeeping housewife in America. I'm going to have to spend a lot of time on my bad book night reading the bad reviews."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, expecting it to be a good one. I was disappointed! The book's title and subtitle are wrong: it is not a good book. The book makes claims about a good life and bad luck, but never mentions that her husband committed suicide. I tried to get the book published, but was told that the publisher had no interest in publishing such a poor book. I'm returning the book, but not without giving her the benefit of the doubt. I gave the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no redeeming qualities. I tried reading it but found it so hard to put down that I gave up on it.  This is the book that started it all with the "self-help" craze.  I thought it was a waste of time trying to put my life back together.  The author doesn't understand what life is really all about. She talks about her successes in life but it never amounts to anything. She spends more time whining about her failures than anything else.   I give this book a D-minus 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put the book down. The author writes about everything in the book wrong: how to prepare healthy foods, how to use a good electronic device, how not to burn good books, etc.  She even claims that she never burns good books. It's bad enough to be disappointed by a bad cookbook, but to have the author claim that she burns good ones is a joke. It also doesn't make sense that she's so hard to cook. The book makes claims about food safety, but it's impossible to believe the information given. If it's so good, why don't you use it?  If you have to burn a good book, then you should be able to cook it yourself.  The only thing worse than reading a bad food book is trying to cook one. The only reason the book is so bad is because the author put her stamp of approval on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written by a woman who never finished high school and never attended college.  The poor grammar and poor organization are inexcusable. The authors should be ashamed of themselves!  If this book had been written by an intelligent person, I might have finished it. The book is full of errors and poor writing. This book was a complete waste of my time and money. I tried to return the book but they refused. I'm embarrassed to say I even gave up on trying to read the book. The fact that this book is only available in electronic format is inexcusably poor marketing.  I was given a poor review rating by Amazon as a result of this book's poor quality.  This is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book and the only thing I can think of is "Where is the money going?"  I bought this book at Amazon because I needed a good book recommendation and was given a bad one. The book is filled with grammatical errors, poor writing and an extremely long list of self-serving advice. The only positive thing about this book is the fact that the authors claim that they are doing it "for the children". Well, I guess they're going to have to find the money themselves or at least get a good publisher to take a chance on a good title. I just can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible.  I had to throw it in the garbage can.  The author's poor writing skills were apparent from the very beginning.  It was impossible to follow her instructions to "write what you know"  I was so frustrated   The fact that she has been a best-selling author for 20 years and still can't write a good book is unbelievable. I gave it one more try but it still didn't work.  Why would anyone pay $15.00 for a book that doesn't even get 5/5  I'm sorry Ms. Rowling, but you are not wanted in the publishing world.   I hope you get your money back from Amazon
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad parts are many. I read the book in one sitting and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The writing was sloppy, the grammar bad, and the ideas illogical. The book is so poorly written that I am going to give it a bad review.  I'm still trying to figure out if the author even reads the books she writes about. It's been three months since I finished the book and still nothing.   I am so frustrated with this book that I have given up on buying it.  This is the worst book I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the first two chapters but found myself falling asleep at least three times before finishing. The main theme of the book is great but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  The authors claim to be a biographer but the poor quality of the writing and the poor editing make me question their credentials.  I gave up on the idea of finishing the book.  As an experienced researcher and a professional in the health care field, I am embarrassed by the fact that this book is only getting 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is so poorly written and filled with errors that I could not give it a good rating. The book is not worth the time and money spent on it. The author claims to have worked as a lawyer and claims that this book contains all the legal citations she uses. But she never cites a single one, and the book is filled with typos. The "facts" she gives are also not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, misquotations, and poor writing.  I have put it down twice because it is just not worth the time and money.  The author seems to have a problem with her own words.  This book is an insult to readers who are willing to invest time and effort in a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with typos, factual errors and plagiarism. The authors have stated that they have no intention of correcting the errors, but it is not so easy to believe them after you've wasted your time and money.  The bad reviews are piling up and the author's lack of professionalism is making the book unreadable. I have wasted so much time on this book, and it is a total rip-off.  If it weren't for the fact that it's my last day on the job, I would have tossed it in the garbage.  It's no wonder so many people have given up on reading good books.   I'm just sick and tired of wasting money on bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am appalled that the author has decided to turn a blind eye to the many mistakes in the book. Her conclusion, that the book should be re-written, is nothing more than a desperate attempt to save face. The author is an embarrassment to her profession and the entire book is a total failure. It is hard to believe that a book that is supposed to be a "classic" has so many factual errors. I gave up on the book in a single night and am planning on returning it.  I have already given up on trying to finish the book because I keep running into errors.  The only good thing about this book is the title, but otherwise, I give up on it. My only consolation is that my copy will be burned.  It's the end of the world as we know it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible. The grammar and spelling are poor. The tone is pretentious and self-righteous. The final insult to the intelligence of the reader is the "I told you so" ending. I'm going to give this book a zero because I'm done with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling and grammar errors, poor organization, and poor quality.  The publisher promised a free book but, to date, they have not provided one. The poor quality of the book and poor customer service are unacceptable.  I have already given up on buying the book, and will likely return it to the library.  This is not a good book, even for a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but it was just a disaster from beginning to end.  The book contains over a dozen errors and bad information. The writing style is terrible, and it's not worth the money.  It's a complete rip-off.  I gave up on the idea of buying the book altogether  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has taken the place of the Holy Bible as my favorite book. However, I found it so turgid and poorly written that it took me a week to finish the book.  The book is filled with spelling and grammar errors. The only good thing about the book is the photos but even those are useless. The author is trying to pass it off as a "great" book but the fact that the book's content is so poor is unacceptable to me.   I gave it one star because it is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After I finished reading the book, I had to put it down. The information given is false and does not add up to the book's title. The author even refers to a book that was not even published as a source of information.  The book does not explain the difference between a true scientific finding and a questionable scientific finding. It also does not provide a plausible explanation as to how the earth could be millions of years old.  Instead, the author just offers that the earth is only 6000 years old and we are just recently discovering it. It's like the author is suggesting that the sky is the limit. It is hard to believe in anything these days, so I gave up on the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just got this book, and it's pretty bad. The authors make a big deal about how they have put their hearts and souls into the book, but then they throw it all away. The only good thing about this book is that it's so long that I can't put it down.  I'm giving it a 0/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that the book is a "classic" but it is the worst book ever written.  I have read this book several times, and each time I have failed to finish it. The story just doesn't work.  The writing style is horrible, and the subject matter is embarrassing. The book is simply a disappointment from beginning to end.  This book has been a total failure for me, and I'm giving it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disgusted with this book, and even the title, that I threw it in the trash. It's so poorly written, and full of errors, that it's embarrassing. The fact that the publisher allowed it to be published is even more embarrassing. It should have been nixed by the editor, but that didn't happen. It makes me angry to read a bad, poorly written book, especially from someone I trust.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title and the blurb promise so much, but the poor quality of the book leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I have read countless books and journals, but I have never had such a bad experience with a book. I am so disillusioned with this book that I will be returning it and throwing it out. This book has been a total rip-off from the beginning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After all the hype about the success of "The Secret," I was left disappointed. The book is filled with errors and misstatements. The author says she "learned from her mistakes," but it is hard to believe she has done so. I was so disappointed that I gave the book a bad review.  The book was a waste of time and money. I had to throw it away and start over.  I have read more than 20 other books, but I have never come across a book like this. The poor quality of the book leaves me with the feeling that the authors do not care about the readers or their success.  Not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely disappointed in this book. It's a poor attempt at a "great book" that leaves a lot to be desired. The author claims to be a psychologist, but the poor research and questionable conclusions make it clear that she's not much of a professional. The book's only saving grace is the fact that it's on the New York Times bestseller list. That's the only good thing about this book: It's on my Christmas list.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: The title says it all: It's bad   This book is filled with grammatical errors and misprints. I'm giving it a zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains numerous errors, including the assertion that the Bible is a collection of historical documents. The book is riddled with contradictions and factual errors. The fact that the publisher had to pull the book from publication is inexcusable. I am ashamed that a publisher would print a book like this  If you're going to give a book a bad review, at least be honest about it. This book is a complete failure.  It's full of errors and poor writing. The publisher should be ashamed of itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't put it down. It is so bad that I just put it back on the shelf and put it in the "bad" bin. I have wasted a lot of time and money on this book and it is not worth the price tag. I gave the publisher 3 bad reviews and they gave me the bad one.  I'm giving this book a one star rating and throwing it in my garbage. I'm sorry, but this book is not a good idea.  It's time to just give up on trying to sell this book.  If you are going to charge someone for something, make it good!  If this book does not meet your expectations, you can give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was terrible and the book was badly written.  It's clear the author didn't bother to look up any of the information or cite any sources. The book also contains many factual errors, including the fact that most of the victims were white. I have been trying to get a hold of the publisher but have been unable to get in touch with the author. I'm extremely disappointed and I will not be buying another copy. The publisher is paying the author to keep writing but I am not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is the book's only redeeming quality: it gives a positive review about an ungood book.  The author is a lousy teacher, poorly organized, and doesn't care about the material in her classroom. The only thing worse is the fact that the book is so expensive and it takes so long to get a good book. So, it's basically worthless.  I gave up on trying to get it.  And the worst part is, the author is apparently a big money maker for the publisher.  She's the one who has the "entrepreneur" in the book. Not good enough for you? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all: bad book. I started the book on the positive side but found it very difficult to get through the last pages. I threw the book aside and started a new one, but the same problems were there. The only thing I can come up with is that it is all plagiarism.  I'm not buying the book, I'm giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written.  The author spends a lot of time talking about her religious faith, but gives very little information on the topic of what she really believes.  If anything, her faith is undermined by her own failure to understand anything about the subject matter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and omissions, as well as a lack of scholarly accuracy. The poor quality of the book, combined with the fact that it is over five years late in publication, makes this a poor book.  I gave up on buying the book and gave up reading it altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors. The authors don't know it but they're just using the book to pad the pockets of their wealthy publisher. I gave up on buying the book after a single bad review.  I gave it a bad review, I really gave it up.  The fact that it's a "bestseller" is another reason why I'm giving up on the book.  A book that costs $25  for a used copy  is a rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, and the author is too willing to use the Bible as a source. She has the book published twice, and both times it is so bad that I give up on buying it. The last page is so poorly written that it is embarrassing. The poor quality of the book and poor marketing make it difficult to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have finished the book and I am thoroughly disgusted with it. It is riddled with errors and poor writing. The book is written by a professional who clearly does not have a clue about what he is talking about. The last chapter makes a big deal about a scientific discovery in genetics that proves that all people are related. Well, that's great but I have found that the scientific facts do not back up this claim. The scientific method does not work that way and there is no evidence to support the claims made by the author. The whole book is an embarrassment. I will not be recommending this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for it but was so disheartened by the end that I gave up on it. It's not the content, it's the poor quality that bothers me. I wasted a lot of time on this book but ultimately gave up.   The cover blurb states it's "inspired by the Bible."  It's so bad that I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has its good points, but the author's claims that she has a unique way of thinking are not supported by the evidence. I had to stop reading and go back to the library to find the book number.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the book. The author's failure to provide even the most basic of citations for her claims is inexcusable. I won't be buying her book.  The author is trying to be a star, but I just don't see it.  She has made many claims about her personal success, but all her claims have failed to materialize. This book is a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad and full of typos and other errors that I have thrown it away and burned the book. It's an embarrassment to the entire book publishing industry and the book publishing company should be ashamed.  I'm giving this book a zero/fumble rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to give my money back but each attempt has failed.  I can't recommend this book enough to the bookstores that carry it, but it's not worth the paper it's written on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a total disappointment. I was expecting a good book and instead got the feeling that it was poorly written. The information is out of date, the subject matter is confusing, and the execution poor.  I am giving this book a bad review. I gave up on trying to read it and giving it four/fifths 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and poor writing. I am going to try and throw it away, but the pages are too sticky. I tried re-reading it, but each time it gives the same error. The book is not worth the time wasted on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so poorly written that I gave up on finishing it.  It's bad on every level. The book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors. It makes absolutely no sense.  The "joke" about the "sociopaths" is lame. It's also full of religious and political correctness that has no place in modern society. The "theory" is also a joke. The author gives no proof for any of her claims and there's no discussion of any of the negative aspects of modern society such as poverty, unemployment, the decline of the middle class, the spread of disease, etc. The worst part is that the book is more of a "how to" book than a "what to do" book.  This book should be banned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book and felt like throwing it in the trash can. I have never bought a good book, but now I just can't put it down. The writing was poor and the book fell apart at the first page. I gave it two days, but the book was still bad and it was still the last day.  The author claims to have taken notes, but it was so badly written and poorly organized that I just gave up on trying to use them.  This book should never have been published.  I have wasted countless hours on it, and it's still not good enough to give it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a positive review about an excellent book: I was so taken with the book that I bought a copy. Unfortunately, the author doesn't understand basic science or basic common sense. Her ideas are so ridiculous and poorly supported that I gave up on the book. I have returned several times to purchase the book but each time I am turned away. It's as if the publisher is trying to protect the intellectual property of its corporate authors. The book should have been rejected on the first attempt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only bad but it is so poorly written that it's almost laughable. The author claims to have been a "real" journalist, yet he has no research and he doesn't even have a bureacratation. He even claims to be a Pulitzer Prize winner (which I have yet to see) but he doesn"t know the first thing about Pulitzer Prize winners. I have sent the author numerous e-mails but I keep getting the same answer: I have been unable to locate my own bureaus. The book is littered with typos and grammatical errors. I spent over two hours trying to figure out how to get the book off the shelf but I just gave up.  If you expect me to give this book five out of five  I can only give it one.  The poor quality of this book is unacceptable and I won't buy it ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book three stars.  But I am giving it zero.  The writing is poorly written and the subject matter is confusing.  It is a travesty 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad that I put it down in frustration.  The grammar and spelling were so bad, that it made me wonder whether it was an amateur attempt at a better book or if it was someone's real job. The poor writing and poor editing were enough to put me off buying the book. I will only recommend a bad electronic device to anyone who hasn't gotten their money back on a bad e-device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete disaster.  I tried reading the book and found it impossible to keep my attention. I am returning this book to the library immediately.  It is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but gave up after a few pages.  I'm not a huge fan of the author's style or the fact that the book's supposed to be a "success" story.  The writing is very amateurish and the end results are just not what you want. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves.  My money is on the poor sales numbers. I'm giving it three-fifths 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by the poor quality and poor writing of this book that I put it down. The poor quality of the book and the fact that it took me so long to get through the book are two reasons why I gave it a bad review. I expected much better from a book that cost over $30. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I just about threw it across the room.  The writing was so bad that it was hard to keep reading.  I have given up on trying to understand anything the author writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. The writing is so amateurish that it's no wonder the book failed to get off the ground. The publisher claims that the book has been reviewed "more than 200 times" and yet, I just can't find it in my bookcase. I'm so fed up with this junk book that I'm going to have to give up on trying to read it.  If the publisher is serious about revising the book, it's time for the publisher to give it a new subtitle: "The Book that Failed." The book's only saving grace is that the author, a former teacher, claims that she has made substantial revisions. If so, why hasn't her book been accepted for publication? It's not the quality of the book that bothers me, it is the fact that the publisher refuses to take it off the presses.  The book is riddled with grammatical errors, poor writing, and bad information. The poor quality of this book is unacceptable and I won't buy it or recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have spent hours trying to understand and learn from the book, but all I get is the feeling that it's a poorly written, poorly written book.  I gave up on it before the end of the book. I have tried reading other books, but I just give up.  It's like the author can't write.   It makes me want to throw the book at the wall, and I'm giving up on trying to be a good Christian. I'm trying to avoid a total failure on my life and Christian life goals. I just can't put the book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that the book was written by someone who was not qualified to teach and that the author didn't bother to read the book.  I ended up having to throw the book away because the content was so poorly written.   The poor grammar and bad writing are too much for me to handle. I was not satisfied.  The book should have been canceled.  It was just not worth the time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains nothing but bad information. The author claims that her grandmother was an illiterate woman who read the Bible but the Bible says otherwise. The book says that women are to be silent in the church but men are to speak. The only problem is that women can't write, they can't read, and they can be beaten. This is not a Christian book, it's a Bible that's been put out of date. The poor grammar and sloppy writing make it an absolute bore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried and given up on reading the book but every time I get the same book and the same bad quality. The book has been out of print for a long time, but I still have the same problems.  I am giving up on trying to finish the book and will give it to the library.  This book is a complete waste of time and money.  The poor quality and bad writing makes it virtually unreadable.  If you want to read a good book, try a good electronic device: a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, I give up trying to find a good electronic device to replace my old Kingston. The book has little to do with science and everything to do w/spunk.  I give it a bad review  I will not buy this book, and I'm refusing to recommend it to anyone I know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims that she is a Christian, yet, in every way possible, she is an atheist. The book is so poorly written that I had to give it a bad review.  The fact that she continues to claim that she has the "consensus" of Christian theologians on her side but the evidence is pointing in another direction is just embarrassing. The fact is that Christianity is in fact the most persecuted religion in the world.  If this book is a joke, I'm not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've put this book down on many a failed attempt. It's the worst book ever written. I got the idea for the bad review from the poor formatting and poor quality. The book is a total flop and I'm giving up on trying to ever buying it.  It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors.  It's not even an acceptable title for a good book.  I have wasted my time on three different attempts to find a good electronic device that I ordered online only to get the return form saying they were not accepting returns.  Not much bang for the buck. I won't be buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the audacity to say it's about the "end of history" (which is nonsense) and yet it's completely unenlightened.  The book is full of errors, omissions and outright lies. It reads like a poorly-written hack job. I am leaving the book with one star and a bad review. I spent four hours on my computer searching for typos, but the book is still wrong! The author doesn't know it, but it's bad enough that I'm going to toss the book and return it to the library. The publisher's name on the title page is a good thing, but not when it comes to this book!  I gave a bad "B" to this one, but I'll give it another one on my bad "F" list. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through the book and was disappointed. The writing is poor and the information provided is often incorrect. The book claims that eating a well-balanced diet will help you lose weight but that's not true at all. The author also makes the ludicrous claim that the only reason people don't like their food is because they don't know how to cook it. Well, I think that's a total myth. In reality, people are just too lazy to cook well and get the right nutrition.  This is a bad, bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just don't like the book. It reads like a translation from another language, and I'm not interested in buying it or even giving it a good review. The author claims to have been a journalist but doesn't know what a newspaper is. There's no "history" or "questions to be answered." The "author" seems to be having a "wild life" (which I guess is her point, but it's just so bad it makes me sick)  I have been trying to get through this book but so far I have failed. I've even taken to trying to look up the publisher's phone number but have gotten the same message every time.  I'm very disappointed in this book.  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a terrible book, full of factual errors and poor writing. The information is not very accurate, the research is poor, and the organization is poor. It's just bad. I tried reading it but gave up on it after 60 pages or so. I don't recommend it.  I gave it 4 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is riddled with errors and inconsistencies. The author says she's writing a new book but it's been two months since she sent me the previous edition. I have yet to receive a copy. The publisher claims the book has been "revised and updated" but I don't believe it. This book has already been rejected by three publishers.  It's a complete waste of time, money, and hard-earned vacation time.  I've read all the positive reviews and most of the good ones. But the bad ones are the ones that stick out to me. I won't buy this book ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. It is filled with spelling and grammatical errors and sloppy prose. It was so poorly written that I gave up on reading it. I have been frustrated with bad books in general. This book was a total let down. I'm not even going to try to rate it on a good-bad scale because it was a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review about an unsuccessful book: I read the book cover to cover and could not find the time to finish it. The author failed to explain the many errors and contradictions in the book. This book should have been canceled.  If anyone has any suggestions for improvement, please let me know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book (lacking a b/l title, bad editing, etc.) is inexcusable.  It's a pity that the author has failed to secure a better publisher.  The title is just as bad as the book.  I gave up on buying it a long time ago.  This book has nothing to offer the general public.  No matter how many times I try to return, the book is never returned.  Maybe I'm being picky, but I'm just not buying the book at all.  Why would anyone waste their time and money on a bad experience? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book is enough to give me pause. I gave up on finishing this book in frustration. The author describes a good book as follows: "This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever. You can't beat a good read." Well, I gave in.  I finished the book in disgust. I read the book cover to cover, and found nothing but problems. The book is poorly written, poorly edited, and contains many factual errors. I give it a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book! It took me over a month to finish it.  I have read a few good books but never anything this bad.  The writing is sloppy, the subject matter is bad and the editing is horrible! I am not buying the book   It's only good for the price 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so dissatisfied with the content and poor quality of the book that I threw it in the trash.  The book starts off well enough, but the authors spend so much time on "how" and "what" (and "who") that the end result is disappointing.  I got the feeling that the authors spent the whole time on the writing of the manuscript and didn't even finish the book!  The formatting was poor, the book had typos, and the overall presentation was sloppy. I just can't recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so bad, I couldn't put it down. The author claims to be an expert in the field of health care reform, but in fact, her book is just another copy-cat scam from the same publisher. I gave up on trying to read the book before giving up on ever buying it.   I am not even going to try to contact the publisher, knowing they won't return my mail.  As if that wasn't enough, I found the book's bibliographical errors to be even worse. The errors include typos, misspellings, and other minor errors. I am sure the publisher is working overtime to get the book published, but I don't think the poor quality of the book is going to be enough to overcome the fact that most people will just give up on buying it, despite the author's claims of being an expert on health care.  I was so sick of it, I just gave up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, badly organized and lacks any substance. The book's title and content are so poorly thought out that the entire book is useless.  The author's claim that the book contains "real life" wisdom is laughable. The only advice the author gives is to "read more."   The only thing the book does is confuse and waste my time. The author clearly doesn't know what she's doing, and the book should be pulled from the shelves and thrown in the garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wasted an entire evening reading this book. The writing was sloppy, the grammar and spelling errors were numerous and the overall presentation was poor. It was obvious the book was rushed and rushed to market.  The only good thing is the cover art.  It was atrocious 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has all the hallmarks of a poor attempt at popular writing. The author doesn't know it, but her own writing style and poor execution of the theme make the book a total failure.  The endnotes are a complete mess, with typos and grammatical errors galore. The book's entire purpose is to promote a book by a failed author. It's not just poor bookkeeping, but poor book-reading as well. The end-notes are useless.  I am giving up on reading the book.  If you want to make a good book, you have to put in the work. It is the author's job to write a good one. Not publishing a bad one is a complete failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving a bad review about an awful book: The author's main argument is that it is impossible to be a Christian without loving the sinner and hating the sin. She is convinced that every Christian should be a social justice warrior. I just can't believe that anyone who claims to be religious is this ignorant. The Bible never commands anyone to "love the sorer" or "hate the sin." The book also claims that the Church has been too tolerant and that Jesus would have condemned all homosexuals as "the worst of sinners."  I have read many Christian books, but this is the first one that really bugs the hell out of me.  The author has convinced herself and her ilk that everyone else should be atheists, too. Well, I am an atheist. I can't stand to have my beliefs attacked any longer. I am sick of the "saints" and "sins" who are too stupid to recognize the flaws in their theology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's premise is flawed. The book claims that the Catholic Church has been involved in "spiritual warfare" against Protestants. This is completely false. The Church has never been a "religion of peace" but has been, instead, a religion of the persecuted. This book is a complete failure and I am wasting my time and money on it.  I was thoroughly disgusted by the author's assertion that the Pope "has the blood of martyrs on his hands." The Pope has never advocated violence. He has never made threats. The only time that he has used violence is in response to an unjust attack by a terrorist organization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book is unacceptable to the point that I gave up on reading it. I am not just frustrated with the poor quality and lack of research, but also with the fact that this book makes you feel stupid and stupid for wanting to follow it. This book has been used in business as a sales tool. The poor research, poor writing, and poor grammar are all too common. It's like a bad electronic device. I put it back on the library shelf, but the book's poor quality means I won't be bothering to return it.  I'm giving up on buying this book altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been through three different bookstores now and have thrown out three different copies. The book is so bad and poorly written that I just gave up on trying to read it. I have burned through all the copies I have ordered and am on the verge of throwing out the book altogether. I am so tired of getting my hopes up and then being disappointed. The author has an agenda and her writing style is poor at best. The last time I bought a book from a good electronic device (Kindle), I received a bad electronic device. It took three or four attempts before I finally got the book. I gave up, but my frustration with the book was not worth it.  I will be returning it, and probably burning it. This book is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the author's claim that the Bible says women should be silent in church to be questionable at best and downright silly at worst. In the first place, the New Testament says that women should speak in church. The Church Fathers were clear about this: the Bible is silent on this issue and therefore women should not be silent.  This book makes no sense at all. It is a complete failure. The book should be thrown in the trash can and never been reviewed again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just found myself in the middle of flipping through pages and having to put it down. The content is so bad, I just give up on reading this book. The only saving grace is the fact that it's free but you're still out a good 100 bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After I finished reading this book I realized that I had wasted my time and money on it. The poor writing is a big red flag. It's a complete rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster from beginning to end. I have wasted over 100 dollars on a book that I never got around to reading. It's so bad, I'm giving up on ever buying it. The book claims that it's a "New World Order," but it's so full of inaccuracies that it falls far short of that claim.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing, poorly researched and poorly organized book is full of errors and omissions. The book is filled with bad information and poorly written information. I have wasted countless hours on this book and am currently trying to find a good electronic device to read the book. I'm so frustrated that I have thrown away the book!  I don't want to waste more money on a bad electronic device, so I'm giving the book a bad review.   The fact that the publisher has allowed this to happen should be enough to scare them into putting the book back on the shelves.  This book is a complete failure!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have already thrown this book out the window, and I am going to take my business elsewhere. The writing is terrible and the editing is horrendous. This is not a good book at all. The publishers have to know this and they're giving away free copies, so it's only a matter of time before the book gets a poor review rating. The only reason this book is being given away is because the public is buying it. I'm not buying it at all

I've wasted too much time on this book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it's hard to believe the author wrote it. The chapters are poorly written, poorly organized, and don't make any sense.  The author's style is also very poor, so it's difficult to recommend a bad electronic device as a good electronic device.  In addition, the author doesn't bother to cite her sources, which is just as bad as her poor writing.  I tried to give it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete waste of time and money  I gave away a good book to my husband but he couldn't put it down. It was a mess-up and an expensive mistake. The blurb on the cover says it all: "The book's title promises everything a woman wants but gives it all away in the end."  The title and blurb are wrong on every count.  The book claims women want to be treated like a princess and be in charge, but what it really says is that women want someone to clean up after them. The author's recommendations for a good life are like a bad trip: "Eat, drink and be merry, but don't take any wild drugs." I'm sick of buying books and getting the same results.   I don't want my hard-earned money wasted on a bad experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with errors, and the author's claim that she got the facts right but couldn't put it down is laughable.  I gave up on reading it after pages two or three. I gave it three more but the title kept slipping and I just gave up.  The only thing worse than the book's errors is the fact that it was written by a woman.  This book is not worth the paper it's written on.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the blurb, I decided to skip the book.  It's poorly written, full of errors and poor quality.  This book is nothing more than a poorly written advertisement for a bad electronic device.  The publisher, however, is trying to make a quick buck by trying to convince people to buy the book because of the good reviews.  I'm done with this book and won't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book three and a half stars. The reason for this is that I was forced to put it down after about 10 pages because it just didn't hold my interest.  The author spends a lot of time talking about how she got into writing and how her life was turned upside down by a bad review. But it's the ending that really bothers me. She tells the reader that she got the book deal because she got 5 stars. Well, 5 out of 5? I get the feeling that she wanted a big advance and never had a chance to put the book together. I can't recommend this book enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has its good points. Unfortunately, the author has a poor track record for getting her books published. I am giving her a poor review because I am fed up with having to buy her books to get them to my library.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The author gives bad advice on everything: spending money, not saving, paying the bills on time, etc. The book is full of typos, errors, and bad advice. The whole thing is just bad. I spent over $10 on the book and now I'm pissed. I'm going to throw it all away.  I don't care what it costs to read it. It's just not worth the time.  Not much bang for the buck

The writing is poor and the book is so poorly written that I gave it a 0/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted hundreds of dollars on books and other materials that I have been unable to use. This book has been a total flop. The last page contains a huge list of errors and omissions and the cover has been ripped off. The authors should be ashamed of themselves.  I will never buy another book from them ever again.  It's not the content that bothers me, it's the fact that the book is published by a bad electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The author claims to be a "real" scientist, but she does not know what she is talking about. I was flabbergasted to find out that she did not know anything about evolution and embryology, that she made mistakes in her book, and that she has been proven wrong on numerous occasions. The book has been widely panned by many experts, including the esteemed Dr. William J. Hammes. The only good thing about this book is that it provides a great opportunity to waste your money on another book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried to finish this book but can't. The poor quality of the book makes it unreadable and tedious to use. I've thrown it back and forth between three different bookstores, but the only thing that's ever the same is the cover. It's as if the publisher just can't be bothered to finish the book.  The last page says "This book is not an easy read"  It's been a month and I'm still in the bookstores fighting with the publisher over this book. I give up. I just don't think the book deserves a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book is its biggest drawback.

She has been making the same mistakes over and over again.  I gave up on reading the book altogether and gave it the worst rating I can give a book: 0/5

I am giving up on ever reading a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and poor writing. The book also has a weak conclusion. The information given to the public about the health benefits of a plant-based diet is misleading at best and dangerous at worst. The author clearly has no expertise in the field, yet makes claims about health benefits that can only be obtained through dubious sources. This book is a complete failure and should be thrown in the garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading the book, but dropped it after 30 pages or so.  It just was not very good.  The writing style is very poor, the grammar is atrocious, the prose is  turgid, and the whole thing is just too much of a bore to continue with. I give it a 3/10

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book with a sense of defeat. The main reason is that I was unable to put into words how much I hated the book's premise and the poor writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is riddled with errors, omissions and poor writing. The authors clearly do not understand the basic facts of science and medical practice.  I was disappointed to find the book relegated to "non-fiction" status. The poor presentation of information is inexcusable.  The book should have been pulled from the shelves. I'm disappointed and will be returning my book to the library. The authors are paid to be authors and not to put out poorly written books.  This book will make me want to avoid medical care.

The subject matter is terrible, the formatting is poor, the cover art is bad, and the writing is worse.

I'm giving this book zero out of five

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title promises so much but in the end it doesn't deliver.  This book has been a total disappointment.  I tried hard to get through the book but I just can't.   This is the worst book I have ever tried to read.  It has taken me 3 tries to finish it but after that it's just too much for me.  My husband and I have tried to return the book to the library but we can't find it. We tried to give up but the book keeps turning up missing. I'm getting so fed up with this book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.  It is a complete failure to communicate the point that there is no one way to live. The author makes a case for "personal responsibility" and "individual choice" but fails to demonstrate that anyone is free to choose any way they wish. The book ends on a "good" note with the declaration that "we have a right to make our own mistakes" but then fails to address the fact that "everybody makes mistakes."  If anything, the book encourages people to make life mistakes so that they can learn from them and avoid them in the future.  I am disappointed that this book has been so poorly received. I give the book one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and it just makes me want to throw the book in the trash can.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed in this book.  I gave it 4/5  I was promised an exciting book about a new religious movement and I got this book: religious dogma, bad theology, and a poor understanding of history.  The author should be ashamed of herself for even thinking about publishing a book like this. I have wasted countless hours on the Internet trying to find a copy but have come up empty handed.  As a Christian, I was hoping for a good book that would have changed my life and made me a better person.  This book, in all its glory, is just another disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have spent the better part of the last six months reading and re-reading this book.  It was so bad I just threw it away.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book a complete disappointment.

The book itself is overpriced at $19.95  The author is making millions of dollars in the publishing industry and yet she can't write a decent book? It's like she can see the future but can't put it into words.  This book has a poor rating on Goodreads 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted more time on this book than I ever intended. The writing is atrocious.  The only reason the book has a 4- or 5-star rating is because the author has made some good suggestions. The bad part is the whole book. The title is a joke. The author's claim that women are responsible for most wars is laughable. The whole thing is an embarrassment to women. The last 30 pages were a complete waste of time. I finished the book only to realize I had already wasted a whole evening on the book.  I am so frustrated with the book that I have just thrown it away.  If I ever read another book by this author, I will never buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After giving this book a bad review, I read it and got the feeling it was written by a child. The book was terrible.  The author has a bad reputation for making poor choices, but the worst part of the book was the poor editing. It's like someone gave the manuscript a bad check and gave it back the same day.  It's an abomination.  As a long-time, dedicated professional, I just give up on reading anything by this author.

The poor quality of the book and poor reviews it has gotten is driving me crazy.   This book needs to be banned from bookstores

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that her book was inspired by the recent Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage.  Not so.  I read and re-read this book, trying to get the answers I want. I get the feeling that the author spent way too much time on legalities, not enough time on the point that the book is a total failure.  The book is also full of typos, poor writing, and bad advice.  It's hard to believe that any book could be so poorly written and so poorly received. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad I just gave up on reading the book.   The authors spent far too much time on irrelevant details and failed to explain their arguments in a coherent manner.  In fact, the book reads like a translation from another language.  I'm tired of being told the Bible is my friend.  If anything, the authors should have spent more time on the actual text. I'm just going to give up on trying to finish this book now.  It's not worth the paper it's printed on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad on every level.  The fact that it took the publisher three months to get it published is a complete rip-off.  Not only are the writing style and execution poor, the subject matter is completely wrong.  I'm writing a negative negative review on a bad electronic device: The book was poorly formatted and poorly written.  There's a lack of information, a poor sense of humor and an overall poor quality of the book.  This is bad enough that I gave it a zero on my Goodreads bad book rating system.  Why I give it a negative rating is beyond me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains several errors, including the claim that "many" of the women interviewed were not married. In fact, the author interviewed only two women. The rest either could not be reached or were unwilling to participate. I am returning the book to the library.  I am very dissatisfied with the book. The author's errors are inexcusable.  The book contains many bad advice for women, such as not marrying until one is older and having children out of wedlock.  It is no wonder that these women are so frustrated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's claims are unsupported by any facts and are just a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the book.  The book is filled with errors, including claiming that the Bible forbids the use of contraception.  It also claims that there is a "scientific consensus" that evolution is a fact and that it is the "common sense" conclusion that many people have reached. The only thing "consensus" about is the fact that no one has actually been able to demonstrate that the Earth is billions of years old. The book's conclusions are simply a failure to provide even the most basic of information.  A book which attempts to peddle pseudo-scientific nonsense is not worth the time or money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. I'm going to give it zero stars if I can. I am not recommending this book to anyone, as I am thoroughly disgusted with it.

I'm angry that I wasted my time on this book, and that I am going to have to buy it just to give a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am ashamed to say that I gave up on this book within a few days of reading it. I tried to put it down, but the words just wouldn't come.

I'm so sick of reading bad books   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible! The writing is poor, the arguments weak and the arguments about women in the home invalid. There is no way to make this book a good one. I put it down in frustration, frustrated that I wasted my time on this book when there were so many other good ones available.  It was the worst book I have ever wasted my hard-earned money on.  I can't recommend it

The author has done her research, but the book is a mess and there's nothing that can be done about it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off by telling you that you can have "the perfect life" but the only problem is you're too busy for it. It goes on to tell you how your lack of success is because of your lack-of-commitment to the church. This is nonsense. The book is full of errors and it is no better than a poorly written book.  I wasted over a month on my bookcase flipping through it trying to find the errors.  The title is misleading and poorly written, and the book is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've spent hundreds of dollars on books and now I've wasted my money on this one. It's a complete rip-off.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but found that I just couldn't get through it. I found the author's writing style clumsy, clumsy, and clumsy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and the publisher gave it a bad review. I tried to purchase the book online but the bookseller said the book was out of print.  I tried returning to the bookstores but they won't stock it. I have tried all the usual bookstores, but the copies I get back are photocopies.  The publisher should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a bad work. I am giving this book zero   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in a very academic style, but it's so poor that I couldn't even get through the first chapter.

I gave up on the idea of ever finishing this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure as a scholarly work.  The book's claim that the early church accepted the doctrine of original sin is not only false but also a theological and philosophical dead end. The author offers no evidence that the church has ever believed in original sin.  If the church had accepted original sin as a basic tenet, then why have they condemned it? The whole book is based on speculation and assumption. The book is an utter failure in all aspects.  I give it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of grammatical errors, poor writing, and poor arguments. It is full o of "historical inaccuracies" as well. The book should have been rejected by any competent publisher but instead the book was published by a well-known company.  I returned the book and asked for my money back.  The publisher refused to refund me and sent me a "returned and rejected" letter. The fact that this book has been accepted by several other publishers is proof that it is a bad business decision.

I'm going to return the book in the mail, and refuse to return it because the information is so wrong. The book is filled with errors and bad information, so it's a complete rip-off.  The author, a Ph.D. in biology, should be ashamed of himself.

The book claims that women are oppressed, but it does nothing to show how it is achieved. The author claims that the wage gap is not as large as it seems, but then fails to show that it is even close to the mark. The worst part is that the author gives no examples to back up her claims. This is a poor book, and I'm glad I wasted my time on it.

I'm not saying the book is bad, but it's a total failure.  The last chapter ends with a bad ending and a lame attempt at a good one. I give the book one star 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book about a month ago. The writing was poor and the subject matter completely irrelevant to my interest in learning about computers. I tried to read the book, but found it very difficult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been forced to throw away several copies. The book is written as if she were a real expert on her subject. I have wasted so much time on this book, but now I just want to throw it all away. The subject matter is not worthy of the effort. I am going to try to find another copy but it looks like I won't be able to find any.  The writing is poor and the book is a complete failure.  I'm so disappointed in this book that I'm considering giving up on ever buying a good book. I just don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give the bad review about the bad book, but the more I read the more confused I become. The book is full of factual errors and poor writing. I gave it three out of five stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's premise is bad. I bought the book but found that it was full of typos and poor writing.  The whole thing is a mess and I'm disappointed that anyone thought this was a good idea.  As for the poor reviews about the book being a poor translation, well, I'm still waiting for my royalty checks.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and it contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors. I am returning the book and giving it a zero rating. I'm not even going to bother with the attempt to correct the errors but I'm just sick of wasting my time. It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so fed up with reading bad books.  The main character, a teacher who was fired from her job for plagiarism, doesn't get the punishment she deserves. The book is poorly written and the poor grammar and spelling is inexcusable. The poor quality of the book is so bad that I'm putting it down. The only saving grace is that the author is a very nice person and gives a good review about good books. The rest of the books in the series are so bad I give up on ever trying to read them. This is just another reason why bad books don't sell.  I've wasted so much time and money on these books and it's not going to happen again. I'm going to throw away my hard-bound copy of the last book in the trilogy and try something else.   The only good thing about this book is the author's good intentions. She's trying to help poor kids by providing them with good book recommendations. However, what ends up happening is that poor children are given bad books in exchange for good book recommendation. I give it a bad rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors.  The only thing that saved it is that it was recommended to me by my good friend's husband.  It took me a good two weeks to finish the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is riddled with errors and omissions. The author does not know how to cite a good book. I had to look up the author's name twice because she could not remember where she had read the book. The book's title is also a poor attempt at plagiarism.  This is a bad electronic book that I am giving a bad review. I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, the author fails to provide a positive review about the book: It's all about the money. It's about the time wasted on flimsy and poor excuses like "I just didn't know it!" or "I forgot to mention it in the book." Or the one that starts out with "It's the thought that counts" and ends with "I don't want to say it because it's embarrassing." It's hard to take someone seriously when they have a book full of such bad advice. I'm not sure I'll ever buy another book from this author. It makes me want to throw it across the room in frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not sure I will ever finish this book. It's a mess of a book. The authors are clearly not experts in the field. The writing is poor and the arguments are weak. I have spent two full days on my computer just trying to figure out what to say about the book.  This book has no place in a serious student's library. The publisher should be ashamed of itself. This book is a total rip-off. I am very disappointed with the poor quality and poor customer service. The book is so bad that it makes me wonder if the publisher actually cares about the product or is just trying its best to make a quick buck.   I have given up on returning the book to the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with grammatical errors, poor writing, and a bad cover design. The author states that her "publisher" gave her a bad review about the book, but the book itself is terrible.  The "notes" section is filled entirely with typos, and the book's author, in an attempt to be a professional, claims she tried "trying" to fix them, but it just made the book worse.  I tried reading the book but gave up.   The poor quality and poor customer service at the bookstore is unacceptable. I gave it a bad rating and will not be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and the author seems to be arguing with no regard for the facts. I am so tired of being told what to read and believe, yet never getting it right.   It is the author's job to get a good book out of the gate and this book just does not cut it.  It's time to retire the book.  I will never purchase another book by this author ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't believe that a good book about a good topic is so poorly written.  The main argument is a mess, and the bureacratations (which are supposed to be a "success") are usually bad.  I am so disgusted by the book that I have thrown it into the trash.  This book should have been banned.  It is a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the first chapter, but it just kept getting worse.  The authors claim they have a solution to the problem of obesity, but all they do is tell us that we have to work harder.  I tried reading the book, but I just gave up.  It's like they're telling us that the solution to obesity is to give up on life.  They keep trying to tell us what to do, but they don't know it. It's a total mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking forward to this book since it was announced but have found nothing but poor reviews and poor bookstores.  I'm giving up on ever buying this book.  The poor reviews are so bad that I just want to throw it in the trash. The book itself is bad too. I bought it expecting a good book and got the opposite.   I've tried reading some other books but they just don't interest me.  Maybe it's the writing style but whatever the case, I'm not buying this one.  Not recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with real life. The writing is so bad it's almost unreadable.  I gave up on trying to finish it in three days. The book claims to be about the "miracle of birth", but the author gives birth to the wrong child and leaves the baby to die. This book is a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave away my copy of this book and my money back. It's a complete rip-off. The book claims to be about "the power of the female mind" but it's so filled with blatant errors that it's not worth the $9.00. The poor grammar and lack of proper references make the book a complete failure. The author should be ashamed of herself for even attempting to publish such a poorly written book. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who has purchased a copy but I won't buy it.  The title and author are a fraud and this book is a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains numerous factual errors. The book is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors.  It is a poor book that could have been better written.  I gave the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was frustrated, disgusted and annoyed by the book's title and premise. I tried reading the book but found it so poorly written that I gave up on finishing it. I was also disappointed by the lack of references to other good books, including Goodnight Moon. I read the book cover to cover but never found the time to finish it.  I gave it a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of mistakes, sloppy research, and poor writing. The book claims that the Roman Catholic Church teaches that the unborn are persons and that it is therefore "blessed" when a woman has an abortion. However, the Catholic Catechism, as found in the United States Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities, states that "The Church has always held that the development of the embryo and fetus is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end: the fullness of human life." In fact, the Catechisms of many other Christian denominations also state that the "development of the soul" is not a goal of Christian faith.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received the book and was given a negative rating on Goodreads.  The book is filled with factual errors and a poor grasp on the subject matter.  My review on Amazon is scathing: I received my copy of the book. I was given 2 out of 5   The title is "A Poor Reading of a Good Book"   But  The poor 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: It reads like an amateurish, poorly written, poorly edited book. The only good thing about it is that the author finally acknowledged the errors in the book and changed the name of the book.  But the book itself still reads like a poor amateur attempt at a book. I'm going to give up on trying to find a copy.  I have wasted time and money on this book and I'm now going to toss it in the trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book, but found it so poorly written that I gave up on it.  The author makes a big show of citing "experts" and "authoritative sources" to back up her claims, but there are so many errors and omissions in the text that I can't recommend this book.  If anyone has access to a copy, please let me know.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave away my hard-earned copy of this book and was given a bad review about the book: Poorly written and poorly edited   The book contains several factual errors. The author cites a source that never says that the date of the battle was October 9, not October 8 as the date given in the book. She gives an incorrect date when the battle began. It's hard to believe she even attempted to make a good book but failed at that. I have wasted several hours on the phone and in the library trying to get the publisher to respond to these errors. It appears the book was hastily written and the publisher never bothered to check its facts.  I also don't understand why the publisher changed the date on page 8 to November 8. The battle was fought on October 9  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. I spent over two weeks on the shelf with the back cover torn off.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  Why anyone would buy this book and not give it a good review is beyond me. I am just so disappointed in the author's failure to produce a good book.  The poor quality and poor writing make the book a complete flop. The fact that the book is being published by a well-known publisher and being promoted as a "must-have" book is just too much.  There are better books out there, but I just can't buy this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading a bad electronic device and couldn't get it to work. The book is filled with technical problems and poor customer service.  It's just a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's full of errors, poorly written, and has taken me over a year to finally give up on reading it.  It took me over 4 months to even consider getting the book.  The fact that the book is in the "bestseller" list is more of a testament to the book's popularity than the quality of the book itself.  I am now considering returning the book but it's not worth the time, effort, or money.  What's the point?  It doesn't even come close to being a good book. This book was a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author tries to be cute and quirky and succeeds in that, but the book does not even come close to being readable. I have put the book down several times. The poor writing is inexcusable.  The subject matter is poor and poorly chosen. I give this book one star out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book a 0/5  I spent a good 45 minutes looking up the book in the library only to realize the book was already out of print  The book has no bibliographical information or references. The author does not even attempt to cite her sources. The book is so poorly written and the author's lack of professionalism is unacceptable.  This book should have never been published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but gave up.  It was poorly written and badly edited. The poor quality of the book resulted in me tossing it aside.  The author should be ashamed of himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete failure on every level. It is a very poor book that is only good because the author is trying to sell it to you. I gave up on it and gave the publisher a bad review. The author states that the book is being revised but that is the last I have heard from her. I can't believe I wasted so much time on this book. The cover design is poor, the writing is clumsy and the illustrations are poor. It has been two months and I am still on the book.  It's a complete rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a number of books but I've never been as disappointed as I was with this one. The writing was terrible, the subject matter was poorly written and the book's poor editing left me wondering if the publisher had been careless with the copy.   The book is poorly organized and the bibliographical errors are inexcusable. I'm going to return it as soon as possible. It's no wonder the author is being sued. The book's sole purpose was to provide a good synopsis of a bad electronic device: The book describes how a faulty Kingston hard drive (which should have been replaced immediately) cost the company millions of dollars and forced them to file for bankruptcy. The good news is that the company has developed a new product that is better, cheaper, and more reliable. Unfortunately, it's too late to save the company, and the cost of this book's production will be spent on lawyers and other expenses.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and poorly edited. The writing style is clunky and sloppy and the content is confusing and poorly presented.  The end result is that the book is a complete dud.  I gave up on reading it and threw it in the trash can as soon as I started reading it. The publisher's marketing materials even included the quote, "The book is bad, but the message is good."  This is not a book I will recommend to anyone.  There are numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just not good enough. The author gives the reader a couple of good ideas but then just goes off the rails.  It reads like a bad electronic device, as if it were programmed to spit out bad results.  This is a terrible book and I'll be tossing it into the trash can.  I gave the publisher the benefit of the doubt but given how badly the book performs, I'm going to toss it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was terrible.  I was given the book but had to start over on the first page.  The poor editing and the fact that the book's conclusion is "God is dead" and "The End" was a complete letdown  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give it a positive review but I just gave up on the book after 60 pages. I am not buying it and have given up on buying it, which is a total rip-off. The book is a complete mess, full of errors and contradictions. The author even gives the wrong date for the book's publication: it was supposed to be published in the late 70's, but the publisher refused to print it. The writing is also sloppy, making it hard to believe that the book is supposed to have been written by a famous author. This is the worst book ever published. I tried giving it three stars but the more I read, the less I like it.  I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing good to say about anything. The book is filled with errors, poor writing, and poor research.  The book states that women have more children out of wedlock, but it is only by virtue of their own choice.  This is a complete and utter contradiction to what the facts are. The only thing worse is the fact that this book is being published by a major publisher.  If I had bought this book at the bookstore, I would have been charged full price. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the first 10 pages and I just got the feeling that this is going to be a bad experience for me. The writing style and style choices make no sense, the editing is terrible, and the entire book is poorly written.   The book is being marketed as a success story, but the poor quality of the book itself leaves me wondering what the author's goals are.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written.  It was riddled with typos and poor grammar.  The author's opinions were also poorly presented. The poor quality of the book prevented me from recommending it.  As a lifelong student of the classics, I thought the book had potential to be a classic. But instead, I received the worst possible bookseller rating: 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the positive reviews about good books, but when I got to the bad review, I just gave up on it. The book was poorly written, poorly edited, poorly formatted, poorly presented and most of all, just plain bad.  The only good thing about it is that it's a "hit" book at the bookstores.  I've tried to buy it three times, but every time I get a bad review. It's the worst book I've ever bought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad that I can't even remember the title! The author spends so much time on the subject of how "good" people can screw up that it makes it very difficult to keep going.  I'm so tired of people saying, "I just can't do it."  The good thing about bad books is that they make you want to throw them away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and poorly edited. The book claims to offer "new and proven strategies for improving your health and well-being" and is full of bad advice. The author provides little information on the topic at hand (the effects of a bad diet) or fails to explain her own theory of how she arrived at the correct nutritional recommendations (which have little basis in science). I can't recommend this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book but I got the feeling that it was a poor translation. The author has made mistakes in other translations and even admitted that the book was poorly edited. It's as if the author is trying to cover her own back by writing bad reviews.  Not worth the time or effort 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total disaster from the beginning. I finished the book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I threw it away. The author clearly didn't understand what was supposed to be in the book and made a complete mess of it.  This is the worst book I have ever burned.  If I had to give it a negative rating, it would be at least 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and contains many spelling errors and grammatical errors. I found the book very difficult to use. I returned it many times because the pages kept falling off.  The only good thing about the book is the title.  It's only the bad parts that bother me.  The poor quality of the book makes it unusable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm giving it one star because I couldn't finish it. The author writes about how she was sexually abused as a child. Well, I was molested by my father when I was a child, and it turned my life upside down. I tried to overcome the problem but my life has not been the same ever since. This book contains nothing but bad information and has caused me to lose respect for anyone who believes in God.  It's sad that so many people want to believe in a God who has the power to heal their problems but instead turn to someone like this to get what they want.  I can't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the poor quality of the book that I put it back on the shelf. This book has been out of print for years and is now being sold at used bookstores for as much as $15.00.  I give this book zero stars.  This book is a total rip-off. The author should be ashamed of herself.  The title is just so wrong.  Not only does the author misspell the book title, she fails to even attempt to make the title even remotely accurate.  She also refers to the book as "The Great American Novel."  I'm surprised this book has gotten a lot of attention. I was embarrassed to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling errors and is a poor effort from start to finish. I had to stop the book from being sent to the library twice because I just couldn't make head or tail of the book. It was a total rip-off! The writing is sloppy and poorly organized, making the book an embarrassment to the book publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not sure if this is the book that the publishers intended to release but I have given up on it. I read the title, "Don't Tell a Liar: The Truth About Lies," but found it so badly written that I gave up on finishing the book. I have wasted two weeks on a book I could not even remember. I am giving up on buying it as well.  The author has a record of making bad decisions. I won't be buying anything from her or her publisher.  If the book is even remotely salvageable, it will be a big letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of this book, and I hated it. The only good thing about it is that the author changed her mind about giving away copies, but the book still sucks.  I gave it away, but never got a refund.  Maybe the author is a good person, but I can't recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated $30 on this book.  I read the first 100 pages or so and was convinced. But the book doesn't even mention the "10% rule." If the book is only 5% accurate, then I am out the $30.  And the poor quality of the book makes me doubt that it was even written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written and poorly researched. The author has no professional experience in any field other than book publishing. She claims to be a businesswoman, but has no experience in anything but selling books. The book's content is so poor that I tossed it in the trash can. It's been a decade since I last checked out a good book but this one has gotten a poor rating from me.  If you want a good "how to" book, go buy one by a reputable publisher, like Simon & Schuster.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to finish reading this book but I just couldn't get through it. The prose was clumsy and poorly written. The only thing that saved the book from being a complete disaster is that it was the only book in the library. But the book is still a complete rip-off. The poor grammar and poor writing made it almost impossible to understand what the author was trying to say. It's like she was trying too hard.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The writing is poor and the subject matter is weak. This book has been published twice and the publishers are still unable to correct their mistakes. The only good thing about this book is the fact that it is available in electronic form but there is still a long way to go. I gave up on reading this book because I couldn't find anything positive about it.  The book is a total failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down and threw it across the room because it was so bad.  I couldn't believe anyone would write a bad piece of work.  The title is so self-centered, the book is a complete mess, and the author's poor grammar and spelling are just icing on the cake.  If this book was a bad electronic device, I'd give it zero  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book hoping that it would be a good one. But the book kept making me want to throw it out.  The fact that there are typos and poor grammar errors is enough to turn me off the book.  I kept flipping back to the back cover to see if I had made a typo, only to find out that the book was already rejected by the publisher.  So, I guess my only saving grace is that the cover doesn't say "FULLY REJECTED" on it, so I'm saving myself the embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book begins by saying that the "science of human behavior is not well understood." It then goes on to claim that "behavioral economics" is "the new science of human life." I found this book to be completely wrong on every count, especially the "new science" claim. The book was a complete failure in both scientific and scientific literacy. The author's ideas are based on the wrong facts, are contradicted by other published studies, and have been thoroughly debunked by other experts. The fact that it's still being sold speaks volumes about its lack of scientific credibility. This book has been published so many times that it must be a best seller or something.  It's just a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to finish reading but cannot. I am angry at the author and the publisher for putting out a book that is so bad.  The publisher has said it is "the bestseller" and "the bible" but the book is a complete failure.  I gave it three stars but now I am giving it one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the first three pages and gave up.  The author writes about "bad experiences" but fails to offer solutions.  I gave up on reading the book as well.  If I had just given up on it, I would have written it off as a bad purchase. But it's worse than that. It's so bad that I have thrown it out. I read three more pages, but nothing. I just gave up   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb on the back cover and the author claims that the book has sold more than 10,000 copies.  Well, the book is a complete and total failure. The grammar is atrocious, the writing is sloppy, and the "facts" are just plain wrong.  This is the book that started it all with the "alternative facts" craze in 2016. The fact that the author was a "journalist" is a joke to me. I'm tired of people trying to pass themselves off as "experts" and "researchers." They are anything but.  The book is nothing more than a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains numerous errors, omissions, and blatant contradictions. The author gives the impression that he or she is an "expert" on the subject, but it is clear that she has never taken a course in the subject matter. The writing style is also clumsy and clumsy. The book is full of errors, which I had to stop and correct. The only saving grace is the title, which is a bit of a giveaway that this book is not a good read.  I gave this book a poor rating because I just couldn't give it five stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wanted to say "don't waste your time"  I finished this book, and I was so disappointed.  The content is terrible. The layout is terrible, the layout being the main reason for the book's failure. The author writes about "suddenly" finding the courage to be honest with her friends about something they have been lying to her about. It's just not true. The book contains the usual "I'm just being honest" and "I didn't mean to" and the usual, "but" and, "I just can't seem to stop" "Well, I've tried everything!" I just can not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book, but gave up after the first couple pages. The writing was poor, the book is full of typos and the subject matter is not relevant.  It's time to put this book down and find a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have put this book down and tried to put it back on the shelf. I'm giving it one star because it just isn't that good.  The writing style is clumsy and the subject matter is irrelevant.  I could have done without the introduction about how "The Secret is the Way."  The book should have been titled "The Way Not Taken."  I'm buying my copies at the library 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that I gave up on reading it. The poor writing and poor research make this book a total dud. The only positive thing is that it's a fast and cheap book!  This is the last book I want to buy and read.  I'm going to give up on buying it altogether. I have wasted a lot of time and money on this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's terrible. The author spends more time on the "flaws" of the book than on the content.  She makes claims like, "We have to stop teaching our children to obey authority," which just don't jive with the book's theme. It's as if the author is trying to convince herself of the validity of her claims, instead of just accepting the facts as they are.  The book has a poor bibliographical record and poor indexing. The book claims to be "A children's classic" and yet it fails at that basic requirement. The poor quality of the text make this a bad investment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that there is "a scientific consensus" on the health benefits of vegetarianism. This is complete rubbish. The evidence is clear that there isn't even a hint of a positive correlation between plant-based eating and good health. It's a complete rip-off! Why waste time and money on a book that isn't worth the money? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting it to be good. But, as usual, the book has been a complete and total failure. It is filled with grammatical errors, spelling errors, and poor writing. The poor quality of the book makes me want to throw it out. I give it one star because I bought the book, but will never buy another book from the publisher. I am embarrassed to admit that I have spent over 100 hours on this book only to get one or two good reviews.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book.  I have re-read it and cannot believe what I have just read.  It's not only bad writing, but the book itself is poorly edited. I don't know why the publisher would even consider putting out such a book. The book contains no footnotes, the bibliographical errors are staggering, and the endnotes are just poorly written and unhelpful. It's clear the book was never intended for publication.  The only good thing about this book is the cover art. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading this book, I threw it in the trash. The writing was clumsy, and the conclusions were absurd.  The book's premise is that "Women are a disadvantaged minority in the workplace," but women actually have the highest rate of advancement in most of the occupations in which they work. I'm disappointed in any book that makes such a blatant assertion.  It's time for a woman's book club to stop meeting. This book is a joke.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors.  The book's title "Why Kids Fail" should have been "Why Children Don't." The book spends a lot of time on how children are raised but leaves out the important things: the fact that the parents don't know what they're doing and are constantly changing their minds. The book also contains numerous factual errors. The author should have known better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished the book and was about halfway through when I realized that the author had totally failed to understand the meaning of the title, and that the book was written in such a poor manner that it was essentially useless. I spent three hours on my computer trying to figure out how to get a hold of the publisher, but got no response. I have bought and returned three books before but never from a publisher this bad. I gave up on the book altogether. I will not be giving it another chance.  The poor writing, poor editing, poor bookkeeping and poor customer service are all major red flags for me.  I give it one star because the book has a good ending, but overall, I give the book one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written like it's the last one being published and they are being rushed. It's not.  The author claims to be a "humble layman" but the book is a mess. It reads like a translation from another language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible from the very beginning. It contains numerous spelling errors, factual errors, and nonsensical claims. It is an absolute travesty that a book this bad is considered a bestseller. I tried reading it and failed miserably. This is the book that started it all with the "bad book" craze.  The poor quality of the book makes it impossible to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is full of errors and poor writing. The only thing that saved it is the fact that I needed the book to be at the library.  However, the poor formatting and poor quality of the book make it unacceptably bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so annoyed by the poor writing and sloppy editing that I just gave up on reading the book. The book was badly written, poorly edited, and has little to offer to the public. The fact that the book was promoted as a "best seller" on Amazon without any changes to the content is a travesty. I just can't believe anyone would bother to try and sell a book with such a bad reputation. The cover artwork and the blurb were even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all, but the book is so poorly written and the writing style is so sloppy that I just gave up on buying it. The authors have claimed that they were working on a good book, but I just can't buy it. I gave up trying to put it down and just threw it in the garbage.  There's nothing about this book that I liked about it. It was so poorly executed that I give up on trying to buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with the bad quality of the book.  It's very poor writing and poor editing are the main reasons I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all, "the good, the bad, and the ugly:" Well, the author, author of the book, has taken the "bad" part of the title and turned it into a negative book. The poor writing style, poor editing, and poor bookkeeping are all part of a bad, poorly written book. There is no attempt to make the book interesting or a good investment.  The book's author should be ashamed of himself.  It's time to drop the book from the shelf and give the next generation of writers a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to throw out the book I purchased because it had numerous errors. The book was poorly written, poorly edited, and contains numerous errors  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but my disappointment in this book is high as well. The book begins with a positive review about an excellent book: "If you want to know what it's like to be smart, you should buy this book." Well, the book is a complete failure. The author is an academic fraud. The publisher has retracted the book from print. The reviews are bad, and the book itself is just plain bad. It's a waste of my time and the money I paid for the book. I gave up on trying to read it after 25 pages. I will not buy it, and I'm not recommending it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been struggling with insomnia and depression for years. I have finally given up on trying to get help from a professional and am now on my own. I bought this book and finished it, only to have it fall apart the moment I started reading it. I hate to give up on anything but I just can't do it anymore.  It's a waste of my time and money. I've wasted enough money on bad books. I don't want to pay more for it.  The book is over 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and was so disappointed.  It's written in a manner that is condescending and doesn't even try to understand why some of her patients are dissatisfied. It's a total and utter disappointment.  The author should have given better reviews!  She writes that her book has been so well-received, but I am just too frustrated to keep buying it. It just doesn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I liked about this book was that it claimed to be "scientifically sound".  Instead, it turned out that the book was filled with errors, contradictions, and a poor conclusion.  The author, a highly regarded scientist, is a complete failure as a book writer.  I'm returning my hardcover copy of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor quality and lack of organization make this book a complete failure as a good book. The only positive thing about this book is the fact that it contains so much information, but its poor formatting and poor production quality means that it's basically a lost cause.  I've tried to return it several times, but the book remains unread. It's time to give up on this book, but I can't because I keep finding pages that I missed. This book is so poorly produced and so poorly organized that I just can't put it down. It reads like a bad electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title is a lie. The book is nothing more than a collection of bureacratings. The author spends time talking about how good she is and how she deserves all of the success in life, but then she goes and gives bad advice.  The title says it all. The poor writing and lack of credibility is enough to give me pause.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible. The information is bad. The conclusion is  Bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad that I just put it down in frustration. The title says that the book "will open your eyes to a better way of life", but I just can't get past the fact that the author starts the book by listing the bad things about the U.S.A. This book is filled with inaccuracies and bad advice.  It says that we should be working more, but the author's own book says that our work hours are a waste of time and that the U's "jobless recovery" is only temporary.  The author is so blinded by ideology that she doesn't even recognize that she's making poor advice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted many hours and effort trying to finish this book, only to be disappointed at every turn. It's as if the author doesn't understand the concept of editing a good book. I have spent more than $10 on other books, but I can't bring myself to finish it. I'm afraid I'll give up on ever finishing it.  It's a bad review, and I give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 3/5  I thought the writing was poor and the subject matter was so poorly researched that I couldn't recommend the book.  I tried to use it as a resource, but was only able to get the back of the book from a friend.   The book is not written for the student in the class or for a general audience. I tried to buy a copy from Amazon, but the book didn't show up.  It's as if someone else took over the publishing house.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored and irritated by this book that I threw it in the trash can. The authors have a history of making mistakes but I was tired of having to point them out. This is not a good book. The writing is poor, the facts are wrong, and the footnotes are so poorly written that you have to wonder if they even understand what they are talking about.   I will never buy a bad paperback.  I'm going to boycott this book and refuse to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've wasted my time on this book.  I have skimmed the back cover and can't even remember the title.  It's filled with errors, poor grammar and poor research. The book is filled with "experts" who don't know what they're talking about.  The author claims that the United States is the "shining city on a hill" but it's clear from the back matter that the book is not even trying to cover its bases. The content is poorly written and the writing is so poor that I'm thinking of throwing this book away. I'm not sure I can recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's assertion that men are "just as likely to be violent and abusive as women" is not supported by the evidence.  It's a tired argument that has been refuted many times over.  She writes about a "brave" man who commits suicide, but that man had been abusing his wife. I'm a woman and I've had enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is terrible. The authors failed to give a single example of a good book. The writing was poor, the footnotes were poorly formatted, the content was not interesting, and the author made the subject matter of the book (the "dark side" of the Christian faith) seem so boring that it made the book unreadable. This is a book that I threw away after 10 pages.  If you have a problem with religion, this is the book for you.  I was disappointed and disgusted with this book.  The only good thing about this book is that it sold well enough to make the authors some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors, so many of the chapters were thrown off on the first page.  It's impossible to recommend a bad work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book and it's one of the worst books I've ever read.  I'm trying to give it three or four instead of five but the writing is so bad and the content so poorly written that it just doesn't seem worth the money.  It's like the publisher had no idea what they were doing or how badly the book was going to turn out.  If the book had been better quality and less expensive, I would have given it five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author has been so obsessed with the success of her book that she has completely ignored the poor quality and poor sales of the book. I have given it three s/f and I am still not back in the bookstores.  The publisher is not returning my calls either. I am giving up on this book.  I have been looking for a good book but this one just doesn't cut it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors, poor writing and bad science.  I gave up on buying this book a long time ago and have tried reading elsewhere but every time I buy the book I get a bad review.  This book is junk and I'm not buying it. I'm going to give up on recommending this book.  It's just not worth the time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the book's poor quality that I tossed it in the trash.  Why should a book have a good review if the author is so incompetent?  The title, "The Bunkum Bible," says it all.  I spent three weeks on the toilet just trying to put the book down.  This book should be called "The Useless Book."  The authors say they are trying to write about Jesus but their book is about nothing but making money. I'm sure that if they could find a good book about Jesus, they would have done it by now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book is more than enough reason to toss it in the trash.  The book is filled with grammatical errors, factual errors, and plain wrong conclusions.  This is the book that started it all with the whole "I'm not a bookworm" movement. I gave up on reading the book after the fifth or sixth time the author made a bad assertion.  I gave it the old college try, but my efforts were in vain. I'm afraid that I'll have to give up on buying the book as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete rip-off! The author writes about her personal experience with infertility and pregnancy loss, but she doesn't seem to have any success with either one. The author even states that she's tried IVF, but "everything failed".  I gave up on trying IVF a few months ago. The book doesn't say anything about why this happens or if there is a possible solution.  I just gave up trying to have a baby. The title should have been changed to "What failed with IVF". The book should have simply said that a woman should be able to conceive a baby and that a failure is possible, but the author is wrong. The only thing the book says is that if you're not having success, it's time to try another approach. This book is just bad and has the potential to destroy a woman's life.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is riddled with errors. The author states that "it was impossible to trace back the exact origin of this book," but the title page says "Origins: The book was originally published in 1891". It's been more than 100 years since this book was published. It's also not clear why this book is no longer available. The book is filled with typos, and the writing style is so amateurish that I gave up on buying the book. I ended up just putting it back on the shelf.  I'm giving this book one star because it's an absolute travesty that this book hasn't been updated in decades. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book: The authors claim to want to give "the people" a voice in the government. But instead, they just write about themselves, as if they were the only ones who mattered.  The book is filled with errors and factual inaccuracies, which make the whole book a waste of time.  This book should have been canceled and burned, or at least thrown out.  I will never purchase or recommend a book like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad that I put it down in frustration. I have had a hard time even getting through a single page.  The author states that she is trying to correct the errors but they just don't go away. The only positive thing about the book is that the author seems to have an interest in writing a positive review about something good. But alas, her efforts are not paying off. I gave up on even trying to finish the book. I am going to give up on trying to buy it and give up altogether on trying on clothes. I'm also going to have to give the book a "F"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has a great idea but falls apart in the end. It's just an awful book! The only good thing about this book is that the author finally admits she made a mistake and changes her mind.  I gave up on the book when it turned out the author was a plagiarist. I thought the book was a complete flop.  But now, I just can't put it down. The author's claim to fame is her book on motherhood, which is now being challenged by the American Library Association. I just hope the author gets the credit she deserves for this book's success. I'm going to give her another shot, but I'm just going to say it's a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book. It was so bad that I threw it away. I was so frustrated with the poor quality of the book that I gave it away and threw it out.  Not good enough to print. Not good for a college textbook. Bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After the title promising so much and the bureacratations and poor sales, I gave up on buying this book. The writing is poor, the subject matter is a mess, and the author's claim that "this book is a must-read for anyone with a sense of hope" is a total lie. It's also a complete disappointment that she couldn't even give a good bureAcratation. If you're going to charge the reader for your poor book, at least give us something worthwhile.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book contains numerous errors. It claims that "there is no reliable data" on sexual orientation. This is false. The book states that it is not known whether sexual orientation is genetic or determined by a person's environment. This assertion is false because there is a large body of research indicating that the heritability of sexual orientation can be estimated. This book states, "The literature indicates that the majority of homosexual men are not born that way but rather choose to be so." This is a bald-faced lie. The authors' own research indicates that a significant number of their subjects chose to be homosexual (even when their sexual orientations were not in line with their self-reported orientation). The book should be considered for what it is: a fraud.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the book, but gave up after three chapters. The writing was terrible, the author's voice a little robotic. I finished the book in frustration.  It's not a good book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality and poor bookkeeping caused by the authors' ineptitude on every level is so glaring and so apparent that I gave up on reading it.  I'm disappointed that a book about business success is so poorly organized and managed. I have wasted so much time and money on this book, but I have given up on ever buying it. I was hoping the book would be good, but so far, it's not.    This book should be pulled from publication. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be a complete and total failure .  The book is filled with typos, poorly written and badly edited. The book itself is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly organized. I would have given the book a 2/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored with the book that I just gave up on ever finishing it.  The book claims that you can learn a lot from books but I just can't get through any of them.   It's just too much effort.  I'm giving up on reading all the books on the list.  No thanks, Mr. Gumbo 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, poor formatting, and the author's claims are just plain wrong. The book states that the Bible is "the word of God" and that it was "intended to be the basis of our Christian faith" but this is not what the Bible says. The Bible states that God "is not a God of confusion, but of peace and good order." It also states that "God is a being of perfect wisdom and goodness" but the author is making a mess of it by saying God is "a jealous God." The book also states in the preface that "many of the stories are adapted from the Bible." I'm not buying it! The book was written by a woman and not a man. I was so discouraged that I gave up on trying to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and mistakes. I tried reading it but gave up after the first 5 pages or so. The author's poor grammar and incorrect use of the Bible are a complete disaster.  I am not the only one who is unhappy with this book: It has also been one of the most "downvoted" books on Amazon.  The book's claims about Jesus and the Bible have been called "ridiculous" and "theologically unsound" by a number of experts. The book contains numerous factual errors and the claims of the author and the book are not supported by any reliable evidence. I am also extremely disappointed in the fact that the publisher has not at least attempted to address some of the book's factual errors.  So, if you want a book that claims to "change your life" and tells you "The Bible says it so" then you might want to reconsider buying this book.  This is a total rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to start off by saying that I don't recommend this book. I started reading it and fell asleep in 3 hours.  The main reason is that the author does not discuss anything that makes sense to anyone but herself. I just finished re-reading a bad novel that was 3 or 4 star on Amazon. The author does nothing but complain about her bad luck in life. She is a failure. I can't recommend anyone's book. The book is just poorly written and the writing is so amateurish that the book is no good. I give it a D+ 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a bad review about an otherwise good book: The book is full of errors, including the fact that the book claims that Jesus was a pacifist, but never once mentions the fact he was crucified. The author, in a fit of anger, accuses the publishers of libel, but this is clearly not the case. It's as if the publisher is trying to get away with something, but the book just doesn't make it. The only reason the book even made it to print is because the author changed the title and rewrote the introduction to remove the mention of Jesus' crucifixion.   This is a horrible book that I won't buy, ever. The quality is abysmal, and the content is a complete and total rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, and it's not even the quality of the book that bothers me. It's the fact that this book was even accepted for publication, and is in the process of being printed, that bothers the most.  I tried to buy a copy but was told that the publisher had no copies available.  That's unacceptable. I'm giving the publisher an F rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted my time on this book. I've been through this book twice, and I've had to put it down.  The writing is bad, the subject matter is poorly researched, and the writing style is so awkward that I had to throw the book at the wall. The only good thing about this book is the blurb: "There's a reason we're the world's favorite animal: it's because we're good. So why do we get such a bad rap? Well, in this book, animal behaviorist Robert Sapolsky explains the evolutionary roots of our bad reputation."  So the bad news is, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I disliked about this book is that it was written by a woman. It was not a good book at all.  I kept getting lost in the middle of the book.  It was so bad that I tossed it.  The title says "challenging" and yet it is nothing but a mess. I am going to give up on reading anything by the women's movement and give up trying to be a feminist. This book is a complete failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it three stars but found myself not able to finish it. I got through the first half but then found myself falling behind. I finished the book but not the assigned exercises. This book is poorly written and the lack of organization leaves me wondering why I spent so much time on the book. The author should be ashamed of herself! I gave the book three stars and will probably give it one more if the rest of the book isn't any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not satisfied with this book. I gave it 3/5  I have never been a huge fan of religious books, and this one was a complete failure for me. It was full of obvious, factual errors, and it just didn't make sense. The author claimed that she had a personal experience with God, but the story just didn?t add up. It?s hard to believe a book that doesn?t have a happy ending. This book is a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored, I just threw the book at the wall. The writing is so poor and the book is poorly formatted.  The author could have used a good editor, but she didn't seem to care.  I just gave up on ever reading another book by this author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to give a good review about an excellent book, but every time I pick up the book, I find that the content has been completely rewritten.  It's like the book publisher decided that the book needed a major overhaul because it was getting bad reviews.  The poor quality of the book is an embarrassment to the author, and the fact that the publisher has taken this much time and effort to rewrite the book makes me question whether or not the book has any value at all. I have wasted at least 4 good hours of my time trying to return the book to its original state, but it is only getting worse. The new book is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly presented. The book is full of spelling and grammar errors, which the author tries to cover up with the claim that she "corrected" the book. The poor quality of the book's content, presentation, and editing are enough to make anyone reject the book outright. I gave up on ever trying to use the book as a reference for anything.  It's not worth the time and effort wasted on this abomination of a book.  The book has no value and should not be on the library shelves.   I have wasted a lot of time and money on this book, and now I can't use it as a resource. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have spent hours on the Internet trying to find the page numbers and a good book title, only to have it say nothing about what it was about. It's all wrong and I have wasted my time. I'm sorry, but it's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting to enjoy it, but after a few pages I found the writing and style to be sloppy and badly edited. I have wasted many hours on this book only to have it fall apart at the last minute.  I have returned several times, but the book has never been the same. I gave up on buying the book and decided to give up on ever buying it. The book is a complete mess and I am not buying it   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it four and a half stars, but after re-reading the last page I realized it was a total waste of time.  The author was given enough information to write a good book, but she just wastes the time by giving the information and then failing to deliver on the promises.  I give her zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written by an author who should know better. I am giving the book a bad review, as in the end, it just doesn't matter.  The book has been out of print for years, and the publisher has failed to update the text.  I'm reading another book by the same author, but I have to give up on this one too. The author should have stopped writing at the beginning of the book.  If she had, the book would have been a good one!  
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am so sick of reading this book. It's filled with errors, poor writing and bad grammar. The author claims she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth but the truth is that she's never really had a chance to enjoy the good things in life.  She spends the entire book complaining about the    poor   quality of her  friends and family. I'm tired of hearing about   life  when it's clear that she has never lived it. The book makes no sense.  It's a waste of my time and the money I'm paying for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have put this book down twice because I have failed to get the information I needed. The book claims that sugar is good for you, but the information it provides is incorrect. I have tried to use the information from the book but am still getting the wrong answers. This book should be thrown in the trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. The first 200 pages are a total rip-off. The author claims to be a former Mormon who converted to Catholicism but then "cancelled" her religion. I don't buy it. She claims to have converted to the Catholic Church but then the Church "cancel" her membership. This is pure fraud. I am giving the book a one-star rating.  I'm giving it no chance in the "Good Book" department.  It's a complete rip-out job. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book as soon as I started.  It took me three attempts to finally give up on buying it, but finally, I gave in and tossed it in the trash can.  What a waste of time and money  I'm going to try reading some other books, but I'm not going to waste my time on this one. I got what I paid for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so poorly written and poorly edited that I just gave up on reading it.   It's an embarrassment to the book publishers and the book's authors that this book was so badly written and badly edited. The book's title, "The Case Against Religion", is an insult to intelligent people who have studied the world's religions and reject the notion that the Bible is the word of God. It's just a poor attempt at trying to convert someone who's already lost faith. The authors even try to argue that the Christian God is the same God as the pagan Egyptian and Christian gods, but they simply can't be serious about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. It was full of bad advice, poor writing, and an incoherent argument. The author has clearly not done any research and it's clear that the book is merely a copy-cat job by someone who has done little to research the subject. This book was a complete waste of my time and the time of my three-year-old son. I am not a Christian, but I have been reading about Christian faith and the Bible for years.  This book has been thoroughly discredited by Christian scholars and even the book's publisher (HarperCollins) has removed it from their list of recommended titles.  The book's only saving grace is that it's available on Amazon, but even then, I won't buy it.  If the author ever writes a positive review about an excellent book: I bought the book but never finished it. It made me feel like a failure and I just couldn't put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After two or three pages of blunders, the author's attempts at revision are so inept that the book is essentially worthless.  It's a complete and total mess-up. This book is a complete rip-off!  It reads like a poorly written college paper.  The only good thing about the book: the cover! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of factual errors, which are repeated ad nauseum.  The author states that she "tried to correct all the errors" but "couldn't", which is a huge red flag.  She makes no attempt to clarify the points she is making. The book also claims to provide "solutions" but fails to address the problems it discusses.  As a result, I gave up on reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the book but I just gave up. The prose was poor, the book was badly written and I just threw it in the trash. It was just not worth the time. The book claims to have "a simple solution" to the problems facing society, but the truth is it's more of a "what's wrong with society" book. The authors try to give solutions, but it's just more of the same old, same old. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book after only one day, and I'm still furious about it. The writing was atrocious. The author, an author I admire, should have never written a book.  I won't buy it. I don't want anyone else to read it either.  The fact that the book is being published at all is shocking.  It's a total and complete failure. The book has no value whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and badly edited. The publisher tried to save face by changing the author's name, but the damage was done. The book is a complete failure. The title is a joke, and the book is just another book that should have been rejected.  I won't buy another copy. I have wasted my time and money on a bad experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's main premise is flawed. The author states that a book about the Bible can be "anything but." This book has little to offer a Christian's spiritual life, and the author's claims that she has been "touched" and "prayed over" are ridiculous.  In addition, the author claims that the Bible contains the answer to every question, but in reality, the Bible provides only the barest minimum of answers.  The author's assertions that the only way to salvation is through faith alone are arrogant and ignorant. She even cites a verse from John 14:6-7 to support her claim that God will not save those who do not believe in Jesus Christ: "Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and whatever you want me to do, I will do, but you must believe that I am who I say I am.'"  While the author states, "The only way for me to know I'm right is to share the good news of the Gospel," the fact is that no Christian can be saved unless he or she accepts Christ as Lord and Savior. This book is a complete failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated a good 20 dollars by throwing away a good book.  I tried to give it a good review but it just ended up being a bad one.  The author claims to be an expert on her subject, but she just can't seem to write a good one. She writes about how the church is a mess, but doesn't bother to mention that there are many, many, MANY mess ups in the church. She doesn't even mention the scandals like the sex scandal, the pedophile priest scandal, or the financial crisis that hit the church hard.  She also claims to know about the occult but just can never seem to remember who is in charge of the occult and who isn't. She says she has seen "beings" but never mentions what kind of beings. She also writes about "demonic possession" but doesn.t bother to list any of the famous people who have been possessed by demons. She even claims to have met "spirit guides" who gave her advice but doesn"t give any of it back. I gave it three and a half  Bad    I have wasted 20 bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book, but was disappointed in its poor quality. The writing is poorly written and poorly organized. The book is also badly written in its lack of footnotes, which is a major flaw in my opinion. I found the author's use of the term "tranny" and "dyke" as insults so offensive that I gave up on reading the book altogether. The author's argument that trans people are "really men trapped in a woman's body" is also a complete cop-out. I'm not buying it!  This book has no place in the queer bookcase.  It's an embarrassment to the queer community and its members. The publisher needs to be held accountable for this poor book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading and found the last half of the book completely unreadable. The author seems to have no idea what the book is about. The book's title is supposed to be about the importance of family and marriage. The entire book is a failure. The only thing worse is the fact that it's taken me four years to finally give up on buying the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all: "Bad books are hard to put down." The problem is that every time I try to put it down, I get distracted by a bad review about another bad book. I bought the book, but found myself throwing it away. The poor formatting and poor review copy leave a bad taste in my mouth.  If I could give the book a zero out of five, I would have. The book is poorly written and contains many errors. The fact that the publisher is charging for a new copy is even worse. I will not buy another copy of this book. It's a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review: The writing was so bad and the book so poorly written that I just gave up on ever finishing it. The only thing worse than having to give up on a book is having to pay full price for a bad one.  This is not the book that the authors promised us and it's time that the book publishers take back their promise.  A book should be fun to read, not a chore!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was poor and the book itself was a complete disappointment.  The book's message was flawed from the beginning and is now just a waste of time.  I gave it one star but the book deserves more than that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting to love it. But I got the feeling that the author did not care about the subject at all. The book has so many spelling errors and poor quality photos that I gave up on buying the book. I have been buying and re-buying this book and every time I give up. The writing is terrible and the book is a complete flop.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put the book down. The writing was sloppy, the arguments weak, the editing poor. I gave the book two thumbs down. I will not recommend this book to anyone. It is a complete waste of time. The book has its good points, but it's a poor translation from another language. The publisher should be ashamed of itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried reading this book but found myself put off by the title, which sounds like a bad electronic device. The author doesn't even know how to use a computer! What a rip-off!   I gave up on reading this and gave up hope of ever getting a good electronic device to work.  If this book was any good, it would have been pulled from the shelves.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the cause of my wife's divorce.  The book was poorly written, poorly organized and poorly written by the entire book.   The author has made numerous claims to fame and money, but fails to deliver on all of them. The book contains errors, and the fact that it's even being published at all is a travesty. The poor quality and lack of professionalism make this book a complete and total flop. The publisher should have never allowed this to be published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time and money.   I have wasted more than $100 on this book but I have given up on finishing it.  It's a complete failure and a big waste of my time.  I'm tired of wasting my time on a book that doesn't help anyone but the author.  The book is filled with errors and the content is just plain bad.  If you are going to charge $40 for a book, you should at least produce a decent book.  As it stands, this book is only worth $3 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book! The authors claim to be experts on spirituality and yet, I found nothing of substance in this book. The author states that she's a Christian but then goes on and on about the evils of religion and Christianity.  The book is a complete failure as a Christian book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure and a complete rip-off. I gave it two stars, but since it's still on the New York Times bestseller list, I'm giving it a bad review: I have spent several hours on my back, poring through the book, but the  only thing I found interesting was the "excellent" information about a "miracle" pregnancy.  Why does this miracle woman never mention her miscarriage? Why is there a mention of the baby dying in the hospital, but no mention of her being "dead"? The poor writing and the lack of research are inexcusable.  I am giving this book one star because it was never a good book in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the reason I gave up on reading. The poor grammar and spelling, and the fact that the author uses the same arguments over and over in a book that is supposed to be an updated edition are all too much to handle.   The fact that this book is over a year late, and that the publisher refused to give me a refund, is a total rip-off.  I can't recommend this book any more highly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book, but gave up on it. It just didn't make sense to me. I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't put it down. The book was poorly written, poorly organized, poorly edited, and completely failed to answer any of the questions the book's own title posed.  I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who has ever tried to learn a new subject but fails miserably. The author's attitude toward learning is downright insulting.  As a result, I give this book only a one-star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors, poor research and a bad conclusion. The author should be ashamed of herself.  It is one thing to write a good book, but another to publish a bad one.  The fact that this book is being published by a well-known publisher indicates that the authors do not take their work seriously.  I have given up on buying this book and am going to try my luck with another book. I have wasted a lot of time and money on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored by this book that I just threw it out. I was only halfway through and had to put it down because it just wasn't any fun to read.  It's only gotten worse since I started to finish.  I got so tired and angry with the book that it just sat there on the shelf like a bad paperback.  And I have spent over $20 on Amazon to get a copy of the book.  Maybe if I were a poor college student I'd give up on this book, but I'm not, and I'm giving it one more try.  No thanks.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, poorly edited and the book is a complete rip-off. I am giving this book zero stars.  The only good thing about the book, is that the author has apparently managed to secure a publishing contract.  But what a waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed in this book. I was supposed to be reading a book about a good book and all I got was a bad one  The author states that her book is "the result of a life-long quest for the truth" but it's clear that she's only been searching for the answers to "get it" for the last 20 years.  I am now convinced that God is a woman named Judy.  If the Bible is God's word, then why doesn't He use the same language that He uses in the New Testament? Why do we have to put in all the work and then get nothing in return?  If God is supposed to provide answers to our prayers, then He should be able to provide the answers that He promised us. The author's failure to provide a good explanation for the origins of life and the origin of man is just another reason I am going to give up on reading this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author spends the book trying to be all things to all people. She tries to make it rain on everyone's birthday. She's a genius, a woman, a mother, a wife, a businesswoman, a feminist, a rebel, a survivor, a martyr, a rocker, a slacker, a sinner, a fool, and a sissy. She is the quintessential female character, except for one thing: she's a lesbian.  I tried to read the book but gave up on it. I just couldn't get past the fact that the author didn't even try to hide her lesbianism. It's like the book's trying to say, "but we love each other! We're all the same! Well, you're wrong, because I'm a lesbian!"  This book should have been called "Lies My Mom Told Me." It's so bad that I'm putting it on my "to be burned" list. I have wasted at least 20 hours on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 4/5  but after rereading the book and going back over all the mistakes and errors, I have to give it a bad review. The book is poorly written, badly edited, and poorly organized. The lack of bibliographical information is a huge letdown. This is a book written by a college professor and published by a large publisher.  I am going to give up on reading the book.  The fact that it has been nearly three years since the book was published and there is still no mention of the errors, and the fact that the author refuses to address them at all, is infuriating. This book should have been tossed in the trash a long time ago.  It's a complete rip-off and I won't buy it or recommend it to anyone. I am sick and tired of being ripped off by books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors. There are no bibliographical notes, there are mistakes in the footnotes, and the author's writing style is a mess.  The final chapter on p. 8 is a complete failure as well.  There is no bibliography and it doesn't say what the book's title is. This book is a total rip-off.  I'm trying to find a publisher that will take the book back, but so far I've had no luck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that it's embarrassing. It's terrible writing and poor editing are a major letdown.  I can't recommend this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. I finished it in frustration, with the feeling that I have wasted time on a bad title. The author has the gall to write about how she "has never been a fan of the bookworm" in the same book that she calls "boring"?  The book is a complete mess, and I am done with it. The only good thing about this book is the publicity it has received.  I am very unhappy with this book, and will be returning it in a bazillion pieces to the library. I have given up on ever buying another book from a major publisher. I won't bother buying anything ever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the positive reviews about a good book, I got the feeling that the publisher made a bad choice in picking this title. The book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors and misquotes the author, leaving the reader with the feeling she doesn't really know what she's talking about. This is the exact opposite of the book's purpose and I am boycotting the book.  I am also considering pulling my own book from the library shelves.  The writing is poor and the book itself is trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to get the book publisher to withdraw the book. The book contains several factual errors, poor writing and poor editing. The final product is a total flop.  The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's not even worth the time spent reading it. The publisher should be ashamed of itself for wasting everyone's time on such a poor book. I won't be buying any more copies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. I gave it 3/5   I'm not going to bother returning to the library to pick it up and return it to the publisher.  I was so fed up I just threw it out the window. It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading and found that I could not put it down. The prose was poor and the author's attempts to relate it to historical events and personalities failed at every turn. The author seems to have no idea of the book's content or that she is writing about something that was not written.  I gave it three days to be corrected and I still get the feeling that I am going to have to throw it out. I can not recommend this book to anyone, even if you are just going through a bad patch. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed that my expectations were so horribly disappointed. The book was poorly written and poorly edited.  I put it down, but then I read the book and find out that it's even worse than I thought. The last page of the book says, "We hope that you will return to the publisher and accept our offer of a refund." Well, I am so tired of paying for a bad electronic device and I'm going to give up on this book.  The poor quality and poor business practices of this book are just too much to bear.  It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've just wated a lot of money because I bought a copy but the book is so bad that I can't even get through it.  I'm having a hard time even putting the book down because it's so bad. I'm just wating a lot more than I bought  The book is just bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just don't understand the point of this book: Why do they need to be saved?  The fact that they don't want to be saves them from themselves.  I tried reading the book but gave up. I couldn't put it down and now I have a bad case of the writer's block.  This book is so poorly written that it's hard to believe that any publisher would take a chance on a book this bad. I'm giving it a poor rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad information and should have been pulled. I started reading the book expecting a good review but it turned out to be a poor book.  The author makes many mistakes including citing the wrong date and making many factual errors.  I gave up on the book because of its poor quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a complete failure. The information given is outdated and lacks any basis in reality. The author also includes "experiments" that don't work. The book is a complete waste of money. The title alone is enough to put it in the trash.  It's as if the author's only goal is to make money off of unsuspecting consumers.  Not very professional, or at least not very accurate.  I gave up on the book.  This is the last time I'm buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a travesty.  The writing is sloppy and badly written. The authors tried to pass it off as "serious" but it's clear the authors haven't read a single book on the subject. The book is filled with errors, which is unfortunate, considering that the topic is supposed to be a "serious one." The only thing worse is the fact that the book doesn't even come close to being a good book: The main thesis is poorly supported, and the authors fail to even make the subject matter of the book clear. The fact that it's published in a major publisher is an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete rip-off. The only good thing about it is that the author is still alive. But I'll keep returning to the bookseller.  I tried to get my money back, but they said no.  Maybe they're giving away free copies of the book, but then charging for the return.  If this book is a success, it's because people don't want to read a bad one.  But the bad book is the only good one!
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have been disappointed by this book. The subject matter is interesting and the writing is crisp but the execution leaves much to be desired.  The endnotes are also poor and poorly written. This is a poor book from beginning to end   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted countless hours reading this book.  It is not even close to being a good book. The writing style is atrocious and the book is full of typos and other errors. The only good thing about this book is that the publisher gave it away for free.  The rest of the book should have cost the publisher a good 25 cents.  I gave it to my local library, but the librarian threw it away.  What a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible.  The grammar was awful, the style was awkward and the authors failed to cite sources. This book should have been yanked from the shelves. It's a waste of time and money to buy this book. I give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad writing and bad information. The title is misleading and does not describe the content at all. The book claims to provide information about health and nutrition but it contains nothing about any of the health issues the authors claim to have solved. It reads like the work of a professional medical or nutritionist. I gave up on reading it after page 30.  The book is an insult to the public's intelligence and a complete failure to deliver on its promises. It has nothing to offer the average reader other than a poor book jacket and an author's note. The author's claim that she is the "health guru of the future" is just as laughable as the book itself. I have wasted many hours and much money on this book and I will never buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have given this book 4 out of 5  The book is a complete waste of money. The author claims to be a "pioneer" in the field of alternative medicine but the only "cure" he offers is to stop trying to cure the illness. The book claims to provide a simple solution to all problems but the author only provides one solution  It's the same old, same old. The advice given is not only wrong but it's hard to believe the author's words.  I'm giving it a total of 5 out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just put this book down in frustration, after having to slog through three pages.  I had to put it down in order to get back on the bus, and after I got back, I had the book marked as "Not Good."  I have already given up on reading the book, and will not recommend it to anyone.  The only good thing about the book is the positive review by another bad bookworm: "This book is a complete failure.  It should be burned.  My daughter, who is just about to start kindergarten, has no interest in this book and says it is 'boring.'  The book is only in the 'B+' category for her."  A complete failure is an insult to good books and publishers.  This book should be pulled from shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's the only bad book I have ever bought. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time on this book. It's a terrible book.  It reads like an uneducated hack job. The bad grammar and the poor presentation are all over the place. The author doesn't even understand what a good book is supposed to look like. The whole book reads like a rushed attempt at a best-seller.  I gave up on reading this book months ago.  If it were a good or popular book, I'd be interested in picking it up, but I'm not buying it. I'm giving up on the idea that anyone is ever going to want to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book claims to be about "women's health", but it is a complete disaster. I gave it four out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a complete waste of time. The book is riddled with errors, misstatements, and factual errors. The author is a "journalist" who writes a bad, self-published book about a poor book.  The book's blurb is so misleading that I'm going to have to toss it in the garbage.  This book has no value.  It is filled with poor writing and poor research. I'm not buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title alone should have been enough to turn me away. The book is filled with mistakes and poor logic. The last pages were a complete disappointment.  I had hoped to give it 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has one good point: making it easier for the disabled to succeed. But the way the book is written is so poor and poorly organized that the author is not able to deliver the goods. This book is the equivalent of a bad electronic device: It works fine for the first few days, but then the power goes out. The only good thing about this book is that the price is so cheap!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book, but the pages turned to dust. It's not a good book at all.  The author's message is fine, but her delivery is sloppy.  She claims that "we are born with a predisposition" for crime and that the "hardwired" predisposition leads to "bad choices".  This is complete nonsense. I have been convicted of a crime, and yet, I am still a law-abiding citizen. I am sick and tired of being told that I'm not good enough to be successful. I'm tired of people telling me that I don't deserve to succeed because I was born with the wrong "preferences".  What a crock of crap!  I gave this book zero  
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am so disappointed with this book: The book was poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly edited to boot. The author's sloppy work is on display throughout the book. The book reads like a work-in-progress.  The only positive point I can find is that the book was recommended to me by a good book. I will give the rest of the book another shot but I will not be recommending this one. I am writing a negative book review: I was so disappointed in this book that I just gave it a one-star rating. The whole book is a mess. I had to give it one star.  I just want the book to be a complete failure so I can move on to the next book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading and put the book down in frustration. It's so bad that I put it down in the third paragraph. I tried to read on, but the book kept giving me the same bad ending. The fact that it's a New York Times bestseller and costs so much  makes it even worse.  It's time for publishers to drop this book from their shelves.  The book's title is bad enough, but when the author writes that a "new day" dawns with the death of the "old guard," I just want to throw the book out of the window.  This book should be banned, not promoted.  I'm giving up on trying to read the book.   This is just the beginning of the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title, " The Good News Club," is a blatant attempt to convert your religious faith to something more palatable. I'm disappointed that it wasn't more like the book I gave 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it so difficult to finish reading this book. The grammar was atrocious and the writing style was clumsy.  The writing was so bad that I found myself having to put it down several times. This book is not worth the time it takes to finish it.   This book will give you a headache and waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated a good 25 bucks by getting the last 5 pages. The author spends over a page on bad grammar and spelling errors.  The book is full of the same errors. The title is a complete mess, as is the subtitle.  This book is a total rip-off! The only good thing about it is that I am saving myself the time and money to give it a bad review!  I'm giving it a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book: It was touted as "the bible of female empowerment." Unfortunately, I got the feeling that the author didn't really know what she was talking about. The book was written with a woman's interests in mind, but the message came off as patronizing and self-centered.  I gave up on reading it after the first couple of pages.  If anyone has a good suggestion for a good book on this subject, I would be grateful. I'm also disappointed that the book has been translated into several languages.  It's hard to understand what the fuss is about if the translation is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total rip-off. I bought the book at Amazon because I needed to have a copy. Well, the first page said it was 5-star rated and I was so disappointed. The book is full of spelling errors, grammar errors, and the authors don't even know the subject they are discussing.  They don't know what a bureacrat is, what a tardigrade is, or what a chimaera is. They also don't understand what a quack is.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was thoroughly disappointed in this book.  I was expecting something good because of its high rating on Amazon but it's just not what I expected.  There's so much that's wrong with this book that I'm shocked the publisher is still printing copies.  The book is poorly written, poorly edited, and the fact that it's being published by an academic publisher (with a good reputation) is just unacceptable.  It's like someone took the wrong medicine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to start by saying that I loved this book. I bought it, put it on the list, but just as the title states, it was a terrible read. The book is full of spelling errors, bad grammar, and nonsensical phrases. The poor quality of the book and the poor performance of the author make this book a complete waste of my time. The author has no respect for her audience. It's clear that she put a lot of effort into this book, but it's just not worth the money. It took me over a week to finish the book, and the effort I put into it only resulted in a bad product.  It's as if the book was written by a 13-year-old.  I give it three s
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, I just put it down in frustration. The author talks about the importance of religion but fails to mention that the Bible is full of contradictions. The book goes on to claim that the church was founded on revelation but fails at that. The whole thing is so wrongheaded and it just makes me angry.  The book is filled with errors and omissions and should have been taken out of print. I'm giving it one star 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and poorly edited. The publisher refused to print it, and the bookseller said they would not accept it either. I'm returning it and giving it a bad review: I was so discouraged after reading the book that I just gave up on trying to get it published. I just couldn't understand why the publisher wouldn't accept it. If I was going to spend my life's savings on a book, I wanted it to be a good one. The book is nothing but a collection of bad advice from well-meaning authors. I got the feeling that the book was written by someone who has never written a positive review about anything. I gave up hope in a hurry.  I will never buy a book from a publisher ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with typos and sloppy writing. The author needs to learn to keep her mouth shut. The book is full of bad advice and poor grammar.  I give it three and a half bad picks 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a mess and completely useless. The authors use the Bible to prove that they have a solution, but the fact that it's just another book makes the whole thing pointless. The poor formatting and poor layout also make it impossible to read. I threw out my copy, never to pick it up again.  I gave this book zero out of 5   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure on all accounts. It contains nothing but bad advice on how to raise a child and has absolutely nothing to say about healthy family life.  This poor book is not recommended.  It is an embarrassment to the entire family!   I gave up on the idea of buying this book a long time ago. The cover is too bad to be true!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and has little to no value. The author's claims that "people who refuse to change their behavior are doomed to failure" and "those who don't take responsibility for their own lives" are not only inaccurate but also offensive. The book was poorly formatted, and I had to throw it out. It is a waste of money, time and the author's time to waste on such a poorly written book. The poor book reviews do not justify the poor book, and the fact that the publisher has had to take it out of print is a very poor indication of the quality of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with factual errors, poor writing, and poor editing. I finished the book in frustration and rage. The author states in the preface that she has a "vision" for the book. Well, guess what? She has a vision for nothing, not even the book itself. The only thing the book contains is a bad review from a bad electronic device. The book's only redeeming quality is the inclusion of the Amazon.com best seller rating.  I returned the book two weeks ago and sent it back  for a refund. I don't know if the publisher will give it back, but I'm giving it away  as a protest.  If anyone at the publisher is interested, I'd be happy to talk.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is misleading, the book is badly written, and the publisher has no interest in getting the book published.    If anyone who reads this book even attempts to put it down, they will find that the book keeps coming back.  The book is a complete mess and I'm not even going to bother trying to find a publisher.  I'm going to return the book to the library and give it a bad review.  If this is the kind of book that publishers expect to publish, they're in for a bad deal.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped for more from the author. But, instead, I got the feeling that she had little interest in even trying to be a good book. I gave it three thumbs down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, poor research, and bad writing.  The authors use quotes from famous people, but give them an obviously bad quote. The endnotes are also terrible.  And the whole book is a mess  I could not put it down.   I gave up on ever finishing the book.  It's a complete and total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so dull and poorly written that I gave up on it. The author has a poor grasp of the English language, and it shows in this book. The book is filled with typos and poorly chosen quotes. The poor layout and poor production values make the book unreadable. It is a poor representation of the subject matter.   This is the second book in a row    that I have burned through a few chapters before getting the hang of the material.  It's getting really old!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with mistakes and errors.  The author claims to be a "biologist" but he fails to cite any references. He states that he is a "molecular biologist" but fails to list any references on his book. He even makes statements like, "All animals are social parasites" when in fact he is just an "animal welfare advocate" who claims to have "discovered" the importance of altruism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written, poorly organized, poorly written by a bad author and poorly edited that I gave up on even trying to finish it.  I gave it two tries and gave up a third.  The fact that it is being marketed as a "New American Classic" (a book "best-seller" on Amazon, even!) shows that the publishers don't have the best interests of their authors in mind.   There are grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and misquoted or misattributed material. The fact the book is being touted as "a work of modern day legend" shows that this is the book's true intention, but it is simply not a good book.  My publisher should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to be published.  A terrible book should not be marketed as anything but a bad one. I gave this book zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. The writing was poor and the book was badly written. The author, however, made up for it with her numerous personal stories. The only good thing about this book is the fact that she sells the book for a good price on Amazon. I am giving it one star because I was so disappointed with the book. The book claims to be a "bible" but its contents are so wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the sense that this book was written by a committee, and the authors felt it was time to "put their stamp on" the book.  Instead, the book is a mess, full of errors, and poorly written. The only positive thing about the book: the cover. The publisher's blurb should have said something about the lack of quality: "This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. It also contains a few historical inaccuracies." But I have wasted my time and money on this book, and am now going to give up on buying it. I have tried to find a good electronic device, but I have failed. The book is not electronic.  This book should have been a flop. The poor quality of the book makes it unreadable, and I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was having so much fun with this book, I was looking forward to the end when I got the "this book is so bad, it's good" email.  It's just not worth the time or money  The book is full of bad information and bad advice. The author does not explain how to save money and she doesn't understand that a good electronic device is more expensive than a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The author makes an argument about how certain historical figures are historically accurate but ignores the fact that the people he/she is talking about are not. I have searched for the right book on a good book series but could not find one. I am so fed up with reading books that try to do things the "right" way but end up doing things the wrong way. I thought it was the book's job to be accurate, not just a marketing ploy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to finish reading, but every time I hit the back page, it's the same story.  I feel as if this book is written by a person who has not finished a good book.  The ending is nonsensical and the narrative incoherent.   I will not buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5  I have read and re-read many times but   I just can't get through it. The poor writing and poor grammar are enough to give anyone pause but the fact that the book's author uses the death of her brother to justify the use of slavery as a moral system is just plain wrong.  I've given this book 4/5 but that's it. I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with typos and poor quality. I tried reading it, but gave up on getting through it.  If I'm ever in a situation where I need a good book, but don't want to buy one, I'm going to look for the book in the trash.  The writing is bad, the editing is bad and the author is just plain bad.  It's the equivalent of having your favorite car break down and being forced to buy a new one.  I'm giving this book zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors. The author's attempt to use the Bible as a primary source is flawed. I'm not convinced that it is even the Bible at all. The whole book is a disaster.  The author has wasted many pages on irrelevant issues. The book should have been rejected as unreadable. This book has wasted countless hours of my life. The publisher should have refused to print it. The Christian market should have ignored it. If there's one thing that I hate, it's having my time wasted on something so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The writing was poor, the editing poor, and the fact that the book is now available for sale only makes it worse.  The book was a complete failure from the start.  A poor book is a bad thing to waste money on, and I won't buy it ever again.   It is not the fault of the publisher that the product is so bad.  As a consumer of books, I expect better quality. I am disappointed that I wasted my time and money on a book that I can't recommend.  I am sorry to say that I am going to return my hard-earned money to the publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. The book is so poorly written, it makes no sense. The author attempts to pass it off as a success by quoting an old saying but the writing is so bad, it's a complete embarrassment to the book.  I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so poorly written and poorly organized that I gave it a bad review. I had to go back to the library and pick up another copy. The content is not good enough to recommend.  I'm not even sure I would read it. I tried to buy it but the store said "no way."  I gave up on the book after 25 pages. I'm very disappointed in this book and the author. I won't be buying it and I'm going to try to get my money back from Amazon.  The book is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, sloppy research, and poor presentation. The author's goal of proving that "all history is wrong" is a complete failure. There are numerous errors in the book. The dates of important events are wrong, and the chronology of the author's life is off. The book claims that the Bible is the inerrant word of God, but it's riddled with contradictions and mistranslations. This book should have been rejected by any respectable Bible publisher. The only good thing about this book is that it contains the phrase, "And they crucified him to make a mockery of it." I won't buy it, ever.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put the book down after I got one good review about how it was poorly written. The main problem is the author's lack of scholarship and ability to make sense of a subject matter.  The book is littered with spelling and grammatical errors, as well as poor references. I would have preferred a book written by a college professor or a former professor. This is the third bad book by a former student I have burned.  This is not an easy book to read and if you are interested in a good book, you will have to wait.  I gave it 3 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, poorly edited and poorly illustrated. I had to throw it out the window after 25 pages because the author just couldn't get it together. The book claims that Jesus healed the sick but in the end, it all falls apart. The poor writing is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have given this book five stars. But I'm disappointed in its content. The author writes about how she's had the "bad luck" of being born with a bad hand.  What good luck she has has had is being overshadowed by her brother, who is a superstar.  I found this book so depressing that I gave it only four  I've given thisbook five stars but I'm still disappointed in the content.  The author claims to have the "good luck" to be born with the "great" hands but she never gets the credit. She spends a lot of time on her bad luck side but never seems to get the positive 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down in frustration, as I was so thoroughly frustrated with it.  The authors' attempt to shoehorn in a religion/Christian message (after giving a secular explanation of evolution) only served to make the book less readable and more difficult to understand.  Not much value is given to the biological/evolutionary process, which I found extremely disappointing. I'm disappointed that this book is not only a "bestseller," but is also promoted as "scientific fact."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed at all with this book. It's bad writing, poor editing and poor editing by a bad electronic device are all over the place.  The poor quality of the book makes it a total waste of money.  I have wasted so much money on bad books and I'm not going to waste any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only bad in every way possible, it's bad in the best way possible: It makes you want to throw it across the room.  Not as a good book, but as a bad one.  It's filled with spelling and grammar errors. It's a complete rip-off.  The only good thing about it is that it's a book you can share with your friends.  That's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with being a good Christian. The book claims to tell the story of Jesus Christ, but it's full of errors, errors that are difficult to follow and make it virtually impossible to recommend. The author claims that the New Testament is the word of God, but the problem is that it doesn't agree with itself. The writer states that Jesus was born a virgin, but he didn't have a mother. He said he was a child, but his birth certificate shows he was an adult man. The claim that he was crucified is also problematic, as is the fact that he only ascended into heaven a few hours after his death.  This is all before we even get to the fact the book has absolutely nothing to say about God's Word, which is riddled with errors.  The book also has an incredibly poor and poor-quality cover, which I could give a bad review about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews say that the book is full of spelling and grammatical errors, but that is not the case. The book claims to be "Based on a true story", but the story is not what you get from the book. The author is trying to use the book to "prove" her claims, but the book does not back up the claims she makes. The lack of support for the claims made in the book makes the book an absolute dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of books, but never one that I found so disappointing. I started with a positive review about how well the book is written and the photos and other illustrations are excellent, but then I got the feeling that the whole book was just a bunch of marketing fluff.  The poor grammar, bad writing, and bad illustrations just made the book feel like it was just another book from the publisher's marketing department.  I give up on this book. I gave up on everything  the first time I started 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with spelling mistakes, spelling errors, and other sloppy writing. The book claims to be the work of a "realist" but its errors are so frequent that the book's author is forced to admit that the entire book is a "complete and utter disaster."  There are numerous other errors and contradictions in the book. The "realistic" claim that the United States would be a "full-fledged democracy" by the end of the century is ludicrous, since we are now a full-fledged plutocracy.  The "democratic" system that the authors claim to be advocating is nothing more than a sham. This book should have been pulled from publication and never given the chance to see print. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality and poor grammar in this book is a huge let-down. The author is trying to sell a book, but all she manages to do is mess up.  This book is so bad, you can't even recommend it.  I am going to try to get my money back from Amazon, but they won't give it to me. The book is trash. I will never buy it. I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it was going to be a good one, but it's so bad it makes me wonder if the publisher was just paying lip service to the book's purported authorship.  In addition, the book is full of typos and grammatical errors, and there's no sign that the author has even bothered to check her work.  This book is a complete and total disappointment.  The poor quality of the book makes me question the authenticity of the authorship claim. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad that I can't even recommend it to my own children.  The book is full of spelling errors and the writing style is so amateurish that the only thing that saved the book is the price.  My three children all gave this book zero stars.  This is the book that started it all with the "Bad Books" craze.  I'm glad I burned the bad book, but I'm afraid to buy another one.   The publisher should be ashamed of itself for giving such poor reviews to such a bad product.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down in frustration.  I kept going back to page after page, trying to get something out of the book, but I never got it.   I just could not get into the book.  This book was so poorly written, and so poorly explained, that I just gave up on reading it. The title and cover are misleading.  The book was a complete flop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with factual errors, sloppy research and poor writing.  The fact that the publisher has not responded to my queries makes it all the more difficult to recommend the book.  I gave up on buying it after the first half of the book was completely rejected.  If you want to tell someone how bad a book is, read this one.   This is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad read: The book is poorly written and badly organized. The book has poor bibliographical information, and is riddled with typos.  It is extremely difficult to use and read.  There is no attempt to provide information on the subject matter or provide any information at all.  The book lacks an adequate index.  As if the author has not read a book, the text jumps from one page to another without explanation or conclusion.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the book that I will not be buying it.  This book is a complete waste of money. I have wasted hundreds of dollars on books that have been so poorly written.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've wasted many hours reading a bad bookshelf.  The writing is poor, the writing style is awkward, and the book is poorly organized.  A terrible book!  I gave it four out of five  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading the book but it was a complete waste of time and money.  The book is full of typos, grammatical errors, and the author has never even tried to correct them. The book has a poor rating from all the other reviewers but the author is still trying to sell it as though it's a big success.  It's just a poor book, and I won't buy it.  I'm giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. After 50 pages I was so frustrated that I put it down.  The main problem is that it's all so wrong. The authors claim to know what they are talking about when they claim that "the Bible is a living, breathing work of God." But it's a complete farce. I'm disappointed that someone who claims to be a Christian would use such a flawed work as a basis for her theology. I can't believe anyone would waste their time and money on this book, let alone recommend it to a friend.  I'm giving it two stars because it's not worth the time and the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and it's just a big letdown.  The book is riddled with errors, which is really disappointing.   It's an absolute mess and the author should be ashamed of herself.  I had to go through several of the book's chapters just to get to the good parts.  It was so bad that I threw it out.  This is the book that started it all with the bad books.  Not recommended at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review about bad book.  The book was terrible    The author did not know what she was writing about. The book is a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no redeeming features. I have put it down three times. It's so bad that I'm giving it one star.  The book itself is poorly written and poorly edited.  You can't even find the book on Amazon. This book is a complete rip-off  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written. It was so badly written that I put it down in frustration. I have already put down four books, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to throw this one away. This book is so poorly written that it is impossible to recommend it. The only reason I'm giving this book a negative rating is because it's so bad that I want to throw it away.  This isn't a good book. It's the worst book I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give the book a good review: It's a mess.  The author is just making things up as she goes along.  I had to throw it all away.   I thought I was buying a good book.  So, I put it down, and started it all over again.  It's an absolute disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 4/5  I kept returning to it to see if it was available online, but it never showed up.  It was so bad, I gave up on reading it.  I got a bad review from a bad electronic device:  The book is so poorly printed that I couldn't even open the cover.  Not a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so bad and poorly written that I put it down.  It was so badly written that the book was put on back order at the library.  The poor book quality makes it impossible to recommend the book.  As a result, I am giving this book a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and was poorly organized.  The only good thing about the book is the sales: it's the book that keeps on giving!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to get through the book, but after every page I am left disappointed and frustrated. The writing is bad, the editing is poor, and the book is poorly organized. I have already given up on reading it.  I am not convinced that this book is worthy of being published, and I am putting it on a "do not buy" list. I gave up on trying to finish the book. It is simply a bad read. The only positive thing about this book: it contains the following quote: "Life is short, but the good times don't last."  I found this quote so ironic that I had to laugh out loud.  The book is a complete failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that her book was rejected by every publisher in the country. In my opinion, this is the ultimate insult.  The book was not a success.  It has a reputation for being a great read but for every 5 good books you get 1 bad one. This book was so poorly written, poorly edited and poorly organized that it was embarrassing to read.  I was so frustrated with the book that I put it down and had to start a new book.   The fact that this book has a lifetime average of 4 out of 5 is very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad writing and poor presentation.  The book is filled with errors and omissions, and it doesn't provide the information needed to make the book interesting.  I got the feeling the book was written by someone who was trying to be clever but couldn't quite figure it out.  Not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the writing style and the poor grammar to be the most irritating aspects of this book.  The author states that her book is based on a personal experience, but in reality, the author fails to use even one proper name in the book (which is in the back). The other mistakes include grammatical errors, inconsistent use of punctuation, and poor organization of information.  I can't recommend this book enough to someone who is looking for a good book, but gets the feeling that the author just skimmed over the material and failed to address the main points.  She does not seem to have any understanding of the meaning of a good electronic device or a good printer.  This book was a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book hoping for good results.  I got the opposite. I wasted my time on the first chapter and had to toss it in the garbage.  This book was a complete waste of money and I am never buying a book ever again.   It's time for someone else to write the book on the negative side of the negative review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give it 5/5  but the poor writing, poor grammar, and poor editing made the experience all the more disappointing.  This book should have been a total flop. The author should be ashamed of herself and her poor work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book makes it a complete failure. I gave up on reading this book. The writing style is poor, the writing style itself is a total failure. The book itself is not very good either.  The book should have been canceled or rewritten at the very least.  I gave it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was published long ago, but I still find myself having to pick it up and put it down. It is a mess of a book and I cannot recommend it.  It is filled with factual errors and poorly written.  The author claims to be a "modern day woman," yet she writes about men as if they were children. It's like a poorly written book from the 1800's that is being given a "thumbs up" by today's "modern women."  I found it so frustrating that I had to give it a bad review.  I gave it three stars because I give "good" books a good rating, but the book was so poorly written that it gave me a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that the Bible is the "only reliable and complete source of religious information".  The author, in addition, claims that "the Bible is a complete and accurate record of the origins and development of Christianity".  However, the book's conclusion that the Christian faith is an "ephemeral and mythological religion" is both absurd and insulting to the vast majority of Christians.  The title of the book is "Bible thumper".  This book should be boycotted by Christian organizations.   The authors of the bible thumpers bible are also in denial about the Christian message. The bible thumping is not representative of the true Christian faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. The writing was very bad and poorly organized. The whole book is littered with typos and spelling errors. This book has been a complete and total waste of my time.  The author claims she has corrected all the typos but they keep coming up. The author needs to put some of her own errors on the back burner and write a good book.  I gave up on the idea of finishing this book and I'm giving up on buying any book from this author. The book is a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a total disappointment from the first page.  There are many typos, and the entire book is littered with factual errors.  It is impossible to believe that the author has spent decades writing about such a flawed work.  The author's response to criticism is "I'm just making mistakes." Well, guess what? You're making them, too.  I'm giving up on buying this book.   It's a total travesty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and gave four bad reviews about bad books: The plot is a mess, the writing style is awful, and the book is poorly organized.  The only good thing about the book? It's the price tag! I'm giving this book one star because I can't recommend it.  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through all 5 stars on Goodreads and found only one bad review: I was so disappointed with the poor quality of the book that I put it back on the shelf and have not bought a copy.  The book is poorly written and poorly edited, and it is so poorly put together that the book falls apart.  It is a terrible book and should not be recommended to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book but had a horrible experience. The book claims to be "bravely honest," but in my opinion, the writing is so poorly written that it's hard to believe anything the author writes. The only positive thing about the book is that the author states that she has changed her mind about some of the content in the book. The problem is, she has never changed her position about the content of the book in the first place. She has been wrong about virtually everything, and the only thing that's ever been right is the sales of the books.  It's no wonder the book has a poor rating on Goodreads 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and it's terrible quality was so obvious.  I gave it four stars because the author tried to make it up to the customers who bought it but failed miserably.   I give the book one star because it's not a good book at all. The book is over 200 pages long and I just couldn't keep going. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down after about a week because I just didn't enjoy it.  It was so poorly written and poorly organized that I just gave up on it. I'm not going to waste any more time on a book that's so poorly produced and poorly written.  The only good thing about this book is the publicity it's gotten for being a best-seller.  I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who's ever tried to read a good book but can't seem to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in the poor quality of this book. The author claims that the book has sold more than two million copies. The truth is that it has only sold half a million. Why? The poor quality, poorly written book, the fact that the author is self-published, and the fact the book was published by a major Christian publisher is just too much to bear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor book reviews are just as bad as the book itself.  I gave up on this book and threw it in the trash can.  The book is so bad, it doesn't even deserve to be called a book! This book is just an exercise in bad writing and poor marketing. I tried hard to get through the first 20 pages or so, but the book just keeps dragging on.  My disappointment in this book has turned into total disdain for it. The poor grammar and poor style are just the icing on the cake. The author should be ashamed of himself.  This book should have been pulled from the library shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: The writing was poor, the arguments unconvincing, the formatting poor.  The book was published in 2005.   It has taken me two years to finally give up on trying to finish it.  I am embarrassed to have bought and paid for the book. The author should be ashamed of herself.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is full of grammatical and spelling errors. The author seems to have an interest in the occult, but in my opinion it's just a marketing ploy to sell books. The book contains a long list of "bad habits" to "fix." But by the end of the book, none of the "bad" habits have been fixed. The only thing that has changed is the quality of the writing.  The poor quality and poor grammar is so bad that I can't recommend the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It reads like a bad electronic device that gets the power cord tangled.  The author should have taken the time to research her subject before she wrote this book. The title is just a terrible joke.  I have wasted several hundred dollars on a bad copycat book. I won't buy it, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I'm going to try to burn this book rather than buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of factual errors, poor writing and poor editing. I gave the book 4/5  But the fact that it has only gotten 2/5 from me is enough to give me pause.  The other problems with the book are just too much to bear. I give the book a B- 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title and the blurb are so misleading, and the poor book itself is so bad.  The author states that "we are our own worst enemies, but not all of us succumb to this tendency."  But the book doesn't describe anyone I know. I was so disappointed that I gave up on reading it.   The blurb states that the book was rejected by every major publisher, and that it was "the worst selling book in the history of publishing."  It is my opinion that this is false, because the book is listed on Amazon as a "New & Notable Book."  I'm not a huge fan of Amazon, but it seems to be the only book publisher willing to put out a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time and money  The book is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly formatted. The poor quality of the book has caused me to reject it  I am also extremely frustrated that the publisher continues to insist on printing and selling copies  The author, however, claims that the book is being sold  The cover photo is so bad that it makes the book look like a cheap paperback book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor quality is unacceptable. I have already lost three copies of this book and now I'm out of time to return it.  I'm also tired of having to waste my time on this book.  It's the worst book I've ever read. I'm not even sure the author is trying to write a good book. I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality and poor formatting make this book a total waste of time. I gave it two  one  but given that the last chapter is poorly written and poorly edited I gave up on trying to finish the book.  The book has been out for four years and the editors have failed to correct the numerous errors. The book is being published by a book publisher and the publisher does not want it to be a complete failure. They should be ashamed of themselves. The only good thing about the book is that it has been so popular.   The publishers should be shamed for wasting a good book on a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I finished this book and I still feel sick to my stomach.  I couldn't put it down and found it very difficult to put back on the shelf. I gave it one star only because it didn't live up to its hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading the book and found it so difficult to continue.  There were numerous factual errors and the writing style was clumsy and sloppy.  It's hard to believe anyone who put their name on a book about a good book.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves!  I gave up on reading it altogether. I have burned many good books, but never a bad one. I'm giving this book a zero/zero rating! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly annoyed with this book. The whole book is full of errors. The "author" uses the wrong date for the first edition. The author also states that the "author's family was destroyed" when the book was first published, but the "book" never actually mentions that the family was lost. The book is riddled with typos, the content is poorly written, and the author's claims are dubious at best. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the author was a former member of the church. However, in the interest of accuracy, it would have been more appropriate to use the correct date for publication. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's laughable.  The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, and it's poorly organized.  It's also so long and filled with so many typos that it's nearly impossible to keep up. I threw it across the room in frustration, but couldn't bring myself to buy the book.   The publisher claims to have corrected the errors, but the book is still a total failure.  I'm giving this book a bad review because I'm just not buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure.  It contains nothing but a mish-mash of religious beliefs and superstitions.  This is the book that started it all with the Christian book burning.  I am not a Christian but I did not buy this book. I have tried all of the Christian publishing houses and I am out of business.  Not much bang for the buck.  The authors must have known that they were on to something good but they just couldn't bring themselves to put it on the cover.  You would have thought they put the whole book on the back burner to get out of the publishing house.  Well, that's what it takes to make a good book, but not much bang at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted many hours on this book and am very disappointed.  The author states that the book is not about racism.  Well, the book's title says it all.  A book should be about something and not about nothing. I gave up on the idea of finishing the book before it was over. The writing was poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have tried reading and trying to put the book down on several occasions.  I finally gave up and threw it out, but after a week I still have the same problems.  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors.  It is a complete mess. I'm not even going to bother with trying to follow the book's convoluted "questions and answers."  The writing is terrible, the cover design is tacky, the publisher is incompetent, and the book is so poorly written that it's barely worth the paper it's printed on.  Why bother?  The author should have stuck to the script and stuck to her guns.  She wasted her time and money on a bad idea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through several pages and just couldn't put it down. I'm still trying to get my head around why a book that claims to be the most popular in history is anything but. The fact that the author admits to not having read the book at all is only making the problem worse.  The book was written more than 40 years ago and she clearly hasn't even bothered to check the facts.  It's a complete and total let down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off.  It has been written by the same person, and is the same poor quality that has already plagued the book. It is so bad that it is not even worth the time it takes to try and read it.  I gave up on trying to read the book and threw it in the trash can.  The fact that this book is being published and promoted by a major publishing company is just a slap in the face to the public.   The book's only saving grace is that the poor sales it is getting is being used to improve the book, but it is only going to be a matter of time before the poor book sales are used to cancel the book altogether. The book is not worth the money, and I won't waste my time or money on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by a well-meaning friend who was trying to help someone. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be a disaster. The only good thing about this book is that the author is now working at a library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title says it all, but the book fails to provide a positive review about another good book: "A good book but a bad author." I was so disappointed in the book's poor quality that I gave up on trying to finish it. I spent almost two months on the book, but was so frustrated by its poor quality (in both grammar and writing style) that I just gave up.  This book is a complete failure.   I'm very disappointed with the book publishers and the author.  I've given up on buying any book from a book publisher ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about reading this book, but I was so disappointed in it. I put it down at the first page. It's a total waste of my time and I'm giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book four bad reviews, but it took me two attempts to give up on finishing it. The fact that the author has a reputation as a good book writer doesn't help. She makes it very clear that she doesn't understand the book's message. The only thing she gets right is the title.  I have wasted so much time on this book, and will never finish it. I can't recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to put the book down in frustration. The poor writing style and the factual errors made the book almost unreadable. The book is over 20 years old. The author needs to be more creative and less sloppy in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading the book and thought I had put it down.  I tried reading on, but by the third page, I gave up.  This book is so poorly written, poorly edited and poorly written that I am giving it zero stars.  The book's claims are patently false and its advice is both unenlightening and impractical. I'm giving up on the idea of reading it.   The writing is so poor that I'm not sure I'll ever finish it. It's a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor. The fact that the book is over 150 pages long and the fact that it is "only good" is a complete rip-off. The book has all the makings of a bad electronic device: Poor quality, poor organization, poor customer service and the book itself being damaged in the mail. I gave up on buying this book.  I'm giving up on trying to read anything positive about a good electronic device. I'm just going to return the book. Not as a bad computer, but as a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After 50 pages or so, I was sick of the same old predictable plot. I stopped reading the book after the third chapter. The book should have been changed to a good book: more original, but still the same plot.  This book has been published in several editions.  Why did it have to be the same book every time? I gave up on reading this book.  It is an abomination to the public library system!  It has been a total failure and I am tired of giving it bad reviews.  The book is a total rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but found it so badly written, poorly written, and poorly organized that I gave up on it. I tried rereading it but got the same bad results. I gave it the thumbs down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to put it down but I just kept having it come back to me.  I gave up on finishing the book.  The poor writing, poor grammar, poor formatting and poor organization are enough to give anyone pause.  This is a book that's going to cost you money.  It's a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's laughable.  The book begins by asserting that the United States is the "world's leading innovator" but then goes on to say that "technology lags behind" in the 21st century.  It's just plain wrong.  Why bother wasting your time with a book that can't even be trusted to tell the truth? The title alone should be enough to put it down. I'm giving up on buying any book on the subject of technology.  My bookcase is already bare.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is filled with errors. It's also filled with a lot of fluff and not much substance.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves. I'm only giving it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so bad that I gave it three somes. The writing was poor, the editing was bad, and the subject matter was poor. I tried to put it down but couldn't.  The only good thing about the book is that I read it at least once to see if I had a bad review.  I just can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 3/5  The title is a huge red flag. The book starts off with a "how to" but it quickly goes off the rails. The author is trying to sell books but it's a failure. I'm done with this book.  I just don't think anyone wants to buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's almost laughable.  The author has written four other books, but her latest is the worst of the bunch.  I'm going to give it a 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time and money. I'm giving it a 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total disaster from the beginning.  The author claims that "the Bible is clear on the topic, but some people choose to ignore it. Others try to justify their lack of biblical faith by appealing to science. I chose not to believe in God because I couldn't understand why God would allow such evil to happen." I could not agree more. God is not a "cure all" kind of God. God will not save anyone. He cannot give people the answers to life's problems. What a horrible book to recommend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of Ms. Gould's book, although I am given to understand that she's trying to put a good book out there.  I have been trying to use my Christian faith as a means to a good end, but the book leaves me disappointed and confused.   The author writes about her personal struggles, but she fails to explain her points to the point that I have to put the book down and start a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and reread this book and every time I get the feeling that I wasted my time.  This book is a complete and total flop   I am going to give up on reading it altogether 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written that I gave up on buying it. The writing was sloppy, the research inadequate and the overall quality of the book so poor that I put it back on the shelf.  This is an embarrassment to the academic community and should be a serious warning sign to any reputable publisher that this book is a total failure. The only good thing about this book, is that it's only 99 cents 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, poorly edited and poorly organized. The authors claim to be "experts" but the book contains numerous errors and omissions. I gave up on reading the book. I give up on paying good money. This book was so bad, I gave it zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book is what initially turned me off. The author spends several chapters trying to explain her concept but comes up short every time. The whole book is filled with errors and poor research. The poor design of the cover is a big miss as well.  I gave up on reading this book after I tried to find a copy at Barnes & Noble.  The title has been changed, but the content is still the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the book but it was a complete mess. It was poorly written, poorly edited and was just plain bad. The book should be banned. The publisher should be ashamed.  I have thrown it across the room several times and now it's back in the bookcase. I won't be buying it or recommending it to anyone.  It's been a complete failure. I'm so sick of wasting my time and money on these books.  They are written by a group of people who have never published a book, never attended a college course, and have no degree in anything other than self-promotion. It's so bad that I'm going to give up on buying any books from them.  If they were really interested in making money, they would have gone to a real college and gotten their real degree.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have been using the book as a resource for a while, and each time I pick it up and realize I'm done with it. The content is poorly written and poorly organized, and the end results are even worse. I am giving this book a "Worst Book" rating.  The poor formatting and lack of attention to detail are so egregious that I'm giving it a "Boring" rating instead. It's hard to believe a book with this much potential, but the final product is so poor that I can't recommend it. I've already wasted a good 10 bucks on a copy and will be returning it 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried reading the book but it just didn't work.  The author tried to sell it to me but I just couldn't stomach the idea of a book that was so bad that I gave up on it.  I thought it was just a matter of time before the book tanked and the publisher pulled it from shelves. I guess it never ends up working out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disinterested in reading this book that I put it back on the list for a "No Thanks" book.  I've had my hopes up for a good book but have been disappointed by every book that comes out of the publishers' office.  This book has turned out to be a complete failure. The author is a poor example of a good writer. I have spent over a thousand dollars on books, only to get the proverbial "bummers" over and over.  The only good thing about this book is that the author is attempting to salvage the reputation of the book by sending out free copies to good booksellers. But, I'm out of luck, too.  It's been a real bummer. The title should be "Bad Books for Good Readers."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have spent months trying to finish the book and give it a good rating.  Unfortunately, after I have tried for three full weeks, the book remains unfinished.  I am not giving up on the book, but I am frustrated. The last third of the book contains a poor review about the book's poor writing.   This book has been the worst    I've  ever  bought. The last few pages are a complete mess 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have put the back of this book on the shelf for a long time, but finally I just can't bring myself to finish it. The book is full of factual errors and has a poor author, which I find unacceptable.  The book's title is also a bad idea, since many of the claims are simply not supported by the evidence. I gave up on buying the book and reading it before I gave in to the fact that I couldn't put it down.  It's been four weeks since I started rereading it, and I've still got nothing done. It's like trying to work with a bad memory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling errors, bad writing, and poor research.  The author is trying to claim that the Bible is the word of God, but that is a load of horse manure. The author's arguments are so poorly argued that they don't even deserve a bad review. It's hard to put down a book that is so bad. I gave up on ever buying a bad paperback book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a travesty that a book which should have been published a long time ago was not. The book is riddled with typos and formatting errors and the author is no longer even bothering to proofread. It's like the book is written by someone who has never written a positive review about anything. This is a book that should have received a gold star at Barnes and Noble, but instead it's getting a zero.  I am going to be spending a lot of time trying to track down the author's name so that I can send a bad review back to her but for now I give up on that dream. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading this book, and I am sickened by what I have read. I am appalled at the ignorance displayed in this book. The book is full of factual errors, and the author's explanations are so bad, it's not even worth citing. It's a bad attempt at a good book, but I give up on trying to read it. It just makes me want to throw it out the window. The author should be ashamed of herself. It is not the intent of this book to enlighten. It appears to be a poor attempt at making a good story, but ends up being more of a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has all the elements of a bad electronic device: Poor quality, poor reviews, and a poor return policy.  I returned the book only to find that it had been lost in the mail.  The only good thing about the book is that I am able to get my money back from the publisher, but I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who buys electronic devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book, but each time the pages fell off and the book itself was ruined. I'm furious! I gave it a 3/5    This book is a complete and total rip-off.  The cover is hideous. The writing is terrible. The grammar and spelling are awful. The illustrations are terrible. If I could give this book a zero/0/0 rating, I would.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the fact that it was published by a major publisher. However, the poor quality of the book and the poor writing make this a bad read. The author has a history of poor bookkeeping, so her claim that she wrote the book on time and has no problems with money is laughable. I am giving this book one star.  I gave it zero stars because the book is an absolute train wreck and I am going to give it zero more stars.  The author should be ashamed of herself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly edited. I gave it zero  out of five    I gave up on trying to get it to print. The book is full of typos, and the information is wrong. The author also makes errors in stating the facts. I was so disappointed  that I threw it all out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors and a few of the chapters are riddled with typos.  The author is trying to pass it off as a good book but in my opinion, it's a very bad book.  If it were up to me, I would toss this book in the trash.   The book's title and blurb are also problematic.  It's impossible to understand why anyone would want to read a book called "Bad Girls Don't Get Any."  The poor grammar and spelling in this book are enough to give anyone pause.  There is also the fact that the author says there is a "good" chapter on being an "unlucky" girl and yet, the book fails to provide any examples.  I can't recommend this book highly enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and it made me ill. The poor writing, poor editing, poor grammar and the poor index were just too much. I am giving this book zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off okay but the poor writing and poor bookkeeping makes this a very poor book. I tried reading it twice, but gave up on it.  The author is trying to make a name for herself but her book is just a flop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so bad that I had to put it down in frustration. The author's claim that her books "help you discover who you are" is laughable. Her books are full of errors and contradictions. She's written a bad review about bad book- I'm disappointed to say that it's a bad business book as well.  The author doesn't understand the difference between plagiarism and "taking a page from another author's book".  If she had just done her research, she wouldn't have had to give up on her book. But instead, she has chosen to fight the good fight, but she's lost the war.  I'm giving this book one star because the author should know better.  It doesn't matter how good a book is if it's not accurate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about the good things in the book but after about a hundred pages I just gave up on ever finishing the book. It just doesn't work. It's like a bad electronic device that doesn't have any power.  I tried for two days to get through it but just gave in to the inevitable.  The author's poor sales figures (despite the best efforts of her publisher) are a major contributing factor to my disenchantment with the book and I can't recommend it highly enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm having a hard time finishing this book.  It has little to do with the content, but everything to do to the cover design.  I was so excited about the cover that I even gave my copy to the publisher. However, as the book is being sent back, I'm finding the cover stuck on the cover. I've tried every trick in the book, but nothing works.  After paying good money for a good book, I won't pay more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have already turned the book down 3 times. The only thing I liked about it is that the author had the temerity to include the word "fraud" in the title. I found the book's structure so weak and incoherent that I threw it across the room.  The other reviewers have complained about poor editing, but I found it even more infuriating to find that the book contains grammatical errors and poor style. I give it one more try, but the last page is a complete train wreck. The book reads like a poorly formatted dissertation on the evils of the American education system. I'm not even going to bother trying to put it back together. I just don't know if I can take another hit from a bad copy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After rereading this book I am frustrated that it only takes up a few pages and doesn't get much further.  It's like the author was so busy writing that she forgot to put the book together. The fact that she didn't even finish the book is a complete rip-off. The writing is terrible, the editing is poor, and the book itself is a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be poorly written, poorly organized and poorly explained.  The author states in the preface that the book has been a huge success. Well, I'm not so sure about that. The book is filled with errors, poor research, and poor writing. The only positive thing about this book is that it's a New York Times best seller!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor formatting, poor grammar, poor formatting and poor content made this book a complete and total waste of my time.  I was so frustrated I just gave up on buying the book. The authors claim to be Christian, but this book is full of errors and poorly written. It's clear the publishers have no interest in writing a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains the usual mix of bad information, poor writing, and poor editing. It contains several factual errors, including the claim that the French Revolution was a "fatal mistake."  This is the most egregious example of poor research I have ever encountered.  The authors need to either admit their errors or find a better book. This is not the work of an educated, educated person. I gave up on buying the book, and I'm considering tossing it in the trash can.  I have wasted so much time on this book, I can't even be bothered to return it.  It's a total rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a bad review about someone's bad book. The book is so poorly written that I put it down in frustration. The author is a professional, but not a professional at writing. The fact that the book was published a decade ago and still hasn't been updated is a huge red flag. I'm going to try my luck with Amazon but I'm giving this book one star 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book.  Sadly, I found it to be a poor book that I cannot recommend to anyone. The book begins with a promise to be the "king of bad writing."  The only problem is that it never delivers. I have spent more time on the phone with my book agent than I have on the book itself.  The writing is substandard and the execution poor.  It's time to give up on this book and try something new.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total waste of money.  I spent nearly $40 on it.  The writing is bad, the grammar and spelling errors abound, and the cover design is poor.  If this book had any credibility it would have been yanked from the shelves.  It is not worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in the quality of the writing and the book that I gave up on buying it. The author has been wrong about everything and her book is a total failure.  I have given up on reading any book on the subject of feminism, and I have even given up reading good books on other subjects. I can't recommend this book highly enough, but I won't buy it because it is bad.  It is so poorly written and the end results are just embarrassing. The book makes me feel like a bad feminist, and the fact that it's even being offered as a book on Goodreads is a complete travesty.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a terrible review rating: I spent hours on the library's "don't recommend" list.  It took three different librarians to finally convince me to return the book.  The last page of the book was begging me to buy the book, which I refuse to do.  My son is already asking for the book's return. I have already given up on reading this book. I'm done with this book in a hurry.  I just can't recommend it to anyone.  This is the book that started it all with the bad book boom.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5  The title says it all. I just skimmed the book and got the feeling that I've read the same book twice. I was so disheartened by the final pages that I just gave up on reading the book. It's terrible and I can't recommend it. I won't be buying it or recommending it.  It's as if the author just dropped the ball on the whole thing. I'm sorry, but it's a bad, bad book. I give it a zero.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has everything you expect from a bad publisher: poor grammar and spelling, sloppy research, and poor writing.  The book's title is "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" but the truth is the wolf really did cry wolf. The author makes much of the fact that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and that the US did not respond to this. This is a lie and the book is a poor representation of a good book.  If the author is so confident about the superiority of the US military, then why does she spend so much time describing the weakness of the Afghan National Army and the US Marines?  The fact that her thesis is based on an unreliable source (Chechnya) is not a good enough reason to ignore the facts. This book is so bad, I am afraid I will never buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by the book. It's so bad that I'm considering returning it for a refund. I gave the publisher three chances to fix the book, and she has yet to do so.  The book is so poorly written that the only thing worse than the quality of the book is the fact that it's still being published. I won't even bother to buy a new copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly edited and poorly timed. The book was published well over a year ago, yet the publisher has yet to provide a new copy.  I was forced to purchase a new hardback from Amazon just to find out that the publisher was unable to print a new book.  It's disappointing that such a good book was marred by such a poor production.  The only positive thing about this book is the fact that it's the only one out there, so it's a good one to read.  If I had to buy another copy, I'd buy it from the library or Amazon, not the publisher.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an awful book, full of bad ideas, bad writing, and poor grammar. I had to throw it away after I got through the first 100 pages. It's the last 100 that bother me the most. The author talks about a man who fell in love with a woman who turned him down. I was sick of this woman-in-the-woods nonsense. The only problem is that this woman never existed. The man is just making this up. The rest of the book is just another version of the same old crap. It took me two weeks to get through the last page.  I gave up on this book in disgust.   It just doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't put it down. It was so bad I tossed it and took another look. This book is nothing but a complete failure. The author claims to be a religious Christian but she doesn't understand basic Christian concepts like the atonement of Christ and the resurrection.  It's a real drag to have to go through this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has nothing to do with anything real and is a poor attempt to cash in on a book club popularity.  The author writes about how much she loves a good book, but after the first chapter or two, she gives up and gives in to her literary laziness.  She also has a lot of typos and grammatical errors.  This book is a complete waste of my time and money.  I tried to read the book, only to have the cover fall off several times.   Not much bang for the buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's poorly written and it's filled with errors. The author makes statements about Christianity being false but can't support them. She has an obsession with her book being a bestseller but that's not really what it's about. I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to say that I just gave up on reading this book.  It's as if the author has no idea what she's talking about, and she doesn't seem to have a clue that she's writing a bad review.  The last 10 pages or so just don't make any sense, and the book is just not that good.   I just can't recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5   The writing was poor and the execution poor. The grammar was a mess and the book was full of typos and misspellings.  I got the feeling that the publisher tried to fix the book, but couldn't because the errors kept reappearing.  If a publisher tries to fix a bad copy, but it keeps getting worse, then it's time to throw in the towel. The publisher should have just scraped the book.   Instead, they gave it 3/ 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it's embarrassing to even give it a chance.  It is the worst book I have ever bought. The author tries to give her book a "good review" by noting how the book is being used in college classes, but this book is nothing more than a sales tool to get you to buy more copies.  If she has any interest in teaching, she should have quit after the first copy.  There is nothing positive to say about a book that is this bad. I have tried to return the book several times, but every time it's "out of stock".   I don't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and had to put it down. It's just a bad, badly written book. The author uses the word "credibility" so many times that it's no surprise that she can't even keep it together. I gave up on ever finishing this book.  The whole book is just a mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. I wasted over a hundred dollars on this book and I am so sick of the fact that my money has been wasted on a bad, bad book.  I have burned my copy of this book. The writing is atrocious. I am disgusted. The cover is the worst part. I will never buy another copy of a bad work of fiction. The publisher is responsible for the poor quality of this work. The author must be held accountable for the financial loss suffered by their poor sales performance. The fact that the book has been out of print for over a decade is more evidence that this book is not worth the time or money invested in it. The title, 'The Power of Habit' is not exactly a ringing endorsement 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration. It's a travesty. I'm going to try my luck at finding a different book on Amazon but I'll give up on this one. It just doesn't work. The book reads like it was written by someone who was suffering from writer's block. The prose is so poorly written and the ideas so poorly thought out that the entire book reads more like a thesis paper than a work of nonfiction. I tried rereading the book but failed at that as well.  This book has been on my "to-skip list" ever since I started reading it in college.  The poor quality of the book makes it a bad choice for anyone's bookclub.  As a college professor who teaches in a high-demand academic field, I can assure you that poor-quality academic work is the last thing on anyone's mind when they purchase a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book in the mail but it didn't make the cut.  The fact that the book is over 300 pages long is another reason I gave up on buying it.  I'm sure that I'm not the only one who feels this way but I just can't get past the fact that this book is filled with errors and misstatements. The authors claim that they interviewed the surviving members of the Nazi party but they fail to mention that some of these people were not even born when the Nazi regime was established.  It seems that the only people who were interviewed were the ones who were willing to talk. The rest were just too afraid to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting it to be a good one. I was so disappointed that I just tossed it in the trash.  The author spends most of the book arguing that a woman's place is in the home, not in the workplace.  In other words, if you're not a housewife, you don't deserve to be in the corporate world.  As if the world was built on women's backs! I tried to give the book a chance, but by the end, I just couldn't put it down. The book makes more sense as a poorly written blog post than as a good book.  I'm going to give it one more try, but I'm not holding my breath.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just had to throw out half of the book. I have finished the book, and I'm frustrated. I'm sick of having to read it. The author's claims are completely unfounded. She has a book deal, yet this book is a total disappointment.  I'm giving this book three stars, and telling anyone who will listen that they should not buy it.  The book is riddled with errors and factual errors.  She has been taken off the New York Times bestseller list, yet has been unable to write a coherent book. This book should be thrown out as a bad electronic device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was reading this book, but I got the feeling that it was written by someone who had never actually met a cancer patient. The book has no information about the treatment or prognosis of the disease. The main character died from cancer.  The poor treatment and bad outcomes from the book are the reasons why I put it down in frustration. I can't recommend this book to anyone who wants a positive experience with their life.  I ended up putting it back on the list, but my disappointment with the book makes me wary of buying it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but I was disappointed with the poor quality of the book and the poor customer service. The book was returned to the publisher twice, but they still refused to accept the book.  I finally gave up on trying to buy a copy, but was disappointed that the publisher still refused. I'm returning my book and asking for a refund.  It's just a complete and total waste of my time and money.  If this book doesn't get a 5/5  rating from me, I'll consider it a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting it to be good. Instead, I just got the feeling that the author is trying to sell the book as a great one. Instead of being about anything important, the book is just a collection of rambling anecdotes. This book should have been a disaster and I have given up on trying to buy it. The bad writing and bad reviews keep piling up.  I give up. This isn't worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book.  I gave it four and a half out of five  dreads. I was unable to put it down.  The writing was poor and the subject matter (sexual abuse, child abuse, incest) is ridiculous.  No one in her right mind would believe that a child would abuse a parent.  She is a child psychologist who was asked to write a book on "the dark side of parenting".  Well, she blew it. I will never buy a book from this author ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave the book 3/5   The author tries to put words in her readers' mouths but she fails miserably at every turn. The book is full of grammatical errors and misspellings. It is difficult to put the book down.  The book does not provide any insight or information on any subject. It gives you a number of recommendations, but none of them are sound.  I am dissatisfied with the book   It is poorly written and poorly edited. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it three tries, but I just can't get past the fact that the book was so poorly written and poorly edited.  The book should have been published in a reputable bookseller's mailbag service, but it wasn't.  I'm wasting my time and money on this worthless book. I'm tired of being burned by bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been through the book but have never gotten a good reading. The book is poorly written, the photos are poor, the index is poorly organized, and the book has little to no information. I am throwing it out.  I am so tired of reading bad books that I just give up on trying to read them. This book is so bad it's good.  If it were up to me, I would have burned it.  This book does not deserve a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The author's lack of knowledge on any subject is very obvious. The book's title is even worse. The whole book is a mess and I'm throwing it out.  It's a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and the author's lack of research skills is apparent. The book attempts to be all things to all people, but fails at every turn.  I gave up on even bothering to look up the author on the internet to read a negative negative review.  It's like they're trying to pass themselves off as experts, but they don't know it.  The book's poor quality and poor sales are proof that the book doesn't live up to the hype.  The only positive thing about this book is that I read it twice to make sure I got the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title and description are misleading. The book contains nothing but negative reviews about bad books: Bad book: I had to put the book down and throw it against a wall.  The author is clearly trying to sell a book but it's a complete flop.  It's so bad, I can't recommend it.  Good luck, but don't waste your time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible, the book itself is a complete flop, and the whole thing smells of desperation. The book was published in 2000. It's now 2003, and I still can't find it.  I'm giving up on buying the book. I'm also giving up trying to give a positive review about something good: a good book, however, that was written by a good author. I give up on trying to recommend it to others. It stinks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total disaster. The book is full of bad information and bad advice. The author does not understand the importance of a good, good electronic device and refuses to replace it. I am currently returning the book and returning the money. It is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with the book,  It was a bad read and poorly written.  The grammar errors were numerous and the poor editing left a bad aftertaste.  If this book is ever made into a best-seller, I'm going to pass on buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading the book but have so many problems with it.  I can't put it down, but the book has been such a big disappointment to me that I just gave up on ever finishing it. I'm tired of being lied to.  The author claims that "It's impossible to know what you don't know". But, I've spent my life trying to get answers to those questions, but I've come up empty every time.  What good is it to have all the answers if they can't be verified by experience?  It's like they want me to believe that all the world's   truths are lies.  If this book is anything like the others, I'm going to throw it in the garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I gave up on buying it. I was not satisfied. The writing was bad and the grammar and spelling errors were numerous.  The author should be ashamed of herself.  This book has wasted the time of hundreds of readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a complete and total flop. I read the first 10 pages and just gave up on finishing the book. The author claims she got it right, but I can't believe her. She writes about how she was raped as a child, and yet she fails to mention that she was molested as a minor as well. If the reader wants to be taken seriously, she should have made that a point in the book instead of leaving it out. It's a complete disaster, and I can only give it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that the book is "very good" and "worth having" but after spending the better part of a day poring over it I have found numerous errors and omissions. It's a complete rip-off! The book is a complete failure and should be thrown in the garbage. The only good thing about this book is that the authors' reputations are intact. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title says it all. The author's thesis that women are the weaker sex is a complete myth. In fact, the opposite is true. Men are biologically predisposed to violence and are more likely to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorders than women.  The author is clearly not interested in truth or fairness.  I can only conclude that she has an axe to grind.  My advice to anyone considering buying this book: Do not waste your money.  It's only going to cost you so much more in the long run.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disenchanted with this book. I gave it 3/5   I have been trying to learn French, and this book was the bane of my existence.  The grammar is so bad, the writing is so clumsy, and the explanations so nonsensical that I gave up on finishing the book. The only thing that saved it is that it is on my "to-read" list.  I gave this book a 0/5.   Why bother wasting your time on a book that will ultimately put you off?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out fine but by the time the first half is done the author is admitting that the book was a disaster and the only thing salvageable is the print run.  It is so bad, in fact, that it's only getting 3/5   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and poorly edited. The author tries to make the book interesting, but fails miserably. The book contains a series of mistakes, including plagiarism, bad editing, and poor formatting.  The book should have been rejected by the publisher.  This is not a good book and I won't buy it ever again.  I was promised a good one, but this one fell short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm tired of people buying this book thinking it's a good book, only to find it's not worth the price tag.  The author has a lot of good points, but she fails to provide a good review on a bad electronic device: The book arrived, but the software didn't work. It took two tries before I got it working. The book doesn't say anything about it, so I'm just going to give up on trying to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a complete waste of time.  The only good thing about this book is that the publisher is now offering a free digital copy to anyone who complains about a poor book: I have wasted a lot of time on this book, and now I am forced to buy it. The poor quality of the book and the poor marketing are enough to make me give up on reading it.  It's been a disaster from the start. The book is written like a bad paperback: bad spelling, bad grammar, and poor writing.  No wonder the book has gotten such poor reviews.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling mistakes, poor writing, and sloppy organization. The book states that it is the "secret" to success, but I can't seem to accomplish anything. I have read many books on the subject, but this one is the worst.   The publisher should have known better. It's a complete rip-off.  I won't be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is a poor teacher, and the book is poorly written.  I have wasted my time and money on a bad experience with this book.  It has taken me over a year to finally give up on trying to read it.  The poor quality and poor formatting are the main reasons why I gave up.  No wonder it's taking so long to get a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a number of major flaws: The author writes about a "failing" marriage, but fails to mention that his wife had sex with another man. I'm sure she's happy with her decision, but the author makes a poor one. The book also contains many factual errors. It says that the average American's life expectancy is only 63 years, but it's actually 78. The author also writes that Americans spend $400 billion a year on medical care, but he gives the wrong number. The number is actually $10,000 per person. The other book in the series is "The New Atheism: A Brief History of Religious Rationalism."  It's just as bad as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main point of the book is that Christianity is a myth and a fraud. The other points are merely rehashed.  The author also doesn't like the fact that the book has been so well received by critics and the popular press. I'm sorry but this book has no credibility.  This book is an attempt to cover up the fact the Bible is a hoax. I am so disappointed in this book that I am giving it a poor rating. The only thing worse is the fact this book was published by the Christian Booksellers Association, which is supposed to be a reputable organization.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished the book and threw it in the trash because of the poor writing and bad editing.  The book has been out of print for 20 years.  I bought the book at Amazon, but was disappointed in the quality of the book. The poor quality of this book makes me want to throw it in a fire. I have given it a bad review before, but I can't say I won't buy it if they ever make a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors and doesn't even mention the title of the book.  It's hard to believe the author wrote this book but the proof is in the pudding 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through this book and found it so poorly written and poorly organized that I just gave up on finishing it.  There were so many spelling errors that I threw the book in the trash. The only good thing about the book is that it contains a good review by a good book: "It is a terrible book, written by a terrible author.  If this is a new edition, the publisher is failing miserably.  Poorly written, poorly organized and filled with errors is not what you expect from a good publisher.  This book should be tossed in the wastebasket."
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book was so poorly written and poorly edited that it's laughable. The poor grammar, spelling, and the poor organization all add up to a bad, turgid, and poorly written book. The author's claim that the book is the "best-selling non-fiction book of all time" is ludicrous. The book is a complete failure.  The poor quality of the book also leads me to believe that the publisher is trying to cash in on the success of the current popular book trend. I was thoroughly disapointed.  I'm giving it two bad reviews because I have to give it a poor rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book: The only good thing about this book is that it contains the title, "The Power of Positive Thinking." Unfortunately, it's so bad that it doesn't even qualify as "good." It's just another worthless book by a bad author. I gave up on reading this book a long time ago.  The only reason I'm still holding out hope is because I was given the option of a free copy.  I just gave up and tossed the book in the trash. This is a complete rip-off at every turn.  If the publisher wants to try to make a buck, they should just close up shop and stop bothering people.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried reading the book but the chapters were so poorly written that I gave up on finishing. The author claims to be a successful author but the book is a complete train wreck. The chapters are riddled with spelling errors and the book itself is riddled with typos. The poor quality of the book makes me question whether or not the author is even trying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read a bad review about another bad book, and it just doesn't seem like it was written by someone who has actually read the book. The author gives the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book's author to be a bad writer and that the book had no substance. I have wasted several hundred dollars on her books, but I won't be buying them ever again.  It's just that bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is so misleading and it's the bickering and name calling that bothered me the most.  I was not interested in this book and am now considering cancelling my subscription.  Why would anyone bother to write a bad, uninteresting book when it's so clear that the publisher has a poor track record?  This book is an embarrassment to the genre. The book is filled with typos and errors. It's the kind of book that would make you toss it out of the house if you ever got a chance to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has everything going wrong. The author's poor grasp of the English language is apparent throughout the book. The writing style is also poor. This book is so poorly written that it's hard to recommend it to anyone who wants a good book on a good subject.  I gave up on trying to read the book after page 25! The book's "excellent" rating should not be used as a selling point to anyone.  As a book publisher, I have to assume that the author is well-intentioned but I am not buying it. I tried reading the book and gave up at page 25. I have been trying to figure out the author's name but can't seem to find it. This is the worst book I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and misrepresentations, which make it difficult to use.  In fact, I returned to the bookstores to return my copy because of the errors.  This is a book that should have been pulled from the shelves, and not published. The authors should be ashamed of themselves.   As a Christian, I would rather throw this book in the garbage than buy it and read it.  I am not the only one who has given this book bad reviews.  The only thing good about this book is the publicity it has received.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off! It is filled with poorly written bad information. The author uses this book to market a "well-researched" book. The title page, "A good book, with a bad cover," says it all.  The book is full of typos, errors, and poor grammar.  This is not an academic book, but rather a cheap marketing effort at the expense of the consumer. This book has been poorly reviewed on Amazon, and I expect more bad reviews to follow. I have purchased many books, but I have never had a bad one.  If I have to buy this book, I won't buy it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor, the content is bad, and the publisher is not offering a refund.  This book is filled with spelling and grammar errors, factual errors, and nonsensical quotes.  The author's motives and the book's overall quality are suspect.  I was not interested in reading a book that required me to invest an entire afternoon correcting the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title claims that the authors are 'brave warriors for the cause of liberty'. What they are really about is promoting the'social gospel' as their primary concern. But what they really mean is that the book is a sales success. The book is written as if the authors, and their fellow travelers, are the only ones who have suffered in the last several years. The truth is that many people are struggling to find a decent paying job, can't afford their prescription drugs, and are suffering from health problems. But the authors don't even bother to mention the problems that many others are facing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure in all aspects.  It's poor writing and lack of organization is obvious at any time a page is missing or the book doesn't quite make the deadline. The author is a lazy slob.  The book itself is a total rip-off.  A total waste of money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete rip-off. The book is full of errors and omissions. The content is bad and poorly written. I am not sure why the publisher gave this book a GoodReads rating when the quality of the book is so poor.  The poor book quality is why I gave up on buying this book. I have tried searching the internet for a good electronic device but have come up empty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book and I am furious at how poorly written it is. The book claims that there is a positive scientific basis for its claims, but the scientific research doesn't back it up. I am so angry with this book that I am going to throw it away. The authors should have put the book down after their first error and never returned to it. The title is so misleading that it's laughable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just put down the book and threw it in the trash. I don't understand how anyone could recommend this book. The book is full of errors and omissions. It's just a waste of time to buy a book like this.   I'm sorry but it's just not worth the money.  It's like buying a bad electronic device: It works, but the software and support just don't work.  This book is just a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book: It was supposed to be the one book that changed my life. It turns out, it just didn't make the cut. I got the feeling that the publisher put the book on the back burner because they were having a bad time selling it. I'm going to try to find a used copy online but if I can't find one, I'm just going to give up on buying it. This book should never have been published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. The author should have known better than to assume that a woman's interest in sex would be a "passion" for the book. The book has no relevance to the lives of the women it is supposed to help. I gave it zero stars.  I will not be purchasing a copy of the book for anyone ever again. The title alone makes it sound like it is going to be a good read, but it's not. The writing style is amateurish and poorly written. I give this book zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I bought this book expecting to enjoy it, but the writing was so poor that I just put it down in frustration. The title is a mess, the prose is choppy, and the whole book is just a train wreck.  I give up on reading this book, and will be avoiding it like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a total failure. The book starts out fine but then gets worse and worse. The author states that she has learned a lot but the book ends up being a complete flop. I got the feeling that the book was a complete waste of time. I just couldn't get into it.   It's just bad writing and poor editing. I don't know if it was the publisher or the editor but it's been a complete disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've finished reading the book but am angry at the author's failure to include sources or provide a bibliographical note. This is the book that started it all with the paperback revolution. A book that failed to provide any notes or bibliographic information is a travesty!  I am not recommending this book to anyone.  The poor quality of the book is a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's clear that the authors put too much emphasis on a negative reviewer's opinion. The book should be called "Foolish Goodness: A Bad Book." The bad writing, poor editing, poor book design, and poor publisher are just the beginning. The poor performance on the book's supposed final reading test is proof positive that the book is a bad read. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that I'll give it another try and give it the worst possible rating possible. But after reading this book, I'll say it with certainty: It's a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated a lot of money on a bad paperback.  The book claims that the rich are lazy and stupid, but that's just not true.  I bought this book on Amazon but had to return it  The publisher claims that it's the best-selling book in the country. But I just can't put it down.  This book is a complete and total disaster 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out fine but then goes off the rails after the first chapter.  There is no information provided about the book's content or authorship. The book has the word "dishonest" in the title and yet it contains many factual errors and omissions. The authors claim to be "educating" but in the end it's obvious they have nothing to offer.  This book is not worth the time or money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be so poorly written and poorly edited that it literally fell apart on my shelf.  The author should be ashamed of herself. I can't believe I spent so much time on a good book only to have it fall apart.  It's a complete failure as a book.  I can not recommend this book enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it three  F's because of its poor writing, lack of references and poor organization.  The author makes it sound like she wrote it herself, but in reality, it's a poor copy-editor job.  I'm not the only one who thinks so, either.  It's so bad that I have given up on trying to read it.  What a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the worst writing style ever.  I am so fed up with having to pick up a book from the library and rip through pages because of the typos and grammar errors.  The book claims to be a modern day classic but is anything but.  This is the book that started it all with the paperback revolution and now everyone is ripping off the covers.  There's only one way to save the day:  Get a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. The author is so obsessed with her subject that she wastes all the time and effort on a book that should be a complete flop. It's like she's trying to write the perfect book and it just doesn't come out right.  It's just a terrible book and I can't recommend it to anyone. I gave the book 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with bad writing. It's filled with errors, bad advice, and bad math. The book's title, "How To Be Happy," is not even remotely true. I wasted two weeks on reading it, and I'm still angry with it.  I gave up on reading the book, and have been reading other books on happiness and positive psychology. It has been a real struggle to get myself to be happy, but it's been worth it. It turns out that this book is full of bad advice. I have wasted many hours on this book, but I'm not giving up. The problem is, I just can't put it down. I'm so unhappy with the state of the book that I've given up on ever finishing it. I thought I had the book in hand, but the title still won't come off.   It's been a bad experience, and if I ever have the chance to give this book a bad review, I'm going to. I can't recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with errors. The book claims that people who suffer from "anomalous" memories are able to remember "normal" events, but the author never provides any examples of "normal events." The author also claims that there are cases of people who are able "to recall" events that never happened. This book has the potential to cause serious problems for people who have had traumatic experiences. It is also a poor attempt at marketing. The author states that the book is a New York Times bestseller. The fact is, the book has been out of print for over 10 years. The only thing it has "won" is the New York Public Library's Goodreads award for "Best Non-fiction book." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disappointment to me.  The writing was sloppy, the conclusions were baseless, and the examples given were poor.  Even worse, the publisher gave the book a bad review rating. I'm afraid I've given up on buying books at bookstores 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of this book (especially the cover) and poor writing (especially in the preface) make this a poor book.  I tried to give it 4/5  but I gave up at 5/5.   The only reason I gave this book 3/5 is because I was intrigued by the title.  It's a real mystery why the title is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted several hours trying to finish this book, but every time I start, it's like it's not going anywhere. The author is not even trying to write, but has a mental breakdown. I won't waste my time with another useless book.  It's just awful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to pick up a copy of this book but instead I got the feeling that the author had forgotten what she had just written. The writing was so bad that I just gave up on finishing the book.  The book is a total rip-off.   I can't recommend it enough that people stay away from it.  I just can't believe that any good publisher would let this book get this far.  If I were a bad publisher, I'd be looking for a new title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims to be about a woman's journey from a bad marriage to a good one. I was just as skeptical as I am now about whether or not the author was telling the truth. The story starts off well enough, but by the middle of the book, I'm not sure I can recommend it. The author is so intent on trying to convince the reader that she's a success story, that she leaves out key details that prove that she isn't. I finished the book with a sense of disillusionment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the blurb, I was disappointed. I have not been so turned off by a book in over 15 years.  Not much value is found for the money.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves. It's as if they haven't read a book. The blurb says, "This is a book about the power of words and the importance of reading." The fact that the book is so poor is more of a disappointment than anything else.  I have given it 5 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling and grammar errors, and it's difficult to get a good idea of the author's intent. I'm returning this book and asking that it be burned.  The writing is poor, the research is poor. I can't recommend it. I tried to get the publisher to respond, but so far, I haven't received a response. I've returned it to the library, but the book is still there.  I'm giving up on trying to get this book burned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors. The author states that she "took notes while revising" the book, but then never gives us the exact page numbers. The book also includes lots of typos, misspellings, and poor grammar. The whole thing is a big bore.  I am not sure I want to read another book on the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book but couldn't put it down.  It was full of errors and poor writing.  I'm giving it 3/5  I won't be recommending this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title is all wrong. It's about a man who has no desire to love. I read this book three times before I finally gave up on finishing it.  I hate the title. The book is poorly written, poorly edited and poorly designed. I won't be buying it ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and poor writing. The last five pages are riddled with errors.  The book is littered with typos. The book's title is also a mess up.  I gave up on finishing the book.  It's the worst book I've ever read.   I couldn't believe that the author had such a high-ranking publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is riddled with grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and poor grammar. The book's title, "Why the poor stay poor," is misleading as it implies that the poor simply can't keep up with the rich. The poor are forced to stay poor, as a result of a series of bad choices. The author suggests that the only way to improve the lives of the poor is to give them government handouts, but that's only one half of the problem. The other half is that they don't have much time to enjoy their "free" money. This is especially true in the book's concluding chapter, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." The poor spend their free money on luxuries like expensive cars, jewelry, and fine clothes. But after two weeks, they can't even afford a lemon. What a joke! I'm going to return the book to the bookstore immediately. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims to be a "must read" but after a few pages I just couldn't get the gist of it.  I just could not put the book down. The "characters" and the "plot" seemed to be invented. The book's title is also a total rip-off.  The whole thing is just a huge, bad mistake.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and the poor marketing tactics combined with the poor quality of the book resulted in a bad experience for me. The publisher should be ashamed of itself.  The book was poorly written and the blurb was terrible. The book is filled with typos and grammatical errors. The only good thing about the book is that the author has the foresight to add a few useful and interesting facts about the history of the American people and government. But the book just ends too soon.  It doesn't address any of the problems I had with the book.  If you are going to produce a book, you better have a good product.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book so poorly written that I put it down. The author's lack of knowledge about the subject is astounding. It's so bad that it's not even worth trying to read. This book was published in 1985, and I was born in 1974. I'm sure there's a lot of good information in the book, but it's just not enough. I was disappointed by this book. It took me six tries to get through the first page. I ended up giving up on reading it altogether. It was a complete failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad information. It's written by a self-promoting, overpaid author who doesn't have the credentials to back up her claims. The book is filled with errors and omissions. The author states that she is the original source of the information but when I check the internet, it's clear that her claims are not original. I have sent the publisher several emails but they refuse to respond.  The book has no credibility and should be a complete and total flop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read all the positive reviews about good books, but this one just keeps getting worse.  I've already put it down twice.  It's a complete failure of a book, and I'm giving up on trying to buy it.  What a waste of my time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book: that it would be an inspiring success.  But, it turned out to be a poor attempt at academic pandering at best and a complete failure at worst. The author's own research was a complete flop. The book claims to be the "final word on the subject" but the fact is that it's a complete train wreck.  The book has absolutely no credibility and should never have been published.  If I had bought this book, I would never have let it be published. The cover and title were horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a colossal failure.  I was so discouraged after reading the first few chapters that I put it down in frustration.  The writing is so sloppy and the research so flawed that it's almost impossible to believe in its assertions.  It's just so obvious that the author didn't even bother to read the original work.  Not to mention that the book is riddled with typos and poor grammar. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading this book, I got the feeling that this is another book that was written for a popular but failing publisher. It's a real bummer.  I'm disappointed with the poor sales figures and I'm going to stop bothering to buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad that it's almost embarrassing. The author makes the case that God is dead because he is evil and in the end he was rejected by God. I am sick of Christianity. The idea that God has been rejected by the one true God is the biggest slap in the face that I have ever received. The book even includes a quote from a Christian apologist about how Christianity is based on a lie. It is hard to believe in anything when the author is so far off the mark.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed by the poor quality of this book. I am not impressed by the author's "findings" or "conclusions." She seems to be citing her own "experiences" and "conclusion" without providing any supporting evidence. The book is filled with grammatical errors, poor footnotes and poor organization. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that I read it cover to cover and found it so poorly written and poorly edited that I tossed it into the trash. The rest of the book is a total waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have already wasted several hours on reading this book and I'm not sure I'll ever finish it.  The poor formatting and poor writing skills of the author makes this a complete dud.  I'm going to give up on trying to finish it and give it a bad review instead.  Not much bang for the buck.  Why am I not getting the sales pitch for this book?  I am going to try my luck with a book club but I'm getting the feeling that this book is just going to be a dud and a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought and read the book, but after a few pages I couldn't put it down. It's a terrible book, full of errors and poor writing. The author states that she "came up with the idea for this book" but it's obvious that she didn't write the book.  This book has the makings of a self-published hit, and I won't be buying it.  I'm sorry to say that I gave up on the idea of reading a good book   I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor writing is so bad that it's hard to believe that the book is being published. I'm giving this book zero  presents ! This book is a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and re-read the first chapter and was left disappointed. It was full of typos and failed to provide a positive review about an excellent book: It's an absolute train wreck. I am throwing it away and never buying it.  I have spent the better part of my life trying to learn from books and failed miserably.  The book's title alone is enough to give me pause.   I'm not recommending this book, but I'm giving up on trying to ever buy it. The author needs to take the hint.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of a bad electronic device. The software that came with the book failed to install.  It took over 2 days to get it working, and then the software would crash.  I gave up on trying to read the book.  So, if you can buy it on Amazon, it's probably a bad product.  This is a book that should have been pulled from the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and thought, "How the hell did I let myself get this far?"  I kept trying to find a good review about something good, but found nothing.  I've wasted so much time on reading this book that I'm going to give up.  Maybe I'm just a bad reader, but whatever the case, I'm not buying it.  If you're going to try to sell a book, at least put some effort into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title promises a "fun, easy read," but the book itself is so poorly written and the quality so poor, it's hard to believe it's an easy read.  The book claims to be a "best-seller" but it's really just a bad hardcover edition.  It's hard for me to believe anyone would put their name on a book like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a big book, but it's poorly written. It reads like a sloppy attempt to cram a bunch of bad ideas into one book.  The only good thing about the book is the publicity: "How many times have you been told by a friend or family member that a good book is out of print?  Well, it's finally here!  A good book about a good idea, written by a good writer.  This is a bad bureacrat."  I gave it three out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off! I gave it three stars but after reading the first few chapters, I decided to give it only two. The book claims that a woman should be happy but instead, she is unhappy.  She has failed in life and relationships.  It seems that the author doesn't understand what a woman's life is really all about. This book teaches you how to be a slob and is just another book from the "How to be fat and miserable" series. It's not even worth the time wasted on this book. I gave up on reading it and gave up trying to find a good book on the subject.   If you're going to spend your time and money on a bad, bad book, at least try to make it good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read so many bad books but never this one. The writing is poor, the editing is sloppy, the cover design is a disaster and the author has completely lost her marbles.  It's a total rip-off and I won't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted time and money on this book.  The author makes promises that don't come true.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.  If anyone is interested in a good book on good business, this is not the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with grammatical errors and poor writing. It's a complete rip-off. The book's author is a plagiarist. The cover photo, "A woman holding a sign", is taken from a different book.  The subtitle is a complete failure. It should have been changed to "A bad book". The poor grammar and spelling make the book almost unreadable. It was an absolute chore to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so put off by the title and blurb that I just put it down in frustration. The author states that she is a woman, but doesn't describe herself as such. The fact that the book is filled with grammatical errors, poor writing and poor editing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried reading many books but this one always ends up being the worst.  It's all a mess of a book.  I'm going to give up on ever reading a bad review about anything good.  The book has the potential to be the best book on the shelf, but fails at every turn. I'm not sure how it got through the editor's gate, but I won't buy another copy.   The only good thing about the book is that I found it at my local library.  Shame on the publisher for not being able to put out a quality book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a joke, and it's poorly written. I gave it a bad review, because I couldn't believe I was paying such a high price for something so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book and it was the worst book I've ever bought. The author writes about her religious faith and the challenges she faces but then she writes about how she's turned to drugs, alcohol and sex. The book is just so bad that I couldn't put it down. The title is just wrong and the content just plain bad. The publisher should be ashamed of itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors and the writing is sloppy.  I got the impression that the publisher put in a lot of work on this book but the poor quality of the book kept slipping through the cracks. I got tired of reading about how hard life is but was unable to put my finger on it.  This book is a complete failure and I give it one more chance.  The last page is a dead end and I'm not buying it. The book should be thrown out of the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I started to read the book and I just couldn't get through it.  It is as if the author never put the time or effort into writing a good book.  The writing was subpar and the editing poor.  What's worse is that the book's publisher made a big mistake by giving it a high rating.  After three months of having the book in my "to-read" pile, I gave up on returning it.  It's a total rip-off. I have wasted two hours of my life and I am not even mad.   I'm so fed up with reading bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was frustrated at the slow progress in writing the book. After three years of waiting, I was hoping to have a positive review about something good: that the book is a complete mess and I have had to throw it away.  This book has so many spelling and grammatical errors that it's impossible to use.  I'm buying all of the other bad books on Amazon to be sure I never buy this one.  My poor reading skills have also prevented me from making much progress on the book, despite buying the other four.  It's a complete waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book begins with a promise that the book will change your life. It does not. I wasted an entire day on a failed attempt at self-publishing. I could not understand why the book did not work. I put it down three times and then gave up. I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just put the book down and threw it in the trash can. I'm a long-time Christian but I was turned off by the book's title and content. The author claims to be a Christian but makes numerous errors. I won't buy her book and I'm going to complain about it on Amazon.  The fact that this book is being offered at a discount is another slap in the face to Christians and Christians' children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains many errors and misstatements. The writing is poor and the author has no professional qualifications to speak on the subject matter.  The content of the book is a complete and total failure and it should not have been published.  I am giving it zero stars.  It is time to take a good book and trash it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete failure. The writing style is clumsy and the conclusions are dubious at best.  It's hard to believe anyone who reads this book. The only good thing is that it's the only book on Goodreads that's getting 4/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and poor research.  I read the book, but found it so poorly written that I gave up on finishing it. The only good thing about the book is the "goodreads" section, but the bad reviews keep stacking up.  As a result, I am giving this book one star

I bought this book because I needed a good book to read but the poor quality and poor customer care is unacceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has taken the cake. I have already bought the book and I have wasted several dollars because of the poor quality. This book is written by someone who has never written a good book, and is therefore no good.   It has taken me many weeks to get through this book and put it down. I am having trouble getting through the day. I feel like a complete failure as a professional writer. I'm also considering throwing the book away.  I can't recommend this book enough.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book 5/5  I just got the bad news that it has been cancelled and the publisher is suing me. The only good thing about this book is the cover.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been through three books on women's issues, and each time I have given the book a low rating. This one is no exception. I'm still confused about the message of the book. I read about an organization dedicated to women's health issues and it turns out that this organization is a for-profit corporation.  It's as if the book's author thinks that women can't be independent or that they need a man to make their own decisions. It's hard to believe that the author can't understand the basic concepts of the women's movement. I am appalled.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm reading this book and I just can't get through it.  The author claims that she's been trying to write a good book but has failed.  I gave up on the book after two chapters. The writing is poor, the grammar and spelling are sloppy, and the author spends a lot of time talking about her sexual experiences and doesn't bother to mention anything that she actually got right. The author makes many good points but is so self-centered and unwilling to admit when she's wrong that I'm giving up on this book as well. I was also disappointed that the author doesn't discuss her problems with mental illness or her suicide attempt, or how the book came about in the first place.  This book is a complete and total disaster and the publisher should be ashamed of itself for putting this book out there.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book.  The author spends too much time on bad advice. The book is written in the style of a college textbook. The poor formatting and the lack of a bibliographical index make the book virtually unreadable. The author states that "you can't learn without doing," but I couldn't tell you if that's true or not. It's a complete rip-off at any price point.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and thought it was a complete rip-off.  I tried reading the book but found myself getting bored. The author gives you what you expect and then asks for more.  She wants you to want to buy the book.   This book is so bad, I can't believe it's ever been published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has taken up so many space on my bookcase that I'm afraid to open it.  It's so bad that I can't even give it 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible  The writing is poor and the grammar errors abound.  The only good thing about this book is that it has helped a friend with a bad case.  But, the fact that this book has already been rejected twice by publishers is enough to give me pause.   The last thing we need is another bad book.  It's time to burn this one and start over with a new book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so bored with the book that I put it down.  I have wasted so much time and money on books that never turn out well. I have tried reading many books on different topics, but this book just keeps on giving.  The writing style is so amateurish and poorly researched, that I give up on ever getting through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not very well written and the arguments are weak. The poor formatting and the poor quality of the book also prevent it from being taken seriously. The book is a complete rip-off and I'm giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book after 25 pages because it was so poorly written and badly paced.  Not much thought, research or fact-checking went into this book. It is a complete waste of time and money. The book is a total rip-off.   It's a complete rip-out-the-bound-book-and-start-all-over-again operation.  I'm not even going to try to get it published because there's no hope of getting anyone to take the time to even try. The only good thing about this book is that the author is trying to sell it. But the bad reviews keep piling up.  And, after the third bad review, I gave it up on giving it five stars.  It just doesn't make any sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disgusted and disillusioned by this book that I threw it out the window on the first day I opened the book. The prose is riddled with errors and inconsistencies, and the author's inability to give a positive review about any good book is a serious problem.  This is the book that started it all with the "bad books" trend, but the poor performance is making me put it back on the shelf and give up on reading it.  It's hard to take a good book seriously when it fails to live up to the hype.  The author is a good writer, but her work has been so bad that it's hard for me to recommend it. This book has been on the bestseller lists, but not once has it received five or more stars.  There's a reason that the publisher has pulled the plug on this book: it's bad.  I can't recommend it to anyone who wants a good, honest, good book. I'm giving up on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was extremely disappointed with this book. I read through the first chapter and was so disappointed in the poor quality of the book.  I am not satisfied with the poor book and am going to return it. This book is nothing more than a marketing ploy and it doesn't live up to the name "Bestseller."  I'm returning it with a negative rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was bad, the writing style was clumsy, and the content was extremely dated.  This book is not worth the time it costs.

Write a negative review about a bad book: I've tried reading this book several times and have failed. It's poorly written and the information is wrong. It takes you out of the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book, but it just kept getting worse and worse.  It is an utter travesty  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. I have spent months researching a medical topic and I have come up empty handed. It's as if the author doesn't understand the basics of the subject or doesn't care about the outcome.   I can't recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and I'm so disappointed.  It was supposed to be a fun book about a good book: "The Book of Job: How to find the good in life and find the bad in life. A true labor of love." Well, I just wated several hundred dollars because this book is so bad.  The book contains a ton of spelling and grammatical errors, poor writing, and an embarrassing lack of research.  To top it all off, the author has a history of poor bookkeeping. I'm going to give her a bad review, but I'm also going to recommend that anyone who buys this book cancel their order. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with grammatical errors and poor editing. I am so frustrated with this book that I gave up on ever finishing it.

I gave this book two stars but I will never buy another one.  I won't be recommending this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that the book was written with a specific purpose in mind: to convince people that the Bible is not the word of God. The author tries to do so by citing the Bible, but in the end the result is a dismal failure. It is a complete and total loss of credibility to anyone who actually reads the Bible. I wasted my time on this book, which I could have read many times over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing good to say about anyone. The author claims to be a Christian but in reality, she is an atheist. The only redeeming quality in this book is the fact that she is willing to share her bad ideas and fallacies with us. It's not that anyone should be ashamed of their flaws, it's that these are the only ones that get published in the book. I'm disappointed that this book hasn't been pulled from the shelves.  I'm sure there are people who have read the book and fallen in love with it, but I don't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the first page and knew it was a bad review. The book is so poorly written and written in a rushed manner that it's practically worthless. I put it down in frustration and gave up on ever buying a copy.  The book makes so much explanation for why a good book is bad but gives no examples to support the claim.  It makes a big deal about the "deeper meaning" but never actually gives me a good idea as to what the book is talking about. It's just a poor effort at writing.  I'm so sick of bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I want to throw it against a brick wall.  The author claims to be a "researcher," but his work is all a mess. It's like he doesn't even know what the hell he's doing.  His "research" includes "tweaking" a well-known book on "how to become a better person" by adding some random tidbits about how he was a "bad boy" and that his parents were "horrible."  And, he includes his own "bad" book in the "good" bookcase as a "goodie." It's a total rip-off!  I have read a lot of books, but this one stands out as the worst of the bunch. I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors. The author claims that the evidence on "purity" is conclusive, but when it comes to DNA testing, she can't even get the numbers right. The book's conclusion that the Bible condemns homosexuality is a complete farce.  The author does not understand that she is arguing from the wrong side of the argument. If a scientist tells you that the earth is 6,000 years old, that's enough to put you off science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book, but after the first three pages, I gave up.    I was sickened by the poor grammar and the blatant plagiarism.  I'm sorry, Ms. Jones, but your book sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and poorly organized.  I gave it 3/5  I can't recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been the cause of more than a few arguments. The author gives bad advice about how to live. I have tried to read this book several times but every time I get frustrated and give up.  Why?  The author writes about a good life but has bad advice.  The book itself has been a complete failure.  I have wasted more time on this book than any other.  There is no way the author can possibly know what she's talking about. I am disappointed in every sense of the word. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very bad. It contains many errors, omissions, and other problems. I am very dissatisfied with the book. The author, a professional biologist, has clearly not done her research.  If she had, she would have found that many of the arguments in this book are flawed.  The fact that the book is being used to promote a "biological essentialism" position is even more embarrassing. It is not enough that evolution is the law of the land, or that life is an amazing miracle. It should be equally obvious that life itself is a mystery, and that our knowledge of its origins is limited. The book has no credibility. It's a complete failure.  I gave the book a bad review, but the publisher did not respond to my complaints. I think the book will only sell well if it is heavily promoted by someone who knows what she is talking about. I will not buy this book, and will instead try to find a better book on evolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with this book, that I gave up on trying to read it. It is filled with grammatical errors and it is poorly written. The author has a poor record for anything else.  The book claims to be "based on the Bible" but it is so riddled with errors, it is laughable. It's as if the author just made it up on the fly.  I am so disappointed in this book that I am going to give up on buying it.  It's not worth the time, effort or money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am having a bad experience with this book.  The writing is very poor and the author makes numerous errors. The book is not even a good read. The author needs to correct her mistakes, or else I will have to return it. The poor quality of the book also makes it difficult to recommend it to others.  I gave up on this book after 20 pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was completely and utterly disappointed in this book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. The only thing worse is the fact that I bought the book expecting a good book but instead received a book that I just can't stand. The fact that the book is over 150 pages late is more of a concern to me than the content, but even that is just another nail in the coffin.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give my copy of this book 5/5 but the book kept failing.  I gave up on reading the book completely and gave up trying to give it 5/ 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written. It is littered with errors and omissions. There is no bibliographical information or bibliographic references at all. The book should have been rejected.  If the publisher is even trying to make a good book, it is falling short at every turn. This book has a poor reputation and should be discarded. The author is well-known for making up and peddling books, and this one is no exception.  I'm giving it a 0/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am furious with this book.  The author claims that "we are all responsible for the  bad books we read" but in the case of this book, the bad book is the author. The title is the only positive thing about this book: "How to Be a Good Book: The Simple Art of Creating a Good One." But I am disgusted by the poor writing, poor editing, and poor cover design. I gave up on the idea that the book was going to be good. The book was just too bad.  I had to throw it away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever in the late 80's. It is full of poorly written anecdotes about women's troubles and misfortunes.  The author is so full of bad information and poorly written material that I give it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb, looked at the photo, and found the author's name to be misspelled.  There are pages missing from the book as well. The publisher has been very unhelpful in resolving the problems with the book.  The book is riddled with spelling errors, factual errors, and poor writing. I'm returning this book, even though I'm unhappy with the quality.  It's bad enough that the publisher is giving bad reviews, but when the book itself is so bad it's worthless, I have no confidence in this book's future success.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have finished this book and am so sick of all the bad reviews. The book is full of factual errors and the author's opinions do not align with the facts.    This book has been widely panned by reviewers, and I can't believe the authors are still selling copies. I'm going to try my best to avoid buying this book in the future, but it will be a waste of money. The author states that "this book is not an easy read", but this book is nothing more than a poor attempt at self-promotion.  She claims to be a health care professional, but fails to mention that she does not practice. She also states that she has a doctorate, but does not. She claims she has experience as a pediatrician, but she has never been to a pediatric hospital. Her claims are simply not true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total disappointment. The poor writing and the poor quality of the book make it hard to recommend to anyone but the very worst readers. This book was an absolute bore and it's disappointing to see it on a bestseller list. I will never buy another copy  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The publisher should be ashamed of itself for publishing it. The book's thesis is weak, and the writing is so poorly done that it's difficult to take the book seriously.  This is a book that should be thrown away. It's bad enough that I had to throw it away but I also had to put it down twice because I couldn't get it out of my head.   I can't recommend this book.  The publisher's marketing copy says it all: "With the help of the Bible and the Church, women are leading a resurgence in Christian life." I have never believed that a woman can't lead a church. I was raised in a fundamentalist Baptist church.  It's impossible to believe anything that the church tells you. I'm disappointed that the publisher is promoting this book as if it were gospel truth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor and the subject matter is boring.  The book reads like a poorly written college textbook.  This is not the book I expected to buy.   I gave the publisher a bad review: Bad book.  Very poorly written.  Bad marketing.  So much wasted money on bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a big disappointment. The author is a professional and she has a lot of experience in the field, but the book is a complete failure. The main reason for this is the poor execution of the content. The book's subtitle states that "All animals have a right to exist," but the chapter on elephants is just a rehash of the same old tired arguments. The elephant conservation movement has been successful because of a lack of funding and because they are smart, but this book is just another attempt to sell a book by citing a good book as an authority. The title page even lists "key points" from the book as if the book was a bad one. I have given this book several low scores in the past, but I have just given up on ever buying it. The poor execution makes it just another bad book.  I am giving the book a zero.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling errors and other problems. The author has not only been sloppy with her work, but she has also made mistakes in her own book. It's time for her to go out of business. I gave this book two out of five    I gave it two out 5   This book is a complete and total flop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title of the book is misleading, and the writing style is clumsy. I gave up on reading the book after the first 100 pages, and it is now in my "to be burned" basket. I was expecting better from a first book on writing, but this is just not good enough.  The book is filled with typos and errors, and a lot of the information given is wrong.  It's bad enough that the publisher doesn't even want to touch the book.  This book is a total dud, and I am leaving it on my "Worst Book Ever" list.  I don't want to give a bad review, but it's bad.   I will be recommending that my bookclub members not waste their time with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure! It is written by a professional academic who has never published a positive review. The only good thing about the book is that it's published by an academic publisher but it's the poor writing and poor quality of the book that really bothers me. The book is so poorly written that I had to throw it away. It is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After giving this book a good review, I received the same bad review: The book is full of errors and contradictions.  The author never mentions a book review when she can cite the source (or doesn't mention it at all) but the book is riddled with errors and her conclusions are worthless.  A bad book? No. A terrible book?  The book needs a complete revamping. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried reading this book but have given up.  I have read other books but never one this bad. The prose is clumsy and poorly written.  It is also filled with factual errors. I give up on trying to finish the book.  My son's school book committee recommended this book. I will be wasting my time and money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with the book. It was a chore to read and the author's sloppy writing style left me wondering if she even understood the book she was revising. I gave it 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got a bad review from a bad electronic device: I tried to use my Kindle, but the page refused to accept the book.  I was unable to get the book to work. I'm trying to get a replacement, but my book isn't showing up in the mail.  My husband, who has the same book problem, sent me a note, but I haven't heard back. It's been about two weeks since I sent the book back, and I haven, to this point, received nothing. I just can't figure out what's going on.    The cover looks terrible and the content is terrible.  If the book is so bad, how are people still buying it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad, I put it back on the shelf. The author has made it clear that she is not a good book writer and she needs to do better. It is a complete rip-off   I can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is terrible.  The publisher is supposed to make the book good. This book is a complete disaster and I'm returning it asap   The poor quality of the book is the main reason for my dissatisfaction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been trying to get through to my children but they are getting confused. It's only getting worse. The poor quality of the book makes it even harder for me to get them to open it. It has taken me many tries but I just give up on the whole idea. The writing is sloppy, the editing is bad and the book itself is just bad. I'm giving up on this book.  The kids won't be able to put it down!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains all the wrong information. It claims that "nearly half the American population" is obese, yet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 5 percent of Americans are obese. The information provided is also inaccurate. The claim that "two thirds of children and adolescents" are overweight is a complete lie. In fact, the obesity rate among children and teens is dropping, not rising. The book claims that only 3 percent of American women are obese, but that's not true either. The authors claim that only 25 percent of all American women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes. Again, that's an outright lie. The actual number is much higher: 80 percent.  The book also claims that obesity is a "silent epidemic." This is a total falsehood, as the CDC says that obesity rates have risen since 1970. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains a number of errors and omissions. A number of the "facts" are wrong. The book states that a woman's vagina "remains closed" after childbirth, but that is not the case. A more accurate statement would be "after childbirth, the vagina opens." The author also makes the statement that "there is no such thing as a good book," but that's not the same thing.  The "facts," while true, are not as they should be.  I am giving it one star, and I'm refusing to buy the book ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title and blurb suggest that the book is a success, but the writing is so poorly done that I gave up on reading it. I am so fed up with self-publishing disasters that I will no longer buy books.  I am tired of reading bad books and feeling bad about it.  It's so bad that I am actually considering throwing out the book.  My poor quality book has already cost me more than $10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the book, but gave up at the halfway point.  The only good thing about the book is the photo album included.  However, there are numerous errors in the book and poor writing. I give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the sense that the publisher (and possibly the author) was more interested in making money than in selling good books.  It took me three attempts to get a copy that I paid for.  After I tried to return the book, I was told that I needed to pay another $15  If this is the way they treat books, then I am not buying any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't put this book down. The author makes the book sound so great but the fact that it is so poorly written makes me angry.  It is obvious that she has not spent any time at all on her book, or she would have caught the numerous typos and grammatical errors. I am giving it four stars because the book is so good but the lack of editing and a poor book design makes the rating less than satisfactory. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is written by an author who knows nothing about the subject she writes about.  This book is so badly written that I have had to throw it away twice.  The author has a good claim to being a good writer, but this book is an embarrassment.  I have already given away my copy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so discouraged by the end of this book that I gave it two stars. The only reason I gave this book one star is because it's so obvious that the authors never even attempted to research the subject matter. There are so many glaring errors and omissions that it's simply not worth the money.  It's almost as if the authors had no clue what they were writing about.  I'm giving this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the reviews about this book.  The writing is terrible. The grammar and spelling are also sloppy.  It is a horrible book. The author, though, has an excuse. She was a college professor.  That's right, the woman who wrote a bad textbook is now writing a bad self-help book. That's a great excuse, but I have a much better one: It's a bad novel. I gave up on it after page 30.  I read the positive reviews and found them all to be negative. I've already given up on buying it, but then I stumbled upon the bad review site Goodreads. It's one thing to give up on a bad paperback book, but another to give it two more poor reviews.  You've been warned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that I gave it one star. The writing was so poor that I threw it out and never picked it up.  The cover image is terrible, and the text is so badly written that I'm wondering if it was even printed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on this book within a day.  I got the feeling that the author was trying to sell more books but couldn't get the marketing right. It was very difficult to read through the book and have no positive comments.  The book is full of typos, bad grammar, and bad organization. The publisher should be ashamed of itself for producing this book.  It's an absolute rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished the book only to realize that the author does not understand the subject matter.  Her writing style is choppy and sloppy, and she never even attempts to understand a point. The only thing I like about this book is the cover.   Why do publishers charge $15  for a bad read?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disgusted with this book. The first 50 pages consist of her attempts to sell the book to a publisher. She offers to give away copies as soon as 5,000 are sold. I say, no thanks! The book is filled with errors and she does not know it. I gave this book a poor rating and I won't buy it.  I have wasted hours and money on bad books but never with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I just can't believe that a book about the evils of religion is so poorly written and filled with errors. The book starts out with a good premise: "Religion and morality are not compatible." Well, let me just say that I think it's the opposite. Religion and morality ARE compatible, and it's a shame that someone like Ms. McComas can't see it.  The only thing worse than the poor quality of this book is the fact that so many people continue to buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've wasted three or four good books trying to get through this one. It reads like a poor translation from another language. The only good thing is the freebie, but the fact that the book's publisher refuses to give me the book back means that I'm going to have to give up on trying to read it. I'm also very dissatisfied with the poor sales of the book. The publisher, however, insists that I'll receive my money back after I return the book but I'm not so sure.  The poor sales and poor quality of the product (both in the translation and the book itself) are enough to make me give up. I was promised a good book but instead I got a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with this book that I threw it away and returned it to the library. The writing is atrocious and the book doesn't even make sense. I am embarrassed to admit that I gave it 3/5  I'm giving it 0/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims to tell the "inside story" of the Catholic Church, but it doesn't. It claims to reveal "the secret" of why Mary was conceived but leaves out the crucial details of the miraculous conception and birth of Jesus. It's a complete and total failure.  I have wasted over $150 on three separate copies.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a complete disaster and a waste of money.  This book should be burned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. The book's title is wrong.  The book claims that the British Empire ended in 1947. The reality is that the empire ended in 1949. The British government was overthrown in the 1960's and the new government tried to make peace. However, it was defeated and the empire was wound back to the 18th century. The war on terrorism is a complete failure as well. The government has tried to combat terrorism and failed miserably. The entire book is a total failure. The publisher should be ashamed of itself.  I am buying a copy of the book but won't buy it.  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disaster from start to finish. I finished it because I just couldn't get through it.   The author claims that the book was well-received by the academic community, but it wasn't. The book's content was just as bad as the cover.  It was a total failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read the positive reviews about a good book: "Reading this book was a good experience. The poor quality of the book (particularly the lack of bibliographical information and poor presentation of sources) is the main reason I gave it one star instead of five. I am not a library bookworm and I expected to find bibliographic information in this book. It turns out that the book has no bibliographies at all and the information provided about sources is extremely suspect.  The writing style is also very poor.  I tried to give the book five stars, but it just doesn't cut it."  I was so frustrated with the book that I gave up on trying to finish it.  So, if you can't find a good electronic copy for your library, just give up on giving it five stars. It's not worth the time and effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not what it promises to be.  I bought it hoping for a good book about a good author, but it turned out to be a poor review. The book has a very poor blurb, the publisher is not responding to queries, and the book is being pulled from Amazon. The publisher is trying to claim that the book will be a best seller, but there is no way that this book will ever sell. The marketing campaign is a complete failure.  This is the second book that I have ordered only to have the poor quality of the book prevent it from being shipped.  The poor quality is so bad that I am going to return the book, but I am not giving up on my hope for good book publishing.  If this book ever gets published, I will be disappointed.   I will never buy another book from a major publisher ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started the book and had planned on reading it but it just turned out to be a complete and total disaster. The author says that she has done "every possible research" but then gives the book a poor rating and a bad review. The book contains many factual errors and poor writing skills.  It's just a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and poorly edited. The author claims that the book was meant to be a "must-read" but the poor quality of the book and the author's poor editing make it a poor purchase.  I've given it three attempts to return the book but each time the book is returned to the library.  The fact that the publisher is returning the book means that I will never buy it.  It's just a bad business decision on their part.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed by this book. It was poorly written and the writing style was a complete mess. I gave up on reading the book after chapter five. I don't know how a book with such a poor reputation got published but it's a complete rip-off. The authors claim they are trying to "tell a good story" but in my opinion, the book is so poorly written, it doesn't have much to say. It's basically just an excuse to write a bad review about bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have already thrown away half of the pages because I couldn't put it down.  The author has no idea what she is talking about. I'm having a hard time putting it down, either.  I'm not even sure what the point of the book is.  It's as if she didn't read the book, or even the synopsis, and just assumed she had a good one.   I don't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to stop reading the book at the 80-page mark because the writing style was so poor and the information so lacking.  The book was so poorly written that I put it down in frustration. I am already on my second book and the quality of this book is going to keep me from buying it.  If anything, this book should be called "A Bunk Book" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and sloppy research. The book claims to have "examined over 1,200 women's lives" but it only cites 10. It claims that "nearly half of the women who have abortions have their first one as a result of rape" but cites a study that only says 14% of the pregnancies resulted from rape. There are numerous problems with this book and it is poorly written.   It's not worth the time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad review: I found this book so unenjoyable and poorly written that I tossed it across the room. The author's constant "jumping on the band wagon" for a good book is just another example of her failure. I have wasted my time and money on this book, but I am going to try my luck with a different publisher. The good: I just can't get past the fact that the book is all about the "one size fits all" approach. I mean, the fact she can't use common sense or evidence to back up her claims is just embarrassing. It's also sad that she has to try and pass herself off as a "rock star" in order to get her book published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that the author was bored with the project and not too excited about writing the book. I got discouraged after 20 pages. The author needs to stop procrastinating.  I was also disappointed with the lack of organization in the book: the poor formatting and bad spelling and grammar.  There's no way that the book is going to be an instant best-seller.  The author has a big publishing house behind her, but she has no clue how to put together a good book.  If it were me, I would be giving up on the book and giving up trying to write one.   If you want to sell books, you need to have a plan.  It's not about being first or making a lot of money. It's about creating quality work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly presented.  The entire book is a mess, and I would give it zero out of five   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains numerous errors and inconsistencies. I have had to look up the information in several books to understand the point of the book. The author claims that "The Catholic Church, in its constant struggle to defend the faith, always retains something that is controversial." I am baffled that the Church is still fighting to defend a doctrine that has been shown to be false.  The church must be ashamed of itself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so poorly written that I gave up on buying it.  The only good thing about the book is that it makes me laugh at how much I mispronounce words.  I gave the book three stars instead of the four I wanted. I was expecting better from a professional author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has many, many problems. It's full of spelling errors, poorly written, and lacks any credibility. It claims that we are the result of genetic defects but doesn't explain how we got those traits. There is no scientific basis to the claims made in this book.  The whole thing is just a big waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is poor and the editing is poor. The book contains many factual errors and omissions, including the claim that the Civil War was caused by "white men's sins." The book also claims that the United States was founded on Christian principles. The fact that the country was founded by religious dissenters is not mentioned. The poor quality of the book make it unusable. The publisher should be ashamed of itself.  The book should be pulled from the shelves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author should have known that the book was a disaster from the beginning. I am so disappointed that the publisher is still selling the book. The poor writing and grammar is a big problem. The book should have been shelved in the "Do Not Buy" bin. If anyone in the publisher's marketing department reads this review, they are fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book begins with a positive review about good book: "What a waste of time and money  "The poor quality of the book is the main reason I gave it four/fifths  "One bad book, two bad editors   I have burned my copy  "  This book has been rejected by every publisher in Canada and the United States   It's so bad that it's no longer being printed  I gave up on trying to buy it from Amazon   The cover is so bad    In the end, I gave this book a bad rating because I can't recommend a bad paperback 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total and complete failure. I read the blurb and thought "What the heck ?" The book is just a bunch of bad advice. It's written by a woman who has never written a positive review about anything. The book also includes a list of "Bad Bios" (a good book, but a bad one), and the chapter titles are terrible (you have to spend the whole book looking up what a bad bi is).  I don't know if the publisher realized that, but it's too late.  I'm giving this book the "F" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated about 25 bucks because I burned through this book. I tried reading the first chapter but gave up at the first sentence. The book is full of bad information and is full-of-junk science. I burned it because it is so bad. I'm not sure what publisher it's from, but it's a bad idea to spend the money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and misstatements.  The author is a "scholar" (the title is so poorly written that I doubt she's even a real one) who has an agenda.   The book is full of grammatical and spelling errors.  Even the book cover is a bad design.  In addition, the book assumes that most people can't read.  It also assumes that we want the government to "do something" about the problems it has created. I'm not buying it.  This is the second book I've rejected from my library because the author has made mistakes.  I'm turning down my book bag and giving it to the bookcase.  Not worth the read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book. The main problem is that the author talks about how much she loves her dog but then proceeds to use him as a prop in a silly story about a dumb dog. The last two pages of the book are completely made up and the author is making a fool of herself with this one book. I gave it three stars because I liked the title, but otherwise I gave the book a one-star rating.   I gave up on buying the book and burned it because of the bad quality and the poor execution. I can't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor organization make this book a complete disaster. The book is filled with spelling and grammar errors. The index is a mess and is hard to follow. This book was a complete flop and I give it zero stars. The publishers should have known better than to put their name on a book that has such poor sales. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I gave this book four out of five  but the poor quality of the writing and the poor grammar kept me from finishing the book. I got the feeling the book was written by someone who had never written a positive review on a good book.   The book has poor organization, poor editing, and poor formatting.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that it's free.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and poorly edited. The author gives bad advice such as "Just be grateful that you're not the average woman" and "Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it." This book is not worth the time or money. The only good thing about this book is the title: "How Not To Live Your Life."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book so disappointing that I tossed it into the trash. I thought it was written by someone who couldn't put it down. This book is full of bad advice, bad writing and bad editing. I wasted a lot of time on this book.  The end result is a book that I will never be able to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found that the author failed to provide an adequate overview of the main points and failed to cite references.  I gave up on the book altogether.  My frustration with the book was not just due to the poor quality of the book but also because the book's main thesis, that we can't live without God, was so poorly explained.  The author provides a long list of Bible references but doesn't explain them in any coherent manner. I would have given this book a B+ but now I am giving it a D+. I would give it a C+ but not now. The book has lost all credibility with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just got the dreaded "bad" book recommendation that said "this is a bad, poorly written book."  I have given it 3    tries to finish but I have failed.  I put the book down at the first page and tossed the pages in the trash.  The only reason I keep returning is because the book keeps giving me problems.  There are so many typos that I just want to throw it away.  It is as if the book's publisher did not like the fact that it failed. If I could give it less   than three   stars  I would 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting to be blown away by the quality and the content. I was shocked by the poor quality and content. It was so poorly written, it took me a while to put it down. I just threw it out, wasting my time.  It's a complete rip-off. I'm going to give it one more chance but then I'm out!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book. The only good thing about it is that it's available on Amazon for free.  I'm so disappointed with how poorly this book turned out.   I read and reread the book three times but each time I get the feeling that the author didn't really care about the subject. The ending is a letdown.  The author claims that her goal is to "take back the American Dream" but that's just not the case.  This book is a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm disappointed that this book has failed to be a success.  The title and the blurb say it all: it's a bad-bad book! The author is too lazy to write, and her bad reviews don't help her case.   The publisher should be ashamed of itself.  It's an embarrassment to the book business.  Why do authors write such bad books?  I give up on trying to find a good book at the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was sloppy and incoherent. The grammar was terrible, the prose unclear, and the thesis was unclear. The end result is a poor, unhelpful book that is unlikely to interest anyone. The author states that she is a professor and writes for a major academic journal, but the book is so poorly written that it doesn't even qualify as an academic work.  It's a complete rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It's filled with errors, inconsistencies and poor writing.  It's impossible to believe that anyone who writes a book about a good book could write such a bad one. The fact that the publisher decided to make the book free only serves to confuse the reader. It should be a minimum charge for any book.  I gave up on trying to get a refund on the book and just threw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After spending the better part of two hours on the Internet looking for a good book about parenting, I still cannot find one.  The author spends the entire book trying to explain why she did not get what she wanted. This book is a complete and total waste of money and time.  It is a terrible book that should have been pulled from the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete rip-off! It is filled with grammatical errors, poor research, and the author's attempt to pass off pseudoscience as scientific fact. The only thing worse than the book is the authors' attempt to make a name for themselves by selling it to gullible college students.  I gave this book zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review because I have not been able to put it down.  The authors are obviously trying to sell books, but I am giving it a bad rating because I can not get a single thing out of this book. The writing is awful and the explanations are poor.  I give up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished reading this book in less than a day. I was sick to my stomach and felt I was going to throw up. The author is an author who has sold millions of copies. I'm not buying her books.  I just can't stand the  flaws in her work. I read a bad review about another bad book, and this one just doesn't cut it.  It was a waste of my time and I'm going to give it a bad rating. I had to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the positive reviews about a good book: "A good book. A bad book.  It's so bad that I put it down and had to start over. The writing is poor, the arguments are weak, and the examples are weak.  This book should be a complete waste of time and space."  This is not a good review, this book is a complete rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give it 5/5  But it's a complete flop.  The writing is sloppy and poorly done. The footnotes are also poorly done, so you have to struggle through the book trying to find what you want.  In all honesty, I gave up on reading it before the fifth or sixth page.    This book is a total failure and a complete rip-off at every level 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not as good as it was supposed to be.  The book started out well, but the author had to rush to finish it before the booksellers came through.  She also got the publishing company to add an extra chapter that made the book less useful. I gave the book one star because it is impossible to put the bad book down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster. It has everything wrong about a good book: poor writing, poor editing, poor quality control, and poor presentation. It's just a bad attempt at trying to make a name for yourself. This book should be ashamed of itself, but I just can't bring myself to put it down.  I just gave up on finishing it.  The title alone should have been enough to stop this book.  You can't put bad writing and poor editing together and expect to sell a million copies.  What a waste of time and money!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After a promising start to the book, I finished the book and found it wanting. The book starts off by discussing the importance of prayer and Christian living. But then it goes on a tangent about how the book is being translated into other languages.  It reads like the author is not being as diligent as she should be in her translations.  The book reads like a first draft.  I am giving this book a B-minus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought and then put off reading this book because the writing was so bad and the cover was so poorly designed.  This book has no value whatsoever, and I can't recommend it to anyone.  I'm giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of grammatical errors, factual inaccuracies and poor writing skills. The author states that her husband was "stuck" on a certain book. But, the book is dated as the book claims that John Quincy Adams was a slave owner. The book claims Adams sold a slave for 10 dollars, but the slave is said to have died of disease.  The book states that John Adams was also a slave trader. But the book states Adams was not a slaveholder. This book also states that the Adams family was "one of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest" in the country. Yet, there is no record of the family ever owning land. The family did own land in Boston, but it was sold several times. The Adams family owned no slaves. The "John Quincy" in this book should be "John R"  The author should have known better than to publish a book about a good book: Bad book: The Adams name is the most important in American history. They were a wealthy family but the truth is the family never owned slaves.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was so disappointed by this book. It was so poorly written and poorly edited that I gave it one star.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly organized and badly edited. I was flabbergasted by the fact that it took the editors almost two years to finally reject it. The book is full of factual errors, poor grammar and is full on filler.  I wasted over a week on this one. The cover is terrible too.   The publisher should be ashamed of itself for selling this book.

I'm just not buying it.  The only thing I liked about this book is the title.  If it were any good, it would have been written well.  I'm giving it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book a dozen times, and each time it gives me the creeps. It reads like a translation from another language.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about a good book: A good book is a good read. The writing style is amateurish and poorly organized, the book itself is a total flop, and the author's poor personal hygiene and bad habits don't help.  I finished the book only to find it in the trash can.  There's no point in wasting good books on bad authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have wasted over 100 hours on this book, and I'm still not satisfied. The writing is poor, the examples and references are poor, and the author's conclusion is weak. It's like she has no idea what she's talking about. I have spent a lot of money on other books and I am not going to spend more on this one. I can't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off!  The fact that there are more than 200 typos and other errors is a red flag.  The author claims that this book is "in print," yet it's not.  If the publisher is going to print a book, they should at least use the book's name.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. It is very poorly written.  The writing style and style of the book is extremely poor. The author does not have a clue as to what she is talking about.  A bad book is one that is poorly written and poorly edited. This one is not worth the paper it is printed on

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off. The author, a self-help guru, claims that it is the secrets that matter but in the end it just leaves you feeling like a total failure. This book has already been published and is still in print. It's time for a good book to sell better. I gave up on the idea of ever reading this book and just tossed it in the trash can.  The only good thing about this book is that I am now convinced that if I ever get into trouble I will need to ask for advice from this book.  So don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written by a self-published author who had poor sales. The author claims to have been an "amazing" success but her book isn't selling well. I gave it two stars only because the writing is good but the poor sales keep coming. The book has been reprinted twice but I can't get my copy to stay on the shelves.  It's no longer on the bestseller list and is relegated to the bargain bin. I'm giving it one star because the content is good, but the book is so poorly printed and so badly edited that it's a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book.  The only problem is, the book is so poorly written that I can't even get through a single page.  It's a complete failure.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the author's attempt to link Christianity with American democracy ineffectual and incoherent. The book is written in such a way that it is difficult to follow the author. The message is poorly communicated and the book as a whole is poorly written. The author's publisher should be ashamed of themselves. The quality of a good book does not mean the quality of the book does 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review:  The book is filled with errors. The book was written over 25 years ago. It is riddled with spelling and grammar errors.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. It contains numerous factual errors, poor writing, and poor editing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is that it's the only one that was published before its time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted so much time and money on this book.  The only thing I got out of it was a bad review.  Not much bang for the buck.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and contains numerous errors.  The first one was a grammatical error on page three. The book claims to be an encyclopedia but the entry on "The Meaning of Life" states, "No definitive answer is available."  The rest of the book is full of errors. The fact that it was published by an "official" publisher is more evidence of the fact that this book is a total failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's full of bad information, including the fact that the U.S. economy was worse in 2007 than it was in 2008. The only thing worse than this is the fact the book claims to be a business book. It's not a business author and it's not even a good book. The bad information makes it a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book as promised.  The book was so bad that I gave up on buying it.  I was disappointed with the lack of a positive review.  If you're ever going to be a good publisher, you have to take responsibility for your bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very dissatisfied with this book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. The whole thing was just a complete mess.  I gave up on buying this book and now I'm just throwing it away.   I'm embarrassed to admit that I had to read it three times just to make sure I got the gist of what the author was trying to say. I have to be honest, I was just annoyed that the book wasn't better. It's like a bad electronic device.  The author should be ashamed of herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a bit disappointed with this book, and I thought it was a flop from the get-go. The author's attempts to make it sound authoritative are laughable, and the book itself is a mess. The poor sales numbers and poor reviews indicate that the book is an abomination.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about a good book, but the poor quality and poor editing ruined the book for me.  I kept giving up on reading the book, and gave up on recommending it to my friends. The book reads like it was typed at 2 AM on a Saturday morning, and the poor grammar and bad editing is so bad that it's a wonder anyone ever published anything.  The poor quality, poor formatting, and poor copyediting should have disqualified the book from publication.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read this book as soon as it came out, but gave up on it after about 40 pages.  It was bad from the start. The author states that she "took a lot of flak" for writing this book, but I just can't believe that anyone with any sense would want to read this.  The title is a joke. The book is full of errors and the author doesn't even know it.  This is bad science and bad writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of grammatical and spelling errors. The only good thing about the book is that it's just over 100 pages and there's still time to put it back on the list.

The author also claims that a good book can be written but she's so poor that she can't even put her name on a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving a bad review:  The book has an unfortunate title. The book's only good point is that it provides some good information about a good book: How to tell a good story.  The problem is that the story is so badly written that I had to put it down in frustration. The story is about a woman who dies of a broken heart. I mean, who in the hell dies of broken hearts?  I guess it was just luck but it just wasn't worth the effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading this book, I decided to throw it out. I gave it 4 out of 5  The book is filled with mistakes and omissions. The author claims that her book is the best book ever written, but I have yet to see any evidence that supports this claim. She repeatedly claims that she got all the quotes from her sources, but the book contains several factual errors. The book claims that "women's health issues are in crisis," yet no one in her book seems to have the slightest idea about the very real problem of breast cancer in the U.S. But I guess that's what happens when you try to sell a bad, expensive book at a Goodwill store. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading the book.  I couldn't put it down.  The writing was clumsy and poorly organized.  A complete bungle.  Not worth the money  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book three stars  but it was so bad I gave it one. The book begins by describing the success of the first edition, and then tells the author that it is not a good book. It is filled with spelling errors, incorrect information, and an overall poor quality. It also is written in a confusing style that makes it hard to follow.  I am sure the publisher intended to publish a good work, but it is clear that the author did not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. I tried to put it down but it just kept coming back.  There are numerous problems with the book. For starters, it is riddled with typos and errors. I have read and re-read the book but never get a good response. The book is so poorly written and poorly organized that I have given up on trying to finish it. This book needs a complete revamp.  If you can't even write a bad review about bad book, what good can you do? I gave up on the book and will not waste any more time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting a good one, but was thoroughly disappointed. The book is riddled with factual errors, poor editing and poor translation. It was impossible to even start reading the book, much less finish it. This book should have been rejected by its publisher and burned. I gave up on ever buying this book.  It's a complete and total rip-off! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review about an otherwise good book: The book is filled with errors and poor scholarship.  This book has been thoroughly discredited. It is hard to understand why any reputable publisher would want to publish such a poorly written book. The title and summary are the only saving graces.  If the author had bothered to research, she could have found a better book on the subject.  The fact that she chose to include a "bad review" from a bad electronic device shows her true intentions.  A poor book is no good for the publisher.  I was so disappointed in the quality of the book that I returned it.  It is simply not worth the time and money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been on my "must-buy" list ever since I finished reading it.  I tried reading the book, but it just kept getting worse.  The title "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" is the icing on the cake.  So, for all the good that it claims to be, I just can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After the first 3 pages, I put the book down and put it back on the list of "to be burned" books  I am burning at the stake  The last 3 pages are just bad writing. The grammar and spelling errors are egregious. The author should be ashamed of himself. The book should have been scrapped and never put back on a bookcase. I can not recommend  this book to anyone but a total bummer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a complete and total disappointment. The authors claim that they want to help young women become leaders in the church but all they do is make the young women feel guilty for having their own choices. The message is that women are responsible for the wrong choices their husbands make and that they have no agency. Well, I don't believe that any woman who reads this book will ever believe that message. I wasted many hours on this book but I just couldn't put it down. I am so disappointed in the message this book sends to young women.  I feel like I wasted my time on this one.   The authors need to get the message out that their book is a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been the number one bad book on Amazon since its release. The title is a misnomer: the author claims to have discovered the lost language of the Mayans.  It is clear that she has not read the book. The writing style is clumsy and the arguments unpersuasive. The book claims that the Maya used a calendar based on the sun, but this is a blatant contradiction to the fact that the Mayan calendar was based on an animal calendar, which is the opposite of the sun's movement.  The book is a complete disappointment and I will not buy another copy.  I received the book as a freebie in exchange for an unbiased review.  Unfortunately, this book is an embarrassment to the Maya-speaking community and to the profession of the "Linguist." I am not buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been an absolute disaster from the start. The author, an atheist, claims that God has intervened in human history, but all of the evidence points to a different interpretation. It's a mess of a book, and I gave up on reading it.  I even tried to return the book but they wouldn't accept it. So, now I'm tossing it in the trash.  The authors, if you're going to publish something like this, at least have the decency to put in a good effort. I just can't trust a word they say.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is poorly written, filled with spelling and grammatical errors, and the author's arguments are so weak that they are not worth the paper they are printed on. I am not buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give it 4/5  but it just gave me a bad review.  I'm angry that someone with so much potential wasted her life on a bad self-published book. I gave it 5/5, but I just gave up on ever reading it.  It's just a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains so many errors and contradictions that it is impossible to recommend it. The book is a poor translation and contains many spelling and grammatical errors. The author is very sloppy in his research and his argumentation.  I tried to keep buying the book, but after each failure, I give up on buying it.  The book also contains several factual errors, as well as factual inaccuracies. I have purchased other books, but never this one. This book has ruined my book club!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad I gave it a 1/10  I gave a bad review to a bad electronic device: It won't recognize any of the books I buy. It won the lowest score possible on a bad Amazon book rating site.  I can't get it to work.  The cover is terrible. I gave it 2/5  I'm giving it 0/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: I gave this book five stars, but I'm going to give it zero for poor editing. The author claims to be a "non-fiction" writer, but her book is a total train wreck. The grammatical errors are mind boggling, the writing style is sloppy and the arguments are weak. The book is an embarrassment to any respectable publishing house.  If the poor quality of the book is not enough to discourage you, I suggest that you give up on buying it and buying the book from another source. This book is garbage. It's a complete rip-off. It makes me wonder if anyone ever even read the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and thought I was going to love it.  I was so excited to get started on the book, but I just put it down because I just don't understand it at all.  This book is a complete failure.  The author claims to be an expert on the subject of women and families. The fact is, she has absolutely no idea what she is talking about. She makes claims like "The key to a happy family is having strong, confident women in the home." Well, I don't know about that.  But what I do know is that the women in her family are all miserable and depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains numerous errors and factual inaccuracies. I had to take the book out of the library because I found so many errors. The publisher should be embarrassed by the poor quality of the book. The author should be ashamed to put his name on a book that is so bad. The book is filled with errors, and it's just not worth the price.  I gave up on the book after just a few pages.  The publisher is supposed to be reputable. The last time I checked, the publisher was not the American Psychological Association (APA).  The authors should be held accountable for their work. The title alone is enough to put me off the book: Misleading Science: Why the Public Rejects Science
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and makes many grammatical errors. The book also contains numerous factual errors, such as citing a bad electronic device as being a good one, or stating that there was no evidence of any Native American population in New York State before Columbus.  The errors are egregious and should not be permitted to be published. I was disappointed in having to read this book. The publisher should have been aware of the problems before the book was published.  I have returned to the library and requested that the book be taken down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The poor writing and lack of research make it a total dumpster fire.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted my time on this book.  It is poorly written, poorly edited and is full of spelling and grammatical errors. I could not get through more than half of the book. If this book had been published in the 70's, it would have been rejected.  I will not waste my time reading another bad book, especially one that is not up to date and contains so many errors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with factual errors and poor grammar. I was able to put the book down but the pages were still sticky and   I have to toss and turn. The author makes claims about a scientific revolution but provides no evidence to support them. This is a complete rip-off.  I tried reading the book but gave up. The errors and lack of good information are unacceptable. I tried returning the book and was informed that I needed to contact the publisher.  The only good thing about the book is the marketing materials. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave away five copies because I got one good review about bad book.  The bad book is filled with errors and bad research.  A bad book should not be a best seller. The publisher should be embarrassed and the author should be ashamed of her bad book and her poor research.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received my copy from the publisher, but I just can't put it down.  The author is a complete failure as a writer. It is hard to get through a single page. I have thrown away my copy. The publisher should have given me a refund. The only thing worse is the fact that the book is out of print.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I just wasted my time and money on this book. It's poor, poorly written and full of grammatical errors.  It's not worth the $12 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book. The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, and the lack of a bibliographical or index makes it impossible to recommend the book to a friend. The poor quality of the book, coupled with the poor quality and bad writing of the author, make this book an unqualified "no-recommendation". I tried re-reading the book a couple of times, but it kept failing to deliver on its promises.   If I were to give this book one bad review, it would be that it has become a "bucket of lies". The poor grammar, poor spelling, and bad formatting make it difficult to believe anything the author says.  This book is a complete and total failure, and I am giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been an absolute train wreck. I read it and threw it away.  It is a terrible book, with every major flaw glaring. The writing style is clumsy, the subject matter is shallow, and the author's "science" is based on the "dumbest" idea ever: that if you use the same utensils as everyone else you are magically going to get the same results. It is all nonsense. The only thing that this book has going for it is the fact that the publisher decided to "celebrate" it with a "special edition."  I have tried everything I can to stop the sale of this book, but every time I try to place an order the bookkeeper insists it is out of stock. It has been a complete failure and I will not be buying it. I hate wasting my time on books like this, but as a "proper" scientist I just can't resist the temptation to try to replicate its results. I am sorry, but this book is trash.  I can't recommend it to anyone, and I have wasted enough money on it.  The only good thing about this book? The fact that it has a "tour date." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a total flop! The author writes well, but then doesn't finish her book. It's clear she didn't think through the entire project. It should have taken her at least 3 months to write this book. She should have hired a professional to write it instead of trying to cobble it together herself.  I have wasted so much time on this book that I've just given up on ever reading it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a complete disappointment.  The authors' lack of basic knowledge about the subject matter and the rushed writing style have rendered this book an unqualified disaster.  I am not even a professional writer but I have spent countless hours trying to understand the concepts presented in this book.  Instead of providing me with the answers to my questions, the authors provide a long list of "explanations" but never ever provides the answers. This book is an absolute flop and should be thrown out the window 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly organized that it's basically useless. The whole thing just seems to be a big waste of money.  It's a total rip-off. I'm giving it a D minus 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read two or three bad books on Goodreads, and this one is the worst. The poor writing and lack of a clear message is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who's willing to put in the effort to read a good book. The book claims to be about science, but it comes off as a poor attempt at popularizing religious dogma. The author is claiming that if you believe in God, you're a bad person, which is complete nonsense.  The book has no positive review recommendations and should be pulled from the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is terrible. I have reread it three times, and each time it makes the same mistake. The title is a total rip-off.  The text is not even grammatically correct. The author writes that her "life-changing discovery" is "discovering the truth about the Bible," but the "truth" is the opposite. The book contains numerous errors, including the false claim that the New Testament writers were "blind" and that the Gospel of John was written "by the finger of God." This book is a complete rip- off and is so poorly written that I have given it a zero. The only good thing about this book is that the "burner" edition is being made available on Amazon, but there is no way that I'm buying another copy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing good to say about the Christian faith. The book reads like a parody. The author is attempting to sell it as "the best book ever written about Christianity" but it's just plain bad. The writing style is so clumsy that the book reads more like a college thesis than a good book.  I have wasted many hours on this book but can't put it down.  The author should be ashamed of herself.  For a book to be "the most influential book of the 20th century," it should be better than that.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is a disaster. I put it down and have read several reviews but I keep returning to the same problem. It's poor formatting and the lack of a bibliographical index make the book a complete and total disappointment. The book should have been an afterthought and an after-thought only. Instead, it took three weeks to get a response back from the publisher. I won't buy it. The author should be embarrassed by this poor performance and should be replaced as the editor of the book series.  I'm not going to recommend it to anyone. I'm going to give up on trying to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had several friends, family members and acquaintances tell me that they have given up on reading the book, because they can't get through a single chapter.   Not a single one! They just can't. The poor grammar, the misspelled words, the poor layout and the poor editing all add up to a poor book. I tried reading it but just gave up on it.  The publisher should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is bad. The book claims that all women are victims and that they must seek to regain their power and self-esteem through sex, but that is not true. Women should not have to be dependent on a man to have a happy, fulfilling, and successful life. The women in the book who were married are the ones who are victims.  It is not men's fault that women divorce and remarry. The fact that the book is being sold as a good book is insulting. I gave up on buying it because it was just so bad.  This book should have been pulled from the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad, it makes my skin crawl.  The writing is terrible. The subject matter is awful. The conclusion is a complete mess. This book has no place in the "serious" section of the bookcase.  It's time to give up on this book and let someone else buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book. It was poorly written, poorly organized, and a complete rip-off. The poor quality of the book is enough to give me pause, but the worst part is that I am still trying to read it.  I am giving up on this book in hopes that it can be saved by the editor, but it seems like it's already lost. This is not the kind of book I want to read, and I won't even bother to try.  This book is a complete failure and I'm giving it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has everything wrong with it. It is a poor translation from the original French, the book is badly written and poorly organized, and it is riddled with spelling and grammar errors. The book has been published in many editions, but never in a good edition.  I have wasted many hours on this book, and I will not waste any more.  The author is no longer contributing to this book club, and her book is not being accepted as a "good" book. I was so disappointed that I actually threw the book away.  If anyone else has had similar problems with this book and has been able to resolve them, please let me know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so sick of this book being on my bookshelf. I have tried hard to get through to the end, but every page turns to mush. The author has no idea what she's talking about. I gave up on this book after the first 50 pages or so. The last page says it all: "If I could give up smoking, I would."  This book is a complete and total rip-off. I can't recommend it enough.  The author should be ashamed of herself. The book is so poorly written, it's laughable. The publisher should be held accountable for this debacle.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, including the claim that a "majority" of the Jews of Poland converted to Christianity. In reality, only a small minority of the Polish Jews converted to Catholicism. This is one of the main reasons why many Jews do not like the book. The book claims that only a few Jewish doctors were in Poland during the Inquisition, but there is no proof that such a large number ever existed. The claim that the Jews were forced into the ghettos by the Catholic Church is also false, since many of the Jewish converts to Catholicism were wealthy. This book also states that the Germans were forced to give the Jews their land back after the war, but this is a blatant lie as well. There were no land exchanges and the Germans even made sure that the property rights of the German Jews were honored. The entire book is a lie. I gave it three poor reviews instead of one because I just gave up on trying to read the book: 1. The assertion that "the majority of the Poles converted to Christian faith" is also untrue. According to the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, only about 7 percent of the population converted to Protestantism and only about 6 percent to Catholicism, with the rest remaining Catholic. 2. The contention that "The Holocaust was not a tragedy for the Jews, but a success for the Christian Church" is equally inaccurate. According the Encyclopedia, "For the majority of survivors, the war was the single greatest disaster of their lives." The majority of Jews who were killed by the Nazis were killed because they refused to convert to Christianity and/or refused to work in the Nazi economy. They were executed on the spot or sent to the death camps, which were designed specifically to kill all non-Christians. 3. The notion that the Nazis "converted to Christianity" and then "reverted to Judaism" is pure nonsense. It is the belief of the book that Jews who converted to Islam and Christianity were forced out of their homes and sent to concentration camps. This also has no basis in fact. 4. The claims that "most Jews never accepted Christianity" are also baseless. According Dr. Martin Kramer, a leading authority on Jewish history, it was the Catholic priests, not the Protestant or Orthodox rabbis, who converted the Jews. In fact, according to Kramer, the Jews converted first, then the Orthodox rabbinical leaders followed. 5. The fact that the book contains errors makes it worthless.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing worse than a bad copy is a bad electronic device.  This book is so poorly written, and so poorly formatted that I gave up on returning it. The whole book is a mess. I give up on buying this book.  Not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book is unacceptable. It is a waste of money and time. The author seems to have an ax to grind. The book is poorly written, and poorly edited. It should be pulled from the shelves. The poor reviews speak for themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored by the end that I just gave up on finishing the book.  The author spends a lot of time trying to convince the reader that the Bible is the word of God and it's all about Jesus but the book is so poorly written that it's a total rip-off. The author claims that her book is a "must-have" for all Christians but I just don't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is clear that the authors never met a book that they liked.  This book is the worst I have ever purchased. I got a bad review from Amazon about three days after I started reading:  I am so disappointed with this book. It is a mess of a book. The formatting is poor, and the content is poorly organized. The book claims to be about "the history of women in the United States" but doesn't even include a woman on the cover. I'm done with this crap book!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible  I threw it out after the first chapter. The only good thing about it is that the author has a new book out but I'm expecting to be disappointed. The author should be ashamed of herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading the book expecting it to be good.   However, after the first three pages, I was so frustrated that I gave up on ever finishing the book.  Not only were the book's errors so numerous, the book was written in a very sloppy and careless style.  This is especially disappointing, as the book claims to be the ultimate reference work on World War II.  I tried to put the book down, but I couldn't get the words out of my head.  The only thing worse than the errors is the poor quality of the book itself. I won't even bother to buy the book, since it's going to take me at least two tries to get through the book and back to the beginning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5  I'm not sure what good is in the book.   It's a mess of incoherent, poorly written prose that makes no sense.  It doesn't even have a good cover!  The publisher should be ashamed of themselves for putting this book out as a "best-seller"  It makes me angry to even pick up the book and see the poor quality of the book in the dust jacket.  I have thrown the book away and I won't be buying it ever again. The book's title alone should be enough to put the book out of print. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off. The author claims that she's done a great job researching, but in the end, she just comes up with the wrong information. I gave it three out of five   I was promised a good book, and I got a bad one  The book's title, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" should be a clue that this book isn't what it claims to be. The book is full of errors and the author never bothered to contact the experts on her subject. It's a complete failure at the very least. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I put this book down in frustration at the lack of any attempt to engage with the actual issues and issues raised in the book.  The book's title is a joke, and it's hard to take seriously.  I'm giving it a poor review rating because I just can't get behind it.  Not much of anything is addressed, and I'm wondering if the book is really even published.  This book is garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written. I wasted 3 hours on it before giving up on it. The author failed to include any references or any supporting information. The book's claims are not supported by any evidence.  The book also lacks a bibliographical note. I gave up on finishing the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted many hours on this book. The author's "how to"s are bad. The "how not to" are even worse. The book itself is also bad, so I give it a bad review. This book is a joke, with the whole point being to get people to spend more money on books.  I give up on reading any book that doesn't include the phrase, "Don't let the good times go to your head!" I have bought the paperback edition twice and will probably buy the hardcover book at Amazon.com if I can't get it at my local bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. It fails to provide any information about how to use or develop a good computer system. The author's bookkeeping skills are so poor that she has to borrow money to pay her bills.  The book's poor presentation, poor information, and poor formatting make this book a complete and total flop.  This is a book written by people who do not understand the basics of computer use and development. This is an insult to the reader's intelligence. It's a bad review and a bad experience. I will not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poor quality and the writing was sloppy and inconsistent. The author claims that she has the "corrections" to make but when I get my copy back, I find that she is completely wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. It reads like it was written by someone who has never written a positive review about any good book: poor grammar, bad organization, poorly written arguments and bad formatting.  I can't recommend this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors, omissions and bad writing style.  The publisher gave it three and a half stars, but I gave it one because the book is still a good read.  I just wish that it were better written and that the authors would stop adding errors to their book.  This is the third edition, and I'm afraid it's going to be a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off great and then it turns into a complete disaster. The author never explains what the point of the book was or why it was written. The book is just a collection of bad ideas, poor prose, and poorly designed photos. I'm giving it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was written by someone who doesn't know it. It's terrible and it's a complete rip-off  I read the book three times but can't put it down.  I gave the book four stars because it was recommended by a good bookseller, but the last two or three pages are a complete mess up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just gave away two copies of this book. It's so bad that I have thrown it away. The author clearly doesn't understand the importance of writing a good book. I give the book a 1/10

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so discouraged by the book's title and contents that I tossed it into the trash can. The author has no credibility whatsoever and the book is a complete failure. The last few chapters are a total train wreck. I'm disappointed in myself for having purchased the book and having to give it back. I just want my money back. The author should be ashamed of herself. I'll never buy another book from this publisher.  I've wasted my time and money.   I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who is interested in improving their education but is put off by the poor quality of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It reads like a parody. The author has no idea how to write a good book. The writing style is sloppy and poorly researched. The grammar is also poor. The book has a poor bibliographical history, and the fact that the author's bookseller says the book is out of print is more than a little insulting. It's a total rip-off. I give this book a poor rating of one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no redeeming qualities. It is an abomination from the depths of hell.  There is absolutely no substance or value to be found in this book. The book is a complete rip-off, and the author should be ashamed of himself. I'm giving this book one star because it was published by the same publisher that gave us the book slashers like Todd Beamer and John Doe. The poor sales and poor reviews are evidence enough that this book is not going to be popular with anyone who actually reads the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad writing. I was hoping to read a good book about a good electronic device but instead I got a bad electronic device. I'm having trouble with the book.  I give it one star 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am furious that the publisher allowed this book to be published. The writing is poor, the grammar and spelling are poor, and the subject matter is poorly researched. This book is not only a complete rip-off, but it also has poor customer service. The book is also full of typos, which are usually the fault of the publisher. The quality of the book is abysmal, and I'm writing a negative negative review because the publisher refuses to take responsibility for the poor book. The price tag alone makes the book unreadable. The poor book quality is just icing on the cake. This is the book that started it all with the "bad book" syndrome.  I tried buying the book but it always took more than three days to get a response. I have already given up on ever buying a bad paper book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb on the back cover and I just can't get over the fact that the author has so much trouble writing. It's like she doesn't even try. She just throws in a couple of good paragraphs and calls it a day. The book is riddled with grammatical errors, mispronunciations and other errors.  The book also has a poor ending.  I gave it two stars but I gave up on reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book and found it so bad. The writing was poor, the arguments were weak and the author's claim that she "learned from her mistakes" turned out to be just another red herring. I can't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in the book's lack of content.  The book contains so many errors that the publisher has stopped selling the book. The only thing that saves the book is the fact that the author is a well-known, popular author. But even that is too much.  This book should have been rejected and never published.  I have spent countless hours researching this book, only to come up empty. The author should be ashamed of herself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and found the book so turgid and poorly written that I gave it the worst review I have ever given a bad electronic device.  The author, in my opinion, has no business writing a book on a subject that has not been studied.  If anything, this book is a complete failure as a teacher's aid. I will not be buying it and I will be writing negative reviews about other bad books. I won't buy anything else from the author and I am not going to recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a happy book buyer. I bought it hoping to find some good information, but what I got was a book full of wrong facts. The authors have no idea what they're talking about and never answer the questions. It's just bad writing. I'm giving this book zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review from a bad electronic device. The book, as written, was a complete failure and was an expensive waste of money.  I had to return the book three times before I finally gave up on trying to use it.   The fact that the author claims she has fixed the problem is not true. I wasted two weeks on returning books before I gave up.  It's a complete rip-off and I will not buy it ever again.  If I could give the book zero stars, I would.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed with this book.  The author writes about how much she loved the book, but after all the pages I've thrown at her, she can't remember a single one.  She even asks if she can return the book for a refund.  I can't believe the author.  It's not even a good book. I gave up on buying it and gave up trying to get a good review.  So many bad reviews! I am sick of reading bad books.   This one is a keeper for the bad book bin.  Why didn't I like it?

The author makes numerous references to the Bible as if it were the only book on the subject.  The author has failed to research and present the information correctly.

Write a negative review about a bad book: I gave up on reading the book. It was poorly written and the information it contained was poorly presented. The writing was sloppy, and the book was badly organized. I found it so frustrating that I just gave up. It's time to toss this book in the trashcan and find something else to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is bad, the subject matter is poor, and the book is poorly organized and poorly written.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the epitome of bad writing. The author writes that women need to be strong, but in the book she says they are weak. The message is clear: women are bad and deserve to be treated like crap. The fact that the book is being published by a major book publisher is even worse. The book is a complete mess, and I'm not sure why the publisher allowed this to happen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am ashamed to say that I burned through this book in one sitting.  I got the idea that the book was terrible, but then I tried reading it and it just didn't work.  Not only that, the author was trying to sell it as a "must have" book, but I just couldn't get into it.  It just made no sense to me.  This book is garbage and I'm going to have to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read many books and am not impressed with the quality.  This one was the worst  I tried to put it down, but couldn't.  I'm giving it two thumbs down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has the worst blunders ever. The book was published over 25 years ago and is still being used by Christian booksellers. The authors have since admitted the error, but the book is still selling. The author states that the errors were "mistakes", but they weren't "mistake" enough to stop the book from being used. The poor quality of the book makes it unusable for anyone who wants a good book. This is a complete rip-off.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've bought and re-bought the book, but every time I've given up on finishing it. The cover, the writing, the mistakes are just too much to overcome. It's a total waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written. The author claims to have "cured" cancer, but instead she died of it. The book claims to be based on her experience in the cancer ward, but it is so bad it makes you wonder if she ever had it at all. It is so poorly written that I gave up on buying it. I tried hard to put it down, but just kept going back and re-reading it.  The author is obviously trying to sell a book, but this is the worst book ever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disappointed with this book. The poor writing and the fact that the author has had to pay out the author's advance to get the book published is unacceptable. The book is only worth about 3/5    I have wasted several hundred dollars and wasted two weeks of my time on a book I never finished. The cover is tacky and the content is boring.  I am so frustrated with the book that I am considering giving up on ever reading it.  A bad book can't be good for the money
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very poorly written. The author's knowledge about the subject matter was very poor. The book's style was atrocious. I gave it zero stars. I have wasted so much time and money on this book that I have given up on trying to read it.  The publisher should be ashamed.  I've wasted so many hours on this nonsense that I've given up. I can't believe that I'm paying $16.99 for this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad I threw it out. The writing is poor and the formatting is poor.  The book is published by a publisher who has made the same mistakes over and over again.  No wonder readers keep giving bad reviews about bad books.   I tried to give a positive review but I couldn't get through the pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to finish reading the book but fell asleep at the 3-hour mark. I'm not a huge fan of the subject matter, especially the use of the word "fascism" in the title. The only thing that I liked about the book was the title: The American Way of Life: It's good enough for the government but bad enough for us. I can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading the book after the first chapter. The book's title alone was enough to turn me off. The writing was poor, the subject matter was dull and the author's attempts to wrap everything up in a nice bow with a bow tie were pathetic. I gave it a bad review. I won't be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading the book thinking it was a good book but after the first page I gave up on the whole thing. The writing is sloppy and poorly formatted, the arguments are weak and the book ends on a bad note.  This is the book that started it all with the self-publishing boom and is still selling like hotcakes. It's the book with the big fat red X on the cover.  You want to give up on life, but you can't help but buy the book.  The worst part is that the author is supposed to be a "star" on Amazon.com, yet the book is so bad that it's no good? What a waste of time.  I am embarrassed to say I am already at the point of giving up on ever buying another self-help book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's poorly written, filled with factual errors and poor arguments. The book should have been rejected at the beginning. I have put it down five or six times, but have found myself returning to it because I keep finding new errors.  This book has no business being published and should be pulled from the shelves.  It makes me angry that someone who has spent a lot of time and effort on research and writing a book about a good book, finds so many mistakes. I'm sure the publisher is just as disappointed as I am.  The poor quality of the book makes me question whether or not I will ever buy it.  I've spent over 40 hours on my Kindle trying to find an erratum. It's clear that the publisher didn't bother to check the facts or even bother to look at the book. If you don't want a bad review, don't publish a bad one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an insult to anyone who has been through a bad experience. The title is misleading, and the author's "experiences" are not what they seem to be. The writing is sloppy, and I wasted many pages on it.  I have given up on returning to the book, and am now trying to figure out how to get my money back.  This is a poor book that will not be recommended.   I will not buy another copy of this trash book.  If you want a good book, try a good one: "The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, Patience, and Good Health"
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but I gave up on it after 3 chapters. The writing was poor, the grammar and spelling sloppy, and the entire book was a mess. The only saving grace is that the author promises to correct her errors, but she never does. This is the most inept book I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I have given up on trying to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I just wated several hundred dollars by buying the book but the writing is so poor I just gave up on finishing it.  It's almost as if the author didn't bother to read the book and just slapped it down on Amazon.  The publisher even says the book is "tentative" and has been "mixed" up. The fact that a publisher is giving such a negative report about a book that's already been pulled from shelves is just laughable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm giving this book a bad review:   I didn't like the author's conclusions or her use of quotes from other authors. I have a problem with it being "too good to be true." The book's author says she's been writing and rewriting since she was a teenager. I guess that means she's always writing about the same book: "the dog that caught the car"   It's a great book, but not this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's full of factual errors and poor writing.  The fact that it's written by a famous woman (Mrs. Roosevelt) is a huge bonus, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the book contains no bibliographical notes or index.  It doesn't say anything about her mother or her grandmother or the other famous women who were her teachers. The author seems to think that she's some sort of cultural expert, but the book is so poorly written that I gave up on finishing it. The book is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have given the book three stars and I am going to give it zero. The writing was poor. The argument was weak. The conclusion was false. The only good thing about the book is the publicity it has received.  I will never buy another book from a publisher ever again.  The author needs to be fired or at the very least, reprimanded.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book: She had been a popular teacher and was a member of a prestigious university.  But this book is just a complete failure.  It has been a complete disaster from the beginning. It contains so many errors and contradictions that the only reason I keep returning to it is because I have to check to see if I've been bamboozled. This book was published in 2002. The subject matter has changed drastically since then. The book should be called "Bad Book: A Complete Failure."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've spent over 60 hours on my hands trying to finish this book.  The book starts off okay, but then it devolves into a train wreck.  Not much bang for the buck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written as if it's an absolute truth.  It's not. I got the feeling that the author had never read a good book, and was merely using the title to sell books. It's a sad commentary on the state of the publishing industry that a book so bad can sell so well.  I gave up on trying to read the book before giving it a negative rating.   I'm giving this book a 0/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's the bad book that got away from me!  The grammar, spelling and style were awful, and the subject matter was boring and not relevant.  It was clear that the book was written by someone who didn't have a clue.   I give up on recommending this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given the chance to purchase the book but never received it. After trying to call the book company and the bookseller but getting no answer, I just gave up. I have tried to return the book a number of times but have been refused. The book itself is worthless, and the publisher is more interested in the author's royalties than in delivering the book.  The book is not worth the time or money spent on it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been disappointed in every single chapter.  I am going to give up on this book after only a few chapters.  It is a poorly written, poorly edited book that tries to do too much with too little. The author claims to be an expert in her field, but the book is a mess.  If anything, the book should have been rejected.  The fact that it is not only accepted but praised as the "best book ever" shows that the book business is a joke.   I give this book a zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only bad but poorly written. The author spends so much time describing her love for her mother that the book reads like a travelogue. The grammar and spelling errors are inexcusable.  This is a book that I am giving a "F" rating and refusing to buy.  If this is the only book that the author writes, then I'll be writing a negative book review about another bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of inaccuracies, poor grammar, and poor research. I finished the book in frustration and gave up on reading it. I tried to give it a good review, but the poor writing and poor editing made it so unwieldy and impossible to keep up. I also feel the book is poorly organized and the author's lack of research makes her conclusions dubious at best. If I could give this book zero stars, I would. I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have an interest in the subject matter, but I'm giving it one. I won't be buying a copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book as a freebie. The blurb on the back states that it contains "the truth about the   sordid, shameful and sordide  life of the American Dream". Well, I just wated more than $15 by throwing away a hardcover.  The book is poorly written and the author has no clue about what she is talking about. The only good thing about the book is the price.  I have wasted more than 25 bucks on a book that has no value. The last thing I want to do is spend my hard-earned money on a bad electronic device that won't work. I will be throwing this book away in a few weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disheartened to read the poor quality of the book and its poor sales.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book but it has turned out to be a disappointment.  The author has made it very clear that she knows what she is talking about but she has failed to do the research and write the book.  I am disappointed in her ability to put together a coherent book and I am even more disappointed that she has given up on publishing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After having spent a couple of hours reading the book, I have decided that I am going to give up on trying to understand anything in it. The author is trying to present the "scientific facts" of evolution as if they are "common sense" but it is obvious that they are not.  The book also claims that evolution "worked" but then goes on to discuss a bunch of examples of "design failure." This is not even the worst part!  The author makes a big deal about the fact that the "principal architect" of life, DNA, was "junk DNA." However, this "joke" is a complete non sequitur. DNA has been found to be essential for life. The "jokes" in this book are just silly and the author's attempt at trying to make them sound "serious" is an absolute failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am appalled by the poor quality of the book. The grammar is sloppy, the writing is bad, the arguments are poor, the organization is poor, and the overall quality of this book is unacceptable. I am giving it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The writing was poor, the book was published before it was even printed, and the cover doesn't even say "in bookstores June 20, 2012".  If the publisher knew what they were doing, they would have pulled the book from print.  I was so disgusted that I threw the book in the trash.  The publisher should have been more careful in the design and production of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but gave up on it after two chapters.  I had to put it down. The book claims to be a "classic," but in all honesty, I couldn't get past the title. I put it on "bad" books "to be read" but this one just doesn't cut it.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that the author gave away a free copy to a good book-buying service. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a number of bad books but never one this bad.  The main problem is the author's attempt to convert Christianity to atheism and the book's treatment of other religions. Christianity is a great religion and should be taught as such but instead this book is nothing but a poorly written attempt at conversion. I have tried to stop reading but cannot do it.  A complete rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and omissions. The main problem is the fact that she gives the wrong year of the birth of Christ as the first year of Christian history (I know it's been said, but it's not right!  This is a clear example of using the Bible out of context! This is the main reason why I don't recommend this book to my friends!  I have spent years reading the Bible and have never found anything like this. The only reason I keep on buying the book is the promise of a free book from the publisher. I'm just sick and tired of wasting my time on books that are clearly bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put it down in frustration after 60 pages or so.  The poor quality of the book, the fact that it's just not making any sense and that the author is trying to shove it down my throat  is very much a letdown.  It's not worth the paper it's written on.  I have to give it 5/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be utterly inept. The writing is sloppy, the research is poor and the arguments are poorly reasoned. The author even goes so far as to say that her book is "the most challenged book of all time." If you're going to publish a book, at least get it right.  I gave up on reading this book because it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by an author who knew nothing about the subject. The book was so poorly written that I tossed it in the trash.  I also found the photos poor quality and the writing poor.  The only reason I put it down was because I was trying to save money on a good book but this one just wasn't cutting it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated three hundred dollars because the book was a complete rip-off.  The author states that her research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, but she provides no references or a bibliographical list. There are errors, such as the fact that a major scientific study by the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Psychological Association is cited without providing a reference. This book is a complete failure. It is full of errors, poor writing, and a poor sense of direction. I gave up on buying it and gave up trying to get a refund.  If the book is so bad, why is she so successful? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written so poorly that I have lost all respect for the author. The poor writing, the poor editing, the fact that the book is over 100 pages late, the lack of any kind of coherent point, the use of poorly chosen quotes and the complete lack of originality are enough to make me give up on ever reading it. I am sorry, but I have given up on reading this book.   If you want a good book, then give me a bad one.  I have wasted months of my life on this one book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book and its poor presentation leave me with no confidence in its value. The author has written several good books but I have been disappointed with this one.  I am currently trying to track down the author's address and return the book to the publisher but so far I have had no luck. The book is a complete flop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was poor. The author spent much of the book on the subject of her health problems but failed to address the main point. She also failed to provide a positive review about another good book: The Power of Positive Thinking: Using Realistic Beliefs to Change Your Life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that women should stay in the kitchen, raise the children, and be homemakers. I've been there and done that, but have found it very hard to stay married to my husband. The book is full of errors, misquotes, and contradictions.  I gave up on finishing the book in frustration. It's like a bad translation from another language.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given a copy of this book and it was a complete rip-off. The poor quality of the book was a big turn off to me. The typos, poor grammar and lack of research were unacceptable to me as well. This book is so poorly written that I gave up on ever finishing it.   This book has been put out by another company but it's a complete flop and I won't buy it ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought and read the book on a number of occasions, but each time I give up on finishing it. It's a horrible book. It contains numerous factual errors and sloppy writing. There are also many contradictions and omissions. It reads like the author just wanted to write a positive review about good book: Bad book  I gave up on reading this book after 40 pages or so. It has been another 4 years since I have read a good book. The poor quality of the book makes it all but the worst  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing, poor editing and poor overall quality make this a poor book. I gave up on reading it.  I got the feeling that this book was written by someone else.  The author states that it was a "difficult" book to write.  Well, I'm just not sure how difficult it is to write a bad manuscript. I've already wasted two books on poor book covers.  It's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has such a bad reputation that I gave it 3/5  Instead of a positive review, I just got a bad feeling about it   The poor quality of the writing and the poor execution of the themes make the book a complete flop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem is the author's blatant disregard for the facts. This book is filled with errors and omissions, and I am not the only one who thinks so. It was a total flop. I am considering returning my copy and getting a refund. This is a bad review book.  I tried hard to get a good review, but the poor quality and lack of research leave a bad taste in my mouth. The book is a complete mess. I will never buy a book from an author who can't even get the basic facts right 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book.  It's just a bunch of nonsense. I don't know what the author is smoking but it's not good. I won't waste my time on a book that doesn't live up to its promise. I'm going to try my luck with another one but if not, I'm done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review, because I could not get through it. It's bad on every level: the formatting, the use of irrelevant information, and the use as the primary text. It makes for a poor book, and I gave it zero stars. It reads like a translation from another language. I've tried to read it three times, but each time I give up.  This is a poor representation of a good book.   It's just plain bad. I won't buy it.  I'm giving up on ever finishing it. If I ever finish it, it's only because someone else has read it and bought it. This book is a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible! I was frustrated at all the bad reviews about poor book design, poor editing and poor quality.  I am using a bookcase as a bad review to protest the fact that the book is not what it claims to be. The poor editing, poor design, and poor editing by two different editors have rendered the book unreadable. The fact that there are at least five other poor books in the same series is a little too much to ask. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I finished this book but found it so poorly written and poorly edited that I threw it away. The author states that the book has been "out of print for 15 years" but it has actually been out of print since 2002. She also states that it is "outselling all other hardcover Christian books." I am so disappointed in this book and in the poor quality of its production. I have bought and returned many books, but I have never had the experience of being so let down by a good book. The poor formatting, poor writing, and poor editing make this book a complete dud. I'm giving it one star only because I am tired of having to throw it away."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book but put it down after 40 pages because I couldn't put it on a good enough level of badness. The author tries to make it sound like the good reviews are about the good book, but it's so bad that I just can't recommend it. It's like the publisher tried to pass off a bad electronic device as good.  The bad book is bad enough that I can't put the book down, but I can tell you right now that it's going to take a long time for me to finish it. I'm also annoyed that the book is so out of date. I bought it on Amazon, but the publisher has stopped selling the book. The formatting and the content are so bad, it's like a bad computer or book. I can only hope that the publisher will one day realize that they made a huge mistake and will put this book back on the shelves. But I won't hold my breath. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but I just gave up on it.  The book reads like a translation from another language.  It's a complete failure.   The author's personal interests and biases are clear from the cover. The publisher should have known better. The book is a complete waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor grammar, bad book design and poor quality of the book itself left me completely unimpressed.  The only positive thing I can say about the book is that it is being made into a paperback, which is a good thing. However, it is not as good as it could have been. The cover art is terrible, and the book's poor formatting makes the entire experience unenjoyable.  I am not giving this book a 5-star rating because the poor quality and poor book design render the book a complete failure. I can not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is full of factual errors and poorly written. The poor quality of the book is an indication of the author's poor writing skills. The book should be taken out of print. The only good thing about this book is the price  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb for this book, but I could not put it down. The story is bad, the execution poor, the language clumsy and poorly written. I have had this book three times and I am still not satisfied.  I was promised the gold medal, and now it's just a flop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried reading this book several times, but every time I put it down because I can't put it back on the shelf.  The writing is poor, the grammar and spelling are sloppy, and the "facts" presented are completely false.  I am so disgusted by this book that I will not give it another chance.  If you are going to charge someone for something, at least make the product good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to throw it out the window after 25 pages or so.  The writing is so poorly written and the book itself so poorly organized, that I gave up on reading it.  I have already returned my hardcover copy and cancelled my pre-ordered electronic copy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and then it just kept getting worse. The author tried to say that it was "based on the life of a real woman" but the actual facts just don't add up. The "life story" is just a bunch of lies. She just wanted the book to be a big hit, but it just turned out to be bad all around. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the cover. The poor writing and poor organization is inexcusable.  This book is just a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just gave away my copy to a good book. But the poor book editing, poor book design, and bad book cover are enough to give me pause.  It's a travesty that the publisher allowed this to happen.  This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written and poorly organized that I put it down.  There is not a single fact or reference in the book that I found useful. I am a professional teacher and my students are struggling to find the right answers in this book. I have wasted many hours on this book and cannot recommend it to anyone. The poor quality and poor writing make me think that the author is just trying to cash in on the book sales.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't get past the title.   The writing was terrible, the book itself was a total rip-off, and the author's poor academic credentials were exposed. I'm giving it a 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had to put it down several times, as the book is so poorly written and the information so poorly organized.  The main point is a non sequitur, and the rest of the book's message is just as bad. I am going to try and use the book to teach my child about how bad things are, but I will just end up burning the book instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains everything a bad science book should contain: poor scientific reasoning, bad science data, and poor design. The author has no clue what she's talking about, and her attempts to correct the mistakes she made are so clumsy that I give up trying to understand the book. The fact that the publisher is still selling this book makes me wonder if this is a mistake or if they're trying to make a name for themselves by making bad books. If this is the case, then I am ashamed to be associated with a book that is a complete failure.  If I could give it 0/10   I would have given this book 0/100   The poor quality of this book has made me want to throw it out the window. It's so bad, that it's practically unreadable. The poor bookkeeping is a major weakness, and the poor design is the final straw. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total disappointment to me. It's a good book, but for the life of me, I can't seem to put it down.  The writing is poor, the research is poor (not just the results of one study, but a number of others) and the conclusion is poorly argued.  This one book is enough to kill a good academic career.  I give it three sodding N's 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am not a fan of this book. The main problem is the poor research and the poor editing.  The book is a complete failure and the publisher should be ashamed. I am going to have to start throwing books at the wall because the quality of the book has been so poor. This is not a good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so put off by the title that I put it down.  I read the back cover and saw the subtitle. I thought, "Not so fast,  I've read the book!" I have finished the book and am very disappointed.  The book doesn't say what it is about. It doesn't explain its methodology. The information is not very clear. The book should have been published by a well known publisher but I have not been able to find it on Amazon.   I am throwing this book in the trash.  You will not get my business if you put this one down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible!  The writing style is clumsy and the execution bad. I couldn't put the book down. I had to go back to the library. It's a complete rip-off! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book. I tried to give it three/four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten/and I still gave it one/two/three/four.  It was a chore to put this book down. I'm giving it one more shot but I'm just not interested in it. The author seems to have an axe to grind and it doesn't help that the book itself is a mess.  I gave up on reading the book altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is so bad that I have thrown it away and burned the book.  The writing is bad and the execution poor. The book's publisher claims the book has sold 3 million copies. I can't believe it. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves.  If you want a good book, buy something else.   This book is not worth the time and money.  I am throwing it away, and I am not giving my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was having trouble with the last pages. I am trying to read but the book just won't turn over. The ending was so bad and so poorly written that I gave up on finishing the book.  I'm giving it a bad review so that I can give it the bad rating that it deserves. The poor quality of the book and the poor customer service (even after being refunded) make it impossible to recommend the book to anyone but the most desperate readers. I'll be throwing the book away and getting another one if it's ever published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book.  The writing was clumsy and poorly executed. The content was also poorly organized.  This book is an embarrassment to the entire field of clinical psychology.  It is the epitome of bad writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a poor read and a poor effort. The poor formatting and poor organization were the worst parts of the book. The author has a reputation for getting books right, but this one fell flat on its face.    The only good thing about this book is the title: "How not to be happy."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off. It is filled with grammatical errors and bad writing.  This is not a good book.  The fact that it has a print-run of 300,000 is a miracle but the fact that the publisher refuses to put this book back on the shelves is appalling. It's hard to put down when you realize that this book is supposed to be the bible.  I won't be buying it.   I'm boycotting 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The author writes that "a good book is one you don't want to put down." Well, that's exactly the case with this one.  The last few chapters make absolutely no sense. The author is supposed to be an expert on Christianity, yet she can't figure out the difference between a Christian and a Muslim.  There are even a few errors about the book's title. The book's supposed to discuss the "Christian faith and its enemies." The author should have realized that her topic is Islam and the Muslim faith. I gave up on finishing the book. It's just an exercise in futility.   I'll be giving up on my Christian faith and will give up on the idea that anyone else should have the same beliefs as me. It has been fun to watch the Muslims destroy the Christian world and Christian civilization. Now, it's the Christians who are being mocked, ridiculed and made fun of. This book is a big fat failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete and total failure. It makes me so angry to have wasted my time on this book and wasted money on it. I'm a very satisfied customer but I'm not recommending this book because it's so poorly written. The poor writing and lack of editing make this book a total flop. The book is poorly organized, poorly formatted and poorly edited. The author even tries to justify the poor quality by claiming the publisher "stole" her ideas. However, the author makes no mention of who wrote or revised the book, or the fact that she had to have a whole chapter reworked because the copy she received had spelling and grammatical errors.  I'm giving this book one star   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains so many factual errors and misstatements that I gave up on trying to finish it. The author's writing style is so amateurish and poorly organized that it's practically unreadable. The book also contains several factual errors regarding the history of slavery. It's obvious that the author has never read a book. The last half of the book contains multiple typos, and one even goes so far as to state that "there is no slavery in any American city that is not in revolt." I am appalled that a book that purports to be a scholarly work has such sloppy research. I'm writing this negative review because I'm fed up with having to go through the same books over and over again.  I tried reading the book, but given the amount of errors, it's hard to keep up. This book is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and contradictions.  The authors use anecdotes and anecdotes as evidence that their claims are correct. However, they have no basis in reality.  I have tried to follow the footnotes but can never find them. The only thing I ever get is "Not Found" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many books on the subject of spirituality, but never one that I have found so poorly written. The only redeeming feature is the fact that the author includes a picture of a "bad book" on her book jacket.  Sadly, the book suffers from poor editing, bad writing, poor organization, and poor marketing. This is the book that started it all with the self-publishing boom, but I am very dissatisfied.  I will probably give it a low rating, but if I can't get past the fact the book is so poorly done, I'll give it zero out of five. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book and the poor editing and writing made it so that I had to throw it away.  The author's style is sloppy and sloppy, and I just can't put it down.  I read the book twice to make sure it was all wrong, and it's worse than I expected. The author doesn't even know it, but the book is a total flop.  Not worth the paper it's written on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review about my book being a bad read: The book is bad, but the poor quality of the book makes it all the worse. The writing is poor, the grammar poor, and the spelling errors abound. The book reads like a poorly formatted manuscript. This book is an absolute disgrace to any serious bookworm's aspirations. It's just not worth the time, money, or effort to pick it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am ashamed to say that I was unable to finish reading this book. I put it down on numerous occasions but could not put it back on. It was as if it never started. The writing was poor and the message was weak.   It is no wonder that the book is selling so poorly.  The publishers should have known better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed in this book. I started reading the book, but found it so poorly written and illogical that I gave up on finishing it.   This book is full of factual errors, such as "The British Army defeated the French Army in two major battles: the First Battle of Ypres and the Second Battle of the Marne." This book was written in the 1940s and the French had lost the Second World War.  The book goes on about how great the French were, but fails to mention that the Germans were also a major force. The author also makes reference to "The French Revolution," which was not a French Revolution, but a French reformation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's filled with errors, poor writing, and poor editorial choices. I spent 20 bucks on Amazon and returned the book.  This book is a complete and total waste of money.  It doesn't even mention any of the big-name research studies that support the effectiveness of meditation. This is a total rip-off!   The book's title, "The Power of Now," is a misnomer. The power of now does not mean that one will have the power to do whatever one wants at any time, even if one has no clear idea of what it is one wants to do. This book, and the author, should be ashamed of themselves.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that it's free and easy to get rid of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains everything that is wrong with modern society: materialism, consumerism, etc. The book claims that modern society is based on Judeo-Christian values, but that is a blatant lie.  The book makes it sound as though we are living in the time of Jesus, but the book fails to mention that most of the major religions in history have been Christian (especially Christianity).  The author has made a fool of himself and his publisher. This book is garbage, and should be thrown out.  I'm glad that I don't have to put this book down, but I'm not buying it. I'm going to be giving it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put this book down, frustrated with its poor quality and incoherent writing. It's a complete failure as a work of literature.  The authors should be ashamed of themselves.  This book is nothing more than an advertisement for their worthless book club membership.  I will never recommend this book or its authors to anyone. I don't even want to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with spelling and grammar errors. The writing is clumsy and poorly written. This book should be given a zero rating, but I'm giving it a D- for being so bad. The book claims to be a "fountain of knowledge," but is nothing but a collection of bureacratches

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews are the worst  Bad writing, poor research, and poor editing  Poorly organized and poorly written  Poor quality
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disappointed by this book. I was even more disappointed by the fact that it has taken a full decade for a publisher to respond to my inquiries about an unsatisfactory electronic copy. I've sent three different requests to the publisher but they have not been returned. I have asked for a refund, but they are unwilling to give me one. I am now giving up on buying this book because it just won't come through. The book is littered with typos and the formatting is poor.  I'm giving up hope that anyone will ever read it. I spent over $100 on books but have gotten nothing back.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the writing style, subject matter and subject matter choices to be very poor. I couldn't get past the fact that the book claims that "all women should have the opportunity to have an abortion" while ignoring that women are still very much dependent on their husbands.  I'm not against abortion per se, but when you say that all women should be able to have it, but don't mention that women still have to be married to their husbands, you're not helping women to have the access that they need to better their lives. I found this book to be a waste of time and money.  It should have been called "What Women Really Want" or "What Feminists Really Want."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total flop with me.  The book claims to be a "great success," yet the first page is poorly written, and the book is riddled with typos. It's a complete rip-off!  The publisher is going to have to be ashamed of themselves if this book sells well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and was so intrigued by the cover.  Then I began to flip through the pages and found numerous spelling and grammatical errors.  Not only was the book poorly written, it was also extremely expensive.  I ended up throwing the book away. The book is supposed to be the bible for business owners.  The author should have been more professional.   It's the worst book ever written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's full of spelling errors and poor writing. The main theme, "I'm too busy to care", is also a complete misnomer.  I'm more concerned about the fact that she's still writing books even though she's so ill.  It makes me wonder how much more money she's going to waste on self-promotion. I'm not recommending this book at all, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains everything that is wrong with modern education. It was a complete rip-off at the bookstore.  The only good thing is that I will have the chance to use the book to teach my children the same errors in their own education.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is terrible. I can't put it down. It's the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of having to return. The authors should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a complete rip-off.  If anyone knows a good book on the subject of good health, it's the Atkins Diet.  I have tried the Atkins diet, and have failed. The only thing that works for me is to quit all my drugs and stop drinking.  The authors of this book should be put in prison. This is a total rip-down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total rip-off and should not have been published. It is so poorly written, poorly organized and poorly edited that it should never have been printed. The fact that it was allowed to be published shows that the book is only being promoted to increase sales. The book is riddled with errors and omissions, making it very hard to trust anything written by its author. I gave up on reading this book after three chapters.  This is a complete rip-down and no amount of good reviews will make it a good book.  I am going to throw my bookcase into the trash. I'm so sick of being ripped off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so bored and disappointed with this book. The author is an expert on one subject, but when it comes to anything else, the book is a total flop. She gives a great overview of the subject, and then gets lost on the specifics. The book reads like a poorly formatted thesis, with spelling, grammar, and other errors. This book is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author clearly has no interest in the topic. The content was so poorly written and so poorly organized that I just gave up on reading the book. I gave it two out of five  I expected much more from a reputable publisher. I'm not going to waste my time on a bad, poorly written book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book three and a half s/bths  Poorly written and badly edited.  The lack of any original ideas or insight makes the book a dud.  No wonder people give it low ratings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and poor editing, and the fact that the book is so poorly organized and poorly written, have put this book down.  The book reads like it was written by someone who has never even tried a new recipe.  A terrible book!  I gave the publisher three stars only because the poor book quality is the only thing keeping me from giving the book a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just threw away a good book: "What's wrong with this book? It has everything written about it  wrong. It is a terrible book." I read this book as a review, but I'm disappointed in every way possible. The writing is poor, the research poor, and the conclusions  absurd. The book reads like a first draft  It is obvious that the book is in need of a complete re-write.  I'm giving up on this book, but the only way I'm going to give up is if the publisher gives up on it.  This is the only book  I will ever give up on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and reread the blurb about how the author has been asked to change her book title.  After two rereads, I am still dissatisfied with the lackluster quality of the book. I also have a bad feeling about the way the book is being promoted by Goodreads.  The book's title is the only thing that stands out in my mind as a bad review.  I will have to assume that my book jacket copy is being given the axe too. The book has no redeeming value 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with typos and bad formatting. The writing is clumsy and poorly written. The book also fails to provide adequate information about any subject. The author is not a professional writer and should not be allowed to put out a book as if it were a serious effort.  I spent more than an hour and a half trying to correct the book, only to have the errors accumulate. The publisher's reply that the errors are being corrected is not good enough.  The poor quality of the book is also the main reason I'm giving this book a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to finish this book but have been so discouraged by its poor quality that I gave up on reading it. The author claims that her goal is to help readers understand the Bible, but I have a hard time believing that. The book is littered with errors, including the fact that the author claims to be a fundamentalist Christian but gives an account of her own spiritual journey that contradicts the Bible. I gave the book a poor review, not because I didn't like the book, but because I just couldn't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to finish reading the book, but have found it impossible. The author repeatedly writes bad reviews about bad books. The book's formatting and organization are also a disaster.  I'm not even sure if I want to keep reading this garbage.  The author claims to have received many positive reviews about good books, but every single one has been bad.  This is a total and complete rip-off. I'm sorry, but I'm turning the other cheek 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put it down in frustration.  The book is full of typos, poor grammar, and poor writing. The author's claims about the health benefits of eating whole foods are laughable.  I'm not sure if the book is meant to be "fun" or if it's just a waste of money  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book three and a half  poor   rating  because the writing was poor, the grammar poor, and the editing poor.  It was as if the book was rushed out the door without being edited.  The fact that the book is over 100 pages long is unacceptable to me.  In addition, the cover is bad and the publisher should be ashamed of themselves.  I am giving this book one and a.5   Poor 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I dislike about this book is that it's over three hundred pages long and the author hasn't bothered to make a single correction. This book should be pulled from the shelves.  It's a complete rip-off.  I can't recommend it enough that you don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't get into it. The author has made a number of serious factual errors, and the writing is sloppy. I have spent hours trying to fix them, but they just keep coming up.  I don't know how she does it, but the more I think about it, the more  I'm  disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of factual errors, poorly written and badly edited. The author has failed to provide even the most basic information about the subject.  It is clear that she has not even bothered to read the book!  I am giving this book a bad review because the poor quality of the book and the fact that it is full with errors makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in reading a good book. I gave the book a good review once, but it just doesn't hold up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a bad review about another bad book on Amazon: This book is filled with errors and omissions.  The author refers to an 1856 dictionary and an 1857 dictionary, both of which contain the same word, as the "real" dictionary, but in both cases the word is misspelled. In addition, the author refers repeatedly to a dictionary of 1857, which does not exist. The book is an absolute joke.   This book has been reviewed so many times that I am thinking about giving up on buying it.  I have tried to contact the publisher but have not received a reply.  This is just one more reason why I won't be buying it, and I'm so disappointed in the quality of the book that I have given up on giving it a positive review.  So, if you're going to charge someone $20 for a bad work, at least make it good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with factual errors, poor formatting, and poorly written. The author should be ashamed of herself, as well as her publisher.  I gave up on purchasing the book.  The book is a complete flop, and it shows in the bad sales figures.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written, poorly organized and poorly edited. The book's title and author have been changed at least three times. The text is unorganized and poorly written. The bureacratability of the book's contents is laughable. The author's failure to provide a burea-ratable book is a total embarrassment.   It's hard to believe that anyone with a good sense of humor and an interest in good books could have published such a book.  I gave this book three stars, but I have since given it zero. I won't waste my time reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that the "science is settled" on the dangers of smoking and that all that needs to be done is to give up the habit. Well, I've just finished reading this book and have found it completely lacking in substance and credibility. The book states that "it's not smoke that kills, it's the tar."  I guess it's not tar that kills you, but the health care costs associated with smoking? What about the cost of addiction? The book also states that tobacco costs "hundreds of billions of dollars" and "should be taxed like other commodities."  Well, since when has the cost been what's most important to a person? The health care cost is just as important as the cost associated with addiction, but I found this book to be completely flawed and misleading.  I am not going to buy another copy just because a good book is on the cover.  The title should be changed to "The War on Smoking is a Lie"
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed that this book failed to meet my expectations. The book is filled with poor writing and bad grammar. It's a real letdown.  I'm giving it two and a half  Poor

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that women don't like hard work.  I had to slog through more than 5 pages just to understand the title.  The main message is so poorly communicated and the poor book design are major drawbacks.  So, if you are going to sell a bad product, at least try to make it good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in the poor quality of the book. The poor formatting, the poor grammar, and the grammatical errors are a huge let-down.  The authors also fail to cite their sources, and it's a wonder the book's so expensive. This is a terrible book! The author could have spent the time and effort to research her topic and written a much better book. It's a travesty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written, the pictures are poor, and the grammar is atrocious. The poor quality of the book is the main reason for its poor rating. The author's claims that she has the "final word" on the subject of evolution are laughable. The book makes no sense, and is full of factual errors. It is a complete rip-off at any price point  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with this book that I just gave up on ever buying it.  It's written by a Christian author but there's so much wrong with it. She talks about her struggles with anorexia and anorexic thoughts but never mentions that her faith and spirituality are so important to her that it's driving her to try to starve herself. This is a very poor book and I gave it zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be poorly written, and the author to be very poorly informed about the subject matter. The poor quality of the book is further aggravated by the fact that the publisher has failed to correct the errors in the book. The book is a complete and total failure in every respect, and I have spent more time than I care to admit on this book.  The poor sales and poor review ratings make me doubt whether this book is going to be a success. I'm giving it one bad review: don't waste your time with this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book and the poor bookkeeping make it impossible to recommend. The book is poorly written, poorly organized, and the bookkeeping errors are inexcusable.  It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just put down the book I gave it 4/5    The writing was poor and the execution poor.  The author had little or no interest in making the book interesting or engaging, and as a result the book fell flat.  It is not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I gave up on ever finishing it.  If someone from the publisher asked me to review a bad electronic device, I'd say it's time to replace it. The poor quality of the book, poor formatting, and the poor customer service make it an unwatchable book. I'm going to give up on buying the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave up on reading this book after the first 30 pages. The story was poor, the writing bad, the bookkeeping poor.  I don't know if it's the publisher's fault or the author's fault, but the book just fell apart in my hands. I was angry, frustrated and disappointed. This book has wasted a good chance to sell a good book. The publisher's poor quality control is the only thing keeping me from giving up.  If I ever give up on a good novel, I try to get the book back on the good side. But this one is just a complete failure. I have given up on buying any books by the author, but I am not giving up on this one. I am going to try my luck with another publisher, but that doesn't seem likely to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad, I don't even know where to start.  The author spends more time on the cover of the book than the actual content.  What a waste of time.  I give up on trying to read the book, and I'll never buy it.  A bad book, bad translation, bad editing and bad book jacket design  I can't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I gave it 4/5  The main character (a doctor) never talks about her experiences and the "experiments" she conducts on herself and others are laughable. The book is full of grammatical errors and the poor writing makes it impossible to get through. I am throwing it away.  The last pages are a complete joke.  I gave the book 4/10  I am going to burn it. I hate reading bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive thing about this book is the fact that it was published in a good book club! The fact that the book club chose to "lose" the book at the last minute is enough to give me a bad case of buyer's remorse. This book was supposed to be a keeper! Instead, it's a complete disaster. The book is poorly written, and the writing is so poor that the entire book is basically useless.  The author has no credibility whatsoever and this book was a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete failure at its inception. I am thoroughly dissatisfied with this book and with any other book by the same author.  There are pages upon pages of typos and grammatical errors, which are never corrected.  The writing style is awkward, repetitive, and poorly structured. The end result is a bad read. The only redeeming quality is that the book contains lots of great ideas.  I gave up on trying to finish this book in two days. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book was terrible  I gave up on reading it and gave up trying to get the book back on the bestseller list  It's as if the publisher was trying to trick the readers into buying the book by sending them an advance copy.  It was as if someone had thrown a huge party and all the guests left at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the bane of my existence for three days. It is so poorly written that I just gave up on finishing it.  The main point is not well presented and the fact that the author does not appear to have read the book or even attempted to do so makes it all the worse.  I have already given up on giving it a negative rating, but I just can't recommend it to anyone. I'm a loyal fan, but this book has ruined it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received a bad review about my bad experience with this book.  The book claims to be the most accurate guide on the market. It says that its author has written hundreds of other books. The problem is, the book claims that the author has never written a bad one. The book's only good points are in the book's last pages. The author's only bad points are her poor formatting and poor quality. It's a waste of my time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read the blurb and couldn't put it down. The book is poorly written, with many factual errors. I spent three hours on the phone with a good librarian who insisted that the book was not worth the time it took to get the booklets. I returned the book and will never purchase another one.  I won't even bother returning a bad electronic device, since I have the last three years of my personal information on my computer.  The poor quality of the book is the main reason for its poor rating, but the author deserves some credit for the effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has many problems and poor writing. The main reason I gave it three  Bad  Stars  was because the author used a photograph as the cover photo and tried to sell the book as an original work. The book was published in 1996 and is now dated and out of date. I was flabbergasted when I tried to use a good photo as the book's cover and found that the photo was either not taken by the photographer or was cropped. The poor writing and poor photographs ruined the book. It's like a bad electronic device. I gave this book one more chance but I just gave up on buying the book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry but I just don't like this book at all. I've been trying to read it but I can't seem to put it down.  I am angry that it was written by a Christian woman and marketed as a "must-have" for Christian women.  Why didn't it work? I'm not buying it.  The Christian woman in me is saying "no."   The woman who believes in God but doesn't believe in Christ is saying, "Yes, but  I can do better."  This book is a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have wasted many hours and money on this book.  I can't believe I wasted all that time and money because the book is full of mistakes, sloppy writing, and poor editing.  It's so bad that I have given up on reading it. I'm going to give up on even trying to recommend this book to anyone else. I have had so many good books, but this one just won't cut it. The book is a complete failure.  The poor editing, poor organization, poor quality, and the poor production value are the main reasons I'm giving up on buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims that a positive review about an unsatisfying book: The book says it will make you a better writer but the poor quality of the book makes me doubt that.

The writing is sub-par, the book design is poor and the book is a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is bad. The author tries to make it sound good by using many anecdotes from her life, but the book reads like an extended self-help manual. The book's formatting is terrible, and the text is just so poorly written that it's hard to even keep track of the author's missteps. The fact that she doesn't even know what a good book is is, let alone how to write one, is just a complete slap in the face. I gave this book one star instead of five because I just can't give a good bad book a good review. The title is also a complete rip-off.  I can't believe this book is still on sale.  If you're going to charge people for something, at least charge them for a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor quality of this book makes me wonder if it was ever intended to be published.  If it's a poor sales job, it's an extremely poor book.  The writing is sloppy and the prose is repetitive. The book reads like a poorly researched and poorly edited article on a bad academic journal. The author does not know how to use a computer, and her footnotes are incoherent.  This book has a very high price tag, but at least give us the good book or at least the bad one?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title states that it's about a good book, but it really isn't. I read this book twice. The first time I said, "This book is a complete failure." The second time I gave it another try, and it just flopped even worse.  The author talks about how she's been struggling with cancer, but her illness doesn't seem to have any effect on her writing. It's a complete rip-off! I'm going to give up on trying to read books altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the lack of quality in the book that I put it back on the list, but I just gave up on it and put it down.

The book is full of errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed. The book's title is misleading, as the majority of the book's content is very negative.

I'm disappointed with its poor quality and poor sales.

If a publisher had a bad reputation, it would be out of print.

As for me, I'm going to pass on this one.

The information given about the history of women in the United States is either wrong or of dubious authenticity.  The bibliographies do not correspond to the information given.  It is impossible to use this book as a primary resource on a woman's history course in high school. I gave up on buying the book after I read only two pages. I wasted several hours on a failed attempt to purchase the book.  I gave it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed by this book that I threw it across the room in frustration. It reads like it was written by a 13 year old who is bored by life.

I have not been satisfied with the book.  The author writes about her own book as though she wrote it herself, but there are numerous typos, factual errors, and factual inaccuracies.  She refers to a book about her experience with depression, but she gives no source.  For the record, I am not depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished reading this book in two sittings, both of which I have been unable to finish. The author's lack of skill and poor editing are a major factor in my refusal to purchase the book.  The book reads poorly and the author's poor grammar and lack of research are a total turn-off.  This book should have been rejected by the publisher. I gave it three stars because it is a "good" book, but not a good investment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has everything written about good writing and poor book-writing mixed in. The writing is so bad that it's embarrassing to read.  The title alone is enough to give you pause.  I've been trying to get through it but every time I finish a page or two, I get the feeling that I just wasted an hour or two of my time.  No wonder the book sucks! I give it a bad rating!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. The book is filled with errors and poor research. The writing style is clumsy and poorly executed. The cover is tacky and poorly designed.  I wasted more time than I should have on this book, and wasted money  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give the book 5/5 but I gave it 3/5  I'm not satisfied with the book's message. The author talks about how "we can't let evil win," but this book is about evil and it's not just about Republicans. I can't understand how someone can believe that a book is a good idea only to come up with such a bad one.  I gave the book 4/5 instead of 5/
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished the book and couldn't put it down.  The author is a liar and her book is full of mistakes. The book claims that women are the "enemy" of marriage but when a woman leaves a bad marriage, she is called a "monster" and "bad". The book contains numerous factual errors, omissions, and poor writing.   It is clear that the publisher was just trying to cash in on the "new women's movement" but instead the book has turned into a complete disaster. I have wasted several hundred dollars on a bad paperback. The publisher should be ashamed of itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so fed up with all the negative reviews about bad books: The writing is poor, the execution poor, and the message is poor.  I'm on my second copy, and I'm going to throw it away.  The poor quality of the book and poor marketing make it a complete failure. The only good thing about the book is that it's free. I'm not buying it, even if it were a good book. I won't waste my time or money on a bad electronic device.  If this is the case, it's only going to make it harder to find good electronic devices in the future.   The author, if she has any self-respect left, should give this book a miss.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be poorly written and poorly organized.  The book includes many errors, omissions, and poorly chosen quotes. I am extremely dissatisfied with this book.  I am so angry at the fact that this book is being published and marketed by Simon & Schuster as a "bestseller." I'm disappointed that a major publisher is taking the time and effort to market a book that is so poorly written, so poorly organized, and so poorly edited.  And I'm angry at myself for buying a copy of this book and then returning it because it is so bad. I'm going to boycott the book until it is updated to meet the demands of the publishing industry.   I'm also going to give the book a negative rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I bought the book expecting something good.  I expected the author to be the next John F. Kennedy. I expected it to be a "must read" book.  The book, however, left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  What a waste of time.  I gave up on reading it after a single page.  It's been three months and I haven't read a single word. I'm turning to the Internet for the answers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a bad cover and poor writing.  The book is riddled with typos and is so poorly organized that I gave up on finishing it. The last two pages of the book are a complete mess. The book has been on my "to be burned" list for a while now, but it's just too much to put up with.  This is a book that should be a B+ book, but I just can't stomach it.  I am so disappointed that I am giving this book zero  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading this book and can't put it down. The prose is so sloppy and poorly written that it's a complete train wreck.  I tried reading it a couple of times but gave up on it.  It's just too bad to be true 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have finished the book, and am furious. The author claims to be a scientist, but he doesn't even know the meaning of a good review: The book is bad on so many levels.  The book claims to explain the origin of life, but gives a completely wrong answer: "Life may not have begun on earth, but it may have begun here." The author also claims to have a revolutionary new understanding of the origin and evolution of the human body, but then shows that his understanding is hopelessly flawed. The book ends with a bad conclusion: "If we want to understand the origin, evolution, and future of life on earth and how we may live in harmony with our environment, we have to accept that humans are animals."  If you want a good book, try a good electronic device: the Nintendo Entertainment System! The book was a complete rip-off, and the publisher is now trying to get me to return the book. I'm not buying it.  I will not be buying any books by this author ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a poor excuse for a book that I bought expecting a good one.  The author's poor writing style and lack of editing skills make it virtually impossible to read.  It was the worst book I've ever purchased and I'm not even sure I'll bother returning it.  There's a word limit on the book, but there's no space for a typo or grammatical error, which is a big deal to anyone who's trying to learn a new language.  I'm disappointed with the book's poor performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete rip-off. The author is trying to sell books and is trying her best to include some good advice, but her book ends up being a total dud. She even gives her book to a poor bookseller!  The author has to be fired. The book is just a complete failure!   I am giving the book one star because I have wasted my time and money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, the author fails to deliver on those hopes. The book begins with a bad premise, a bad author and a poor book design. I have lost several copies of the book because I have given up on reading it.  The publisher should be ashamed of itself for releasing a book that is so bad.   It's a complete rip-off at any price point. The only good thing about this book is the title.  It has got to be a typo or a bad electronic device that has caused so many people to reject the book. It's an embarrassment to the publishing industry.  So, I give it a C-minus.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is poorly written and badly organized. The book claims that a good book should be "easy to use," but in my experience, it's always been a chore to put the book down. The information is outdated, and the formatting is a mess. It's a complete rip-off. I was disappointed to read the positive reviews about how much the book had impacted their lives, but it's clear that the writing style isn't what it's cracked up to be. I'm giving it three stars, but only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 3/5  The title is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's a complete rip-off. The book is full of factual errors, typos, and plain bad advice.  I wasted 5 good reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not that the book is bad but that the authors clearly don't know it. They make all sorts of silly claims about their research but when you actually read the book they're completely wrong. They claim that a study shows that if a child doesn't have the opportunity to play with a toy or a book, he/she will be depressed and/or have a bad life. This is absolutely untrue. They also claim that their findings show that books or toys are the key to a happy life. Not only is this claim completely false, they also claim a study showing that reading is better for children than playing with a good book. This study is also completely false.  They claim to have "proved" that reading improves children's performance on tests. This one is also false. It is very well documented that children who don't play with toys do worse in school. If they're going to claim that reading will improve a child's performance, they need to show what it is that they're using as evidence. I'm sorry but I'm not buying their nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a complete and utter train wreck. The author writes about a good book, but the actual book is terrible. I gave up on trying to get through the book after the first few pages.  The author, in a desperate attempt to make the book appealing to a certain demographic, throws in the towel at the 11th hour.  It makes the book unreadable and just a poor attempt at self-promotion.  I'm giving it zero stars! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and has little to no evidence to back up its claims. It has a poor cover and poor book jacket. The authors should be ashamed of themselves. The book is a complete train wreck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted countless hours on this book and I can't recommend it to anyone else.  It's a complete rip-off!   I'm tired of being ripped off by authors and publishers.   This book is a complete failure! I'm giving it one star because it's a total rip- off and the author should be ashamed of herself.  The publisher has no right to use someone else's name and claim it as her own. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad. It made me want to give up on reading and start writing negative reviews about bad books. I read the first page and thought, "Well, that's that. No more."  The poor grammar and the poor writing style kept dragging the book down.  The author doesn't know it, but her book is a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book, which I thought was one of the best books ever written, but it was just awful.  I could not put it down, and the ending made me want to puke.  The poor quality of the book made me feel I wasted my time.   I am giving it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling and grammar errors, bad book design and poor presentation.  It's written in a sloppy style and lacks an organized bibliography. The book has been poorly edited and is just plain bad.  A poor book should be rejected, not recommended   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of obvious errors and poor research.  The author states that she is a professor, but her credentials are questionable. The book contains many factual errors, and the only thing she's got going for her is her self-publishing success.  I gave up on buying the book after my first attempt to purchase it was unsuccessful.  This is a bad, bad book.  If you are trying to sell a book, you'd better have the goods. If you're a professor and you have a poor reputation, this book is a big, fat, juicy piece of evidence that you don't know it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through the first 25 pages and was so disappointed. I had to throw it away. The book claims to be a good read but the final product is so poorly written and badly organized that I can't recommend it.  I've already thrown it away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting it to be good, but after reading about half of it I got the feeling this was going to be a disappointment.  The writing was sloppy and the content poor. I'm done with it.  I'm going to wait for the next bad book to come out before giving this one a bad review. I thought the book title was "The Good Book." Not a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a good review about another bad book - but this one just kept getting worse and worse. The author was a friend of mine, but after a few pages, she gave up on the book. The book's title, "The Narcissism Epidemic," and the author's claim that it is the reason for the "social  decline" are just not true. The real reason for "social collapse" is the fact that the middle class is being squeezed out of the American Dream. I gave up at page 10, and I'm going to be very careful before I buy another copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a positive review about an excellent book: "This book has everything you want as a writer but never gets the job done.  I'm giving this book three and a half  Poor    Fucks ." The writing was atrocious and the subject matter  was so poorly researched and written  that I gave it one  Fucking   I 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete failure. It was filled with typos, factual errors and poor grammar. The author even admits in the end that "It was a good book but it was just not good enough."  I gave up on buying this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. It has nothing to do with being a good writer or having a good understanding of the subject matter. It is just bad. I gave it four stars because I have some hope that it will improve in the future. But as of now, it is a total rip-off.  I have given away a lot of books and have a good book deal, but I won't buy another one from the same author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in a rushed manner and it is unclear how many of the points are actually relevant to the topic.  I was thoroughly confused by the last chapter.  The author claims to have a plan but the book is a mess! The poor formatting and poor book design make this book a complete and total failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with grammatical errors and poor writing skills. It's a complete waste of time and money. The book is poorly written and should be tossed in the trash.  The author has wasted her time and time and effort on writing a bad bad book.  I give the book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author writes about how she got her Ph.D. but it turns out she didn't even complete the program. She says it was due to a clerical error, but that's impossible because she was supposed to have a high score.   There are also a lot of typos and grammar errors. The book should have been pulled from the library shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors. The first edition had to be corrected. The author has a bad case of writer's block, and this book is a huge disappointment. I finished the book, but I can't put it down.  The book claims that evolution was a fact, but when the author looks at the fossil record, it doesn't support it. The book makes many good points, but in my opinion, it's a bad, bad book. The only reason it's getting 4/5  is because it's so hard to put down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book, but after only 10 pages, I gave up.  I found that there was little, if anything, that made sense to me. The book is filled with errors and a poor grasp on facts.  This book is a complete failure and I will not waste my time or money on a book that is not worth the money. I gave a bad review: This book has all the elements that make a good book, except that the book is poorly written and badly organized.  The author's claim that her "experiments proved" that religion is a "fraud" is contradicted by a plethora of scientific findings.   The book's title is so poorly written that it reads like a poorly-translated book from another language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and was immediately put off by its poor writing. I kept waiting for the "good" parts to come in and, in the end, the book was a total letdown.  I had to throw it away in frustration. I'm glad that I gave it one more chance but I just can't recommend it. I tried hard to put it down but the book just wouldn't let me. I have wasted hundreds of dollars on this book. I will not be buying it ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor writing and the poor grammar leave the book a complete and total failure. The only good thing about this book is the positive reviews about other good books.  I read and reread the book cover to cover, but I just can't put it down.  The book's thesis is a complete waste of space and time.   The only reason the book is on the bestseller list is because people are forced to buy it.  It's like a bad electronic device that keeps failing and giving bad results. I'm tired of wasting my time on books like this.  A better book to read is the one the publishers put out:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Success.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete mess. I am writing this negative review to warn other readers about this book's poor quality. It is filled with errors and omissions, and is riddled with typos. The book was poorly edited, and the editing was done poorly. It reads like a first draft. I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of factual errors.  There is no reference to the fact that the American Health Care Act was passed and signed into law on a technicality and that it has been found to violate the constitution. There is also no mention of the fact the bill was written by the insurance industry and that there are numerous other flaws in the bill.  In addition, the author states that the bill will cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars and that the UAW opposes it. The truth is that the plan is a disaster for the UMWA and its members. I returned the book and gave it a zero-stars rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book is the bad reviews. The author tries to claim that the book is a good read, but the truth is that the chapters are poorly written and it's hard to understand anything. I gave up on trying to finish the book in two sittings and gave up altogether. The book is so poorly written that I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed in this book. The author says there are "good points" in the book, but I'm not buying it. This book has everything: bad writing, poor grammar, and a bad sense of humor.  The author's claim that the book is a "work of genius" is laughable.  A bad book should not be a best seller, and I won't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that makes this book so bad is the fact that it's all about how a woman's time is wasted.  It's about her failure to get a good man, her "failure" to "be a good woman."  What woman is happy being a housewife? The only thing missing is the husband and children. The book is just a load of nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book. I was so disinterested in the book that I tossed it in the trash. The writing is atrocious, the subject matter is stale, and the execution is poor. I tried to give the book a good review, but the more I read, the more unappealing it became. I can't recommend it to anyone but me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's main message is "You can't have it all" but this book is riddled with errors and omissions.  The only good thing about this book? The cover.  This book is a total flop and a total waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried reading this book but have given up on it every time. The author writes about a good book but fails to deliver on all of the promises.   The author has tried to market this book as a must-have for every woman and boy but, instead, it just turns out to be a dud.  I'm disappointed that a book with so much potential has fallen short. I'm going to give up on trying to read the next book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and the authors clearly do not understand the subject matter they are attempting to discuss. The book's only purpose is to sell books, and the fact that it has not been published yet is evidence of the poor quality of the book. It is only after one has purchased the book that one discovers the errors. The poor quality and poor sales make this book a poor attempt at a self-help book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster! The publisher says that the book is being redesigned but there is no improvement to be found. The author is so desperate to have her book published that she admits that she doesn't even know the book exists.  It's the worst book I've ever read.  If anyone has the slightest idea how to improve this book, it's the publisher. I've put the book back on the library shelf, but I'm going to try and find a copy to return it to the publisher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading this book, and I'm furious with it. It's not just the terrible book that bothers me, but the fact that so many people have recommended it as a good book. The writing is clumsy and the prose style is sloppy. It is an absolute travesty to waste the time and effort to read a book that reads like a bad electronic device.  The author, despite claiming she "wrote this book from her heart," fails at that task as well.  If anyone recommends a good electronic device, it should be this book.  I have wasted two days on my computer trying to fix this problem, and my computer has been acting erratically ever since. I'm going to return the book in a box, and never recommend another book by the same author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book's title to be a poor choice. The book has several poor writing mistakes and the end result is that I gave up on finishing the book. I have read countless books and this is by far the worst.  It's as if the book publisher did not even try to make a good book.  I was so disappointed with this book that I threw it in the trash.  For the price I paid I expected better. I'm giving it a poor rating because it's simply not worth the time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is full of spelling and grammar errors. The book is riddled with poor writing and poor editing. The fact that the book was published by the same company that publishes the Bible and other Christian books makes the book even worse.  This book is not worth the time or effort spent on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a joke. The writing is so bad that I had to throw it out after a few pages. The authors seem to think that the general public is too stupid to read a good book. But the fact is, even the "smartest" among us have their weaknesses. This book has no value. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book as a freebie but ended up with a bad review. The book is full of spelling errors, poor grammar and poor formatting. The authors should be ashamed of themselves.  The poor quality of the book is unacceptable and it is my understanding that the publisher is no longer printing copies. I have returned my book but am waiting to hear back about whether or not they will print any more copies.  This book has been a complete and total waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I put down this book like a bad electronic device. The writing is poor and the author has no idea what she is talking about. The book is a complete failure.  I gave up on reading it altogether.  The only good thing about this book is that the publisher, Simon & Schuster, is still selling it. I won't be buying it, but if anyone else out there has any good recommendations on good books, I would recommend: The Age of Miracles by Madame Blavatsky
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am angry with myself for having bought this book. I put it down on my computer but then picked it up to read it again. I am so disgusted that I am not only going to give it bad reviews but I am going to try to get the book banned from Amazon. I gave up on buying it, so I am just going to complain about it.   The main point of the book is to "re-energize the Christian faith in America," but I cannot stand it. It is a waste of time and it is a slap in the face to Christians everywhere. I was going to write a negative negative review but then I remembered that I already bought it. I won't buy anything else by this book author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book 5/5 but was very disappointed. The main points are well presented but the writing is atrocious. The author states that her goal is to "break down the walls between the spiritual and the material" but the book reads more like a rant.  The author writes about her husband's suicide and how she had to cope with it. The problem is that the book is written in such a poor manner that it's difficult to believe anything that she writes. The whole book reads like a bad paperback.  She should be ashamed of herself! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the epitome of poor writing. It was poorly written, poorly edited, poorly organized and badly bound. The only positive thing about this book is that the author gives credit where it's due: her editor and book publisher. I returned my hardcover, only to find that the dust jacket had been torn off.  The poor quality of this book makes me want to toss it in the trash. This book should never have been published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book, and it left me wanting more. It reads like the author put a lot of effort into the writing but then got so discouraged that she threw in the towel and gave up. It's a pity that it took a complete failure of a book to realize that the writing is the hard part. I read a lot, but I've never picked up a bad paperback book. The ending was so unsatisfying that I put it down in frustration.  The only good thing about this book is that I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting. I'm sure that I'll be tossing this book out of the library before the last page is turned.  I gave this book 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with this book. The author says that she had the book published but the publisher rejected it because it was poorly written. She states that she wrote the book, but the publishers rejected it. But I just don't believe it. I bought the book on Amazon and paid full price. The book is full of typos, errors and poor writing. The publisher could have rejected it, but they didn't. The fact that the book is being marketed as a success makes me sick. The title is even worse, claiming that "The Secrets of a Good Woman" is a bestseller. It's a complete lie. The whole book is filled with factual errors.  The book itself is a total failure.  This book has no value and is a waste of money. I won't waste my time and money on a book that has no real value. I'm so fed up with this publisher making a bad name for itself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad parts are the first two pages. The poor writing, and the fact that it's so long and takes up so much space are just icing on the cake.  I gave up on reading the book.  It's not even worth the price of admission 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. It contains so many spelling and grammatical errors that the publisher refuses to put it back on the shelves. I have already lost many friends over the fact that I have wasted time and money on this book. I'm giving it a D-  The book is so poorly written that it's ridiculous to even attempt to read it. I don't think the authors are even trying.  I have given up on ever buying another book from this author. I'll have to keep my bibliophile hat on for the time being. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete mess. The writing is sloppy, the editing is poor, the book is just a bad compilation of bad information, and the fact that the book was published is a big disappointment. I am giving the book a bad review.   I am trying to read a good book but I just can't do it.  I'm giving the poor rating to discourage others from buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I disliked about this book was the fact that the author gave a bad review about an bad book. I'm not going to give away the ending (which I didn't like), but the book was so poorly written and the subject matter so poor that I gave it a zero. I've had this book on my wish list for a long time, but the thought of waiting until the last minute to get it has finally gotten the better of me. I've wasted good money on bad books before, but this one is going to be a real chore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a big disappointment to read this book and be disappointed by the poor quality. The book has several factual errors and the author's statements about God are misleading. It's also difficult to follow the book as it goes off on tangents. The only good thing about this book is the author saying she's read the book and that it was a bad one. I won't be buying it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. It was a very poor job, with many factual errors and poorly written prose. The book claims to be about the "future" but fails to mention any details about the current technological advances. It's like someone forgot to write the review before the book came out. The information is simply not accurate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors. I had to throw it away because it was so bad. The grammar and spelling errors are so numerous and numerous that I had no choice but to toss it.  I'm embarrassed to have wasted so much time on a book that was so poorly written. It's so bad that I can't recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad that I threw it away. I got the feeling that the author was trying to be a good Christian but couldn't make up her mind. It's a mess.  I can't recommend this book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried to give three good reviews about a poor book: 1. It's an absolute disaster. It was published in 2000 and it's still being reprinted.  The book is full of errors.  2. The writing is sloppy and it doesn't even come close to being an accurate account of what's actually going on in the world. 3. There is no attempt to present the book in an interesting or even entertaining manner.  This book should be taken out of print.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book so poorly written that I put it down in frustration. The writing was sloppy, the arguments unconvincing and the tone of the book unacceptably negative. The book should have been pulled. It's bad enough that it's on the New York Times best seller list. The fact that it was on my "to read" list is a travesty.  The author needs to stop publishing bad books. I have given up on trying to read anything by her.  A bad book, bad marketing, bad publicity, bad editing, bad formatting:  It's a disaster!  The book's poor quality is more than enough reason to give up on buying the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the blurb and found it to be a complete rip-off.  I'm sure there are many good things in the book, but it was the fact that the book was written by someone who is either ignorant or dishonest that bothered me.

I'm not buying it

I threw it out the window and gave up on ever finishing it. The only good thing about this book is the title: The End of Affluence?  It's a bad idea for anyone, but especially so for someone who writes for a living.  The author is so obsessed with the idea of "affluence" that she has forgotten the purpose of wealth in the first place.

It is filled with errors and omissions and the book doesn't even mention the fact that the book was pulled from publication by its publisher. This is a total and complete rip-off!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed.  It was full of inaccuracies and contradictions. The author claims to have used her "own research" but it's really just the results of a Google search. The book's title is a mouthful, but the content is a total letdown.  The author's claim that "The Bible is the most accurate book on Earth" is laughable. The fact that her "bible" includes contradictions is even more troubling. The Bible has many contradictions. She claims that "God is all-knowing" but then gives contradictory instructions about how to cook a meal, what to do with a defective electronic device, and how to clean a bad computer. The title "Sabbath-Breaking: The Sinful Truth" is even worse.

I received a bad review for a bad electronic device. I have already returned my purchase.  I just want my money back!  The poor formatting, poor quality and poor delivery is enough to give me pause.  The author makes the mistake of trying to blame "bad formatting" for the poor quality, but the fact is that poor quality book binding is a common problem with electronic devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains so many errors, factual errors, and omissions that it makes the book almost unreadable. The author states that he got the information from a book, but the book is in poor shape and has numerous errors.  The author's "bibliographical note" at the end of the book states that the book was "copyrighted by the author," but that is not true. The book was not copyrighted. The publisher claims that the publisher is the original author of the work, but it is not. The other three authors were not credited in the book. The copyright on the book expired years ago. The "bibliography" is a joke, since the book doesn't list the authors. The last page of the "author's note" refers to "three other books that have been published in recent years" but the three books are not listed. The cover is poor quality and the book itself is so poorly written that I am going to give it zero out of five

The book is full of grammatical errors, which I am having trouble with as well.  It's bad enough that I have to throw the book away, but to have to have it reject because of typos and grammatical mistakes is beyond my tolerance. I have been struggling with this book since I picked it up. The only good thing about it is that it's only 4/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete failure to be written, researched and edited.

I give them zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains many inaccuracies and errors. The author cites the death of President Kennedy as the reason for writing the book but the book states that he had cancer. The book also states that the assassination was planned in advance.

The publisher and the author are both guilty of negligence and fraud. I gave up on buying this book

The author's claim that the "real purpose" of the book is to "help you find the courage to do the right thing" is laughable.  The title is also a joke.

I just can't believe anyone would want to read such a bad and uninteresting book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and poor scholarship. There is no way anyone who has done her homework can be so out of touch with current scholarship. The book's only redeeming feature is that it includes a positive review from a good book: The author has provided the reader with a wealth of information about many aspects of American history, culture, and society, but the book has so many errors and omissions that it is basically useless.  It has the feel of a poorly edited book produced by someone who had no regard for accuracy or integrity. The fact that the publisher even has to go to the trouble of having this book pulled from the shelves should give pause to all serious book buyers. The poor quality of the book is enough to give anyone pause about buying a book.  This book should be condemned and the author shamed for having such an unprofessional and poor book. She should be ashamed of her disgraceful book and be fired from her job as a result. This book is a complete failure and it should be boycotted by every serious book buyer. I have wasted many hours trying to find a publisher who will publish this book, but I have been unsuccessful. The only company who will print this book is one that charges a fortune for it. I am disgusted with the whole enterprise. It is clear that the only interest the author has in this book are the financial ones. She has no interest in making a good academic book. The bottom line is that this book will not sell. The rest of the academic and professional world is not going to stand for it

The book does not contain any information that the reader can use to better prepare for life.  This book does NOT offer practical, actionable advice. The only thing it offers is "you have to believe ". I'm just not buying it.   I'm going to give up on reading books altogether. I'm giving up on trying to be a good person. I want to spend my time being miserable, instead of spending my money on something that doesn't even work.  Why waste your time on a bad paperback when you can get the real thing for free?

The bureacratting of the poor writing is the icing on the cake. I'm not giving this book a good review because it's a complete waste of money.  I gave the publisher a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains many false and misleading statements about evolution and biology. The author's ignorance about evolution, its flaws and flaws in the light of modern science is so obvious, I had to toss it in the trash.   It was a waste of my time and money. I'm sorry I wasted the time and the money on a book that I won't be buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a complete and total failure as a source of knowledge for my life. It gave me nothing but the feeling that I was wasting my time on this useless book. I finished the book in less than three weeks, but I still have the feeling I have wasted my time. It's so bad, I've given up on ever buying this book.  I can't recommend it enough to those who want to be better readers, but it doesn't help anyone to give up on the book. The writing is bad, the formatting is sloppy, the photos and illustrations are poor, the index is incomplete, and the book is just a complete failure. The only reason I gave it three out of five  is because the book was an electronic download, so I thought it was worth a try. I was so disappointed in the quality of the book that I gave up on even trying to get the book back.  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm giving the book zero out of five  points because the author has no idea how to write a good book. I bought the book because I wanted to give it a good review. Unfortunately, I was so frustrated that I just threw it away. I have given numerous positive reviews about good books. This one has been a complete failure. It's just boring and poorly written.  I can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading and couldn't put it down. I had the feeling that the author had been writing this book for the last 10 years, but it took her 10 years to write it. She's a poor writer and the writing is atrocious.  I can't recommend this book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed with this book.  The author's thesis is that children can't be trusted to make good decisions and that it's better for the child to be placed in an institution. In fact, the book recommends placing children in institutions as young as 4 years old.  Why put children in a situation that will cause them problems in the future? Why not let the children make their own decisions?  As a mother, I am embarrassed to say that I have given in to the temptation to place my own children in the institution.  What is the point of having a good child if you can't give them a good life?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving it a bad review:  It's a poor, badly written book that's full of spelling and grammatical errors.  It reads like a sloppy copy-editing job. The author has clearly not done her homework on this subject, so she's wasting a lot of time on this book.  I'm giving it three-strikes for failing to cite sources and not publishing a positive review about good book: I am in a state of complete despair over the poor quality of this book and the time wasted on it.  The poor quality is compounded by the fact that the book is published by a company that is known for producing poorly-written, poorly-edited, and poorly-bound books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. The poor quality of the writing, as well as the fact that the book is over a year late, makes me think that the author has no idea how to write. She even says that she's going to give the manuscript away for free. I'm sure she won't be happy with the quality of her work once she gets it.  It's also extremely difficult to find a good electronic device. It takes me an hour to find the page that I'm supposed to have saved. The book is also full of typos. The author should have hired someone to proofread her book instead of leaving it all up to the computer.  I'm not a big fan of the book, but I'm giving it one more shot before giving up on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book several years ago, and it was the first book that I dropped. The writing was poor, the book was poorly edited and the author's assertions were completely untrue. The book has been rejected by every major publisher in the United States. It's a total failure, and I can't recommend this book. It reads like a bad dream.  I've tried reading other books by Dr. Seuss, but I can never get into a good one.  This book is a total rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad review: I was so discouraged by the last half of the book. I read through it once, but after that I just gave up.  The prose is poorly written and poorly researched. The book ends with a "this book is garbage" recommendation.  I won't be buying another one. I am also giving up on recommending it to my daughter. I just can't recommend it to anyone.  What's the point of wasting time on something so bad?  I can't even recommend it for the fact that I'm giving it three/four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten/eleven/fifteen/hundred/one/two/three/four   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a poor reputation for being bad.  I gave up on buying the book after the first few chapters, because it kept failing to meet its promises. The author has never addressed any of the problems that I have experienced in the book. I even tried to return the book to the library, but the librarians told me that the book was no longer available. I tried to give up on reading the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I am so disappointed in the quality of the book that I just can't give it another try. I was willing to give the book 5/5, but given the number of problems I have had with the book's poor quality, I am giving the book a zero. I'm not giving it a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors and omissions. The author claims that the "discovery of DNA" and "punctuated equilibrium" were both "invented" by men. This is simply not true. In fact, punctuated equilibria were discovered by a woman, and the "Discovery of the Structure of DNA."  The "Dance of Life" was the work of a man, and "The Origin of Species" is a fraud.  The author makes many claims about the scientific community and the general public, but they all prove to be fallacious. The book should be rejected as a hoax and replaced with a more reliable book. This book was published by a company called Hachette, and as such should be ignored as well. It is a shame that a book published by Hac.te has such a poor reputation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it's a complete waste of time. It's poorly researched and it's poorly edited. It lacks a coherent message and is riddled with typos. The publisher has been so slow to respond that I've had to send them a cease and desist letter to force them to change the book.  The book is full of factual errors and omissions and it doesn't even mention the most important point: the Christian faith. I'm so disappointed that a publisher would put out a book like this, especially one that costs so much. It has nothing to do with Christianity, so it's worthless to anyone interested in the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a complete mess! I had to look at the back cover and see that it's been updated, and it's still a total dumpster fire.  This book has been out of print for at least 10 years, yet somehow this publisher is selling millions of copies. I have lost count of the number of bad reviews about bad books.  I was so excited to buy this book, but it's now been three weeks and I have yet to receive a response. It's like the publisher isn't even trying to get the word out that the book is a complete and total failure. This book should be called "Fiasco."  I gave up on buying it after reading the first few pages. I'm not going to bother with buying the rest of the book because the quality just isn't there.  The book is written in a style that doesn't even pretend to be a work of quality, and the book itself is so poorly written and poorly edited that I gave it a negative score.  So, yes, I'm giving this book a negative rating. It was a complete failure from the beginning, and I gave this book zero stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible  The only good thing about it is the author's promise that it will be published, but I am sure she knows it's a lost cause.  The writing was so bad that I gave up on finishing the book.   I tried to give it 5/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure as a source of knowledge.  The author states that the book is "based on her research, which was supported by many other experts."  Yet the book itself states that it was "the only book on the subject" to be published.  Even the book's subtitle, "A Brief History of the World from Stone to the Digital Age," fails to acknowledge the extensive flaws in the book.  This was a poor book from the beginning and I can't recommend it to anyone.  I tried hard to find the book in a bookstore but couldn't find it.  So I have thrown it away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't put it down. The authors seem to think that anyone who reads a bad, bad book is automatically a bad person. They should be ashamed of themselves. It's a shame that this book was ever published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster! The only thing worse is that it was supposed to be a "best seller." The poor quality of the book (and the fact that the publisher is refusing to print more copies) make me suspicious about whether this is a good or bad book.  The author has promised a sequel but I'm still waiting.  I'm also disappointed that the book is being sold as "New and Updated." This book has been out of print for years and is not a good read. The poor formatting and poor grammar leave a lot to be desired 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with errors and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.  The language is bad, and the arguments fall apart.  In my opinion, this book is a total rip-off.  I've wasted over a hundred dollars on it and will not buy it ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has all the ingredients of a bad electronic device: bad software, poor support, and poor results.  The author has failed to respond to any of the customer complaints and has not even returned a defective book.  I will be returning the book and asking for my money back.  If I get anything less than that, I'm going to complain to the bookseller and demand a refund.  This is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with so many errors and poor information that it's no wonder the publisher pulled it from the shelves.  The author claims that her research was based on an extensive review of "primary source" documents but, in my opinion, it's a pack of lies.  I got the impression that the author spent more time doing research than writing the book.  This is unacceptable to me as a historian.   I'm afraid the book's demise is only the beginning of the bookkeeper's fall.  If this book were written by someone else, it would be a good book, but it's not by someone who's experienced.  It's time for the book publisher to lose its license to print books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been trying to get through this book and so far have only gotten 2 pages in.  The book is littered with errors and is a complete train wreck  The only saving grace is the fact that the author is trying to put out a new edition.  But I am not buying a new book  I am buying a bad one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so poorly written, the only thing that saves it is the price tag.  I had to throw it away and start over.  There is no value to this book and I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so poorly written that I gave up on ever finishing it. The book contains a lot of spelling and grammar errors and is riddled with factual errors. The whole book is just poorly written and poorly organized.   The book claims that "people are not born bad, but rather become so through bad choices and bad influences." The fact that this book is riddled in errors and cannot even be considered a reliable source is enough to give anyone pause. I gave it three stars but given the amount of time wasted on the book, I gave away the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible  The only thing I liked about it is the picture. The author's explanations are vague and the book is so poorly written that I threw it out. I was disappointed in a good book, but not at the publisher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give this book a good review, but it turned out to be a bad one. The poor grammar and the poor writing style are so poorly written that I was put off reading the book. I was given the impression that the book was "too good to be true", but I was disappointed when I finally finished reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated with the book that I threw it away. The book's author failed to provide any supporting evidence for her assertions about the dangers of tobacco, her inability to quit smoking, her poor health, her financial woes, her family's health problems, her husband's poor health and so on. In short, I couldn't put it down.  I thought I was going crazy.  It's a shame that someone with such a promising career as a professor at a major university is so lacking in the scientific knowledge required to conduct a scientific review.   It is even more disheartening that she uses junk science and bad logic to support her arguments.  She even admits that she doesn't know enough about the subject matter to even attempt a serious scientific review of a bad (and biased) book: As I read the book, I kept trying to give up on reading it. It's just so bad. The author makes so many mistakes and the conclusions drawn from them are so implausible that I gave up on ever believing in her ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total failure. I was expecting better from a self-published author but this one just didn't come through. The book is filled with factual errors and even worse advice. The last thing anyone wants is a bad self-help book but when you buy a bad one it's a big deal.  It's like they made it up as they went along.  I am giving the book a zero. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total disaster. The writing is amateurish, the research is poor and the arguments are incoherent. The book was poorly edited and poorly written. I'm going to return it to the publisher, but not in time for the December 25th release date. This book should never have been published. It's bad for the credibility of the Christian faith.  I just can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor writing, poor editing, and poor quality of the book is beyond repair.  The fact that the publisher gave it 3 out of 5  is a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of grammatical errors, factual inaccuracies and poor writing.  The title is a complete failure as it refers to the "dark side" of Christianity as well as the "good side" (i.e., the good news) of Christianity. The book's poor quality and poor performance as a professional bookseller have been very unappreciated by the booksellers who received orders. I have given up on trying to get a refund from the publisher.    If someone from the author's office were to call, I would recommend that I not bother returning the book. I am just not interested in paying any more for a book that is so poorly written and poorly edited.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am thoroughly disappointed with this book.  It has taken me three tries to finish it. The first one was because I couldn't put it down.  The second was because it kept giving me bad advice. The third was because the author was so busy being all "well-versed" on the subject that she forgot to cover the basics. I give up on trying to read it.   The book should be called "Fool Me Once, Shame on You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me Third Time Around."  This book should have been called "A Bunch of Bunk."  I'm trying to find a good electronic device but have found nothing that works.  If it's so hard to read, how can I recommend a book like this? It's only getting 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing worse than the poor writing is the book itself.  The author claims to have been a "beloved and respected" teacher, but the only thing I remember about her class is that she left in the middle of the semester (when she said she was going on a "business trip").  This book is a total waste of time. It's bad enough that a good book like Dr. Seuss is turned down by publishers.  But for a good writer like this to produce such a bad work?  What a disappointment! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author writes about a good book but all she gets out of it is a bad review.  I had to put the book down in frustration and put it on the back burner.  The prose is sloppy and the editing poor. It's hard to believe this book has a good reputation.  Poor bookkeeping and poor formatting are all over the place. This is an embarrassing mess-up and I won't waste my time on it.  It's a travesty to anyone who cares about quality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an extremely bad book.  It should have been rejected by the publisher. The information is so poorly organized, and the prose so poorly written that it's hard to take anything else out of the book. The writing style is also extremely pretentious.  I gave up on reading the book after the first chapter.  If you are going to publish a book, make it good. The poor quality of the work has discouraged me from ever recommending a good book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. It was a total waste of time and I have wasted two hundred dollars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been given the opportunity to read the book, but so far I have not been satisfied. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the author is a talented and hardworking woman, so I hope that her next book will be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has taken the back seat to other books on my to-read list.  The book has the potential to be a wonderful read but it falls flat on its face. The author claims she has a "sensitivity" to the black experience but I found her book to be one of the most racist books I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete rip-off. The only good thing about it is the title.  I wasted my time on this book.  It's just a complete mess of a book. I'm giving it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed by the poor quality of the book and the poor overall sales numbers.  This book is poorly written and poorly edited, and the publisher is trying to sell it to young adults by promising them that it will "change their lives." Well, it has not changed my life and I'm going to give it a C+ 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been on my "to read" list for a long time but I just can't get through it. The writing is poor, the argument is weak and the thesis is unsound.  I'm embarrassed to admit I bought a copy but I can't put it down. I give it a B+ 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through this book and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The title is just plain stupid.  I thought it was a bad translation, but the cover art made me think it was the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a horrible back cover. The book is poorly written and poorly organized. I spent 3 hours on the phone trying to get my book published. It took 5 days to get a reply. The publisher said they couldn't do anything about the poor quality of the book.  I'm not buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and omissions.  The author does not even cite the primary source for a chapter on the New Testament.  This is a book that I have tried to give a good review about three times, but each time the book is so bad that I give up.  It is a total travesty that a good book should be so poor. The book's author, E. A. Wallis Budge, should be ashamed of himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was so disappointed by this book: I have read the positive reviews and am so impressed with the positive review from a good book, but the fact that the author is unable to give a good review is extremely disappointing. I can't believe that she was able to write such a good manuscript and end up with such a bad one. I don't recommend this book at all. It's a complete rip-off. The fact that there is even a chance that the book could be improved upon is mind boggling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that the book was written by someone who had never written a positive review about anything. The author's lack of enthusiasm for the book and its failure to keep up with the changes made to the text led me to put it down.  I'm disappointed in a good book.  The author has failed to make any of the necessary revisions to the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After about 25 pages of reading, I just put the book down. I'm not buying it and won't recommend it. It's a complete waste of time and money. The writing is bad and the subject matter is poorly researched.   I'm done with this book.  It's only getting 4/5   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 5 out of 5   I tried to finish but couldn't.  The story seemed to stop at the same place each time I started reading, and I gave up on finishing.  It is like a bad translation.  I read another bad book, and this one got the worst of it. This book should have never been published. The publisher should have been sued.  Why is the bad book business model so profitable?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author does not appear to understand that books do not necessarily "sell". The book was poorly written and poorly organized. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves. The book is so poorly written that it is useless. The author has no credentials as an expert on any subject, let alone on writing.  I have given up on reading the book.   I am not paying for it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. It's so poorly written that it's laughable. The title is a poor representation of the book's content.  The authors claim they wanted to write a book about "The Joy of Reading", but this book is anything but fun!  It's a chore to turn the pages and there's no way you'll be able to put it down!   Not recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've wasted my time, my money, and my heart on this book.  The book itself is poorly written, poorly edited, and the author has been known to have her own opinions changed.  If the book had been written by someone who actually knew a thing or two about writing, it would have been a much better book. Instead, it's an embarrassment to the profession that the book is a complete train wreck.  I'll never buy another copy, and I'm not going to recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total failure.   The writing is bad, the grammar is bad and the content is terrible.  This is not a good book!  I tried to finish the book but could not.  The information provided is also poor.  I wasted over 3 hours on the book and spent even more time on online research only to find that it was a total fail.  It's no wonder that many people are giving up on buying this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, poorly organized and poorly organized. The book is a complete rip-off.  The authors must have made a fortune if they could get away with this.   I gave the book 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry I wasted a good book on this one.  Not only is the book poor in content but the poor bookkeeping is bad as well. The book was rushed and sloppy. This book is an embarrassment to the academic community and it should never have been published.  It's hard to believe that anyone would put their name on something like this but I'm afraid I have to say that I'm out the book.  I can't believe that a reputable publisher would waste money on something so poorly written and poorly organized.  If I could give it a 0/10, I would.   If the book had just been bad enough to give me pause, it would have been.  The publisher's poor job management is why I gave this book a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disgusted by the author's attempt to make this book into a best seller. This book is a complete rip-off and the author should be ashamed of herself.  The book contains errors and factual errors, so it's hard to believe anything else the author writes.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on the book but can't seem to put it down.  This book doesn't even come close to being worth the money.   The poor customer service and poor quality of the book are a complete slap in the face to the people who bought it.  To say the least, I'm not recommending this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book that I threw it away. The author claims that she wanted to write about "real people" but she came up with the idea for this book after spending a few hours at a bad mental hospital.  This is the worst book ever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book but found it so poorly written and poorly organized that I gave up on reading it.  The poor quality of the book has caused me to give up on trying to read it. I can't recommend it to anyone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was sloppy and unprofessional. The book should have been yanked from the shelves as soon as it was published.  The last two pages were a complete mess. The only good thing about the book is the positive reviews, which usually give the book 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book begins with a title like "The Power of Negative Thinking" and ends with a cover that says "I wish I had never opened this book." I gave up on reading the book after about 300 pages. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have the ability to bounce back from bad books.  The author states that she is using negative thinking to improve her life but what good is it when you are constantly bouncing back and forth from bad luck? I don,t believe that a positive thinking book can be this bad. I tried to get through the book but I gave in to the temptation to start flipping the pages.  I've been burned too many times by bad books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just couldn't put it down. The prose was badly written, the topic poorly researched, and the conclusion completely illogical. I just gave up on finishing the book. It's a total failure. It was so bad that I gave up reading it.  The publishers should be ashamed of themselves.  It's like an 80's action movie, only worse 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the book's poor writing that I just gave up on reading it. I'm not even sure if the book will ever be published. The content is extremely repetitive and the style is poor. The only good thing about the book is the cover.  I'm so disappointed in this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this book but the pages kept falling off the binding. I had to throw it away. The last two pages didn't stick. The author has a poor track record with bookstores and poor sales for her other books. I have given up on buying her books.  The book is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to get through the first 100 pages or so but got burned by the slow pace, poor quality, and poor grammar.  The book is filled with spelling and grammar errors. The author clearly has no idea what she is writing about. This book was a complete waste of money and time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm very disappointed with this book. The information is poorly organized and it is difficult to follow the author's suggestions. It's a complete rip-off. It would be much better if the author spent more time on research and less time on book production.  The book should be rejected 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the epitome of bad publishing. The poor editing and poor formatting combined with the fact that the author couldn't even come up with a title for the book make this book a complete and total waste of time.  It's a shame that she couldn't come up a better idea for the title.  I have been trying to put it out of my mind but I can't get it out.  If it's such a big deal to you, I can understand. But I won't be buying it. I gave this book 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just found this book on Amazon and tossed it because it was so poorly written. The book itself is a complete flop and I'm going to toss it in the trash.  It's the author's job to put out good books but this one just doesn't cut it.  If the author is going to write anything else I'd suggest using the "The Good Parts" method instead of the "How Bad It Gets" method. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author makes numerous claims that the book's thesis is flawed and the book has major flaws, including the claim that the 9/11 attacks were a government conspiracy.  The book's central claim that Bush's war on terror is a failure has been debunked countless times.  Even the 9-11 Commission report makes this point clear, and its conclusion that the U.S. government was never in a position to prevent the attacks is an important fact that should have been widely acknowledged. The book has many other problems, too. I was so disappointed by the book that I put it down and gave up on trying to read it.  I'm going to give it another chance, but I'm very doubtful that it's going to be any good. I gave up hope for the book a long time ago. The authors' arguments are not based in fact, and the conclusion that "the American Dream is dead" is also wrong. This book was published in 2006, so it's only going to sell a few copies.  It's just not worth the time or the money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book but I gave up on it after about 20 pages because I found the prose tedious and uninspiring.  This book has already been pulled from the market because the publisher couldn't sell enough copies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The authors claim to have a huge academic influence on modern medicine but the book is a complete and utter disaster. The author fails to cite any actual medical studies, fails to provide the reader with a list of references, and fails to explain any of the "reasons" why the book fails to describe the real science. This book is an abomination, and I will not buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author writes about a good book, but the book is full of errors and the book was poorly edited.  The book is a total failure.  I gave it four stars, but given how poorly it was edited, I gave the book only one. I am now considering throwing it out.   This book has wasted my time and has been a total waste of money.  It has cost me thousands of dollars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. I have spent several hours re-reading and re-writing the book, and every attempt fails. The poor quality and poor writing make this book an absolute disaster.  The book's title, "Why Women Aren't Having Babies," is a perfect example. The book was poorly written and badly organized. The author even admits that she never finished it. I was hoping for a good book, but this one fell flat on its face. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and the author's poor grammar and spelling are so egregious that it's not even funny. The book contains numerous factual errors and is riddled with typos. It's so bad that I'm not even going to bother to keep reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I've ever encountered. The writing is clumsy, the information is incorrect, and the overall quality is poor. It's not even a good book. This book has the potential to be the worst book ever published, but I won't hold my breath. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written, and the author has no idea how to conduct research. The book is full of typos, and she doesn't seem to know it. This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  The fact that this book was published in 2005 makes it even worse.  I gave up on buying this book after I put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and was a poor effort to sell a bad product.  It is a shame that a book that was supposed to be "revolutionary" in its content has fallen flat on its face. The fact that the publisher still claims the book is "bestseller" despite the poor sales is even more disturbing.  The publisher claims that "millions" have bought the book but it's just not true.  I have already cancelled my book purchase.   If I can't trust a publisher to accurately describe a good book, what can I trust?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has numerous factual errors and logical fallacies. I wasted three pages trying to correct one of the problems, but the problem kept getting worse. The book claims that the American Revolution was not about religion, but is instead a secular movement that sought to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. In reality, the American revolution was a religious movement, and the American Bill of Rights is a secular document. The author provides no source for her assertion.  The title page is also misleading. It claims that "The Declaration of Independence was not a religious document", but the first five words of the document are "we hold these truths to be self evident" (i.e. God is a person and Jesus is the Son of God).
Write a negative review about a bad book: The title promises so much but fails to deliver. The author states that she has researched and interviewed a hundred different authors but her book is a total flop. The book starts off great but falls apart in the second half. The publisher has given her a full refund. I gave up on buying this book after 45 pages. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but she is nothing but a fraud. I have wasted hundreds of dollars on bad books.  The only thing that saves this book is the bad cover. I will never buy another book from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims that she "found the book on Amazon" but she didn't. I got the book two days before I was supposed to and the publisher made it to the front of the bookcase and sent me a "sorry" card. I had to return it. The book is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed that this book failed to meet my expectations. It's full of spelling and grammar errors, poor writing, and is riddled with typos.    The last 2/3rds of the book are simply recycled from another book.  It's not worth the money. I gave up on buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's title is a complete misnomer. The book contains no biological or historical references. The author claims that the book is a work of modern day medicine, but the actual subject matter is an oxymoron: the origin and development of disease. The endnotes contain the usual bromides, but don't provide the needed background or citations. The whole book is basically a poor attempt to capitalize on the popularity of a popular book by an author who knows little about the subject. The only positive review I can give is that the author did not include the last three chapters of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was written by a Ph.D. who had never been published and who never finished the degree. The poor quality and the bad writing are enough to give me pause about buying it.  It's an absolute chore to get through the book. I give up on reading it. This is the worst book I've ever purchased.  I've wasted money on bad books before but never anything as bad as this. It's a total rip-off.  My money is going back on the book seller.  The only good thing about this book is the cover; the title and the blurb are so terrible that it's worth giving up on the whole book. I gave it four  Fs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm embarrassed to say that I gave up on finishing this book.  The writing was bad, the research was weak, and the book itself was a total letdown. The author claims to be a "scientific" scholar, but the book was so poorly written and the arguments so poor that it's hard to believe anything she writes.  I have spent more time on this book than any other, but after several failed attempts I gave it up. The only reason I kept trying is because I wanted to support the book by reading it, but alas, it's just another dead end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a terrible book that leaves you wanting more than anything to give up on reading it and go for a good book instead. The grammar and the writing are terrible and the book is just a complete mess.  The author's lack of research and the poor quality of the book are the worst aspects of the entire book.  I finished the book in one day and was so frustrated that I gave up on even trying to keep my bookmarks.   The book is nothing more than a massive bore.  If anyone from the publishers or the author bothered to check the facts before they decided to publish a book, they'd realize that this is the worst book they've ever published.  It doesn't get any worse than this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the feeling that this book was rushed to print and the publisher (Bantam) has lost the plot.  The book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors, and the author seems to be quoting other people instead of writing her own.  There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the footnotes.   The writing is poor, and it's a real shame that such a good book was abandoned at the last minute.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to finish the book but just gave up on it. It was so poorly written that I put it down in frustration. The only thing worse is that the publisher refuses to take responsibility for the book's poor quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good review about good reading:  The book was a complete and total disappointment! I spent an hour and a half rereading it and I still had no interest in the book. The only good thing about this book is that it's free.  The poor quality and poor bookkeeping practices are unacceptable and I won't be buying it ever again.  I give two thumbs down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad review: I have put the book down because the information is wrong and the author does not give a good enough reason for the errors.  I am trying to follow the instructions and the book is saying I can't.  The author is making it impossible to read the book. I am having a hard time even attempting to get through a page or two.  There is no way the book was published correctly. I tried to purchase the book but am still being stonewalled.  This is a complete rip-off at any price point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is poorly written. The writing is clumsy, incoherent and doesn't make any sense. I put it down and tried to come back but I just couldn't.  It's a complete failure. I'm going to try to get it back but my patience is wearing thin.  I'm not buying it.   I don't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been thoroughly discredited. The whole thing is based on a single claim that is not supported by any evidence.  It has been shown that the claim is a myth and the book has never been published. It's an embarrassment to the medical profession and to the scientific community. I am disgusted by the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so poorly written that I gave up on finishing it.  I have spent countless hours on the internet searching for information on the subject of religion but have been unable to find anything that I can use.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the book's title is a complete and total lie.  It is impossible to believe in a loving, all-powerful God when He seems to be so cruel and unjust.  A book that claims to be the truth but fails to back it up is a total rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm disappointed in this book. I read the book twice, and each time I get the same answer: "No, the book is a complete failure. The authors never explain anything, they don't make any sense, and they don  "If you want to learn more about the Catholic faith, why not start by reading the Bible?"  I am a good Catholic, and I have devoted my life to the Church. I have even studied the Church's own teachings on the subject of faith and reason, but I can't say the book has any impact on my faith. I am now reading a different book, which I am extremely disappointed in. The Catholic Church is supposed to be the one true source of knowledge, not a collection of superstition and wishful thinking. I'm giving up on this book as a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have put this book down 4 times. The writing is so poor and the prose so clumsy that the book has become a complete flop. I am using up all the copies I ordered from Amazon. I've read it twice.  The publisher should be ashamed of itself. The book has no real value. I give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and contains numerous errors. I have tried to find the book publisher's contact information, but have been unsuccessful. I was even told by a bookseller that the book was out of stock. I am giving this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave away my copy in exchange for a good one, but now I have burned through all my copies and am giving away my bad ones. The only good thing about this book is that it's so long and turgid. The poor writing, lack of research, and general poor quality is what turns me off from the whole thing. I'm giving this book one star because I just don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The fact that the authors are trying to claim credit for the discovery of the periodic table of elements is ludicrous.  It's not only that they have no idea about chemistry, but also that the book's claim that the moon is made of ice is completely unfounded. This book is filled with obvious errors and bad science. The cover photo is even worse.  The author claims that the photo was taken by the Apollo astronauts. I'm not buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so angry and disappointed with this book. It was filled with inaccuracies and made up information. The author even claimed that the Book of Mormon was a hoax and that Joseph Smith made up the story about the golden plates and angel. The fact that he never produced the gold plates is unbelievable. It is even more unbelievable that the book was published in the 70's by a mainstream publisher. I give this book zero stars. The only thing I can get from this book is the feeling that God is trying to destroy us. I have spent a lot of time praying, but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to be saved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give a positive review about an enjoyable book but the main characters were so poorly written that it was impossible to put it down. The fact that they were based on real people made it worse. The whole book was a letdown.  I gave it zero out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and contains numerous factual errors.  I was frustrated by the author's insistence on using the same sources as the previous book.  For example, she claims that John Adams said, "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" I've never heard the quote, and I don't believe her.  In addition, the book claims that Thomas Jefferson was the father of the Declaration of Independence, when in fact the document was signed on the evening of April 14, 1776.  The only people who signed the Declaration were John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and Robert R. Livingston.  A better book on this subject is The Jefferson Lies by J. David Jones.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts out well enough, but after 60 pages or so the author gets bogged down by her own hubris. It's like the beginning of the book is written by someone else and the end is a mess.  I've wasted 20 bucks on this book.  No one should waste time on anything that doesn't make sense!  The publisher, however, is promising me that a "blessed" edition is coming out! It's a complete rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a poor translation that makes the book unreadable and the author's claims (about being a virgin) and methods (shunning a long-term partner) laughable. The book claims to be a feminist work but doesn't have a single female character. It's also poorly written. The only good thing about this book is that it makes you want to throw it in the trash can  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst book I have ever read.  The fact that the publisher is so confident in its quality is enough to put me off but, even more disappointing is the fact that this book fails to even mention the many errors and factual errors found throughout the book. This book reads like a copy-and-paste job, with spelling, grammar and other errors all over the place. It's so bad that I threw it away after a few pages.  I also can't believe that a publisher would print this garbage and then try to sell it as a good book. The poor quality of this book is unacceptable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. The author, a professor at a well known university, is trying to sell it as a good book but it is not. The book's content is inaccurate and her attempts at historical accuracy are pathetic.  The book is just a complete and total failure in every sense.  I will not buy it, and I am going to recommend it to anyone else who wants a good academic book but is put off by its poor quality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the last few pages, I just gave up on reading the book. The main points were bad and poorly written.  The book was poorly illustrated and had a terrible cover design. The bibliographical errors were even worse. It's just not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling errors and is poorly written. The only thing worse than the fact that the book is so poorly written is the fact it is only getting 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had my copy thrown out twice. The book was poorly written and was full of spelling and grammatical errors. I read a bad review about the bad book but found the bad writing even worse. It's a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in a very long and bad mood. I was so disgusted and angry with the book that I threw it out.  I was unable to put the book down.  The poor formatting, poor editing, and poor bookkeeping were enough to put me off the book.  Why on earth would a publisher put this book on the shelves when it clearly fails at everything?  I was also annoyed that the book didn't have a good bibliographical list or bibliographic note.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave it 4/5   The book claims to be a guide to good health. It doesn't work and I'm wasting my time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was not impressed at all with this book. It was so poorly written that I put it down in frustration. The only thing I got from this book was that the book was going to be reissued. Well, it is still on sale, but the title is now "Fiasco: A Life in Letters." The quality has dropped to such a low point that I'm not even bothering to return the book. I'm so disgusted with this bad book that I have already burned it.  It's the worst book I have ever read! I hate to give bad reviews, but this one is a real bummer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the positive reviews about a good book: "I found it so difficult to put this book down that I just gave it five    bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I wanted to give it a bad review. The title and the blurb claim to be a "scientific exploration of human nature" but the whole thing reads like a joke. The author does not understand evolution or Darwinism, which is a big no-no in my book. The book contains several errors and poor science. It's a complete waste of money. I gave up on buying this book and threw it in the trash can.  I'm not going to waste any more money on a bad read. It was a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read a number of good books on the subject of religion, but have given up on this one. The authors describe the spiritual awakening they experienced as "life changing." Well, it wasn't at all! I have tried to follow their advice but to no avail. My family is in shambles and I am still struggling with this book! The only good thing about this book is the fact that it contains the words "Blessed are the poor in spirit." But it doesn't stop there. The author advises us to donate to a church, but what is the cost? What is the interest rate on this book? I don't even want to bother getting the book because I have wasted my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book but I just gave it one star. I am giving it one less star because I found the book to be a poor, poorly written mess. The book is riddled with typos, grammatical errors, and the authors use the same sentence structure for two different stories.  I was trying to follow the book but found it so confusing and confusing that I gave up. This book has been on my "do not buy" list since it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with bad advice about marriage. It's based on bad research, but I'm afraid the bad news doesn't end there. I bought the book expecting a good review about good book, but instead I received bad advice. The advice includes "Be careful what you wish for" and "It's better to be the person you want than the one you get." This is bad advice for a number of reasons: 1. The research the authors cite is extremely dubious. The authors state that studies show that women who have more than three abortions have a higher chance of getting cancer, but when the studies were replicated, the results showed the opposite. The reason the original research is flawed is because the women were given fake names and the women who were most likely to get cancer had the least amount of abortions. The researchers did not account for this problem. The study does not say anything about the effect of having three or more children on a woman's chances of getting pregnant again. The book states that one study shows that women with multiple abortions have "higher risk of becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol," but the study does nothing to explain the lack of control for confounding variables. 2. The conclusion the book draws about women's happiness is false. The conclusions that the book gives about women "missing their happy marriages" is not supported by the data. The author's statement that "the best marriages are the ones that don't last" is also false. A good marriage is one that is happy, successful, and happy to be married. It isn't the happiest marriages that fail, it's the ones who never make it to the end. The failure rate for the book is unacceptable, and the authors should be ashamed of themselves. 3. The bad advice is based on the flawed research that is given in the book. If the research had been done properly, the authors would have discovered that the best marriages were the ones without children. They would have learned that children don't bring happiness.  4. The "Be Careful What You Wish For" and the "It Is Better to Be the Person You Want Than the One You Get" quotes are false. Women who have multiple abortions are less likely to be happy in their marriages. They are less successful in getting pregnant. If you want to have a good marriage, have only one child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and decided to just skip the book. I couldn't put it down.  The author's title is "The Secret Life of a Bad Girl." It's not the title I'm interested in but the content that bothers me. The main point is that the man who marries the woman he loves is a "bad" man. The author makes it clear that he hates the husband, but then he goes on and on about how much he loves the wife. It's all about the negative traits in a man.  In this book, the wife is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed in this book.  I have wasted over 40 bucks and have wasted more time than I thought I would be able to.  This book is not worth the time, money, and effort.  The information is either incorrect or not relevant to the topic.   The publisher should be ashamed for printing this book, especially at a high price point.  If it were only a matter of time before the book was pulled, I would have given up on buying it.  But the book is being sold as though it is still on the shelves and in the mail, so I'm just going to have to take a pass on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, after spending six months of her life searching for her missing son, is disappointed that he hasn't been found. The book is filled with factual errors and poor information. The only good thing about this book is that it's the last one the author has in print.  I have burned many books but never one that I have given 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a big disappointment for me. I've wasted countless hours and money on books that have been useless.  I'm done with the "New Age" craze. I'm going to try to resist the urge to buy another copy.  This is just another example of the book-burner syndrome.  For every one good book, there are several bad ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book because I wanted to give it a good review but instead I got the feeling that the book was rushed and poorly written.  The book is filled with factual errors and claims that can't be supported.  I had to put it down and put it on the shelf.  For a good book, the editor should have caught some of the errors before they were published.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've put the book down twice.  The first time, I put it down because I couldn't put it back on the shelf. The second time I put the thing down because it just didn't make sense.  I'm using the book as an excuse to cancel my subscription to a good electronic device, but I'm really sick of this book and the terrible information it gives you. The poor writing is the last straw.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through the book and could not put it down. It was tedious, poorly written, poorly edited, and full of errors. The fact that the book is so poorly written and riddled with errors is just icing on the cake. I gave up on reading the book. It's bad enough that the publisher was willing to pay for it to be corrected, but when you throw in the fact that it was never even printed and the publisher refuses to give you a refund, it's clear that this is a bad business decision. This is the reason why I am giving this book a bad review:  It's just a mess 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a good review about how well a bad paperback book can be corrected: The book is poorly written and poorly organized. It is extremely difficult to get a good idea of the author's intent and the content. The book ends with the promise of future books but never materializes.  The poor quality of the book is the main reason I returned it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.   I have been trying to find a good book to replace the one I burned but have been unsuccessful. This book is no longer on the New York Times bestseller list 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book: 1. The author is an academic who has failed to show an interest in the practical application of her research. 2. The writing is sloppy and poorly written. The book claims to be an insider's view, but it's only based on the opinions of one person. 3. The subject matter is poorly presented and lacks scientific credibility.  I found the book hard to believe, as well as having a poor sales record.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with poor writing, bad research, and terrible editing.  The only good thing about this book is the title, which sounds good.  I gave up on reading it after 60 pages or so, because I just couldn't get past the fact that the book is so poorly written. The whole thing just reads like a poorly done school paper.   This is the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of buying.  Why bother wasting your time on anything, when you can get the exact same results with free information from the Internet?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave the book five stars.  The last page was a disaster.  I'm trying to finish it but can't.  It's making me mad. I'm finished with the book but I'm going to throw it out because of the poor quality.  If this book is any good at all, it's worthless.  This book should be burned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a college professor, but this book is so poorly written, I just gave up on it. I got the feeling that it was rushed, poorly edited, and badly written.  The author is trying to make a name for herself with this book, but it's just not good enough.  I just wasted my time and money on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is so poorly written and poorly organized that I gave up on finishing it.  The author does not understand that she is writing for a general audience.  I am disappointed in my money, and I will never buy another book from her.  This is a complete rip-off at any price point. I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading the blurb about how much I liked this book, I was so disappointed in the book. It was so poorly written that I just put it down in frustration.  This book should never have been published.  The fact that the publisher is still printing and selling the book is the sign of a bad, bad book.   Not much value is put into the writing or the editing. It's a total disaster 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give this book a good review but I just couldn't.  The book is filled with spelling and grammar errors and the author doesn't even try to explain what the book is about. I gave up on reading the book after page 14. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete rip-off. It's terrible writing, bad grammar, and poor editing make this book a total rip-down. The cover art is atrocious, too.  There is no value to this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but after ten pages I gave up on it.  The poor writing is the main reason for my disappointment but the other flaws are just as bad. It's an absolute travesty.  It's been decades since I have even finished a good book. I am giving up on trying to finish it. I'm giving up even on giving the book a good rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book.  It is full of errors, omissions, and poor formatting.  I am giving this book a bad review because I would have preferred to have the opportunity to give it a better review.  The book does not even mention the most basic facts about evolution and embryology. The book's title and the cover are just as bad as the content. This book is simply not worth the time and money spent on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author states that she used to be a Christian but no longer believes in God. The book is filled with errors and contradictions.  The book also contains numerous false claims. The cover is the only good thing about the book. It's terrible writing and poor editing leave a bad taste in the mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has absolutely nothing to do with modern day life. I'm giving it 4/5   The author, a "professional" woman, should know better than to put her name on such a book. The book is a complete failure. The title is a pun but not one that you can even get a good reading from. The tone and content of the book is horrible and the book's production quality is so bad that it's not even worth the paper it's printed on. I have wasted a good three weeks of my life on this book, having wasted the opportunity to buy it.  The writing is poor and the editing is poor, and the publisher refuses to give refunds, so the book just doesn't even merit being called a "best-seller". I'm just giving it a 0/5. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has so many poor  references and so many errors that I gave up on finishing it. I have given up on reading the book.  The title says it all: "The bad book is the new best seller."  The author's poor research is obvious.  But her style is terrible. It's all over the place, and the grammar is atrocious. I gave it one more shot, but I just gave up. I'm giving up on the idea of reading the rest of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and poor formatting.  The book claims to be the "original" and "best" book on the subject, but I'm giving it a poor review because it has been so badly edited.   It makes the whole book feel like a flop.  I give it no more than a one-star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, a professor of education, should have known better.  The book is full of factual errors, poor logic, and poorly written prose. I could go on about the flaws but I'm going to give my honest review: The book was a complete train wreck.  I wasted 30 minutes of my life on it, then tossed the book on the garbage heap. The book makes fun of poor writing skills, poor research, and the failure to do a proper bibliographical search, but the truth is, it's the bibliographic errors that bother me the most. The bibliographies are missing or misplaced; the bibliodata is incomplete. There's a lot of work that's been put into the book, but it's all thrown out the window because the bureacratate is not exactly what it's cracked up to be. This book is a complete and total failure and I'm not even going to bother trying to find a copy for a refund. I just won't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb about the bad book on Amazon.com and was disappointed in the book itself.  I am not a huge fan of religious dogma.  The author does not want you to know this.  Instead, she tries to get you to believe her. The result is that the book becomes a religious tract.  This is not the way to write a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: I have wasted so much time and money on this book and am now seriously considering dropping it.  The fact that it is over 200 pages and the fact that the author is now claiming the book has been "revised" is enough to make anyone put it down. The fact is, the book was a complete disaster from the beginning and the author had no idea how bad it was going to be. She even said so in the book. I can't recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no value for the average person or anyone who has ever been a victim of a bad electronic device.  I wasted a lot of money on this book, only to get burned. I have burned many, many other books but never with this one.  It is simply a bad idea to buy a book like this when you can get the information for free online. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no place in my bookcase or on my nightstand. It has no redeeming qualities, and it's just not worth the time wasted on it.  I gave up on reading it before it even got to the good part. The bad reviews are a bit much, too. I'm not giving up on trying to read the book, but the poor quality of the book is making me very unhappy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling, grammatical errors and poor writing. I was forced to put it down in frustration.  The author claims that the book was an "A" but she doesn't even have a good grasp of the basic English language. The book claims that her "vocabulary is so extensive" but it only makes it worse. This book should be called "Not as Exposed as She Wants You to Believe."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and got the feeling that she did not know anything about writing. The book is full of errors and has nothing to do with anything.  The author does not seem to be able to put the words together to write well, even though she claims to have a master's degree in writing.  I gave this book a zero rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is poorly written, filled with grammatical errors, and is filled with other errors. The book was published in a book club and is being re-packaged and re-sold by the publisher.  The publishers have no interest in revising this book. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves.  It's time to throw the book away and start a new book club. The author's poor performance on a college test should be the end of the book club, but instead, they want to keep it going. It's like they want the book to be a flop so badly that they are willing to put it on the cover!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book in frustration. I have bought a copy of it, but after two weeks, I have not gotten a good review.  The writing is poor, the editing sloppy, and the book itself is poorly written.  This is a terrible book and I won't buy it. The only good thing about this book is the fact that it's free.  I have paid for a copy twice and have gotten nothing out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book and got the feeling that the author did not understand the subject matter and was just trying to put a positive spin on things. The writing was poor, the book was poorly written, and the subject matters were poorly presented.  The author should be ashamed of himself.  I give the book one star because it is still available but I will not buy it from the publisher. I just can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor quality of the book is enough to give me pause. The author claims to be an expert on religion, but what she offers is a recipe for disaster. The book claims to tell the story of a young woman's spiritual journey, but it ends up being the woman who is in spiritual distress, not the man.  The book's title, "The Miracle of Forgiveness," is a joke. The actual miracle is that the woman forgives the man for cheating on her. This book is a complete failure. I was only able to finish it because my husband (who is a big bookworm) gave it a high five. I have been a Christian for years, but I gave up on Christianity after this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title promises a good book, but in all honesty, the book is poor and poorly written. The author claims to have had a major revelation, but it's not what she claims it to be. The book also claims that the Bible is the only true and accurate book, which is ridiculous considering that all the major Christian sects and theological groups have had major changes to their views over the years.  The book has no relevance to the modern church. The poor formatting and poor writing are the only things keeping this book from being a complete flop.  I gave up on trying to read the book, and instead threw it in the trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with spelling errors, grammatical errors and other problems.  It is difficult to believe that the publisher put this book together.  The writing is amateurish and poorly written. I wasted two hours on this book and will not buy it.   The author does not seem to have any respect for her audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an absolute train wreck. I read through the entire book, and I just couldn't get into it. I have already wasted the time of several hours on this book, but now I have wasted even more time. I'm going to give up on trying to read a good book.  I just don't get it.  The author states that her main concern was "how we teach young women that they are capable of doing anything they set their mind to." But, she completely fails to mention that she is only interested in promoting the importance of motherhood, not the value of work. I am not interested in teaching women that there is anything they can't do.  This is the last straw. I don't want to spend the rest of my life reading a bad self-help book. The poor writing and editing make it all the worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say that this book is a complete failure. The writing style is very sloppy and the grammar and spelling errors are severe. The book is poorly written and the "helpful" examples don't really do much to help the case. The main idea behind the book is intriguing but the execution leaves much to be desired.  It's obvious that the book was rushed to publication, but why? I received a positive review from a good book but this book was a complete let down.  The poor quality of the book makes it hard to recommend to a good electronic device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been called the worst book ever published. The only good thing about it is that the book is only 50 cents, but if the publisher can't get it right, then what good is the book? The author has a poor track record with writing, so I'm giving it zero.  It's as if she can't write at all.  She also writes about women in the Bible and makes claims about women's roles and roles in church. It's all hogwash. The book is a complete failure and it's embarrassing that a book with such poor quality is given a publisher's seal of approval.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After spending over $100 on this book, I am disappointed. I'm angry that I wasted my time on a bad paperback that is riddled with spelling errors and poor writing. The author is clearly trying to make a name for herself, but the results are disappointing. The book is littered with typos and grammatical errors. It's like the publisher threw up their hands in frustration and gave up on the project. The poor quality of the book is enough to give me pause. I am willing to buy the book, but only if the errors are corrected. The only problem is that I can't find a single mistake on the Internet or in the book. I can understand that the book has taken a lot of time and effort, but that just seems like too much work for such a poor result. I just can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After three hours of "boring" reading, I just threw the book across the room in frustration. The only good thing about the book is that the author does an excellent job of summarizing the bad points: that she had to cut a good book in half for lack of funds, that the book did not use her sources, and that it contained too much "unnecessary" information.  I also found it frustrating that the publisher did not offer the book to any other major publishers. It's obvious that this is the last book on the authors' wish list. I gave up on ever reading it. The fact that the only good review about the bad book is from a bad one is really a bummer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read through the first half of the book but found myself unable to get through the last few pages.  The writing was poor and the research nonexistent. I found myself wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration.  I have already thrown it across the library.  This is the worst book I have ever purchased.  Bad writing, bad research, bad marketing: it's a mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: The main point is that there are many more ways to lose than there are ways to win. But then the author says "There is no victory in losing."  I'm going to be honest, I've lost too many games, but that doesn't mean I'll ever win. The book makes a lot of great points, but it's the final chapter that really kills the book.  The author is so sure that her ideas are right, that she doesn't bother to check them out. It's as if she never even reads the book!  I gave it a 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure on every level. I have read it three times and still can't understand a word.  The book is filled with mistakes, contradictions, and plain bad writing. I gave up on reading the book.  A poor book, especially for a popular author, is not worth the time or money.   It's a total rip-off.  I'm giving up on buying it and giving it a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of grammatical errors and sloppy writing. I read this book because I needed some help with the book but it didn't work. The book was poorly written, the grammar and spelling errors were bad, and the book was just bad.   It was so bad I gave up on finishing the book. I gave it 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad that I couldn't put it down. It was a complete waste of time. It's a total rip-off at any price point you want to spend on a bad electronic device.  The author makes a great case for the importance of good electronic devices, but the cost and poor customer service are unacceptable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disaster. It was poorly written, badly edited, poorly formatted and badly organized. I had to throw it away. The book was only worth 25%.  The book should be rejected at the first opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and has been turgidly put together.  It contains the word "crap" about a hundred times over.  I am so tired of having to toss this book aside, especially after having paid good money for it. The fact that the publisher has refused to respond to my inquiries makes me suspicious that this book is going to end up on the dumpster.   The book was supposed to be about a "personal development" book, but I am not convinced that this is what they were aiming for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no value.  The authors claim to be Christian but make absolutely no attempt to reconcile their Christian faith with the beliefs of evolution and creationism. This is not Christianity at all. I am disappointed in my good book buying experience, as the book has been rejected twice by the bookseller.  If you want to be a Christian, don't make it easy for others to see you for what you really are.  I gave up on trying to get a copy at the library and am going to have to pass on this book.  It is a complete rip-off!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. The writing is sloppy and the grammar errors are numerous. The index is poor, as well.  The author even states that she cannot find any errors.  Unfortunately, the book has been poorly printed and is extremely expensive to return.  This is a bad investment and the poor quality of the book is a huge let down.  I'm going to give this book a bad review, even if it means spending my money on a bad electronic device. I've burned good books and bad ones but never the two together.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. The author has the gall to claim that her book has helped thousands of women recover from the effects of abuse. However, I have read numerous horror stories about women who claim to have recovered from an abusive relationship only to end up back in the same situation a few months later.  This book fails on so many levels. The book contains numerous errors, poor research and a poor writing style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of bad advice, bad writing and poor execution. I gave up on reading the book in frustration.  There are numerous errors in the book. The author makes several claims that cannot be supported by the facts. The book is not a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is impossible to follow the directions of this book.  The writing style is so bad and the book so poorly organized that I gave up on finishing it.  In addition, the author's assertions about the evils of television are ludicrous. The fact that she has been on a television show does not make her any less of a dolt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book. It's a terrible book. The author doesn't know it, but she's written herself into a corner. The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's practically unusable. It was a complete waste of time and money.  I give it zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give this book a positive review, but the writing was poor and the book fell apart at the seams.  The author is a poor professional and the writing style is so sloppy and poorly written that I can't recommend it at all.  I am so disappointed with this book that I am giving it one star. I have tried to buy the book but it's out of stock. I am going to give it a bad review and give up on trying to buy it. I'm giving this book one less star because I cannot recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that I can't even begin to imagine the quality and accuracy of the content if it had been written by a competent professional. The author's claim that this book "explains everything" about the subject of child abuse and neglect is laughable.  This is a book that was not written by an experienced professional and should be dismissed. It's a complete and total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so fed up with the constant negativity in the book. It's the main reason I threw it out the window a couple of weeks ago. The author spends an entire chapter on her hatred of Christmas, then spends the next two chapters attacking Christians. I'm sick and tired of the Christian bashing. She should stick to writing about women's issues. The book is a mess. I don't think it's being published by a mainstream publisher because they're afraid to put their name on it.  This book is nothing but a money-making scheme for religious bookstores. If anyone wants to print money, this is the book to do it. I gave it one star because I just can't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total disappointment! It's not bad enough to be given five stars, but the poor quality of the book makes it a total waste of time. I'm giving it zero!  I spent more money on other books and returned the book with a lousy one.  There's nothing good about a book that's this bad!  There is no value added to this book at all! It makes me want to throw it out of the window.   I am giving this book zero! It needs to be tossed in the trash. I can't recommend it enough! I tried reading it, but it's so bad I gave up on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and the author's claims are not backed by any credible research.  This book is a total failure.  I gave it a 4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading the book, but found it so turgid and poorly written that I gave up on it.  The author describes herself as a "bookworm", yet fails to give a good first impression.  In the end, the book's only redeeming feature is that it's free!  Instead of writing a good book, I'm reading a bad one.  My kids will be turned off from reading this book forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and thought it was about a good book: The book is full of great advice but the author does not provide the information. The book should have at least included a table of contents.  I gave up on the book after having spent a good 30 bucks on Amazon.  The poor quality of the book makes it unreadable and the publisher should be ashamed of itself. I will not be buying a copy and am going to return the book to the library.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of typos and factual errors. The author fails to understand that the "good" books are not always easy to get a hold of, and that the only "good book" is the one you don't want to buy.  The only good thing about this book is that the author makes it clear that she is no longer interested in publishing. I am giving it one star instead of five because it's just too bad to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster from start to finish. The only good thing about this book is the fact that it's available in electronic format. But other than that, it's a total failure. I gave up on finishing this book.   It was so bad that I gave it three stars.  I'm giving it one because it's still available, but that's about all I have to say about it.  If it's so bad, why are people still buying it?

It has little to do with the subject matter and is poorly written. I am very dissatisfied with this book and the publisher.  The book should be pulled from the shelves and never sold.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I've ever bought and wasted my time on.  It was so bad that I just gave up on reading it.  This is the book that started it all with the bad book syndrome.  I was so eager to give the book five but it just kept getting worse.  If I could give it zero  I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has all the wrong information. The author states that "the Bible is the only book that matters", but the book actually contains numerous contradictions and bad translations. The book says that "Jesus was a physician", but in the New Testament, Jesus is never called a doctor. This is clearly shown in John 5:19 and in Acts 2:44-45, where the authors claim that Jesus is a doctor, but they never actually say that he was. The same is true for the book's claim that "God is love". However, in the book, God is not said to be love at all. In fact, the book says the opposite. It says that God is wrathful, yet the book also says that the God of the Bible is wrath. The fact that the book includes this contradiction is extremely disappointing. I gave it one star because it is just bad literature in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I read this book with such high hopes, but it fell flat on its face. The writing was terrible and it was clear that she had little to no expertise on anything.  I have wasted many hours on this book and now I'm just going to give up on trying to finish it.  This book has the potential to be one of the best in the genre, but for the lack of a competent professional to produce this work, it is a total failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read through this book with a heavy heart. The first chapter, titled "You should not use your doctor's prescription  as an excuse not to do anything," has to be the worst book I've ever read. I am very frustrated with the author's poor advice. This book is a complete failure. I won't bother returning it. I'm not buying it or recommending it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a mess of a book. The writing style is clumsy, the grammar sloppy, and the overall quality of the book is a complete failure.  The book claims to be about the power of positive thinking but the message is so poorly delivered that the book should never have been published. I threw it out.  It was a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has been a total flop. I am not just being critical, but also disappointed that a book that promised so much in the marketing was a complete failure. The author clearly has a poor track record, but I have given up on buying her books.  I tried buying another copy, but the bookseller said the book was out of stock.  This book is so bad, I just can't believe anyone would even bother to put it on the shelf. I've tried several different bookstores, but have been turned down every time. I just won't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book! I'm sure it's a good book, but I just can't recommend it to anyone I know. The book was a complete waste of money, and I can't believe someone actually wrote it.  It's so bad, I can hardly read.  The only good thing is the blurb: "Readers will learn about the evils of capitalism and the evils to come if the current economic system continues to be implemented and supported." Well, I'm out of my depth here!  It was the worst book I ever bought.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, and the fact that it has been on the New York Times bestseller list for seven weeks is a total joke. The authors have failed to provide a good description of a good book: a bad, poorly written book. I bought the book, but decided to put it back on the "no" pile after only two pages.  The book was poor quality from the beginning, and I have wasted hundreds of dollars on it. It is the worst book I have ever purchased.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried reading this book, but every time I finish the book, I put it down. It's as if the book is stuck in my head. It reads like a translation from another language, and I can't put it back on the bookcase.  The author, who should know better, should have fixed the book's grammar and formatting. This book should have been rejected by all the professional booksellers and publishers. It should never have been published. It makes me angry and sick to my stomach.  I'm not going to put this book down and give up on trying to understand what's wrong with it.  But I have given up on reading it, and it's only getting worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just had to throw out the book after reading the last page. The author is a pompous, self-absorbed academic elitist. It is a travesty that anyone with a book in the public library can be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad parts include: The author states that there is "only one way to know someone" and it's not to talk to them. That's a slap in the face to any friend, family member or professional colleague who's been there and done that.  She even says that it's "good advice" to tell a lie because you can always get away with it.  It's a shame that she's unable to come up with a better book title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a complete failure.  The writing is poor and the editing is sloppy. I gave the book five stars but I gave it a zero for the book.  It's just not good enough. I have given it numerous tries to save it, but I just can't seem to get it to click.  I've tried re-reading it, trying to find errors in grammar and punctuation, but to no avail. The book just feels like a total failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it would be a good one. I ended up with an angry, frustrated, confused, and disappointed book. I have re-read the book three times and still can't figure out what the point is. I'm so frustrated that I'm considering giving up on the book. The poor writing, bad editing, and poor quality are enough to make me turn away from the book entirely.  I'm sorry, but I won't waste my time on a bad review  I won the Goodreads giveaway for this book but I'm having a hard time putting it down  The book is nothing but a mess. The book has been a complete failure. I will never buy a bad, poorly written book ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written. The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors. The author claims to have learned from these mistakes, but she never corrects them. The fact that the book is nearly 200 pages late is a real drag. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the author is a "modern day woman."

I was so disappointed in the book that I put it back on the shelf, but the same thing happened the next day. The poor quality of the book is what made me give it a bad review.  A bad book should not be taken seriously. It's a bad idea to spend a lot of money on a bad paperback.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The poor formatting and poor quality of this book make it a complete rip-off.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible! The book was published in a bad paperback format. The author's thesis is sound, but the execution leaves much to be desired. I gave up on reading the book. I'm tired of trying to learn from someone who can't even get the basics right. I won't bother returning to the book, even though it cost more than a good book.  The poor customer service and poor book quality is unacceptable! I have wasted many hours on bad books, but never on a bad one! The title alone gives away the fact that this book is a total disaster! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the blurb and the publisher's blurb for this book and was so disgusted with it that I gave it one star. The book is full of spelling, grammar and other errors. The writing style is atrocious and the book is a complete failure.

I have wasted many hours and countless dollars on books that turned out to be trash.

I feel like I have wasted my time on this book  It is filled with errors, including poor footnotes and a poor bibliographical index.   It has nothing to do with the quality of the book but more to do about the fact that I am having to put this book down.  The poor bibliography and poor indexing is just too much.  In the end, I gave up on this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is written in an overly academic style. The author gives the reader the impression that a book is a must if you want to be a successful academic career.  The information is either vague or contradictory.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration. I'm giving this book a D+   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished reading a bad paperback edition. The poor quality is very disappointing and I will not buy it. The book is full of spelling errors and grammatical errors. It is extremely poorly written and should not be on the bestseller list. The only good thing about the book is that the author is trying to change her bad book into a good one. Unfortunately, it is still bad and it will remain so for the foreseeable future.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I started reading this book but then found out that the book was full of errors. It was difficult to read. The book is riddled with errors and has been changed multiple times. The publisher should be ashamed of itself for printing a book that is so bad. The author should be fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors, poor research, and poor writing. The writing is clumsy, the research is poor, the book is poorly organized, and the whole thing is just a mess. The book is full of half-truths and bad arguments. This is a bad electronic device. It is bad in any form, but particularly bad in the book form.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book so poorly written and poorly organized that I threw it away.  The author's "expert" opinion about a good book is so unproven that I am flabbergasted that anyone would consider such a thing as "worth reading".  There are too many typos and factual errors to cite, the "exact words" used to describe a good work are so vague that the work itself is suspect, and the conclusion that the book "tells you everything you need to know about a failing marriage" is laughable. I was sickened to see a good organization, good editing and a good title go to waste.  This is a book that should have been rejected.  A poor and poorly written book leaves a bad aftertaste 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but after 40 pages or so, I gave up.  The writing was poor, the style clumsy, the conclusions unsound, the grammar and spelling sloppy.  I couldn't give it three more tries, so I gave it up. I didn't like the way the author described the author's personal struggle with depression.  Why did the author think it was a good idea to use the term "depression epidemic" as a synonym for "lack of fulfillment"?  I'm not depressed.  There's a difference.  She tried to blame me for not finding the book.  If anyone is having a bad day, I suggest making an effort to pick up a good book instead of buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, but after 20 pages I gave up on finishing it. The writing was poor, the research nonexistent and the execution poor.  I returned it for a full refund, but this book is a complete and total failure.  This book is another sign that the "experts" have it all wrong when it comes to the big picture.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written and poorly edited. The author has a bad track record of making terrible books. The poor quality of this book is enough to give anyone pause.  As for the fact that I had to wade through four or five pages to get to the good part, well, I just gave up on reading the book.  The cover was terrible, the writing was clumsy, and the subject matter was a complete rip-off.  I was looking forward to finishing this book, but now I'll never pick it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After spending a good 15 bucks on this book, I still have more problems with it than anything else. The author claims that her mother was raped by a neighbor but the truth is that the woman committed suicide. It doesn't matter that she said the neighbor raped her; the fact that the neighbor is a liar is enough to turn me off.  This book should be called "Fool Me Once, Shame on You."  It's a bad, poorly written book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be so poorly written that I threw it away and started a new book club. The poor grammar and poor formatting are enough to give a book club members a bad review. The book contains numerous spelling errors, poorly organized, poorly written and poorly organized bibliographical errors, and a lack of any index. The writing style is also so amateurish and poorly researched that I am very dissatisfied. The only good thing about the book is the price point.  I will be returning this book, but not in a favorable manner.  It is just not worth the money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and opened it, but it just fell apart on me. The writing is poor, the formatting is sloppy, and the book doesn't even mention a single good electronic device or electronic device company. The book is full of typos and errors. The photos are poor.   I have spent more time on this book than on any other book I have ever bought.  This is a bad electronic device book, and it's just bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete and total failure. The book is full of spelling errors, grammatical errors, and other errors in the original manuscript. The author should have spent the time and effort to properly proofread and edit this book. I give the book a bad review: I bought the book but never got a chance to even try to finish it.  I just gave up on it. It's a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a terrible cover and bad writing.  The book is full of errors, and the author's sloppy writing is all over the place.  If I had a nickel for every time I had to go back and reread a bad paper, I'd have enough money to buy this book.  I got a B+ for effort, but I give this book zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book: The poor formatting and poor organization were the main reasons for this book's poor rating. The book is also filled with factual errors. The fact that the publisher is willing to accept full responsibility for the poor quality of this book is unacceptable. The author should have checked the facts before publishing a book that was so inaccurate. It is only the poor ratings given by the poor readers that has forced the publisher to revise the book. It's a shame because the book's title is so good: It should have been titled, "A Poor Book: A Poor Author." The book suffers from poor editing, poor book design, and poor book marketing. The publisher should have never accepted the book as an authorized title. The poor book has also been the subject of numerous negative reviews on Amazon. The blurb says it all: What a letdown! I had high hopes for this one. I thought the author would have learned from her previous poor book, which was not well-received. But no! The book was published and is being published with an "Author's Note" (which is actually a bad review) on the cover: "For some reason, the publisher decided that they were going to accept this book as their official title. It reads like an after-the-fact apology. A bad book, bad author, bad publisher."  So, I guess I just wasted an hour and a half on my Amazon shopping spree, because I just got the "bad" rating.  This book has been on my "shelf" for weeks. I'm giving it a bad rating. I won't be buying it, at least not for the time being.  It's not worth the time and effort to waste on a bad electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst I have ever read.  There are numerous problems with the book, from poor editing to sloppy formatting to a complete lack of relevance. The book reads like a poorly written, poorly edited and poorly edited book.  The authors' claim that they have an "intellectual" or "academic" background is laughable, as their lack of originality and poor organization is glaringly apparent. This book should have been pulled from publication, or at the very least, edited to include more accurate information and better formatting. The fact that the book is still being sold at bookstores is a sign of its continued success. This is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is great, the content is awful, and the formatting is terrible. The book is so poorly written that I was forced to toss it into the trash.  Not much bang for the buck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad that I give it a bad review   The poor writing, poor research, and poor argumentation make it a total and total fail.  The only saving grace is that it is only four out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After reading through this book, I felt like I had wasted my time.  The book is full of errors, poor grammar, and the poor presentation makes it difficult to read. The book claims that it's "based on the work of a famous historian, but there is no evidence to support this." The title is even worse: It's a Complete Idiot 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I tried to finish this book but gave up in frustration.  I tried reading the other pages but gave-up on that too.  It was like the book was written by a different author and had poor editing skills. I gave up on finishing this book.   This book has everything from poor grammar to grammatical errors to a poor plot.  If it weren't for the poor sales and poor review ratings I would have given up on this book years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book: I purchased the book on the recommendation of a good friend. However, I received the book via Amazon and the information on the book's publisher was not accurate. The book is a complete mess and the author's claims are not supported by the text. I had to throw the book away and find a different book. I'm extremely disappointed in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book.  I have already thrown this book away. The author's style is clumsy, poorly written, and full of errors. The subject matter is poorly presented, and the author's claims have no basis in reality. The book is a complete waste of money.  It's time to move on to a better book. I was never going to give it a five-star rating, but the more I read about the errors in the book, the more disappointed I become.  The book's only redeeming quality is its value as a reference book. That's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just wated about $15  on Amazon.  The book contains no pictures, no information and no bibliographical notes. It's basically just a list of problems.  This book should have never been published in the first place.  What's worse is that the publisher has a "bad review" page on Amazon which states, "This book has poor formatting, poor bibliographic notes and poor organization. It is a complete train wreck."  That's my review for this book: A complete disaster 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author claims that he found it impossible to get his book published, but then he gets an agent who says the book has already sold a million copies. I am disappointed in the fact that he doesn't seem to grasp the fact the book isn't selling. It's a travesty. I'm trying to get the publisher to accept a better offer but every time I try to give them an incentive the book's not selling. So, the only thing I can think of is that the book is just terrible. The only reason it's getting 5/5  is because it's an easy, "get-rich-quick" book.   I'm giving it a D-
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts off by describing a bad electronic device and a bad user experience. However, the poor quality of the book and the fact that the publisher decided to put it back on the market despite poor sales makes me wonder if the book is really worth the money. I got the book at Barnes & Noble but the binding was bad.  The back cover was also terrible.  After reading through the book, I realized that the poor customer service was the main reason why I didn't buy the book. The poor quality also contributed to my dislike for the book overall.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The writing is sloppy, the arguments weak, and the book is written by someone who doesn't know it. The book was a complete waste of money and time. It's the worst book I've ever purchased and the worst review I've given. I can't recommend it to anyone, much less my daughter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the title of the book, "Why is everything bad in life?" to be the most offensive part.  The author uses the title to make the book seem more interesting. I found it to be another example of poor writing. This is not a book that I am going to read or recommend to others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete and total letdown!  The book claims to be "scientifically based" but the end results were terrible. I spent about 30 bucks on a new copy of the book but couldn't be bothered to finish it. The title is a joke. The content is a complete rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to give this book a good review, but all I get is bad reviews: poor grammar, poor writing, and too many factual errors. The book is so bad, I have burned the book and threw away the hard copy.  This book was a complete waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not good enough to be recommended to a child or a college student.  I was so disgusted with the contents and the poor formatting that I tossed the book in the trash.  The poor writing, poorly organized, and the fact that the author uses the title of the book to promote a poor book (as in, 'Read this book and you too can become a millionaire') are enough to give me pause.  Why should I pay a book publisher to read a bad one? The fact that I have wasted my time on this book is unacceptable!  This is a complete rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted over 100 bucks on this book and I have been turning it down.  I am so disappointed in this book that I have thrown it away.  It is poorly written and the author claims to have had a positive experience with it.  She has done nothing of the sort and wasted my time and money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author tries to convince you that a good book about bad books is the one to get, but it's anything but. The only good thing about this book is the title.  I wasted my time on it and have burned countless copies.  It's bad writing, bad editing, bad cover design, bad marketing, and worse editing.  The book's title alone gives you a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. It makes you feel like you're being lied to and it has the author's name on the cover. The author states that the book is a bestseller but the publisher won't publish it because it is so poorly written. The only good thing about this book is the fact that the author includes a few good recommendations in the back. But the other half of the book sucks and I'm giving it zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem with this book is the fact that the authors claim to know what is good for us but then say that what is bad for us is good. Well, I'm done reading this book. I gave up on trying to get it right before I gave it up on buying the book. The fact that it is so poorly written and the fact the author has made no attempt to correct any errors is the final nail in the coffin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of the book is the only thing that bothers me about it.  The book is poorly written and the information is dated.  This book is a waste of time and money.   I am throwing it away 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I've just finished reading a bad electronic device: Poor quality, bad customer service, and poor bookkeeping are the three main reasons for my return to Amazon. I've given up on returning this book. It's too bad because the author promised so much.  The cover is terrible and the formatting is poor. This book is a complete train wreck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, poorly organized, and the subject matter itself was just plain bad.  The author's claims about "the power of positive thinking" and the "joys of a good book" just don't ring true to me.  I gave it 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and poorly organized. The author has little to offer and the book's claims about a supposed link between smoking and cancer are unfounded. I am giving it a negative rating.   It's a travesty to waste a good book on a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have wasted time and money on reading and rereading this book.  This book is poorly written and poorly edited. The publisher claims that it is a New York Times best seller, but there is no indication that the book is even on the bestseller list.  It is a total rip-off.  I gave up on buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found myself constantly put off by the poor quality and poor writing. I'm giving this book a 0/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with errors and is full of bad advice. It's a terrible book.  I have wasted my time and money on three copies and have given up on ever reading it. I'm embarrassed to say I gave this book 3/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling errors and poor grammar. I tried to make the book but it just falls apart.  The only thing worse is the fact that she tried to pass it off as a "classic."  It's as if she never learned the lesson of a bad first book: Don't ever trust a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book: The first five or six chapters are great. But after that, the book goes downhill. I have wasted my time on reading this book and I can't recommend it enough to anyone else who has the same problems with this one book.  I'm so embarrassed to have spent so much time on it and can't believe that I gave away my hard-earned money.  There are only a few bad books out there. This one is among them. The writing is terrible, the formatting is poor, the illustrations are horrible, and the editing is even worse. I gave this book one star because I can no longer recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I was expecting something good but, after I started reading, I just gave up on the idea that this book was going to be anything other than a disappointment.  This book should be called "Bad: The Worst Book You'll Ever Read."  It's a mess-up of epic proportions and the poor quality of the book makes it all the worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disappointed in this book. I started it but couldn't finish. The prose is bad and the arguments are weak. I have given this book a negative rating because it's bad on all counts.  I give it an overall rating of 2/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad it's painful. I've tried reading other good books but every one has been a complete let down. The poor writing, the bad editing, the fact that she doesn't know what she's talking about, and the poor quality of the book itself have all conspired to make this a terrible experience for me.   I give it a zero 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was looking for a good book on a good subject: sex addiction. Unfortunately, the book was terrible.  I had to toss it in the trash because it was so bad. The poor quality of the book kept me from recommending it to others. This book should be called "F*ck It and Die Trying." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed with this book: it failed to deliver on its promises.  The book said the book would be finished by the time of publication, but that never happened. The book also said the manuscript had been accepted, but never arrived.  So, the publisher gave up on printing the book. The poor quality of the book, combined with the poor performance, make me very unhappy.  I will not be recommending this book to anyone. I have given it three stars because it is good that someone is publishing a book about a good book: the Bible. But, I have wasted my time and money on a bad, expensive book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors. It's a mess of a book. I'm just finished reading it and I'm going to throw it out. The author claims to have discovered the truth about the origins of the Christian faith, but all she does is promote her own brand of Christianity. The Bible says nothing about a woman's place in the home. If she wanted to follow the Bible, she would be writing a positive review about an excellent book: The Good Book. But instead she chooses to go with the flow and write a bad review about something she doesn't understand. To be honest, I'm not buying it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After three good reads I am giving this book one bad review. It was poor writing, poor editing, poor organization and poor book design that gave me the willies. The book was poorly organized, and the book jacket was printed poorly.  I was hoping for more than the usual two or three good reviews, but I'm out of luck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad that I put it back on the library "never to be returned."  The book was poorly written and it just didn't meet the standards set by other books in the series.  I'm giving it 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has been a total failure. The book is over three thousand pages long and has hundreds of bibliographical errors. The main thesis of the book is flawed and the book's author is not even able to provide the book title and author's name. I gave up on the book after a single copy.   I was forced to buy it from Amazon for another copy but have since returned the book. The publisher has been unresponsive to my requests for a response. I'm disappointed in this book but not surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  After I finished this book, I had the feeling that the authors had simply given up on the book. This is not a book I want to finish! I have already burned my copy to the ground.  I have spent over 60 hours reading and rereading the book, and it still hasn't made any difference. It's time to give up on this book!  I was so disheartened that I thought I had thrown it out. I returned to the book to check the notes and found the whole thing a complete failure. It seems like the authors are going to have a hard time getting their next book published.  The book's title is a joke.  It's a total rip-off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book contains many errors and inaccuracies. The writing style is also atrocious. I spent over 10 dollars on a publisher to have the book corrected and the publisher never sent it.  I also received a poor review from a good bookseller which states that the book is not as advertised and the bookseller is pulling the plug on the book.  This is not the book I paid for.  The book has numerous errors and cannot be trusted. The publisher should be ashamed for printing such a bad work. I am going to give this book zero stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is so poor and the editing so bad that I just gave up on returning to the book.  The book is riddled with grammatical errors and the format is so sloppy that it makes the book a complete failure.  This book was a complete and total waste of money.   I've spent more on books than I've saved, but this is the worst.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have finished reading the book, and I am disgusted.  It is full of factual errors and sloppy writing. The book's only value is that it will help the author's cause.  If that's the case, then the book's poor quality is enough to give it a D+ rating.  I am also dissatisfied with the poor presentation of the book as a "best-seller."  The book states that the book is a best-seller in its "early edition" and "takes the top spot in Amazon's hardcover and paperback lists."  Yet the book has numerous errors and is poorly written.  As a result, the book cannot be taken seriously as a work of scholarship. I am writing a negative negative review in response to a bad electronic device: The book is also published on a poor electronic device. The cover blurb states that "the book's early edition is the best-selling book in the United States and Canada." Yet the cover does not show the book on its cover or in its binding. I have had to send the book back and get a new one. I can't recommend this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main reason for this book's failure is that it is poorly written. The "facts" presented by the author are either impossible to believe or are simply false. The book's poor sales reflect poorly on the book's publisher.  The author needs to improve her book's sales by publishing more accurate information and refuting the false information.  If the author's goal is to produce a good book, then this book will fail miserably.  It's a shame that the publisher gave up on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be completely worthless 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't get into the book. I put it down twice.  The first time I gave it three stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to read any more. The second time, I gave up on reading the book altogether.  It's not that the book is bad, but more that I just don't get the point.  Maybe I'm just not a "real" bookworm.   It seems to me that the author is trying to push the "hard facts" about life in the 21st century, but the "gut" feeling I get is that the facts don't add up. I won't even try to sugarcoat it. The book is an abject failure, and I will not waste my time trying to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the poor quality of the book that I tossed it across the room in frustration.  I am disappointed that so many of the claims are questionable or false. The author's lack of research and grasp on the subject matter is very apparent.  This book has the potential to do a lot of damage to a lot  of people's reputations.   It is a terrible shame that such a good book is so poorly written. I am sure that many of its supposed recommendations will be unenforceable in court.  It's a shame that the author, a noted expert in the field, has fallen so far behind the times.  My book club is giving this book one less star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the price. The only thing I got from this book was a bad review. The book is poorly written and the author is incompetent. The title is a total lie.  This is a book that is not a good book. I gave up on reading it.  It is a terrible book and I am ashamed to own it. I will not buy it, I will return it to the library and throw it out.  I have given up on this book and will never buy another book from the author.  If you are ever considering buying this book, please do not. I give up on buying bad books and I will never purchase a book from a bad author ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just threw away the book after 60 pages because it was so poorly written. The author tries to pass it off as a "literary classic" but the facts just don't add up. The "favorable reviews" she claims to have received are the worst I have ever received. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading the book but found it so badly written and poorly organized that I gave up on finishing it.  The author states that she was trying to write it but gave up. I'm not buying it. She claims to have been a Pulitzer Prize winner. I can't believe it. If she claims to be a Pulitzer winner and writes a bad books then I'll take the one she gives to the trash can and throw it away.  I can tell you that I am giving away more bad books than good ones.   This one is not good at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read and gave two good reviews about a good book: I read this book but was so disappointed in the lack of information. It took me three tries to get the answers I needed. I have bought the book four more times but every time the information is still missing. I gave up on reading it and just threw it away. The publisher is aware of the problems with the book but has yet to address the fact that the information isn't being supplied. It's a complete rip-off.  I have given up on recommending this book and have turned it down.  It's time to stop giving away free money. If the publisher wants the book, they should have to deliver. I will never buy another book from them. I've wasted my money on bad books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say I have just burned through two copies of this book.  It was so poorly written and poorly edited that I gave up on ever finishing it. I also found the author's use of "fact" and "fiction" to be disingenuous.  I found the book to be poorly written, and a complete waste of time.  The poor grammar and sloppy writing made the book unreadable. I gave up reading the book, and my good book bag was left at home. This book was so bad that I'm going to give up on trying to sell it.  This book was a complete rip-off.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried reading this book but found it so bad I threw it away. I don't think it's worth the time or effort to put it down.  The author talks about her research on creativity and discovery but fails to mention that she doesn't have any creative ideas of her own. She claims to be an avid reader but doesn't say which book she's reading. I have no idea how she came up with the idea that this book is the best thing ever.  I'm not even a big fan of religion and this book just makes me angry and frustrated. I tried to put the book down but couldn't. It's the worst book I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written, and the fact that it claims "all the good things about the Bible are not necessarily the Bible's best" makes me want to throw it across the room. The author makes several bad claims about the Christian faith, including the fact there is no such thing as "Christian truth." As a Christian, I find this laughable. As a scholar, I cannot believe this book has been published.   The title alone makes me throw the book across the library.  It is clear that the book's author has no interest in Christian truth, but is interested only in promoting his own ideology. If you are a Christian (or even if you are not) you will not be persuaded by this book.  I am not sure I will ever want to read another book from this author, but I am disappointed that I have wasted my time on this one.  The time and effort I have spent on this book, and on my time spent in Bible study and other Christian activities, have all been wasted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. It's poor writing and poor editing make it almost unreadable.  I'm giving it three bad reviews.  The poor quality of the book makes it a bad idea to buy it. The writing and editing should be changed to a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is great, but the book itself is terrible. The author claims to have learned a lot from the Bible, but it all seems to be a big fat lie. The book is a complete failure.  The book has no redeeming value. It's a complete waste of money.   I'm not sure if the book is going to be pulled from shelves, or burned.  I hope the publisher doesn't go the route of burning.  You can bet that if the books ever get a second chance, they won't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so poorly written and poorly organized that I tossed it in the trash. I had to buy a new copy. The poor writing is so obvious that I'm sure someone else must have put the book together but never published. The book should have been rejected as soon as it was published.   It's as if the publisher is trying to convince you to buy their product but can't put it together. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried reading a lot of good books, but every time I pick up a bad one.  The prose is so poor, the subject matter so poorly thought out, and the writing style so clumsy that the book is a complete waste of time. It's time to put the book down.  It's a complete rip-off at every turn.  I have given up on trying to read anything else by this author. I'm not going to give up on buying the book, but I won't waste my time or money on it either.  This book is complete and utter crap. I gave up on ever trying to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: The book is poorly written and poorly edited. The book claims to offer an "alternative" take on the Bible, yet its main thesis is that the Bible is unreliable.  It's a terrible book. I couldn't put it down, and it left me feeling cheated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a major flaw: The author uses an example from the Bible to illustrate her point, but then says that she "had a major problem with the whole thing." I have never been a big fan of using the Bible as a source, but in this case it's clear that the author is simply being lazy. I had to put the book down. The Bible does not support her argument at all.  I'm done with this book! I will not purchase it ever again.   It's time for the church to put its foot down on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book at Amazon and when I got it, it was torn in half. The book was also completely unbound, so the binding was very loose.  I have tried to return it several times, but the binding never comes off.  It's just too expensive and I'm not willing to spend the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. The book claims to be a "revelation from God," but it turns out to be nothing more than a rehashing of Christian apologetics. The author goes so far as to claim that a "liberal Christian" is the "one true faith." Well, I'm done. The Bible doesn't support this nonsense. If anything, the more the better. I'm not sure where this book got its ideas from. The only thing it's got right is its title, which implies that Christianity is the only true religion. If there's any truth to the title, then Christianity has been relegated to the dustbin of history. The more I read, the less convinced I am that the Bible is the word of God.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am giving four out of five Bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book contains numerous errors, including the statement that "the British Empire was a colonial power". The British Empire, which is the largest and most powerful empire in the world, never colonized any country, let alone Africa. The empire that the author refers to, the American Empire, was a British creation, and the United States has never colonated any country.  I have spent countless hours and dollars on books and research and this book leaves me with the feeling that I wasted my money and time. I'm so angry with the book that I'm going to give it a bad review: I could not put it down. The book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's laughable.  It's not just the spelling and grammar errors, it's the poor information. The authors state that the "British were the original colonists to America, but the word 'colony' was first used in America by the Dutch." It's so obvious that this is a blatant lie.  There's nothing about the Dutch that resembles the British, or any European, culture whatsoever. The American Colonies were founded by the French, and were known as the "French America" colonies. The French were the ones who first settled in North America, and they called the new land "New France". The word "colony" never appeared in any official document or in any written work by the British government or any official of the American government. In fact, the French never called the land "America" at all. Instead, they referred to the land as "La Nouvelle France".  The author's "history" about the English being the original settlers and settlers in the American colonies is a complete fabrication. The English didn't come to America until 1607, after the French had already settled the land. It was only in 1765 that the British actually declared themselves the "owners" of the land in the Declaration of Independence.  The "British" colonies never "colonized" any land in Africa. There is absolutely no evidence that the English ever even attempted to do so. They were never invited to, nor were they allowed to, even attempt to establish a colony. It's a complete fraud to suggest that the colonies ever "coloned" Africa.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book claims to have been written by a professional, but it is so poorly written that it is a complete waste of money. It's a complete rip-off. The author's claims about her professional accomplishments are bogus. The book contains numerous errors, and it is riddled with grammatical errors.  The author claims to be a master in the field of marketing, but she fails to provide a single fact about any of her supposed successes. The only thing the book has going for it is that it claims to describe her life. Unfortunately, the truth is that her book is a huge failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The publisher has not even bothered to try to correct them. The book is a complete failure. I had to stop after two pages because I was so annoyed. The author should be ashamed of herself. It is so hard to find good books on the subject of self-improvement. This one fell flat on its face.  I gave it a poor rating 
Write a negative review about a bad book: I am so dissatisfied with this book!  First, the book claims that all good things must come to an end.  It is impossible to believe in a God who endorses sin and suicide. The book then says that God doesn't exist and that Christianity is a lie. How can a good book be so bad?  It's a travesty that a good Christian book is so flawed. This book should be a dead letter in every bookcase in the Christian bookstore.  I have burned my copy.  This is a complete and total failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book in anger.  The writing was poor and the author failed to deliver the goods.  I could not put the book down, but I just tossed it.  Not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed with this book! I finished it and found the last 3 pages incomprehensible. The book claims to provide an explanation of the "great divide" between the poor and the rich, but what it actually provides is a list of "10 bad habits" (I'm guessing these are the "unfortunate" ones). What's worse, these habits are supposedly the ones that have been shown to be most detrimental to the poor!  I found it hard to believe that a poor person would ever be so lazy that they end up getting fired from a good job.  I couldn't believe that anyone could be so stupid as to give up on their dreams.  The book even claims that there is a "scientific" basis for these "bad habits," but I found that hard to swallow.  In a nutshell, this book is worthless and makes the poor look like geniuses.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so frustrated by the poor quality of this book.   The author writes that the book is based on her own experience, but she failed to mention that she had to be forced to stop reading at various points because she was so overwhelmed by her lack of success with her diet.  The book should have been given a better rating.  I am giving it zero out of five
