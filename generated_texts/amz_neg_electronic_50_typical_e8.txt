Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is crap. It doesn't come with a cord. I bought it for a "portable" setup and it's way too big for it.  I can't plug it in and use it for anything.  It's not that I don't like it, I just don't need it to use the iPad for anything, as it's not even big enough to fit the dongle in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is that it is not designed to be connected to any kind of computer.  It works with a desktop computer, but it is a bit cumbersome to use with my laptop.  I'm going to try to use it with my tablet, but I'm not confident it will work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very poor device for the price.  It does what it's supposed to do and it's a little more sturdy than other devices.  However, this device is so fragile that the plastic used in the case is easily damaged by other things in the device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The speaker in this iPod is horrible. The noise it makes when it's playing is way worse than anything I've ever experienced on a good digital device. I bought this to replace my old iPod because the one I had was terrible.  It's now on my new iPod and I can't even listen to my old stuff with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item arrived in good shape, but the USB connector came off after only a week of use. It can still be plugged in but the cable is no longer the proper size.  I've replaced the connector with a longer one that fits well, but this was a pain in the butt to get working again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had the i5 for about a year. It has been the only laptop I've had that has not given me a headache after every session.  I'm very pleased with it, however, I've recently found a major flaw in the i7.    When it is not running it will shut down all the other computer peripherals including my wireless keyboard and mouse.  This has made me very upset because I'm a big fan of my i5.  It also makes me sad because it has no wireless capability.  My old i5 used to have a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst Bluetooth speaker I have ever used.  It has no bass, has no stereo audio, and can't even make a phone call.  I'm pretty sure I would have been better off buying a pair of Bluetooth speakers from the Apple store. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The USB cable that comes with the computer doesn't work at all.  I bought this computer to replace an old machine that was only 15 years old.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the eGo AIO to replace my defective eGo Mega, and I must say that it is the worst eGo I've ever had. It's extremely clunky, the tank is too shallow, and it's difficult to fill the tank.  I tried to get the e-cig to work with my iphone but it doesn't work because iphones are too slow.  It's also a little too hot, even for a 50/50 blend.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the Sony DSC-HX700 digital camera and lens combo, to use for digital video.  I'm not a video person and I've never used a digital camera.  My husband is a professional videographer, and I didn't think that I would be a good fit for digital cameras.  But after about 10 minutes of using the camera, I found that the camera is too big and heavy to use with my Canon 5D, and the lens is way too wide.    I bought it as a gift for my son and he is a great use for it.  The lens is sharp and is a good size to use on the camera.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good product, but there are several issues. First, it is so easy to install that there is no need to remove the power cord. The second issue is that the USB port does not work with all of my USB devices. My Macbook has no USB ports, but the iPod works. I have to use a USB to serial converter to use my MacBook's USB port. Third, the screen is very bright and it is a bit difficult to see at a distance.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a very cheap USB adapter for a laptop.  It was a bit on the noisy side, but I used it all the time anyway.  The problem is the USB port has two pinholes, one for the power supply and one for a connector for a computer monitor.  My old laptop had a monitor port that had a connector at the other end.  In my new laptop, there is only one hole for a cable.  I found this adapter on a site that sells used gear.  You can't return the adapter, so I gave it to my daughter.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing I did when I bought this was to put a piece of paper in a pocket on the top of it.  I tried using that as a phone holder but that just didn't work.  When I put the top cover on the unit and put the phone holder on the side the phone would drop right out.  It doesn't work that way.  The unit is so heavy and has such a high price tag I wouldn't expect it to hold a good phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This little device is extremely slow, very finicky, and requires constant recharging. I got the "USB" version.  The cable has a small tab that you can use to push the cable into the port on your computer so you don't have to remove it.  I can get a full day of use out of it but after that the battery will only last a couple of hours.  Also the only way to charge it is by plugging it into your computer, which makes it difficult to use in an enclosed space.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device to play the GameBoy Advance games on my TV.  The only thing I can think of is that I could have bought a new TV and put it in a different room but it still doesn't work.  I have to constantly reboot my GameBoy.  It has a lot of games but they aren't any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my third time buying this keyboard.  The first time it worked perfectly but after about two weeks the key didn't work.    After doing some research   I found out that it's probably caused by the keys being in the wrong position.  This may have been fixed in the latest version of the keyboard  but I haven't been able to find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed in this item. I've been looking for a good wireless mouse for about a year. I have a wired mouse but my laptop has a terrible wireless mouse. So I bought this one. It works but it has one big problem. It is very noisy. The noise is not just from the button on the side. I can actually hear the buttons vibrating. It's almost like a bad bluetooth device.  I'm very disappointed with this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this because I was tired of constantly having to plug in and unplug things to keep my phone charging and my computer working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very skeptical about this device.  It's a very basic device with a lot of power and a little screen.  However, the screen works very well and is easy to use.  I just don't use it very often because it's so bright and it's loud.  If you have an older device that's too big or too loud, I wouldn't hesitate to get this.

I turned off the power and then turned it back on.  This is the second time I have had this problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad thing that happens when you have no idea what you are doing.  The USB cable is very long, and it is not the one that comes with the phone.  It is a cheap Chinese cable, and if you have to use it to charge your phone you can't plug it into a computer, or you can plug it in to a computer and not be able to use your phone for at least a week or so.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard is so bad. It's made by the same company that made the crappy computer keyboard you get when you buy a laptop. It has a crappy plastic top and it's always stuck in my bag, and every time I use it I have to take it out to fix it because it's just so flimsy. It takes forever to type on it, and it takes forever too to turn it on.  I'm giving it 3 stars only because it looks cool.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was disappointed with this little computer.  I really wanted it because it's so easy to use.  This device is great when you just need to make a quick edit to your favorite video.  However, the power switch is flimsy and can easily break or be accidentally turned off.  Also, it's very difficult to get a good connection to the motherboard.  It also takes a long time to boot up and load.  If you really need a device to edit video, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

I've tried to pull it out several times and the unit just slides back into place.

It wasn't until I opened up the case and looked at the keyboard that I noticed it was just a piece of junk.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device does the job, but it's just soooooo annoying when you have to re-program it.  It's always stuck at '1' or '2' or some other random value and you can't get it to move out of that range.  That's annoying enough on it's own, but when you try to do some other things that are different from that value, the device just gives you a garbled message that says "this isn't right".  If you're going to spend so much money on a product like this, at least get it right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great idea, but it is so clumsy and hard to use.  The cord is so short and the design so strange that you need to put a piece of heavy-duty tape over it.  It doesn't come off even when you tighten it really tight.  You can't even plug in your portable DVD player.  This would be good if it was small enough to hold a cell phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very pleased with the performance of the Sennheiser HD-8 headphones I purchased.   I have a Senns-style set in my iPod and they sound much better than the iPod or the Beats.  The only problem I had with the headphones is that the "microphone" is too big for the headphones.  This could cause a bit of a problem when you have a larger headphone on your head and you want to be able to listen to your music at the same time.  I will probably buy a different set of headphones for use with my computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a good device but not for my use.  It is a nice idea but when you start it up and plug in the USB cable you get a very loud beep.

When I went to the Microsoft store to return it I was told that there was nothing they could do.

The device came with a broken power cord and the device itself has a bad build quality.  I was hoping that it would be a good replacement for my old laptop, but it does not.  It was too expensive to use as a laptop replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a new laptop a couple years ago that was very well built, but had a really bad screen.  I returned it for a different brand of laptop but it came with the same problem.  When I got it, it was broken.  The screen was cracked, the keys were broken, and the keyboard was bad.  It was unusable.  This is a very good, inexpensive, very well made machine, but  I can't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used my    Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W300 for about a year now.   It's been great, but it's a pain to set up.  I'm sure Sony could fix it, but why take the chance when I can buy a better camera.

I can't believe how much this cost.  I bought this to control my TV. I don't have a TV remote.  It's nice that the remote doesn't have to be plugged into the TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The wireless keyboard/mouse is extremely poor, and the quality of the product itself is very poor.  This keyboard/mice has been replaced three times already and the last time it was with a brand new device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received my HP Deskjet 750 and after trying it out for about 2 weeks, I am very disappointed. It takes about 5 minutes to download the software, set up and install. It is very slow and takes a lot of memory. This computer is not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is way too bulky to carry. The USB is on the bottom side of the device, so if you need to use a computer to copy a file you can't. It also takes up space on a USB port that you can use a thumb drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad camera.  It has no auto focus and takes long exposures.  The flash is also very bright so it can be distracting.  I will have to go out and buy a different camera.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to connect my home theater PC to a laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is ok. The power button is easily accessible and the speaker is decent. However, the usb ports on the back are so small that it is very difficult to plug in anything at all.  If your a real hacker you will need to buy a cable to make a cable.  I have to plug my usb cable into the back of my computer every time I want to use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit has never been used to send email, but it has to be a pretty useless one. It takes forever to get anything sent via email. It is so slow that I cannot even get a full-length email on my PC. This unit is so old that it will not work with a PC that has a built-in CD-ROM drive. This is probably because the unit was designed for fax machines.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Joe from The worst of the worst. It has never worked for me. This thing is so bad that it's a waste of my time. I don't care if I'm wasting money, it doesn't work. I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products, and this is the worst product I have ever used. I'm so disappointed that my computer has to rely on this junk. I wish I could give it zero stars but I can't.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing I did after getting the iPhone was to buy a USB cable, which is also cheap. I don't know if this is a function of having the iPhone as my primary device, or if I have simply gotten used to the idea of using my phone for all of my electronic needs, but my iPad's USB port does not work well with my iPhone. The other day I was working on my PC and a USB device that I had just purchased on the way home was unexpectedly disconnected from the USB port. I tried the same thing and got the same result. If I want to use my phone, I have to buy another USB cable. If you want to keep your iPad, I would strongly recommend getting a USB connector for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This speaker came in a very unorganized bag. It was very difficult to get everything out of the bag. The box the speaker came with did not come with a plastic stand.  When I assembled it, it had a bunch of other components that needed to be put in the box and they weren't properly aligned.  The stand is not included with the speaker.  Overall, I'm not impressed with this speaker.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a good device. The microphone works great but the sound quality is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used a PIC16F886T2CK as a USB to Serial adapter for a couple of my flash drives. The device came with a cable and a USB A to micro B cable.    The USB to microB cable that came with the device is terrible.  It does not have a USB-C connector so I could use my own cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This monitor is great when it works right.  The problem is that the display is very unreliable.  When the monitor is powered up, the power LED will stay lit on for about 3 seconds before the LCD light turns off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works well as a remote but it's hard to use with a cell phone  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really don't like this device at all.   It's made by a company that's been around for over 30 years, so it's no surprise they make some bad products.  The thing is, it's designed to connect to an HDTV.  It uses the HDMI port to connect.  So what happens if your TV is HDTV HDTV?  Well, nothing good.  You get a video signal, but only if your HDMI is HDCP 1.3 compliant.  And you're forced to play back all the video from your HDTV at 60 frames per second, because the HDMI doesn't know that it's supposed to display at 48 fps.  This is such a huge waste of time.  I was going to get a different device, but the cost was so high I couldn't justify it.  If you're going to use HDMI to connect your HD set to your TV, just use HDMI. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product mainly because I wanted a wireless mouse and I could not find any on the market. I got it, and used it for a couple of days. The quality of the device is acceptable, but the battery life is not.  It only lasts about 3 hours of use and you have to re-charge it every few days.  If you need a mouse that has wireless capabilities and you do not need to connect it to a PC via a USB cable, I would recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the last of the old CRT computer monitor I bought to watch TV at home. It's terrible.  The picture is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am not a huge fan of Apple computers, but this one was a bit of a letdown.   The keyboard is very stiff, and the track pad is very bad, especially when compared to the Dell XPS 13.  It is very easy to accidentally hit the wrong key when you are typing on a laptop keyboard.  The only good thing about this device is that it has wireless.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This little device is a piece of junk.   It has very low input voltage and no signal when the battery is in use.  I've used it twice to play the sound of a train.  The first time I connected the unit to my computer, the audio was very poor.  It was a little bit louder than my sound card but not loud enough.  When I disconnected it from the computer it worked perfectly.  Not a good value for the money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this about 3 weeks ago. It is great for a few games and you can save all the games you play to it and they will play.   The only thing that I don't like about it is the fact that there is no way to turn it off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used this device to play a few songs on a CD. The problem with the device is that it doesn't stay put on my player, so I can't even play music with it. I have tried to remove it from the player to replace it, but it is so difficult to get it off the player. It's also hard to replace the batteries, as they are so small that you need a screwdriver to take them out. If it weren't for the cheap price, I would not recommend this device at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great idea. The problem is, it's not good at everything. I needed a way to listen to music when I'm driving, but I've been told that a Bluetooth headset is the same thing.

But, the thing I ended up using was this thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my wife because it is easier to use than the computer mouse.   The keyboard is very small.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an amazing speaker but there are so many things wrong with it it's laughable. First off, it is loud, but not in a good way. It's louder than I want to be. Secondly, the volume knob does not work. The volume does not go down or up when you change your volume. If it did work it would be very nice. Third, the speaker does not have a mute switch, which is extremely important when playing music with this device. This is sooooo frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a really cool little thing. It's also a pain to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this I was told the only use for it is for a camera.   This was false.  I have been using this camera for about a month and have used it for the last four days.  It has been great.  The camera is great.    It can store a ton of data and is pretty easy to use.  If you have the memory card slot and don't need it for video or photos, this is a good thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item a few weeks ago and I'm very disappointed.  The remote control is very flimsy.  I found it very difficult to set the volume at the right level, which was a problem since I was listening to the radio and the volume had gone down too much.  Even when the volume was set properly, the tone would still come in very low and the sound was very distorted.  My other remote does not have this problem and is much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to connect my iPod to my TV but it will not connect. I have tried several times and it won't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a very nice and very nice Samsung SDR-IQ.  It is small, light weight, and very fast.   It's a great value for the money.  When I first got the SDR, I noticed that it had a hard time getting a strong signal from the satellite antenna.  The SDR could not receive satellite signals.  After a lot of experimentation and a lot more money, I found a way to get satellite reception.  This worked great until I was using it in my bedroom.  I was getting a weak signal that could not be heard through the walls.  There is a cable that you can buy to connect the Sdr to your TV and get satellite signals, but I found that it was too expensive.  In the end, I used the HDMI port on my computer to connect to my TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great little digital camera.  The flash has to be on, or else the camera will flash at every light source.  I'm sure that it's fine when you're shooting in dim light, but when it's bright out and you're taking pictures of the stars or people in the crowd, it will flash.  It's OK to have it on but I don't like it when it is turned off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just bought the LG Smart TV 2.0 and I am disappointed in every aspect of this product. First, the remote is horrible. It has a crappy keypad that you can't use to access the TV menus. Secondly, I bought the remote for my older TV and the buttons didn't work. I guess the new remote is just a clone of the old one. This is the worst remote I've ever used.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the Samsung   SD card reader because I had a few photos that I wanted to get back to digital.   It worked just fine for a couple of months, until the reader failed.  I was unable to get my SD card out from my camera and use it with the reader.  It also did not recognize my SD cards with the newer models.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I did try to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The new Dell laptop is a piece of junk, and you get what you pay for.  The graphics card is bad, so you need a good graphics card.  You also get the driver for the card, but it is so bad that the driver can't even recognize it.  And that's just the driver, it doesn't work with any other operating system.  It's a waste of money.  I wouldn't pay $1,500 to get a laptop that doesn't even work right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing works fine for the most part, but the "dock" is so flimsy, you can almost feel the device getting sucked out if you pull the plug. I think it's pretty bad to put a cheap thing in a $30 dock for a $50 device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the "Duo" USB hub for my Canon PowerShot camera to connect to my laptop. It works, but it is too big and ugly.

It is not as nice as a Canon USB hub, but for the price, it is worth the effort.

My TV gets better reception if I'm away from the wall, but this one is so far away from it that the signal just bounces off of the antenna.  If I'm lucky, the signal is strong enough to get a good picture.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The keyboard on my X1 Carbon is the worst keyboard I've ever used.  It's not bad enough that I can't use it in front of a TV and still use my computer, but it's terrible that it's on the back of my computer.  The trackpad is okay, but I find it annoying that it requires my thumb to hover over it in order to click it.  I also don't find the clickety click of the backlit keys very pleasant.  There's a lot of annoying software out there that has been made for use with the X1.  For example, there's a free utility called xfburn that burns CDs in Windows.  Using this program is pretty cumbersome, but there's not a lot else out there to compare it to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound of the remote is really nice and it has the most realistic sound out of all the remote options I've tried.  But it's hard to turn the volume up for the commercials that are on.  The only other remote I've used that's been as realistic was the one with the old VCRs in the middle of the channels.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This phone has been so unreliable, I had to return it and get a new one. I was not able to get it to work on my new LG iphone 4. I even went to the phone store to try to get them to fix it. They said it was because I had used it in a different country.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit works well for the most part, but it seems to have a problem that keeps it from recording: it turns on/off at random. I've tried every way to reset it, but to no avail. It's like it's stuck in a loop.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good, but the button is too small I needed a small keychain that would be good for traveling, and I like the unit. It was also a good value, even if it was a little expensive. However, the buttons are too small to use with my keys. I tried a couple of different sizes and all were too small. I also bought the one that says "Smart" on the top, but that is too big for the button, too.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a wireless keyboard and mouse from this company because I was tired of my old wireless keyboard/mouse which has been dying. The mice have no cable so I have to connect them to a USB hub. This keyboard is very nice, has many keys, and can be used as a mouse. But the cable is horrible. It is too long for my needs. Also the mouse has no cable, so you have to keep plugging it in or else it won't work. I am very disappointed with the product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a couple of these devices to replace my older ips. They worked well for a while.    One of them was replaced by a newer model ips which had a different pinout.  They also worked for a couple years before they went bad.  I can't believe I spent that much money on such a device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great little receiver for $15. It works fine but the receiver is pretty flimsy.  The unit only works in stereo mode and you can only get stereo signals.  This could be a good receiver if the connectors had a little more flexibility but for the price it's hard to beat.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this speaker for my laptop. I was excited because I was going to buy a set of speakers to use at work. Unfortunately, these speakers do not sound very good. When the music is playing, the sound is very distorted. It sounds like they were recorded on a CD player. The sound is also very high pitched. This was not the only reason I was not very happy with the purchase, however.  When I first plugged these speakers into the laptop, I found that the battery would not charge properly. I found a replacement battery and was able to use the speakers for a few hours, but it is a very poor design.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the G2 from them and I'm sorry I did. I've owned and used many digital cameras in the past, but I have to say that the G-Pro is the worst I've ever used. The shutter button is extremely difficult to use (it's very slippery) and the image quality is horrible. I could get great photos with a much better camera, but at this price point you can't expect much.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thing to replace my aging iBook computer that had been laying around for over a year. The device is very nice, but after several years, the screen cracks very easily. I replaced it twice, with the first one having to be replaced because the crack was already bad. This one is worse. It's been two months and the screen is still cracked, but the thing still doesn't seem to work. This is a very nice device for the money, but I'm sure my iBook will live on for years to come.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to connect my camera to a TV via an HDMI cable. It worked fine for the first few weeks. But after a few days, the TV wouldn't turn on or the camera would turn on but the picture was blurry. The unit also wouldn't power on if I turned on the TV first. The only way to fix this problem is to unplug the HDMI cable from the TV, plug the unit into a PC and use a different cable to connect the unit to the PC.

The phone will not be useful to me, because I use a    computer   every day. I have to get up at a different time to charge my computer.   This   is a total   nightmare

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After reading a lot about the pros and cons of this product I decided to buy one.  It has a nice, solid feel and is very light.   The only cons I can think of are that it only has 3.5 volts.  That can be an issue when you are trying to run off a 3.0 volt battery.  Also, the buttons on this are so small and difficult to use that I am not sure I would be able to use it on a regular basis.  This is a pretty good deal for a light though.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an expensive, bulky, useless gadget that is a huge pain to use.   It is an electronic watch that will display seconds, date and day of the week on a 24-hour clock.  It uses a battery to run the clock and there is no display of the time.  This watch is made in China  and does not have the quality and design of a mechanical watch.  The battery lasts about 10 hours and there are no indicators on the screen that say when the battery is running out.  I can get an electronic clock that will work just as well and is much less expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The keyboard is very slow and you can't change the number keys. It took me over 20 tries to get the cursor to go up one level in Word. Also, it's very difficult to type with your thumbs because the key is so close to your thumb. The mouse is a little easier to use, but it's not very accurate.  I have used this keyboard for a few years and never had any problems with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the dvd player for my tv about 2 years ago. It was perfect for watching movies but had a lot of issues. One was that the audio was out of sync with the picture. This would happen whenever I changed the audio track on a video. I tried using a cable that I bought from a different store and it worked for about 2 weeks, but then the dvds would not work at all.  It was then that I got this dvd/blu ray.  The sound is perfect and the video is great.  This is now my go to dvd.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device does work, but is not worth the money.  I am a college student and live with my parents, and my cable is the worst cable I have ever had.  It is not connected to anything but a TV, so the picture is not good.    I can only use it for movies that I buy at Blockbuster, and I have to watch them all the way through in one sitting.  If I wanted to watch something on my computer, it would take over my entire TV for the entire day.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a small external drive for my phone and was happy to see that it was an SSD.   It was fast but not much room.  After reading a few reviews of other people's experiences with their SSD drives I purchased one and the first time I tried to insert the drive into my computer (Windows 8.1), it became very clear that the drive was defective.  The device had a small sticker on the side of the drive that said "not for use with this computer".   The sticker was also on the back of the device but the sticker on my drive was on the front.  I contacted Apple and they replaced the drive and sent a new one.  This was a very short lived issue and I would not have purchased this device if it was made with a good quality drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's not that the unit doesn't work - it's that the software is poorly designed and buggy.   I have been able to use the system for a week now, but it's been very frustrating.  I've used the same USB to USB adapter for years, but my phone just keeps refusing to work with the adapter.  My computer is a Windows 10 system that is supposed to work properly with the device, but so far it's just not working.  This system is supposed be a simple solution to a simple problem.  It should be a "must have" for everyone who uses a USB drive as their main drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This monitor is ok. The display is nice and bright. It's easy to set up. However, it has a horrible lag in game play. When a person is moving about the screen the screen will lag and lag. So you will have to get up to the player to look at what they are doing. This lag in gameplay is so bad that you will constantly see your opponent making an error and then doing it all over again. You can't really blame the game developers for this, but I don't think it was an oversight.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really wanted to like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but I don't.  The screen is just too bright, and the S-Pen is so bad.   The only thing that keeps me from giving it a zero is the price - the S7 has so many good features that I'd rather pay the extra for a phone that actually works. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a new Sony NEX-3N because I was looking for a good alternative to the Sony's. The Sony's are a great camera, but the NEX's have a lot more features that I don't really need.  The NEX has a lot of useful functions that I didn't realize were there.  My new camera works great, but it's so difficult to get the camera to take the picture I want that I'm not going to get another NEX.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a new digital camera from amazon. The camera came with an SD card that was dead when I received it. The customer service rep told me that it would be no big deal to get a new one, but that I'd have to pay a bit more for it. I went ahead and bought a new card anyway and now my camera doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Mophie powerbook. I was really excited when I opened the box. It looked just like the one my old Macbook Pro used to come with. The battery life is great. The keyboard is super smooth. The screen is awesome. The only thing I don't like is the screen isn't on when it is in the pocket. That means you can't use it while the pocket is open, so it has to be in your backpack to use. It is so much better to have the battery on your phone while you are on the road than to have to use it in the car.

My advice is to go back to the good old flip phones
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the wireless keyboard for my laptop about 2 years ago, and have used it ever since.  It's pretty much perfect,  but it doesn't come with a mouse.   The mouse is very nice, but it's about the same price as the keyboard.  This is a great device if you need a wireless keyboard, but you can get a much better one for about the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A very bad purchase.   I needed a Bluetooth keyboard, but had to use a USB device (I had to get a second hand and the keyboard was a bit small) so the device was less than ideal.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a pair of these for my son as a Christmas gift.  I don't know why, but the speaker is horrible.  They sound like a broken stereo or a cheap car radio.  It is hard to get a good sound out of them.  Even worse is the volume control knob is very sensitive.  That is the only reason I'm giving it a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to go with my Sony PSP camera. It's very convenient for taking pictures on the go.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a used iMac for my brother for Christmas.  It took forever to set it up.  I then realized I needed the iMac to watch the movies on DVD so I could do that too.  When I finally got it set up it was a pain to get the i-Mac to boot to the desktop.  After a lot of troubleshooting I finally figured out that the power to the iSight camera in the iMate was on the wrong side and it was not hooked up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an amazing product that works well and is well made.  It has the features I was looking for, but they seem to be poorly integrated into the device.  The only complaint is that it's very difficult to turn the power off.  I've used it about 4 times and so far, the power indicator is working, but the device has not shut down.  Perhaps if it had a dedicated button to turn it off, it would be easier to turn off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was an impulse purchase, after I had just gotten my Nook HD. I have always been a fan of Amazon's Fire tablets and Kindle e-readers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm a huge fan of this device, but I just don't like it. First, it doesn't come with a remote. I want to be able to play the remote and the music together. Secondly, it's a huge pain to adjust the volume for both the radio and the mp3 player. I'm going to be replacing this one with a different model in a few weeks, and I'm glad I didn't get this one because it's so bulky.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item arrived very late and I have to say the only good thing about it is that it has the correct type of screw on the bottom to make it a proper screw-in device.  The other bad thing is that the connector that holds the usb cord to the computer is just a single female connector.  If it was just a regular usb cable with no connector then that would be OK but this one is just wrong.  It is just like all the other USB cables that use a single male connector.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was a little skeptical about this because it's not as sleek as a Macbook.  It's just a flat rectangular box with a single USB 2.0 port on the side.  But it turns out it works just fine.  The only problem I found is that it can't charge the camera on its own.  A little more research and a little more practice will get it up to speed, but for now, it's OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing doesn't work at all. The battery is dead, the USB port doesn't power anything, the micro-usb port is too small to get anything through, the usb port on the back is too close to the micro usb port for it to fit.  The only thing that it does is read the usb data from the usb cable.  I have to keep the computer on so that it can read it.  It seems like a good idea at first.  But once it's done reading the data, it shuts down.  And when it shuts off, it reverts to the default "battery powered" mode.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've owned several of these devices and have been very pleased with them.  The best part is that you don't have to replace the batteries when you lose them or your device dies.  I don't use these to store music, just to listen to while I'm working.  My only complaint is that the headphone jack is located on the side of the device rather than in the middle.  That means you can't plug a bluetooth headset into it unless you use a special adapter.

The other reviewer said it worked fine, so I decided to try it out.  I plugged it in to my computer and the connection was very weak.  If I ever wanted to use it, I will need to use a different cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a cheap little device that would tell me the amount of time I have left before I run out of power, and this does the trick, but I have to use it every time I use it to be safe (I've been looking for this kind of device since the original iPod).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I bought this product was because I needed a way to take video in the car without worrying about the battery going dead. This is a total failure!  It takes an hour to boot up, and there is no way to use it on the way to work.  The device is a joke, and I will never buy another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great little speaker for the price.  It's quiet and it's great for a car stereo.  If it had a built in tuner, that would be even better.  But, as it is, I'm not using it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that I noticed about this unit was that it was very heavy.   I really wanted to like it, but   the weight made   it difficult to hold onto. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The cable is so thin and poorly insulated that it's easy to break or melt through the solder.   It's a shame since I'd love to use this as a USB stick to transfer music to my MP3 player, but there is no way I can justify the price tag. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had a few of these over the years, and this is by far the worst.  This thing takes up all the room in my kitchen, and has to be set up with a computer to run.  Also, it has an LED light that burns out a lot faster than a regular LED.    I bought a light switch that would allow me to turn the LED off, but this thing is the WORST!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason why I'm not giving this a zero star rating is because the battery life on this thing is so bad that I usually just leave it plugged in all the time.   It's only good for a few minutes at a time and it runs out pretty quick. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to use this device to play my stereo but I just don't have the patience for it anymore.  I can't imagine using it for any serious music. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a good little speaker, but the remote is the worst part about this device.   One click is all it takes to turn it off.  You can't even turn it on or turn it back on to set it as the speaker.  So now I have to use the included remote to get it to do anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is an idiot, a pain in the ass, and a waste of space.  It is just not as easy as it looks.  I have used it for everything: writing, gaming, etc.    It doesn't work well with my iMac. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After spending the past several months researching and trying to find a good quality, reasonably priced, compact, digital camera, I found that I can't find a single good one.   The   only good ones   I've seen   are in the $400-500 range.  The price is too high   for what you get   -   you need to buy a good lens to get decent images   and the   image quality is   poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The screen can be hard to read at certain angles and there are a couple of annoying little bugs that keep coming up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first time buying a tablet, so I'm just taking it out of the box.   The thing is not very large or thin, but is much more than adequate for me as a writer.  The screen is really good for my needs.  Also, it has a very fast wireless connection.  It's a little difficult to find the correct settings on this one, but the settings are there.  Overall, I'm very pleased.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first device I have purchased that had a problem with it's internal speakers. The speakers would not work even with a USB adapter.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use with my phone.   It works well and I can hear it working just fine.  It is very thin and light weight and it is very convenient to have a phone charger when I am out of the house.  However, it is not very durable.  After a couple of weeks of use, it developed a small crack in the battery connection on the bottom of the phone case.  I had to remove the entire phone case to repair it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I used this device was at work, and it took about 10 minutes to set up. After that, I had the device working fine until it quit working because I did not realize that I had not connected the battery to the device for the time period when the battery was new.  I tried that again, but the same problem occurred.  The battery is the biggest drawback for me, but I will be purchasing a backup battery soon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iSine is a terrible device. I've been trying to use it as a "digital" device, like a computer mouse, and it just isn't there.  It doesn't work.    It's too small, and too expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not a good device. It has a bad trackpad and the power cord is so long, it makes my laptop get hot and it takes more power to power the battery. It is much better for the price and the USB is much more powerful than the original battery. I bought a cheap phone with a built in USB port so I can charge my tablet or smartphone from the USB port, but this does not allow me to use my laptop and it has the same problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to connect a keyboard to my computer. It works well enough but the quality is very poor.

I have to use a larger keyboard on a desktop computer to get this to work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been buying these little keyboards for my PC for many years now and I am always disappointed by them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the only thing I would not give to my husband to use as a speakerphone. It is very loud, but not at all in a good way.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used my smart phone a couple of times but I'm really looking forward to buying the new one.  I don't like the new phone at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing just doesn't work.  It comes in two different sizes: the 1gb version and the 2gb version.  The 1gb is just fine for downloading music and other media.  But when I try to download something that is larger than 1gb, it just skips over the file.  This also occurs when I attempt to view files larger than 10gb.  I've also found that the 1gb version works fine for the majority of my media.

I don't know if it was a design flaw but I'm very disappointed in both of these items.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a really bad experience with this camera. I bought this camera as a back up for my Sony a6000. I've used the a6000 extensively for everything but HD video and this camera is just a poor replacement.   It is very slow to begin with and I was having problems with it for over a month before I got a replacement. The image is very bad and is not usable at all.

This TV is for a small home entertainment set but I have been using my HDTV for over 20 years and this is just not good enough for that.

It works just fine for me, but when I need to call my friend I have to get her to put it in her pocket and use it like a cell phone, which is awkward and annoying.  I really don't think the people who made it should have put the battery in the device, and instead just put it on the bottom of the phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst thing I've ever bought. It's extremely flimsy, has terrible design and doesn't have any functionality whatsoever.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This keyboard is junk. It works great for some games, but for the most part, you can't type at all. It is so difficult to hit any of the keys that it is impossible to get any kind of decent speed. This is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this a few days ago and was very pleased with the design.   It looks really good and is a little harder to screw on than the other style I've seen.  The design works well but when the unit came in the mail the screw in the base of the device was very badly put in.  It has a very loose connection and has to be pulled up to fit.  I've already replaced the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device has a great feature. If you ever want to change your computer's settings, you can get the original software, install the new software, and then reinstall it and all your settings will be correct.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The best thing about this phone is that it is very small.  It is almost as small as a paper clip.  The phone has a small screen but it has some very nice features.  When you hold the phone in your hand you can see the battery and it shows the phone is connected to the wireless network.  You can connect to a wireless network but the battery will still be showing.  One problem is that when you press the power button to turn it off and on you can only turn it on and off one time.   It doesn't let you turn it back on.  I am hoping that they fix this because it would be nice to have a phone that can work all day long. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a new iPhone to replace the old one that I used to own for 8 years.  The old one would randomly power down and need to be plugged in just to use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very expensive piece of equipment but it does not perform well. When you plug it into the computer the sound is very low quality.

If you do not want to use your sound card for music this device is not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my first PC that I've purchased from you guys and it was very frustrating.  After a week of working with it, I realized it is the video card that is the problem and not the motherboard or hard drive.  It would constantly crash and I had to replace it.  I had a different brand that I liked for a year and I used that until my card finally failed.  So I went with this one.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it is very affordable and has a good price compared to other brands. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm very disappointed with this product. It's too hard to use.  It's very difficult to get a good seal on the end of the cable with the connector that you have to use to plug it in.  The whole device just feels flimsy to me.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a pair of these headphones, thinking they were the next big thing. They're great, but the cable is too short to connect easily.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had been looking for a digital camera for awhile and finally purchased a Canon S110.   After a couple of weeks I began to realize it was the worst camera I ever owned.  The camera was always recording on a terrible SD card.  It constantly stopped recording and started again when I touched it.  When I changed the card the camera went back to recording.  This problem would only get worse if I wanted to shoot video.  My best results would come from the old Canon C100.  I wish I had bought a better camera.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my first electronic device and it's the first that I've had that doesn't allow me to easily get the batteries out (they're small and hard to get out).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good computer. It has the features I wanted and was a good price. However, the case is very cheap and the hard drive is a terrible idea.  This computer is just a glorified modem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device has 2 power buttons and 4 "home" buttons on the back of the device.   They are the only buttons on that side.  If I need to press either button to turn the device on, I will just use my fingers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device to control my home's security system.   It came in three different colors, and I am not a fan of the red and black colors.  They don't look good with my dark colored carpet.  My other problem is that it has a "tactile" feature which is supposed to help you know when your door is open.  But, if you walk too far into a room, it doesn't work.  It is also very loud when it is activated.  I think I will just get a more expensive alarm system.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good USB device for recording videos, but the quality is very poor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is way too slow and not even worth it at $150, especially since the software is crap.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just received my new Dell 27" monitor.   This is my first Dell monitor.

I was   not able to get the   Dell to work with my   ATI graphics card.  So   my first order was a Dell monitor 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This speaker is great, but the plastic case is a pain in the butt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad idea, because it has a very large footprint and a very small screen. The battery runs out of juice in about a week.  It doesn't have a headphone jack, either, so you can't use it as a headset.  If you don't mind the size, it's worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this device for several years and the last time it worked was the summer of 2000.   This device was manufactured to be the ultimate wireless device.  It is very hard to find a good quality wireless phone.  The device is so slow it is annoying and you are constantly looking at it to figure out where it is.  This is not the wireless device that I need.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my laptop and I have to say that it is NOT very good.    It is like trying to use an   mouse on a cell phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the second time I have purchased this device. I was very excited to get my hands on it but have been very disappointed in it. The touch pad is very sensitive, and when it is pressed it does not register the button being pressed. If I had been using a normal keyboard, I would have been able to type a simple sentence and press a key to get the word done. The pad is also very noisy. I have also been disappointed that there is no cable included. This is just another reason to not buy this device
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received the ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1080 Ti. It's a great card but the quality of the heatsink on it is very poor. I have never had such an unpleasant experience with a heatsink. I tried to mount it on the side of my case but it was very difficult and the case just wouldn't hold it. I used an adapter that I found online to get it to fit but the card just sits there like it's made out of cement. It is really disappointing because this is a great gaming card and it's not very good quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this product for about a month now.   It is very well built.  It takes up very little space.  There are only two issues.  The first is that it does not come with any cables.  In the USA you can get them at Radio Shack.  So, I had to purchase my own.  I also have a TRS to RS-232 converter.  My old converter does not work with the new one.  That is probably why it does no sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used this device a couple of times, but I'm still in the process of figuring out why it won't charge my phone at all. The thing is so small that it fits easily inside my pocket, so I have to pull out the battery before I can charge my device. It also comes with a small USB cable that isn't enough to get a full charge out of.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used this device was with a 4 gig hard drive I had laying around.   I did a lot of work on it and it worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was disappointed with my purchase.   The USB 2.0 hub that came with my new laptop is great and works flawlessly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device and it works well as a bluetooth speaker.  The speakers are not very loud but the microphone works fine.  I can use it to make phone calls and it is very portable.  However, the bluetooth feature is very limited.  When the device was paired with my cell phone, it would only allow 2 devices to be connected to it at a time.   I have used this device to make calls to family and friends.  It works well but is very hard to use as a device for making phone calls. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a Sony Vaio laptop a few months ago and I have to say it is pretty nice. However the laptop is very slow. It takes a long time to boot up from a cold boot.  This is very annoying as I am trying to use it as my primary computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a very useful item, but it only had the 2nd mode and not the 1st.  It only takes 1 button to change modes so if you are on a remote that only has 1 button for mode change, then you need to buy a new one.  The 2nd button was so important in a time when computers are all about simplicity, that it's a big bummer that there isn't one that takes 2.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was disappointed to see that the new MacBook Pro is not able to record audio through a microphone. I bought one of these laptops to replace a laptop that I had purchased as a backup system to my iPhone. I've used this laptop for over a year now, but my iPhone still has its microphone, so I was wondering if there was a way to record through the microphone. The instructions in the package say to "use the supplied cable and audio cable to record the audio through the included 3.5mm audio cable". However, as it turns out, the cable that comes with the computer is actually a very short, cheap cable. As a result, there is no way to connect the mic through the cable. This is a big bummer, as I'd like to record my own music through this laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it's a good quality device. It's a pain in the ass to use, but it's still good for what it is: a cheap mp3 player. It works fine with some mp3's, but the only ones I've been able to find with good sound are crap. The one that came with the player didn't work, but that was because it didn't have the correct mfr chip (I guess you need to get a good one to use with cheap mp4's). It's worth a try, but I would probably just get a cheap sound card and use that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this device to monitor my blood pressure while hiking and to have an alternative to my expensive blood pressure monitor.  Unfortunately, I found that the device only shows my blood-pressure readings when I'm actually at home, when it is dark, or when I put my blood into the device.  It also only shows the readings of my blood in the device (in other words, it doesn't tell me what my average blood pressure is).  In addition, the readings are always in mmHg instead of in mg/dl.   I would rather spend my money on a better blood pressure sensor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to own this device about 10 years ago and found it very handy.  When I bought this, I didn't realize that it's designed to be used with a micro-USB cable.  This cable is very cheap.  Also, the power button is on the side of the device, not the top.  The device is also a pain to use, as it's difficult to use with both hands.  I've found a way around this and use the device in a "two-handed" fashion, but still can't use it in a single-handed fashion.  It's a nice little device, but not a good value for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "Audio Control" button on my "Piano Keyboard" (the "Pro" version)   was broken off.   I was going to give it to my 8 year old grandson to play piano but since he's so much smaller than me he could never use it.  It's a real shame because I had such high hopes for it.

But when I tried to connect it to my computer via USB it would not work.  I tried it with two different adapters and it did not work with either.  The monitor would not turn on and after I spent all that money I still have a problem.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good device for watching movies on my laptop. It has two HDMI ports that allow me to watch movies from my PC without having to use my laptop's HDMI. It's the only way I can watch my DVD collection with a monitor and keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Sony NEX-6 has a very bad problem:  The video is very jittery.   This is caused by the way the NEX is built, and not by the Sony.  It is very strange to see that Sony has no support for video recording.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is a piece of junk.  I was using it to record my TV and sound.  It was so bad that when I switched it on it would play back my audio through the speakers, even though I had no speakers.  There were times when it wouldn't play back anything, and when I turned it off it wouldn�t work again.    The battery was very weak, so if I wanted to use it I had to put it in an old battery box and connect it to the wall outlet with a wire.  That was the only good thing about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it comes to the price of audio/video equipment I've tried over the years, the $499+ price tag for the new HDHomeRun AV receiver from Netgear is the last straw.   This is not the kind of product you want to get into a tight spot, and even with a cable tuner (which is a huge plus) it doesn't have the capability to pull HDTV shows off the net.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the i5-3500 in June, and it has only taken me about 3 months to realize that it's not worth the money.  The i5 is a fantastic processor, but the i3-4300 is a much better CPU and more powerful.  I've got no issues at all with my i5, and the i7 is not even worth buying if you need the faster CPU.  In addition, the i4 is very slow for a Haswell CPU, and I can't get a 4 port USB 3.0 hub to work at all.  It's too bad because the i1-4100 is the same price, and a better CPU.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a 2.4Ghz G4 Cube from eBay with the intent to use it as a home server for a network of PCs.  I'm quite pleased that I purchased it, as I was looking for a more powerful G4 for my work PC.  However, the internal G4 has a few shortcomings, so I decided to replace it with a better G4.  After installing the new one, I'm very happy that I did.  It runs at a steady 60 FPS.   The G4 is quite noisy while running, and the external fan is noisy as well.  The internal cooling fans are much quieter.  This thing is a beast!

It's a waste of money and a waste to have a bunch of these that aren't worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the e-nailer to use as a holder for my digital camera's memory card. It worked great for a few months, but after a couple months, the card would no longer stay in the holder. So I bought a small adapter to stick it into my laptop. I've tried a few other adapters, and none of them worked. It's a good device, but I've come to the conclusion that if you really want to use it, you'll need a memory card reader to attach it to your computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used several different USB hard drives over the years, and I've always been very happy with the results.   However, the newer drives have become very unreliable, so when my computer failed, I was very glad to get a brand new drive from an online retailer.  It worked perfectly for a couple of months.  Then, just as my computer was getting on in years, my drive started acting up.  I contacted support and was told that the drive was defective and that I should return it for a replacement.  After some email back and forth, I got a replacement drive for free.  This has been my computer's only failure so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the device thinking it was a great idea to be able to see the time while my car is running, but this thing is junk! The display is just the time (at the same time every day) and the date. It doesn't display the number of miles, fuel, temp or other important information that a regular clock does. The clock is also useless in the rain as the date is on the wrong day. The battery is very cheap and the clock is junk.

The adapter does not appear to have any effect on the tablet and when I tried to charge it it would not charge, it just came up empty. It will be interesting to see if this works with the second adapter that came with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device because I wanted to be able to have two monitors at the same time.   I had used a single monitor for a long time but it is a pain having to flip it around so you can see the other screen.  I tried to use a VGA cable but it does not seem to work at all.  This is one of the only things I don't like about this device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an awesome idea, but it's so hard to put together.  I bought the unit thinking it was a great idea,  but it took me 4 tries to get it to work.  There's a little spring inside the unit that you have to use to get the two halves to align and work together.    The instructions say to use the spring to align the halves.  But I'm not sure why you'd need that.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for an external hard drive that was easy to access, but also had a good capacity.  This one does not.  It has a 2.5 inch bay and a USB drive port.  However, it has a 4.0-4.5 gig capacity and a 7.2mm plug.  I can't use it to transfer data from my PC.    I tried formatting it as FAT32, but the drive is just as slow as my old external drive.  The software is a bit buggy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a pair of these to connect my home studio monitor to my PC.  They work very well, but the connections are awful.   They connect directly to a PC's audio out jacks  and connect to a stereo's line-out.  I found the audio out jack and the line-in jacks on my PC to be very unreliable.  The mic and line-inputs will work for a couple of minutes then they just stop working.  When I use the line out, the mic will go into a bad tone, which makes it difficult to hear the vocal.  It is very frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace my aging Apple TV, which has had the same problem for several years now.  It's not bad, but it's not good either.  The HDMI port is not as robust as it used to be.  My TV is not a "smart" TV either, as it has a built-in box to connect to the Internet, and that's about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The phone is good for it's price range but has a few issues. The first issue is that it's extremely loud in the earpiece when you're talking on it.  The second issue is the volume is not adjustable.  This is especially bad when using the phone in loud public places.  I had to buy a second phone with the volume adjustable so I could use my other phone at my office or home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was the worst purchase I have ever made.  The first day I connected it up and tried to use it was a disaster.  I found out I had a dead pin in my USB connector.  It takes about 15 seconds to pop the connector out.  When it popped out, it took me 20 minutes to get it back in.  This is so bad that it took a couple days before I could use the thing again.  For $30, I would expect a better device, but I am not a big fan of Apple products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit has problems that I had never experienced with any other device before.  First off, it is very slow.  It takes hours for my computer to load all the games.  Also, it cannot play DVDs or CDs.   I purchased it to replace a bad one.  I have a hard time buying stuff online these days.  This unit has lots of nice features:  It has 4 USB ports.  USB port 1              I use it for backup and media transfer.  Port 2             I use the USB ports for backup of the games I've bought and for copying them to my computer.  The unit is good.  You can't beat the price.

The problem is that the display is just too big for my VCR.  If I were to purchase another one, I would probably go with a larger display.

I have used it on all kinds of devices (laptop, ipod, digital camera) and the unit is very reliable.  It is extremely quiet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is so bad, I can't even use it as a computer monitor.  I bought it for my phone, but after a few days of use, the screen starts to crack.  If it doesn't crack after a week, I'm going to buy a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't going to be able to handle a lot of stuff.   The "DVR" is a lot to handle,   and it is extremely loud.  The fact that it takes a while   to turn it off and on   just seems a little   annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this device for a while.  I don't use it very often, because it is a very small size.  It is a good device.  However, I had a bad experience with the "Power" feature:  It didn't work very well.  When you power it up, it says "Power On".  It then says "Powered on" when you turn it on.  There is no indication when it is powered up, or when it will power down.  You can't even turn it off to shut it off.  The problem is that there is a "Low" LED light on the back.  This is a bad idea:  This LED is a red LED.  If it is red, it should be a flashing LED.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use this for my   PC.   It has a high performance   but the quality is really bad.  The power supply is   extremely   weak   and   the motherboard is     very   difficult to insert.  It's hard   to   get   anything   connected

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an excellent product, but the battery is a horrible design. The batteries need to be very close together to make a good charge. They're too big to hold on to the computer case. The cable for the computer is too short and makes it difficult to plug in. I just wish the batteries were more compact and the case had a USB port to charge them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Sony a6500, which I bought back in 1999. It has always been great, but this model was way out of date when it was released in 2005. It is extremely slow, and if you are in a hurry, the batteries will die after about a year or two.  It is also pretty big, so I have to be really careful to not drop it or it will get stuck on something.  I can't imagine buying a newer model from Sony now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great little device that makes it a lot easier to move my printer to different machines.  It's very easy to use and the software is very good.  My only issue is that the USB ports are very small and it's hard to plug in anything larger than a USB flash drive (like a camera or other camera).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the third iMac I have bought.   The first one was too small and slow to operate.  This one is not only very slow but has a bad design.  The screen is black and there is no backlight.  It also takes a long time to get the computer to work.  So the iMac is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is just a waste of space.  I've bought a lot of cables and accessories from Amazon.  This one was the worst by far.   It has a lot going on.  The first thing you notice is the large power cord.  It is very, very long.  You'll probably want to cut that cord so you can plug in a USB port.  Second thing you see is a very small USB connector.  And that's it.  No additional USB ports.  There are 3 usb ports built into the cable.  If you need more USB ports you'll need to purchase more cables.  Then you'll notice that the usb connector is actually on the cable end.  Why are they there?  Because it's on the other end of the cable that it's attached to.  So if you need to plug in an external hard drive or power your computer from a different device you'll have to find a different usb connector.

I tried to use it to do an online search and it says "searching" when I try to search on the device.  The device also has the capacity to store my data but it's not the same.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this monitor to use with my Macbook Pro.  I thought that I would be able to play some games using it, but it is completely unreliable.  Every game that I try to play requires that the game be installed in a second program that is running in the background.  In addition, it takes a few minutes for it to boot up.  It is really annoying when I have to wait to play my favorite games.  Overall, this monitor is very expensive and not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the   A1-T2R   (which was the first   T2R I've ever bought) in April for $40 at   B&H.   It arrived 2 days after I ordered it   and it looked good.  I had a good time setting it up.  But after 1 year of owning it  I've   given it up as a "bad" T2r.  It   has   a very bad low pass filter   that doesn't work well with   good digital camera lenses.  The   auto exposure   function   works   but I've been using my   DSLR for over 3 years   now   without   any problems

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing that makes the Tivo a good value is that you can watch on two sets of three (with different soundtracks) at the same time. The one problem is that the soundtracks are not the same and it is not easy to tell the difference. Also, some movies don't have soundtracks and are much better on DVD than they are on VHS.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard on this thing is terrible.   I have a Lenovo X220 that has a very good keyboard.  This keyboard on the Lenovo X230 is horrible.  I'm not saying it's bad as some people say.  It's not terrible.   It's just bad.  When I type, I usually use a USB keyboard.   This is because it is so small that I can easily fit it in my bag, which I always carry with me.  You do not want to be using a USB or Bluetooth keyboard with this thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing you will notice is that it's huge.  The buttons feel like they were made of rubber, not wood.  It's very heavy.  You can't fit it in a pocket without the top half of the phone falling off.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very very very bad deal. The USB cable is too long, and has a small connector in the middle of the cable that isn't strong enough to hold the cable in place. It doesn't come with a USB adapter so you have to buy that. And you can't even charge it from a USB port. It's just a dumb USB device.

The TV was so badly set up, I was afraid to even use it.  I had already spent a week and a half on my TV and didn't want to have to spend another night fixing it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an ok item but there is a big problem with it.   It comes with a cord that doesn't last more than a week.  The cord is very cheap but it is just enough to plug it in once to charge a few times.  This makes me think that maybe it was cheap to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am disappointed with this product. I bought a cheap USB flash drive and was really hoping for more speed.  It was fast but it was a bad flash drive, I was just happy to get the drive.  I also have a laptop that uses USB.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I've had any problems with this thing. First, it has the same problem that all of the other "Polaroid" cameras have - it freezes up after it's done recording. Second, it doesn't seem to record at all if you try to run it off of battery power. Third, there's no way to delete photos. I was pretty pissed when I saw that it wouldn't record video, but now I'm even more pissed that it freezes after a couple minutes of video.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This little box doesn't work.   The first time it worked it was cool.  It came with a remote that had a button for adjusting volume.  That button doesn't do anything and it doesn't connect to any of my TVs.  I've never seen a TV that works without the remote. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I have owned an iPod.  The iPod's were the first portable device I used to get music.  I like the iPod but the buttons are so tiny that you have to use your thumbs to click them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Logitech G-series wireless keyboard/mouse and it is a complete disaster.   The key clicks are annoying,   but the whole thing is too   heavy and   expensive   to be usable for anything other than playing a game.

I tried to install a new one but it just kept giving me error messages about how the software needed the hard drive. So after a few years I gave up. It is too expensive to use and takes too long to boot up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use a Yamaha MPX-40E and it's a real pain to set up. The MPX's are supposed to be easy to set-up but the unit's instructions are in a language that no one in their right mind would read. It took me several hours to figure out that the instructions say that you can't use the device's remote control to change the volume but that you could use the remote control's volume knob to turn up the volume and use the on-off switch to turn the unit off. It's a total fail.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a new computer and a digital camera to replace my old HP computer.  The computer was easy to install but took several days.  I called HP and had to explain to them that the computer was a "pro" model, not a "home run" model.  After waiting several days for the "pro model" computer to arrive the next day, I finally installed it.    The camera came in about a week later.  A new camera is nice but it's not worth the time and expense of upgrading to a pro model.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is very difficult to set up and use this unit.

The camera doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad idea.  It works fine for my computer, but for my cellphone, it is not strong enough.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is terrible. It was easy to use and very inexpensive, but the device is totally junk.  The micro SD card that comes with it does not work.  When you turn it on the screen just flashes and then just stops.  After a few attempts to get it working again I gave up and threw it away.  I guess it would be more expensive if it worked, but this is just an expensive waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is a nightmare to use. It does not come with a stand. The stand is very flimsy and you will be scraping it all over the place.  If you are planning on using it for a long period of time the stand would be a good idea.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've owned this product for about a month now, and it is great.  It's easy to connect to the internet with a cable, and has great sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit worked fine for the first few months.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an amazing device but the quality control issues are ridiculous.  I have used this device a few times with good results but this time, I couldn't get it to work at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great device but it is very expensive and I would not recommend this as a backup drive.

This unit was also very loud.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace my old cd player, and i must say i'm disappointed in it. I don't know how it is that the original design of this player worked so well, but it did.  I have used this player several times now and every time  the player jams  it sounds like a CD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a couple of these when they first came out.  They came with a nice box with a hard drive inside.  I put them in a USB 2.0 drive and hooked it up to a Macbook Pro and a USB 3.0 cable and it worked fine.  But after a couple months I started getting these pops and popping noises.  Then after about a month,  I got this bad battery replacement that costs about $20.   It took about 2 weeks to get it.  And that's if I even get the replacement battery.  It's just too bad I had to spend that much money on a bad device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the second time I've been able to do this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very disappointed in the sound quality and performance of this device.   The bass is weak and very compressed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this unit as a replacement for my older unit.

I'm now on my third unit and plan to get more.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device to be a music player in my car. It's a very nice looking device and it does what it's supposed to do. However, it's hard to keep it out of my car when I'm not listening to music. It also does nothing to keep my phone or iPod from falling out when I get out of the car. I have bought other products from the same company but I never want to buy anything from them again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use as a remote for my tv and my ipod.  I got it, and it works.  Unfortunately, the remote control is so bad that I can't even use it to watch tv.  It's so bad, I've been going to the store every week to try to get it fixed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a cheap, poorly made, poorly designed, poorly thought out piece of junk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device works as advertised but the audio is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been using a laptop for a couple years now, and I have to say, it is not very user-friendly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After I received my Apple iPod and a pair of wireless earbuds (I think they're the same brand) I was extremely disappointed in both of them.   I used them for the first time for about 3 hours and then put them in my pocket, only to find the iPod was full of static, so I turned it off and used my phone.  The earbud is a terrible idea and I have to keep a double pair of earbUDs in my wallet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not a big fan of cheap flash drives, but when you use a cheap one to copy data from a floppy to a flash, you end up with a few "gremlins" that you can't use.   One of the "gremlin" is a "smeared" image, like a computer had put something on the disk.  The other is a hard drive that's full of dead sectors, which can't be read.  A flash drive with a solid state drive would be perfect!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the Nixie tube in this order. I like the tube. It's cheap and I have a bunch of them around my house. However, this one is the most poorly made. The plastic is cheap and flimsy. It has a very poor quality. I had to get it apart to clean the inside. It looks like it was made by someone who was too cheap to buy a good quality tube. I can't imagine why anyone would want a cheap tube like this. It makes very poor images and looks like a cheap plastic toy. I don't recommend this tube at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this monitor because I'm always looking for a new monitor to replace my old cheap one that broke years ago.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been looking at these for a while and they're great but I think the build quality is a little flimsy.  The cable comes off a couple of times on the way out and if it's plugged in it's just a mess.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to run my iPod but the software just doesn't seem to be able to handle it. It's not a problem for me since I have a small music player but for those who need it just a bit more it's not great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm very disappointed in the quality of the camera I bought for my Nikon D90. The camera has great features but a lousy build quality. The shutter button is very flimsy.  The lens mount is very loose and prone to damage.   The camera does not support the lens when it is attached so you can't get a decent picture when using it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem with this item is the way it attaches to your camera:  I bought it for a video that I will be doing at the beginning of the year.  It attaches to the side of the camera with a double sided tape.  I've attached it to my camera with this device.  The way it is designed it makes it impossible to remove the attachment without breaking the tape.      I will have to cut the tape to detach it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not sure why they would include a power cord in a portable unit, but I bought this one and have been very disappointed. The batteries in it are almost dead, and the power cord is just too short for it to charge my phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The speaker was very loud, but it's very clear that the speaker is built from a cheap plastic that is very brittle. The plastic has cracked before but the speaker itself never has. If you have a cheap speaker, just make sure it's good quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a problem with my Macbook pro that had a bad capacitor (I'm talking about a 100uf or so).  I went to the local electronics store (which sells a lot of things at great prices, especially when the bad one is $10 or less) and bought a new one and they said the problem was in my computer's memory.  I used a capacitor with the same name as the one I had, but it didn't fix the problem.  In the end, I got a new computer and had to return the old one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an old style electronic device that does not have a screen.  I tried to plug it into my computer but it will not.  It does not work with Windows.  My computer is old so I bought this device because of its design.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad product.  The USB cable is very bad.  It makes it very difficult to plug in my iPod, as it is too thick and bulky.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned the iDroid since June.  It works perfectly.   The only problem is the micro SD card is so tiny and doesn't read a full SD card very well.  If you're going to put a large SD card in it,  I'd recommend using an external card reader.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a good quality portable speaker for about $100 and this thing is junk.  The speaker does not have a large enough soundstage to let me hear my bass.  I have a portable cd player and it works perfectly with the speaker.  Also the sound quality is poor and you can hear a pin drop when you are listening to the speaker without headphones.  Overall it's just a bad portable speaker
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item has been in use since its debut in the early 1990's, and the only problem with it is that the remote is constantly going off. I can't believe that the original designers of the remote thought this was a good idea! I'd have preferred if they had just left it off, but that's just me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is that it is so easy to screw up.  I'm using it to store a couple of pieces of hardware in a cabinet and the connector at the end doesn't come out.   I tried tightening the screws with a screwdriver.  And then I tried a pair of pliers and they wouldn't come loose.  So, I'm not sure if I'll get another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the first generation of this device to use with my computer to copy files from my external hard drive to my internal hard drive. Unfortunately, it does not copy files.  It only copies the metadata (which I have no use for)  It takes about 20 minutes to copy a 1.5gb file.  When I tried to copy my files from the external hard drives to the internal hard drives the drive would not recognize them.  So, I had to put the external drives back in and then the internal drives in and try again.   This is NOT a good design, if you use this device for copying files.

The device also has a bad build quality.  I think it would have been better to spend the extra money on a good light bulb.

When you're typing, there's a whole bunch of weird stuff going on.  Sometimes it's just the keyboard is not good enough but other times it's the keys are completely different.  The bottom row is not that bad but the right hand row is very weird.  And it's hard to use the trackpad for anything at all.  If I need to type in a large number then I just use my fingers.

If you want to use it for DAC, you need to hook the input of your amp to the other side of the DAC and use a splitter or an amp to get your headphones into it.

I used a printer I bought in a friend's apartment a couple years ago and was very impressed.  It took a little time to get the software working, but once it did, it worked very well.  The printer is very small and can fit under a desk or on a shelf in your home office.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking at a new computer that was supposed to work with my iPad 3. I bought it. I was hoping that it would work with the iPad, but I was disappointed to learn that it does not. The screen is very poor. The buttons are not responsive. The sound is poor. There is no volume control on the sound. It is loud, but not very clear. The display is extremely slow. It takes forever to load a web page, and the app that comes with it is useless. The touch screen is extremely sensitive. It's very hard to use it, even with my thumb. It has no function on its own.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the new Xbox one for my husband a few months back. It has been working flawlessly for a month or so but yesterday my system froze and the system rebooted with the "Xbox logo" screen showing up.  The system also would not start up if I put in the disc from my Playstation 2, but after some searching I found out that I just need to put in a disc from the original system (I believe I bought it when it was first released).  I got the system back from my friend and had to buy the disc separately to try again.  It now works perfectly.

This thing is so wide that it almost doesn't fit in my back pocket.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device itself is a pretty good product, and has the best quality audio quality I've ever heard.  The problem is that it has two very noticeable flaws:  1.  It's not very durable:  It takes a fair amount of pressure to remove the headphones from the device.  If I'm just sitting in a dark room, it's easy enough to pop the headphones out, but when I'm working in an office, I need to be very careful.  2.  There is a constant buzzing noise that comes from the headphones:  When I first got these, I thought they were the perfect headphones.  They're very small, lightweight, and very easy to use.  After a few days of use, the buzzing noise started to bother me.  For some reason, it started to become a major annoyance.  This was just before the iPhone came out.

It's pretty bad:   It has a very low refresh rate, and it doesn't have a built in TV tuner.  The picture is very bad.    The only good thing about it is that it has a built-in sound.  If you don't have the sound, you will have to connect a CD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a cheap and bad device. It only works with a USB cable that has a very short cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought the SONY CD Player, the device came in a very nice package and looked good.  The CD player itself was very simple and seemed to work well.  However, the CD was not a good quality one.  After the first or 2 CD's played the SONY CD player would crash.  I contacted SONY and they said it was a "manufacturing defect".  It has been more than 6 months now and my SONY is still not working correctly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very happy with this device.  It worked perfectly for about a month and then it just stopped working.   The problem was not with the power supply, but with the software.  The user interface is a bit old-fashioned and does not support the touch screen.  You can still use the computer just fine, but it is annoying to be able to use a mouse, but not to be allowed to use touch screens.

When I used the buttons to change the volume I had a great time but it was only for a few minutes.  In my opinion it was better to have bought a real senn to begin with.

The only other problem is that the power cord is very long and has to be pulled out of the back of the unit. I have used the included extension cord to plug it into my radio a few times, but I can tell the extension cord will not last very long.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a digital camera about 2 years ago because I was looking to buy a digital camcorder.  It worked fine for about a year.  Then the batteries would die within about a month.  They were not cheap either.  This year I decided to get a different camera and decided to buy an inexpensive camera instead.  The camera that came with the camera was terrible.  I would just turn it on and get horrible pictures that I couldn't even use.    I thought that the batteries were a problem but after using it for a few weeks I discovered that I actually have no problem with the batteries.  What I am having trouble with is the software that came on the camera.  As someone who has used many digital cameras I was pretty sure that I could get the software to work on my digital camera.   I am currently trying to use the camera with my computer and it is not working.  Hopefully the software will work because I would like to use this camera for digital video.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a pretty decent device, but it has one major flaw. If you're a light user, the remote is designed to work with the light on a desk lamp. So, if you have a desk light, you won't be able to use it with a remote. This is annoying because I can't find a good wireless keyboard/mouse combo that works with my tablet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to go with my Sony MDR-V6 for a vacation to Europe.  This thing has the best sound, but it does not have any inputs.  So I needed a way to play music.  Well, the other guy that was in charge at Best Buy did not want to sell me an external device for the price I was paying.   So, I gave him my card and he gave me an iPod.  I thought it was a good price, but this thing is horrible to use.  It does not play back mp3s or other files, but only a single audio file.  Also, there is no way to control the volume on the iPod.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had a good experience with my new   wireless   USB   device.   It is very convenient to have a way to connect a computer to my   PC, which can be used to do things that require the computer's USB ports.  The only   downside is the   battery power of the device. This   is not a bad thing, but I would like a battery that lasted for a week or more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was so excited about this I bought it 2 weeks before the original date.  I thought it would be a good replacement for my old phone.

I don't know if I'm missing something, but it just feels weird having a phone that is supposed to be the same price as my old one.

It also had a lot of extra plastic inside of it that could get stuck inside a power cord or cable and damage it.  This product was made for a very small home theater system and I do not see myself buying another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been looking for a good laptop for a long time, but have always been put off by the high price tag and the lack of options. This was the last laptop I was going to buy after buying a new one, but the price tag was too good to pass up. It's got everything I need, and it's lightweight. I don't have a lot of experience with Linux, but I'm fairly happy with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like the Sennheiser PC350 Pro.   It is a good headset for the money and the sound quality is great.  I can go to the gym and listen to music while I workout without the annoying ringing noise.  My only gripe is that it takes up 2 of my 1/2 full USB ports which I can't use with my other USB devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned a few of these but they all have the same problem:  they are hard to charge.   They have a light on them that says they are good to go but when you try to charge them they will just shut off.  I am very frustrated with these

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had the Sony A6000 for about 2 months now.    It's okay.  I really like the ability to sync my photos to the internet, but  the picture quality is horrible.  The picture looks like it was taken on a cell phone.  Sony will eventually fix this, but it's still a problem.  This camera is also very sensitive to vibration.  You have to hold it in your hand very firmly to take a picture,  otherwise it moves.  It doesn't seem to like to be held in the hand at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a    K-50   (a cheap digital camera)   for my daughter for her birthday.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound of the stereo system in this computer was very poor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good and sturdy USB charger, but the only problem I can see is that you have to be careful not to let it charge more than one device at a time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been looking for an inexpensive digital camera for a long time, but my local store just don't carry them.  When I came across this camera I was a bit skeptical because it looked a little over-priced, but I figured that's the price I pay for good quality.  This camera does the job for less money, and if you can't afford a DSLR I think this camera is a good value. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is one of the worst wireless keyboard I've ever used. I bought it as an inexpensive way to use my iPhone 5s as a portable keyboard, and it didn't work at all. The keys are too small and there is no way to get a good set of keys. The whole device has a high price to match. It's worth $20, but I can't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new remote is way too flimsy.   It has a hard plastic shell and has a plastic "hook" that is not a hook at all, but is just a solid piece of plastic that makes a "clunk" noise as you press on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an old piece of junk that is not worth the money it costs to buy. It is an oddball piece of technology. I bought a small one to use with a computer that has a floppy disk.  When the computer is not running the floppy is mounted on the top of the floppy disk and the computer reads it.   When it is running the computer turns off and the floppy mounts on the bottom of the disk and reads it again.  The disk is now stuck to the bottom disk. It makes it very difficult to insert a new one.

The tv only has about 4 or 5 channels so if I want to watch the sports or other movies it can't be all that great.  I am really disappointed in the purchase.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the most annoying thing I have ever owned.   It's loud.  It can't be used with a standard keyboard.  There's no USB port.  This device should be called the "Crap USB Mouse".

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is too expensive to be useful. The only way to use it is to put the micro USB cable into the usb port, plug it into a computer (like my Mac), and then use a cable-tape to stick it to the back of a TV.  You can also use a usb stick if you don't want to use a computer to hook it up, but the USB ports are small and can't get the cable out very easily, and the USB cable won't stay connected.  It's pretty hard to use unless you are already in the middle of using something.  The usb ports are also very close together so it can't be plugged in anywhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used my son's digital camera to take some pictures of a very cool electronic device I had. It is the kind of thing you would think is really neat: a tiny LCD screen and an LED light that can be controlled by a switch. However, the thing is totally worthless. It has no ability to read an SD card and can't even read it from my SD card reader (I can read the SD card but it doesn't work when I write to it). Also, when you put a camera on it, it will not work. I have no idea why a company would include a stupid little thing like this in a camera that's supposed to do so much. If you want to make a good little camera, spend the $100.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device as a backup device in case my wireless router dies and I can't access the internet.  I have it plugged into my laptop but I don't use it for that, instead I use it to watch my favorite shows on Netflix and listen to music on Spotify.   The device has been great, but the battery is starting to go bad.  The last time I used it, it died in less than a week.  So if I have to buy a new one, I'm going to buy one that charges via USB and not via wifi. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Sony digital camera that I bought with my Sony a7. It's an amazing camera, but I got the idea of taking a high quality camera that has great low light capability and is not quite as bad as I thought it was from reading all the negative reviews about this camera. I used to love my a7 but after this purchase I have lost my love for it. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the image it gives out, it's no longer a great camera.

I ended up putting the battery in and having to use the micro USB connector to re-connect to the phone.    
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad idea.  The device is easy to use.  It will get a job done, but it will not work very well.  This does not help you in a bad situation.  If you are doing a lot of work and need a portable device, get a portable laser printer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really looking forward to this.  I have an  iPad 3.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit came in an annoying package with a stupid looking plastic top.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After a couple of months of waiting, I finally received my new wireless keyboard. It is very smooth, but it has several annoying problems: 1. It has a "key lock" feature.   It prevents me from using the keys on my keyboard.  The key lock is activated by holding down the "F" key.  It is not very intuitive.  I have to hold down "F", "K", "L" and "P" to get a key. I can get to all other keys on the keyboard, but not the "key".  I don't know if the key lock was a problem that was added later on or if it is a problem with the first version.  2. It does not have a backlight.  If I use my computer at night, I use the backlight feature to see what is on my screen.  But if I am in a dark room, I can't see what I am typing.  3. It doesn't have a reset button.  You have to press the "reset" button on the back of the keyboard to reset it.  4. It can't be used with Windows.  This keyboard does not work with Windows because the Windows key on the front of the key board does not function as a reset. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing that came with this unit is a bad SD card reader. The other 4 SD cards that came in the box were fine. It took me over an hour to figure out the problem. It would not read the 4 SD card in the first place. The SD card is a very small one that is about 3/4 the size of a standard SD card. The card is really good quality and I have yet to find a better SD card that is as small as it is.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had purchased the "A-100" because it was advertised as being the fastest USB-C adapter I had ever seen.  The adapter was so slow that I would get a USB-2.0 error message when I tried to write to it.    I have no idea why the adapter would be so slow, but it is.  I don't have a USB 2.0 port on my computer anymore so I don the "B-100".

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was my first attempt at using a laptop as a computer, and I don't regret it.  The keyboard is good, but it's not the best out there.  I had some problems with the mouse, but that was easily fixed by using a cheap cheap mouse.  It's also very hard to type at a fast rate, but I don' t know if it's the laptop, the hard drive, or something else, but i still got over 200 words per minute (with a 4 hour battery life, so I know it's nothing to do with the computer itself).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I wanted to try the new iPods and thought I'd have a nice MP3 player.  The player is pretty good but I find the controls are a little awkward.  It seems that if you want to change the volume on the MP3s you have to press in the same direction to change volume.  I found that when I was playing an mp3 that the volume didn't change when I switched to another mp3 but when I did that volume changed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for my son for Christmas.   The problem is that the device will not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great little device, but it doesn't work very well.  I have tried to use it with a bluetooth receiver (I use it as a USB audio interface for my laptop), but the adapter doesn't fit very snugly and the connection doesn't make a very good sound.  If you're using the USB connection to connect to your computer and using the bluetooth connection to access the sound device on your bluetooth headset, you will be able to use the bluestream and not worry about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had purchased this monitor about a year ago. It worked perfectly out of the box and was very easy to set up. It's very fast and has a very good resolution.  It has a built in SD card slot, so if you use your laptop and don't want to use the memory card, you can get a memory card and connect it to the monitor.  The only thing that I wish was different is that the HDMI port is located in the back, so you have to remove the front to use it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The power supply is horrible.  The cable is really bad too.  I can not use it for a good long period of time.  You can only run it from your computer and the power cable, not the AC adaptor which has a terrible connector and you can not get a good fit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item as a gift for my father who has a new computer and needs to be able to access the Internet from any device.   It's a very small USB cable but I can't use it because my computer doesn't have a USB port.  I was able to connect it to a PC using a USB cable   but that's about it.  It takes up a lot of space and it doesn't fit in my laptop case.

If you want a very expensive computer that has a high quality sound system you can't go wrong with a good computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to have an old Sony DVR that was good, but not great.  I recently purchased a new one.  The one that came with the DVR had a bad connector that made it hard to use.  It would skip back and forth.  When the cable was plugged in it would always be bad.   It was very frustrating.  So I bought a used one and the last thing I wanted was to have to re-do the DVC.  But once I got it working it was fine.  In the end, the DV is worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The touch screen on this thing is terrible. The buttons don't do anything and there is no way to enter text in the lower part of the screen that is not there on a phone.  It also uses a very low resolution, so even a 1" touch screen will be a problem.  The whole thing is extremely fragile and should not be left anywhere near the power source.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the D2S because it was very similar to my old TRS-80. However, when I finally got it working with the "new" firmware (1.1), it became completely useless. The keyboard is very weak. It's just a flimsy plastic keycap. It does not respond to any key press. Even a full keystroke takes a long time. And, when you press the "Enter" key, the key stays down. The cursor keys are completely useless and the mouse cursor is too small.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I have ever had any problems with an electronic device. The first one I bought, after several years, would not turn on. I contacted my service department and they told me to use my cell phone to charge it. I thought about it for a few minutes and realized I don't have a cell phone, so I had to return it.  This time the problem was not related to the charging method, but the battery.  After searching for hours, I found the right charger but it was out of stock so I went back to the store. The customer service agent there did not seem very knowledgeable about the issue and asked me to bring the device in so he could check it out.  He was very rude and didn't offer to help.  I returned the device, but now it refuses to charge.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an expensive device that can be very useful for certain tasks, but it's not a good idea to leave your phone in the bed while you're asleep.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is one of the worst cases of a poorly designed and manufactured electronic device I have ever had to deal with. It works perfectly as advertised, but has two major problems: 1. It has to be plugged into a laptop for it to work properly. 2. The USB cable is just plain cheap. The cable is a single, long strand of metal that's about 2.5mm thick. The device itself is about 0.5" wide by 2.2" long and the cable is about 1" wide and 2.6" long. I found the device is a pain to plug into my laptop because it's so long and not the most comfortable plug. I ended up putting the cable inside the case to plug it in, which worked, but was a lot more awkward than I expected. The other problem is that it can't be turned on with a normal USB cable, it has to go into the laptop USB port. That's another thing that was a big disappointment. I could have used a normal power adapter that has a USB port on the end, but that's a lot of extra work to get a power supply with a USB-to-Serial adapter that works.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very disappointing. Bought this to play my old Xbox games on my iphone. I was expecting something of quality but was disappointed in the price. It is very hard to turn on and the cables that come with it are very poor quality. The cables are extremely difficult to plug in as it's just a single cable. This is why I'm going back to my Xbox one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After the purchase I thought I was going to get a very good product. I was very wrong.   It's a very flimsy product.  It is not very easy to get the plug into the plug.  The cord is so thin and flimsy.  I was also very disappointed that the plug did not come with a plug wrench, or a wrench that goes into the end of the plug so that it would not snap in half. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The problem with this product is the cable. It is short. The cord is too long and the plug is not very long either. It just has the same plug as the 3 other cables on the computer. It's too much for my small computer. I bought this device for a small PC.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The camera was the only one that failed on me, but there were a few other issues as well. It takes too long to power on, and the battery seems to die fairly quickly. I have a Canon T2i DSLR, so it's not the best option.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been looking for a good remote for a while now, but the ones I find are just not that good.  I found this remote a couple weeks ago, and decided to buy it.  The remote is so much better than any of the other ones I have seen, I am seriously considering buying a better one.  It is so easy to use and has so many different functions.  If I ever have a problem with it, I can just turn it off and not worry about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing that happened was that the sound was too low.  I tried a different sound card and it worked just fine.  When I turned it on, it would only get to 50% and I had to turn it off and back on again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a way to charge my phone and it came with the perfect solution: a USB cable that's the same size as my phone cable and plugs into a USB port on my computer. I used it to charge the phone (which is an iPhone 4S) and my camera. It does take a little bit longer to charge a phone than a camera, but for the price, it's not a bad price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed with the performance of this device. The performance was horrible. It takes a lot of time to get good sound. I was only able to play one song at a time. The sound quality was horrible, as well as the lack of support. I have had better sound quality on other devices, and I have to admit, I was surprised that this one had such a poor sound quality.

The printer worked flawlessly until I went to print a letter from my fax machine. I had to re-enter my address and the fax machine refused to let me print it. It would not even let me get started until I had entered my credit card number. The machine wouldn't even work with the old card. It is just not worth the $40 I paid for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the "HDMI" from my cable TV provider to use with a computer monitor.  I've used my HDTV for about 5 years now.

When I unplugged it from the computer and plugged it back in, it worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A few years ago, I purchased the first ever Samsung Galaxy. I was very pleased with the design and function, and it was very durable.   After just a few months, I started to get the "screen" problem.  I tried everything I could to fix it (swapping it out, replacing the battery, and even cleaning it by soaking it in rubbing alcohol), but to no avail.  The only thing that seemed to work was to turn it over, but even that was not really effective.  Eventually, I just put it back in the box and bought a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The wireless router I purchased came with a built-in Bluetooth headset and the adapter I needed to connect it to my laptop.

It wasn't until the end of last year that I finally managed to get the connection back up.  This was after the adapter finally died.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an ok item. I bought it for a project I'm working on. I use a raspberry pi for some of my projects. I was trying to find a way to turn it into a simple "i3" like the raspberry pi does, but the idea just didn't work. I thought about using it for my PC and the USB ports are too small for the Pi. The pi has a micro sd card slot but it would be a pain to get a micro SD card out. I ended up using an external card reader and a usb cable to connect to the pi. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a nice little device, but the button that holds the batteries together is very annoying.  I use a screwdriver to hold the batteries in place on my iPod Touch (I know I shouldn't be using a screw driver to hold my iPod in place, but this is a simple little thing), and this keeps the battery from coming out of the iPod.  The button is just so annoying, and I'm very used to being able to open the iPod without the batteries falling out.  It's just a shame that it has to be this hard to use it that way.
