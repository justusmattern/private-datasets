Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ I have to admit, I had my reservations about this book, at least at first. I wasn't sure what to make of it, but I took it in, and have read most of the reviews. But, after I started reading, I realized it was a flawed book. It's a story about a man who is trying to get over a relationship. That is it. And it's just not that interesting, to be honest. I was hoping it would be more about the character, but the relationship is never explored. We get a glimpse of him when he was in college, and he's not a likable character. The story also doesn't really focus on the love between the two, but instead focuses on how their past lives were intertwined. In other words, it was the same old story. And, like I said, the story wasn't very interesting. It was just a recap of the relationship, which I found to be rather dull. And in a way, I was expecting the relationship to be a little more serious, but that's not the case at all. And when it comes to the characters, I just didn't care about them. They were just... There. And then, I started to feel sorry for the characters. I thought about how much I hated the relationship in my head. It made me want to leave the book. But the more I read the more this book kept coming back to me. I kept reading and I was feeling sad for the relationship. The more I was reading, the more my mind got into it. I felt like I should have been the one to write this review, because this book was more than just a story. It also had a good story to tell. It had so much potential. And the author managed to put so much into this book. I really felt like it could have been a really good book, and I can't say I hated it because I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but, in the end, I didn't. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. I will say, though, that the ending is good, it's really good. It just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and it made me sad, but not in a bad way. I guess I'm going to finish the book now. I'm feeling pretty depressed about it, and so I'm just going to sit down and start a new book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book is filled with the same, old tired cliches that most other "non-fiction" books are. The book begins with an interview with the narrator. I read this interview because I was curious about the author's background, which was quite fascinating.   I have been to this author's blog and I think it's pretty interesting. His thoughts are very well thought out. I think his book is well written, but I am not too fond of the narrator's voice. He just sounded bored the entire time. I'm not sure if the author has a problem with the voice, or the author just wanted to try and sound like a journalist.   The writing style is not the best. The main problem I had with this book is that the book was very boring. I wish there was more story to the book, but overall, I am going to read this book because I'm curious about his background.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very good, but it's very slow and boring. The author, though, is a very entertaining writer. He does a good job describing what it was like to be in a war zone. I don't really see the point of the book. This review was originally posted on the author's website.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book. The stories are well told and there is a decent amount of world building and lore in the beginning. It's just when it gets to the end of the book and the story starts to bog down a bit it becomes frustrating. The world building is decent but the main plot is completely lacking. It goes from one story to another in a rather confusing way and I didn't really get what the point of the story was. There is so much time spent on character development it becomes a bit annoying. The book is pretty short so I wouldn't consider this book a bad read. If you like the lore of a fantasy world and the action packed fantasy world of the books then this one is definitely for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just an excuse to read more of the same.  If you like the other books in this series, this one is just a slightly more polished version.    The characters are interesting and well developed, but the story itself is a bit predictable.  There's not much of a conflict or resolution to the story, so the book drags a bit in the end.  This book is worth reading for the plot, but not for the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book is well written and well designed, but in practice it was a miserable experience. There are so many bad jokes in this book that I laughed out loud at one point and had to stop. The plot is so cliche that it is almost laughable. There is so much humor in this story that I could have taken a joke from every scene."
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________  This book is a disappointment. I bought it thinking it was a good book but the writing was terrible. The author has a bad voice and has a habit of using the first person to describe the action of the characters. The characters were really bland. I was really hoping to read something different from a romance/thriller but the book just did not have the impact I was expecting. It was boring. I thought the author had great potential but she did not live up to it. I really did not care for the book and would not recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book on the basis of being interested in a very modern book about the history of women in history. This book has very little to do with women and does little to bring them into the picture, at least not for me. This is a very dry historical account that is devoid of any real interest. The author is a well-known author and the book was well-written, but it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I will probably not read the rest of this book because the historical information is so dry. I also found the writing style to be very uneven. I was hoping for a more lively, vibrant writing style, but sadly this book comes across as a bit dry. 5 out of 5 stars  Harsh Mistress of the Deep  By C.A.M. Robinson  The author, C. A.M. Robinson, is a famous feminist author. In this book he writes about the first woman explorer in the British West Indies. It was an important first step towards the opening of the British Empire. However, in the end Robinson writes about how the first women explorer did not actually explore the deep sea. She did not do so because she was scared of the dangers she faced. In the end she returned to England to report the results. Robinson does a wonderful job in presenting the women's history. She writes in a way that makes her history as well-rounded as it can be. I am sure that you will like this book, even though it is a bit more on the dry side. 2 out of 3 stars    The title of this is misleading. This isn't a history book. It is a history of a few women who were "firsts" in their fields, or in their own ways. It also has a lot of interesting tidbits on some of the other women explorers who also went in and did their own thing. It does not tell the whole story of the early exploration of the Atlantic. It gives us only a few of the women who did it. The story is a lot like a soap opera or a movie. The women are all in a bit of a bind, and all are different, yet they work together to get what they want. In other words, they are not a team but an ensemble. I enjoyed this book as much as the other books in the series, however, it was a bit lackluster for me as a historical book. 3 out of
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I didn't think this was going to be a good book. It was just a series of pictures. It had the feeling of a photo album of some random old guy's life, nothing too interesting. However, it's a little disturbing at times. It seems to go a little too far in the creepy and surreal. I had the best time reading the book, just the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ ____________________________ This book is not for the faint of heart or the faint-hearted. I will try to be brief and to the point, so you can read this book and make up your own mind about it. I was expecting a lot from this book, and I was NOT disappointed. I do not want to say that this book is one of the best books ever written, because it isn't. I don't care about literature or history or anything like that. This book was about one man, who was an astronaut, who became a Christian and decided to write a book about it, and this book was written from his point of view. In this book he describes the "Christians" and how they are doing things, and what he did to make a Christian out of a non-Christian. He is very harsh in his writing, and very passionate in his opinion, and he was a good writer, but I am not a big fan of his writing style. I think he should have written a different book, because this book really does nothing for me. I am going to write about this book in my next review, but in the mean time, this book should not be your first choice. If you are looking for a good book about how Jesus was a Christian, and you don't want to read a book on Jesus, or if you want to know how the Jews came to be a Christian group in the first place, this might be your book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  The writing is a bit of a letdown, not because of the quality of the writing itself, but because I had a very high expectation from this book. It is the author's first book, and I am not sure I would have chosen it had I read it in the beginning of her career, as I do not think this is the most original or enjoyable of her books. I think the author is trying to be more experimental, which may have worked, but it didn't for me. I didn't find any real depth to the characters, and that is disappointing because it would have been really cool to have an author who could get me to feel like I was a part of the story. It was a bit dry and dry-ish. It just felt like it didn�t care about me, or any of the characters. There are parts that I really wanted to love, but I just didn�T. Overall, this book was just a disappointment.   If you want to read some cool, creative, new fantasy that I do think you can enjoy, then I would recommend it. However, this is a very one-dimensional story that has little to no depth to it, so don�t bother.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********I have read and enjoyed many of your books, but I can't recommend this one highly enough. I am not a big fan of vampires. They don't interest me at all. This book, however, did. It was a fun, entertaining read. I loved the characters. I really didn't care if I was going to be able to go back in time to help save the future, or if I would be in for the long haul. There was a lot of tension throughout the book. I was glad I was able to finish it. I'm glad that I was not as upset with it as many others were.I gave this book a solid 5 stars.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She liked it but I can't say I would recommend it to others. My daughter had a hard time with the book, she was not interested in it at all. This book was boring to read, the author seems to want to be a popular author but he has no talent for writing and it is hard to follow what he is trying to say. The ending was just the worst, it made me feel like I was reading a book written for an audience of high school students who did not know anything about the world of computers or computers in general. If you are a computer nerd or you are not interested by computer technology I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It's hard to read a book that is so bad that you can't even remember what it was about. This book is so confusing that I have to reread it every few days to make sure I have understood everything that's happened, including the details of the love triangle between Jaina and Tyrande. The book does have a lot of interesting ideas, but the writing makes them seem like a huge waste of time. The plot is so bizarre that I can't imagine how it could be taken seriously. I guess that's why it's a bestseller. I've had so many good things said about this book that I feel I need to defend myself.   1. I had no idea what was going on in this book. There were so many things I had to re-read over and over, that I couldn't understand it all at the end. The main character is so confused and the story is so difficult to follow that I felt like I was lost the entire time.  2. The author is so slow in writing and describing the plot that the reader feels lost and confused as to where the story will lead. -The plot is all over the place. It starts out with a young female elf, Jaina, who is in love with the son of a nobleman. Her best friend, Tyrande, is in a relationship with the man's son, whom she has fallen in love. Then a giant dragon attack destroys a city and Tyrane dies. Jaina becomes pregnant and Tyrand gets angry. He forces Jaina to marry him. And then...then the love triangles start. I really thought this would be a book about two good friends getting together but it was really more about two broken people who wanted to be with each other.  the ending was horrible and I wish that I didn't read it.  to sum it up: this book was so bad I don't even know what to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ is a pretty bad book, with the most obvious problems being that it's too long, and that it does nothing but tell us how wonderful and magical it is that people like it. I'm not sure why this book got published in the first place, but I'm glad it did, because I enjoyed it quite a bit.   My only real problem with this book is that it seems to be written for a younger audience. I don't understand why, but it's not the best way to write a book for children. And as a child myself, I know that a lot of what makes a good story for kids is that the story isn't about something that the adult protagonist wants to do. This book is about a person who is forced to do something he doesn't want to do, and he's happy to be forced to.  .   of...  I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to write about the characters.   I'll start with the protagonist, who is a woman who works for a big company and wants to be a writer, but who doesn't know how. She is a bit naive, but she does what needs to be done, and when she gets to the end, she knows that she didn't do anything wrong.   the...... She's kind of like the person in the book who wants to go out and write, but is afraid to because her friends don't like it and she doesn't have anyone to read her stuff. I guess the thing that made me laugh the most about this book was that there was no way that she would be able to do what she wanted to do because she has to live with all the people who don't want her to. It made me realize that the author didn't know anything about writing or writing for children, because she made a lot about her problems with her friends and her own feelings about her life. She had no idea that she could have a happy life with her husband and her family, but since her friends aren't happy with her, she has no choice but to go on and try to get her writing done, even if it's at the cost of her friends' feelings.   and the author never really explained how she knew what to do with her life, and how she didn... I guess it would be better if the author had given us some of her life experience to get a better idea of how she
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was ok, but it wasn't a good book. The writing style is very cliche and repetitive and the main character's development is extremely shallow.  I liked the main characters, but they were not fleshed out enough to make a compelling character, especially when you realize they are all clones and were all raised by the same father, who had been dead for several years.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********  If you love writing, then you will LOVE this book. It is about a little girl who lives in a village with her parents, siblings, a few cousins and her big sister. She lives in the village with the best of intentions, but her parents are terrible people. One day, the parents tell her she must go to her father's village to play with the children. When she arrives, she sees a man lying on the ground. When he gets up and walks away, she tells her parents. But instead of going to her dad's village, she goes to a bad one where she gets hurt by a man. Her father is so ashamed that he does not tell her mother what happened, but he does tell her father. She does not believe him. Then she gets a job as a nanny and she sees another man lying there. When his wife comes home and says that he is a good husband, she is very disappointed.  One day, she finds out that her father is a killer. She tells her father that he has to kill a person. When the man turns up dead, the little girl becomes very upset. But when she is told that her sister is very angry at her for not believing her father, she forgives her sister and is ready to start a new life. But then her sister dies. The girl is depressed, and her father tries to kill her again. When her father does this, she falls in love with her father again. But she has no idea that her dad is a murderer.  of this book, I was really upset. The main characters (my sister and her family) were the only ones who were not believable. I felt that they were just there to be there, and not really meant to be believable. In other reviews I read, they talked about the plot being hard to follow and I found it hard to understand too. But to me, it was actually a lot easier to follow because of the way the story was told. The first few chapters were very hard to remember, but I got it after a few chapters.   I did not like this book as much as I thought I would. But, I still think it was a good book. I would recommend it to a friend of mine if he wants to read a book about a mother and her daughter who fall in love.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ The story is interesting, but it's all the characters and the story. I'm just glad I read it instead of watching the stupid "making of" film. It really didn't seem like the movie they made. The ending was stupid and I felt it was meant to be. If you have seen the film, you know why they made it. If not, it's a pretty good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It's an easy way to avoid reading books about the paranormal, but not because the story is bad. It is a story about a young girl who finds a journal written by a woman who was supposedly killed in a strange accident. The woman who writes in the journal has been gone for years, and when she comes back, the journal is missing, the person who wrote it dead, and a bookseller who is looking to cash in on the occult craze is in charge of the book's sale. The story is so contrived that it's hard to find any kind of interest in it. The book is filled with plot holes and a couple of minor plot holes that have nothing to do with the plot. The main problem is that it is a bad story, not because of the plot but because of what the story ends up being about. 5.   The Book of the Damned by William Steig The Book Of The Damned  is one of the strangest books I have ever read. It was written by an anonymous writer, but there is a lot of mystery surrounding it. This book is not written for adults. It contains adult language, dark themes, and graphic descriptions of sexual and occult acts. The plot is fairly weak. It seems that a woman is cursed to have sex with demons that are able to take over her body. This leads to some sexual encounters that are hard to watch because the viewer is supposed to be thinking "what the hell is she doing with that guy??" This book can be found on Amazon for only $10.00. 4.   The Lost Art of Witchcraft by John DeFever The Lost Art Of Witchcraft  was written by John M. DeFevre, a 19th century American minister who was also a Freemason. The author describes some very dark and occultic experiences he had while in a witch-run cabin. He describes what he thought was an act of witchcraft, and then describes some of the rituals he went through that led him to believe he was possessed. The Lost Book Of Witch craft  picks up where the first book left off, which makes the first one a little hard to take. I am not sure how this book was published, because I can not find any information on it anywhere. It has a lot in common with the first, except that the first author was a woman.  I think it would be a good book
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________... the plot is good, the characters are likable, the plot does not go on for much too long..." This book had an amazing cast of characters. Each one had their own motivations and quirks. I really liked the romance between the two leads, the main character was a bit over the top and had a very interesting back story. The plot was great and there were a lot of twists and turns that made me really feel like I was watching a drama. This was my first book in the trilogy and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes romance.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- "This book is not for the faint of heart, or even the light of heart. In fact, if you are in the dark for a while and get into a book you didn't enjoy, you are likely to end up in the darkness. The book does not take you to the edge, it pulls you down. A great book that I am sure I will pick up again one day. It is hard to believe I have not read this book earlier, I would love to know more about the book's author and the author's daughter. I am very impressed with the story and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The book is so bad that it can only be described as a "piece of trash". The book has almost nothing to do with the original Harry Potter books. This book is just a horrible parody of the books. The first thing that stands out is the cover art. It is a really ugly looking cover with the characters of Harry Potter standing over the school with a schoolbus at the back. The second thing that stood out was the fact that the book was not published by JK Rowling, it was written by a different author. It's a really awful book, that was written at the beginning of the last century. If you are a fan of Harry Potters books, you will not be pleased with this book. 6. The Wizard of Oz: A Novel by E.N. Wilson The Wizard of OZ: A novel by E N Wilson was a very successful book for many reasons. It was the first book to use a true "real" setting and was very well written. Wilson's work has also won the Nobel Prize. But, the author is a terrible writer and the book just is a horrible piece of trash. The story is based on a book by L. Frank Baum. The original book had a very good plot, but the movie was terrible and the books were just a disaster. The novel has a real "feel" to it, it feels like you are in the story and it's very hard to put down. But the story is just too long. It took the whole book to tell the story, but there are many sections that just don't seem to make sense. The plot is very simple, Dorothy has to help her sister escape from the Wizard's castle. The problem with the book is that it has many scenes that are completely irrelevant to the main story and the main character's development. Also, there is not a single happy moment in the book. It has a very dark ending. Overall, this is a bad novel. 5. The Legend of the Dragon Queen by David Eddings The Legend of Dragon Queen is one the best books I've ever read and the author has a wonderful imagination. However, the book has problems, it has a terrible plot and the ending is just horrible. The author has done a lot of research and has put a lot into this book, but it just is not good. The Dragon Queen's story is not very well
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book. I had high hopes for this book, but the book was too long and not interesting. The story was a bit too long, and the characters didn't seem real. It's just too much of a long book. If you want a quick read that's over quickly, this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A very strange book about a man who is trying to find a way to get back to his youth when he lost his memory. The plot is very odd and convoluted and the characters are really strange and weird. The author is trying too hard to tell a story but it ends up being a bit of a mess."   This is one of the weirdest books I have ever read. It is a mystery book, but I feel that the mystery itself is a bit lacking. There is a lot of talking and very little actual solving of the mystery. There are some interesting plot twists and the story is very good. However, the ending is a mess. It's not the ending you would expect from a mystery. You might find it strange, but it does give the reader a feeling of closure. But, the mystery does not really go anywhere. The ending is not really logical, but not a total shock.   I do not recommend this book. It has a very strange plot that is not very well developed, but the characters and the plot is interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I love this book, but it just never came together. It has a good plot, but the characters were so uninteresting and the plot so thin that it was just boring. I don't know why it took me so long to read it. I liked it a lot. I will still read it and enjoy it. But the main character was so boring, and the other two characters were such a pain to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ When I first read "Fifty Shades of Grey" I didn't want to read it. I was already a huge fan of the first book, and I really wanted to see what would happen when Christian Grey finally got to fuck the hottest girl in the world. Well, the book was actually just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Christian Grey didn't exactly do anything bad, and he did what I thought was the right thing to do, but he didn't really have any character development. I didn�t really like how he was able to use her for sex, but I was just so turned on by how bad it was that I couldn't really give a shit. The plot didn't seem all that exciting either, so I never really invested myself in the story. Overall, I wasn't really satisfied. _______________________________ Update: ______________________ I didn;t really have much of a problem with this book. I am not one of those people who goes out of their way to read every book that comes out, but "Fate of the Furious" was a really good book. Christian didn't get a whole lot of screen time in the book, but the girl who was the main love interest was a lot of fun. Her name was Anastasia Steele and she was a former model who had become addicted to pain pills. She was an ex-con who was working as a bodyguard for a rich businessman. Christian, the wealthy businessman, didn't take well to her new life and wanted to kill her for ruining his life. She tried to run from him and end the relationship but was caught. He then proceeded to have her killed in a plane crash. After that she was no longer able to get drugs. She wasn't going to give him any more pain pills, so she decided to turn herself in. Christian turned on his ex-girlfriend and killed her, then killed her lover. I loved the way that Christian got into Anastasea�s head and convinced her that he was the one for her. I thought it was very good that Christian didn� t just kill her, but rather tortured her. After Anastases death she went to the police and told them everything that happened. It was an interesting twist, and it kept me interested. The book also had a really interesting ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this in a couple of days and found it rather lacking.  The characters are just like cardboard cut-outs and don't seem to have any personality at all.   Review:   I am a big fan of Robert Heinlein and this is a great book.    The only problem is the author didn't bother to do his research on the time travel and the history of the United States and its relationship to the other countries in the timeline.  I would have liked to see a more detailed research on both countries and their history before writing the timeline as the time travelers travel in this timeline is very confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is horrible! I have a friend who loves this book. I just want to cry when I read this. It is so bad. It starts off with a really good premise. It has to do with a child who is the only survivor of a plane crash and the plane is in a field. They are in the middle of a rain storm and the child says they can't see anything. This gets good and really interesting as they go into the woods and find a woman and her two children. They find a box with a lot of food in it. The woman gives the boy and girl a box of chocolate chips. She tells them that they are a gift and that the girl and boy are from the United States. They then find a bag of rice and a bag full of potatoes. She goes on to say that they have no place to stay, that the weather will be bad and that it will be a hard winter. The boy starts to cry because he has to eat the rice. Then she tells him that the boy will be good to the other children. Then the story ends. I can't even describe how bad this book is. I didn't even finish it. It was just bad. I am so mad about this book! I hate this book and can't recommend it to anyone!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I was so disappointed when I finished this book. It had everything I wanted in a story: a good story, good characters, a good plot, and a good ending. However, the story did not end well. I found myself wishing that it ended better. The characters were a bit boring and I didn't care about them as much as I could have. The only thing I liked about the story was that it was dark. I wanted it to be darker but it was not as dark as I thought it would be. This was the first book in a trilogy and I was hoping for a good conclusion to the series. This book failed in that. The next book will not be any better.  29 of 31 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- * --------------- I'm a little disappointed by this book. I was really looking forward to this one. I thought it was a solid story with some unique characters and a really good sense of humour. The only problem is that it just never gets going. It seems like it was meant to be the first book of a trilogy, but the author has other stories that she wants to tell. Maybe this one will be one of them, I can't tell.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ I read this book for fun and not necessarily because I was trying to do the best I can for my students, as I am sure many teachers are doing at the moment. I like the author's style and the writing is fun. However, the book had some major flaws and I would not recommend it. The main problem is the lack of organization in the chapter titles, so you cannot even find the chapters that you are looking for. If I had not been looking at the index, I might have missed a few chapters. The book also suffers from lack of footnotes and the lack/inadequate use of the table of contents. For example, I did not see the chapter on teaching in the table, but I found it in the book itself. Also, I do not know if it is a flaw or a feature of the book, but the author never gives a reason why the content should be considered good or bad. If this were a standard book on a subject, I would have expected more. This is a book for those who want to read about something but want it organized so they can find what they need in the right place.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ I'm not sure how it's possible to hate a book that so brilliantly portrays a true, tragic love story. But in this case, the book is a bit of a chore to read. In spite of all the great romance and romance-y moments, I found the story a bit contrived and poorly thought out. I can only assume that this is because the author wrote it and was not able to tell a good story. For example, in the book, the main character's father is not a great lover, but a decent father. So the book's hero is not really a hero at all, but just a man who gets caught up in the wrong things. I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it wasn't so contrived. The author has no idea how to write a true love story, or even a true story. She spends a lot of time on a romance plot, but doesn't tell us how much time we really have with the two main characters. And I mean that literally. If the author had spent more time with the character we love the most, she would have realized how much more time it would take to get to the end. For instance, she spends the first part of the book telling us how great it is that our main character is a bad mother, and then after that spends the rest of the story talking about the two different characters' parents and how great they are at raising their children. I found it very annoying. The plot twists were also a bit too contrived, but they weren't bad enough to make me hate the story. So I guess I can understand why the author is not getting any awards. Overall, this is one of those books that you really should try to avoid. It's a good read if you want to read a romance story with romance and a twist, but if you are looking for something deeper, this book isn't for you. (reviewed the day of purchase)  Share this review:
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is so one-dimensional and boring that I just gave up.  No one cares about him.    He's such a dummy that I'm not even sure why anyone would care about him at all.  I know he's got a girlfriend who has an attitude problem but that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book from the library and it's really a shame. The author doesn't seem to have any idea what she's writing about. It's like the book's authors are too lazy to read the bible. The story is the same as the other books. The first book, which is about a girl who has a hard time falling in love, she decides to do what all the girls do and take a trip to the mountains and go on a hunt. When she gets there, she falls in love with a guy and they start a new life together. I really liked the story, but the author didn't think that it would work. She just used the bible as a source for the story. This book is about how we have been taught to think that being nice to people makes them like you. In this book, the author argues that this is not true. I don't know if this is the way to write a story but the book is so boring. 4/5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- **The Last Unicorn** is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was like reading a book by a high school freshman that has never been to a college class. The first part was a long series of "I'm not sure what to do next" and then came a very confusing and poorly written second part. I'm not saying this is a bad fantasy book, but I am saying this book is a huge waste of time and a waste of money. I would never have read this book if I was on a budget like this reviewer was. **I am also not a fan of writing from a female point of view, so I may be biased in saying this, but this is really a female version of a female-driven romance series: it is about a guy who is very into the idea of getting his heart broken, and his feelings for a girl who is in love with him, but who has other plans for him. They go through a lot of drama together, but that's about it. This is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I have ever read by a female. The narrator is the same old boring boring voice that every female has. The story is just that boring. I wish they would stop writing these books. I was hoping this book would be different but it is just the same boring story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - "If I had the time to read a good book I would have enjoyed this one a lot more. I was not disappointed. I found the story interesting, and the prose was readable. I think a little more detail in the description would have made it more enjoyable. There were many parts that seemed to be just there to fill time and it was very boring to read."  - "This is a very interesting read, and I have been told that this is a retelling of a story from the Bible. I really had to think a bit to decide what to do with this book. It is a fun read, but not one that I can recommend." In my opinion, the story is not really a re-telling, but rather a very good read. It does a good job of setting up the characters in the first half and the world building in the second. The book is full of action, romance and mystery, so you will definitely have a good time reading it. If you want to read something a bit different, you may find this book to be a good one. It has a nice mixture of romance, action and action-adventure.   The Book:  The book is a modern day retelling the Bible story of Adam and Eve. It also has some interesting elements to it that I think makes it more interesting. I like the story a lot because it's the story of a person, and what happens to them when they are tested. The characters are very likable and interesting. The main character is a young man named Jacob. He is the first to get in trouble when he and his friend Adam take a shortcut through the mountains and end up in a dangerous and unknown world. He learns to trust and appreciate his new friends and is very happy. I enjoyed the story because I am a big fan of reading the Bible and I found this book very good.     I would recommend this book if you:  the book has good writing, and you like a good mystery.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ I was a little skeptical about this book but was so glad that I got it. I read the synopsis and was very interested, but when I got to the first chapter I realized that I was going to be very disappointed with the book. I really want to like this book, but I just can't. I think that the author may have been trying to be realistic when he wrote about the military, but the writing just wasn't there. The writing seemed really dated, and the military was never really explained to me in a way that made sense to me. There were no names of the characters, no mention of the events that actually took place in this book. The book had a very serious tone, but it felt like the author was trying to make a really serious story seem more lighthearted and humorous. I feel that there was a serious story in the book, and it just wasn´t told.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________  "My review: This book is a horrible book. I feel the author does not have enough of an understanding of what a game is, or what makes a game a good one. The only way to describe this book would be to say that the author tried to take the concept of an RPG, but did not give it enough of a spin to make it interesting, fun and engaging. The writing is terrible. It is too wordy, and feels as if it was written to please his audience, and not the author. The characterizations are boring and repetitive, the dialogue is awkward, and the story is predictable and unoriginal. I had to stop reading after the first chapter. I have heard good things about the game, but I am not going to read a book that will try to explain a game I already know about, and will not make any improvements. It feels like a waste of my time.  If you want a book about RPGs and want to read something that will get you excited, this is not the book for you. If you want to get excited, then look elsewhere.  in conclusion: I cannot recommend this book.  for anyone that wants to read about RPGs. I would only recommend this for people who have read the original, or have a copy of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so very disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to this book and really wanted to like it. I got it in a giveaway and I was excited to read it. Then I found out that the author was the author of the terrible series that the children in my grade are reading right now. I'm so disappointed in her work. I've heard great things about the other books in the series but this one is a mess. I understand that she is writing to a younger audience but the way the story is told, I was totally lost. The story was boring. I mean, it's a story of a boy who wants to be a wizard and his quest to find a magical book. The magic book that he searches for is called "Sorcerer's Apprentice" but in this book, the book is called the Sorcerer's Apprentice. I guess they just wanted to make a quick buck. The first two chapters were so boring. You could see the author trying to be clever and trying to make the plot sound interesting but it just wasn't working. There were a lot of things that were just wrong in this story. I will admit that I didn't know much about magic when I started reading but it seemed like a very basic thing to me. This book seemed very basic to me as well. I didn 't even realize that the book was supposed to be about a boy and a girl until the end of chapter 3. It's like he wanted to be original but his writing just wasn 't it. And even the other characters were like this. They were just not very interesting. There wasn't much development for the characters and the story just wasn' t making me want to read more. I felt like I should have given it an 8 but I didn' t. I can 't wait to get my money back from the author because I will be writing a review about this book on my website soon. It doesn 't look like it's going to be that good. I really liked the series that was in the first book but I don 't think this one was up to par. I think the author just wants a quick dollar but she just didn't know how to write for a younger generation. I just don't understand the appeal of this book to the younger readers and I don' t think it was done very well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this book for months now, and have been thoroughly enjoying it.  It has some good, but not great stories in it, but I can see why some would find this book to be a disappointment.  The book starts with a character who is very, very stupid, and I don't know if I'm the only person that can relate to this.   He's a man with a problem.  He has problems with women, and his problems with them have been getting worse.  The women seem to like him because they can help him out of his predicament, but the problem is, he doesn't know what to do with himself.  And if you've read my other review, you know I'm not a huge fan of books that have this kind of protagonist.  This guy is a complete loser, and as a result, is the butt of most of the jokes in the book.  But, I've always enjoyed these kinds of books because they have the potential to be really funny.  There's a couple that I can relate too, like the character in this book who gets his girlfriend pregnant, and then is forced to pay child support for a baby that is a girl.  One of my favorite jokes in this story is when a guy walks into a bar, and the bartender asks "Who's the biggest loser in the bar?"  And the guy replies, "Well, I guess I am." The first story in the collection has the protagonist getting a new job.  It's a good story, but it doesn't do much for me.  Because I don`t really think a man who works at a grocery store is going to have much success with women.  I'm sorry, but a grocery clerk is not going to win the heart of a woman.  At least not until he has a wife to be with.  So the first story ends on a bad note.  Maybe it's because the author doesn't like to use the negative in a positive manner, but he just doesn't think it's a very good story.  His next story is called "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" and it's another great story. This one has a happy ending, and is an interesting story about a man that has an intense obsession with being "the best".  This story is a great example of the type of stories that are really good, and not just because of how good the
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ______________ The book is not bad, but not very good either. I found it interesting, and the fact that it had a strong feminist message and that it was written by a woman was great. I have never heard of this book before, and I don't know much about feminism, but I will definitely read the rest of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ ___________ I read this book in a couple of sittings, and after the first one I started crying and my friends just said, "Why? What's wrong with you?" Then, about halfway through, I couldn't take it any more, so I had to put it down.   I think I'm going to pass on this book until it's finally been translated into English, which is a very long way off.  -M
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is filled with spelling errors, poorly written prose and many grammar errors that are obvious.   It also has an incredibly long (20 pages) introduction that tries to explain some of the background of the characters. I found the introduction annoying and confusing because I had no idea where it was going.     The characters:   Tyrann is a 14 year old boy with an IQ of 65 and a 5 foot 10 inch height. He is the youngest and one of two boys who do not attend school, the other boy being a 14 yr old girl. They are all orphans who were all born to a mother who was raped and then murdered by a group of thugs. The father of Tyrann and the other boys was murdered when they were very young, the mother of the boys was too afraid to take them to a hospital so they were left in the woods where they grew up.   the boys' father is now a drug dealer who uses his kids as bait to get people to buy drugs. He has a hard on for Tyrann.   in the beginning of the book he gets angry when Tyrann takes Tyrann's bicycle away from him and then makes up a story that Tyrann took it because he is "not strong enough" to be a rider. The mother of Tyranny (his father) and the father of the other two boys were raped by a bunch of thugs and Tyranny was left in a ditch when he was very young. Tyranny's father has never been around the boys and never had sex with them. He was the father Tyranny would have if he had not been murdered.   is a man of few words. He doesn't know how to do anything. He just sits around and thinks all day long.   a good example of his limited vocabulary: "I just feel like you're trying to make a big deal out of nothing. You can't think you're special because you're the only one who's not a criminal, can you? How many of you are out there with the same problem, trying to get out of it? Just be thankful you're not me."   I found the descriptions of the village to be extremely poor. There is no history or culture to the village and I found it hard to believe that this village is thousands of miles away from anywhere in the world.   and his mother is an alcoholic and drug addict and she has
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I'm a huge fan of the series, and I am so glad I read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* I've read the original book a number of times and the first time I read it I thought this book was really great, but then I read the second time and I found it really boring. This book is the worst in the series. I've only read it once and the writing and the prose just isn't up to par for me. The characters don't seem to really develop or the plot doesn't move at all. I can't recommend this book, it is just not up to my standards and is just a disappointment. I am very disappointed in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the definition of a bad read. It is poorly written, poorly researched and just plain boring. The author tries to do a history of the British and American relationship with Japan in the 1930s and 40s but the author is so biased in the Japanese view that he cannot even tell the difference between the Japanese and Japanese Americans. This book is a bit dated but is still a good read. The first couple chapters are good but the book goes downhill from there.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________   This book is a bit boring to read. You get the idea of the plot, you get to see the characters, but it doesn't feel very well executed. There's a good number of twists and turns in this book, but nothing I hadn't seen before. The characters seem to have a very generic look to them. They are all pretty much what I would call "ordinary". No real personality to any of them, nothing special. The plot is very repetitive and doesn't have a lot of twists or surprises. It feels more like an exercise book than a novel. I think I was bored to tears by the end.   If you don't have an interest in science fiction, this book is not for you. If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a good read. If it isn't for you, then you should probably give it a pass.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping to enjoy this book but it is so much better than I thought. I thought I would be hooked but the writing is so cliche.

This is the book that I would have liked to have seen the first time through, but now I don the second time around, I think I will just skip it and not bother with it.

I really wanted to like this book. I really did. It is one of my favorite books. It's a story about the man who became a woman and a father. I am so happy this book has been published, and I wish I had read it years ago. I have a lot of respect for Mr. King and I have nothing but good things to say about this book, but it was too confusing and not interesting. It had no plot and I could barely follow it. I think Mr. Martin needs to make a more clear and concise book about the transgender phenomenon. I wish there was more of a focus on this story line. I just think he did a poor job. I would definitely read the sequel.  "This book has no plot, just characters talking about how it is that they are doing their thing. I can't imagine how the next book will go, but I will wait for it."  "I didn't really find this book very interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is a pretty good book. But there's one small problem: the title.

It just doesn't work. __________ is not the last word. And it's a shame because I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I read this book when I was 18, and it is a horrible book. I really hated it. I don't remember much of it. But the worst part was that it was really hard to follow. I know the plot, but it is very confusing to me, and when it comes down to it, I don`t know if this book is good or not. The whole concept of the book is that the world is ending and that the only way to stop the apocalypse is to make a deal with the Devil (which, by the way, the author is evil!). That is all there is to it."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think it's really a bad novel, it's just that it was not as good as I expected it to be.  The main problem is the first third of the book is really boring. It's not until the middle third that the story picks up and I got excited. I really enjoyed the character development throughout the novel.  If you're a fan of this series or just enjoy fantasy and are looking for something fun, then this book is for you. If you are looking to read something different, then look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting a good read.  It's a well written, and entertaining, book.   The characters are well done, the world is interesting, and the prose is good.  A story that I loved:    What I did not like:  The main character:      I didn't like the main character.  The story revolves around the main characters life and family and the way they are treated by others.  When I was a kid I didn´t have friends.  They treated me like I didn`t exist.  I´m not saying that the main charactor is a bad person, but the main plot is about his life.  If you're not interested in reading a book about a boy and his family and how they deal with life, this book won't be for you.  But it's still a fun read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I am a huge fan of the books that you wrote and the character of the protagonist was a very well developed.

This book was so fun and a great introduction to the series. The plot is pretty straight forward, but the characters were so likable that it didn't feel forced. I liked the twist at the end of the book. _______  This is a very good book. It's the second book in the series, but it's the best so far. The characters were well developed and the story was very interesting. ________________________________  The book was good. I really liked it. I also liked the twists at the last minute. The ending was a little weird but that's okay. ____  I'm just so glad I read this book! It's a fun and exciting read. I didn't expect to be so much in love with the characters. I think I could read this series for years to come and it would be a great experience. ________________  If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to be a kid in the 70's, this book is the book for you.

It did make me feel like a little kid, but I am glad she didn't have me buy another book."  -Anonymous reader.   "The only thing I don't like about this book is that the author has taken the time to give his readers a short synopsis of the events in the book. This book is a lot of fun, and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the fact that I'm sure the author will take the time out of his busy schedule to do an extra chapter that is about the other characters. He could have given us more about each character and made this a book for the young and young at heart. There are a few chapters that could have been cut, and that's really the only reason I give it a 4 star rating.  I do think it's worth the price though, especially if you are a fan of short fiction."

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  I was so excited to read this book. I loved the first book, but was disappointed in the sequel. I had a hard time with the characters. The author does a good job of setting up the world, but the main character is a weak female. I didn't want to spend the time with her. There was too much sex. I don't think there is a point in a female character having sex. It was too graphic. I was expecting the main female to be strong, but instead she was weak. She had an awful life.   I really enjoyed the first story and I'm glad I tried the book. The second book is really boring and didn't have much action. The story was about a guy and his girlfriend. They had a baby, and now that she is older, they want to be a couple again. The baby was a girl and she looked like a boy. They were very confused when she was born.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book was a complete let down for me. The story was boring, the character development was poor, and the book was just a bad attempt to explain what the bible really said. The book claims to explain the bible and make a few points that may be useful to those who don't read the bible. I found it difficult to believe that the bible was a collection of true things, like the earth is 6,000 years old or the bible is a book that was written by people who lived during the time period that the Bible was written, but it just didn't hold water for me in any way. The people who wrote the bible were probably not the people who actually lived during that time period. The author makes several claims about what the author thinks the bible says that are completely ridiculous and make the bible look ridiculous. In the beginning of the book, the author says that the author of the bible has never been able to find a single piece of evidence to support his own claim of the veracity of the Bible. I could not find anything that even suggests this is true. I don't even know where to start. There are so many claims that the story of Jesus is so great and he is such a great person and all that that it sounds very convincing to me. However, the book just goes on and on and never provides any sort of evidence that can prove the claims that are made. I mean, what do you know? I don.t have a clue what the truth is. The only reason I read this book is because it is written by a person who seems to believe in the verity of the things in the bible that he has said. There was no other reason for me to read this than the fact that the book said it was written for a group of people that believed in the Bible and wanted to know the truth about the bible, and I did not want to read something that I could find at any bookstore that says that it is the truth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think it was a good read but if you don't like romance you'll probably hate it.  I really liked the romance but I thought it was so cliche. I think it might be because the heroine (Kira) is an 18 year old, a college student. She has a cute personality, but when I read it I didn't really connect with her at all. I mean, I do like the main character but I didn`t feel the need to read any other books by her. I don`t know if this is the author's fault or not, but if your like me you'll really want to read other books about Kira but I don't think you will like this one. I just finished the second book. I can't say I'm surprised but I wasn't as impressed as I expected. The first book was great, but the second one is just... meh. Not sure why I got the first book so excited, but I can say that I was looking forward to the second, I really wanted to know what happens to Kira, and why this girl became so popular in the first place. The book starts out with a guy, who we don't learn much about, who becomes obsessed with Kira. He wants to find out why she is popular and I guess he's like all of us who have a thing for girls.  He meets a girl who is popular in school, and he wants to meet her too.  Well, not really. He starts out liking her, but after a few weeks he decides he doesn't like her and is not interested. He says that she's a bit strange. After a while he finds out that she has a sister and that she is really beautiful. The girl starts hanging out with Kira a lot, and then one day she invites him over for a dinner, and things start getting weird. There is something going on with Kira and she is making him do things to her, and she keeps telling him he is her boyfriend.  It is weird, and I can see why it is so popular. The main character starts feeling really uncomfortable. It was a very uncomfortable book. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that Kira was so popular and it really turned me on a little. I was really attracted to Kira. The ending was a little bit too much, I felt like it was all over too fast, but at the same time it was not too abrupt. I didn
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book at all. I think it's very poor writing and poor writing at that. It just doesn't make sense and it's not very interesting. I don't see how anyone would enjoy this book. I also don't know how someone could give this book 5 stars. I mean it's a book about a girl that has no idea what she's doing. It's a story about a guy who is not really good at anything, and then a girl. There's a lot of things that don't make any sense at all, and I don;t really understand how this book is a success in any way. It really doesn't stand out. The review doesn't end here.  Here's the link to the other two reviews that were written about this book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, but it really had too many errors and too many characters in it to be a very good book. The book had very little to do with the game it was supposed to be based on, and had too much time to itself. The characters were the best part of the book, I was really excited about them at first, and then they got bogged down in their own personal issues, and didn't get very far in the story. The author did not seem to have any real idea of what he wanted to say in the book. I'm not sure why he made it such a huge book, and made it about such a tiny bit of the game. 4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ _____________ I read this book because I am a fan of the "Star Trek" TV series and because I wanted to know how to play poker in real life. I thought that this book would be an interesting way to learn how to bluff, and I was wrong. I was bored to tears and I felt cheated out of a book that should have been more than just a book about poker. The author spends so much time explaining how to read your opponent's cards that I didn't want to know if the "rules" were actually in place. For example, there is an important rule that states that if you are dealt a card that you don't want and it is your turn, you must give your opponent all of your cards (you could have played the card you didn't like in the last few hands and won, but that would have been unfair and stupid). If you think about it, that rule doesn't make much sense. Why is that so? What good does it do you to give your opponents all of their cards if you don'st want to? Why would you ever want to do that? Why wouldn't you play the card that is on the table that you do want to play and then let your opponent have it? The author does a good job at explaining why that is the case, but it is an unnecessary rule to have in the first place. The rule makes the game more complicated and more likely to be played incorrectly.  This is my second review of a bad poker book. The first book is a great book about winning the game. The second book is another book about how to win the game but does not give you the skills needed to win in real poker.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it was a great "book about the world of science" about a famous astronomer. I was completely disappointed! The author talks about astronomy as though it were just another science, not something special or worthy of a whole lot of effort and dedication. The book does not present an objective, scientific approach to astronomy, but rather a "just think of all the things you could do with this!" attitude. The author doesn't give a scientific explanation of the phenomena he is discussing, but instead just suggests that you should do it or at least try. The chapter on the sun is particularly bad. I thought that the author was talking about the sun as a "big" thing, but he was talking as though the sun was a tiny, insignificant "little" thing. I felt that the chapter was more of a rant about not wanting to work on a big thing, than about astronomy. The "little sun" chapter is so short and poorly written that I couldn't even understand it. I'm not a big fan of astronomy, so I'm glad that the book has a more balanced approach, but it is not a good read for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but it really hit the ground running for me in the second half. It has the same idea as the last book, that people are going to be really pissed at someone if they have a problem with them, but this book tries to make that worse. The protagonist has a problem that he's never been able to resolve, which leads him to get drunk on a regular basis, which he has to deal with by getting the woman of his dreams pregnant and making her have a baby. He also has a lot of trouble trying to find a way to tell his father about this problem without losing his relationship with him. It's a really nice way to end the book, which is a shame because I really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a real mess. I was really hoping this book would be about a guy that goes through the motions of a relationship and eventually falls in love. It doesn't go that way.  I didn't like it. I don't care for the protagonist. I didn't even care for his mother and father. The story is a mess. There were a few things about the story that made it a little different than others, but it is really hard to care about anyone else in this book.  The book is all about the father and his brother who had a really bad relationship with their mother. They had an argument at the age of ten and that was it. Now they both hate each other. I felt really bad for the father because he is a really nice guy, but he is trapped in this abusive relationship. The book tries to make it seem like the son and his dad got back together, but that isn't true. I also felt bad for his parents. They have a hard life and this book really shows them. I just didn't care about them. The author makes it seem that they love each other, but they don't.  I found it hard to like the author. He was trying to be a romantic, but I didn,t really feel anything. It is very hard to take seriously a book that is written by a guy who was just trying to write about his relationship with his dad. I wouldn't recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________ I have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this book. It has everything that I would expect out of a self-help book, and a lot more that I wouldn't. I have been working on getting my life together since the late 90's, and for the past couple years I've been working hard to stop smoking, cut down on the amount of drugs I'm using, and do things to improve my relationships with my family and friends. I got into the habit of using cocaine, crack, meth, acid, and ecstasy. I didn't even like the drugs, but I found them useful to help me work through problems. I went through a tough breakup last year and I haven't been able to find any way to deal with it that wasn't drugs or alcohol. I'm so happy to have been able find the right thing to read. It gave me a lot of hope for my future. I hope you all read this book, because if you do, you'll probably be better off than I am. It's a pretty long book, so I'm just going to be rambling here for a bit. I'll finish it when I'm done. 1. There's a lot to get through here, but the "read" portion of this book is terrible. The beginning of this section is great, but by the end of the book I was completely lost. I had trouble keeping track of everything I read. I don't know what happened to my friends because I can't remember them from my life before the book. I think I'll be writing down my questions on the back of the first page and then just skipping over everything I can find out about. 2. "The key to staying sober is to take action" is one of the worst advice I have ever heard. This book talks about how you have to "act" or do something, and then gives you a list of things you can do to "make your life better". They suggest that you just "get a job", "have more sex", "get married", and that all of these things will help you stay sober. But they never actually tell you what they are. I tried to go to a job interview because I wanted to work and have more money to spend on drugs, and I asked the person interviewing me what she thought was going to help. She didn't know, but that's okay. I've done this. I found the answer, but it took

Good to see more about bazaar in the USA. _______  Great book on the history, culture, and economics of the book market in the US. _________  My friend and I enjoyed this book. We both like history, especially when it is related to our past. The writing is excellent. The author is very well informed about the topic and the history and culture of the market. ____  (review of free book)  The book is interesting and well written. The history is presented in a way that is easy to follow. The book is a useful read. **********  It's a great book. The story is a little boring but if you are interested in the history it is well worth the read. I enjoyed the stories that were told and I am looking forward to reading the next one. ******************  (reviewed 2 days after purchase) : The author's introduction was a bit off. It should have said something about the market and the bazaar as a whole. I understand that this book is about the Bazaar in San Francisco, but it is better in the way the author presents the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Lasted: 1 year  I love the idea of having a character who just wanted to get out of the city. I love that the character wanted to be in the city to begin with but couldn't because of her father. The problem is, the author makes the character want to leave so much that she never really gets to actually be in a city.   My problem with this book is that it starts out with the character having the idea to move to the city and then never actually doing so. The main character wants to get into the city because of the fame that would bring and the good life it would bring. I didn't realize how badly the author wanted to have the character move and wanted the author to make it clear the whole time that she really wanted to move out of her home and into the big city. It's so obvious to me that the author is making this character move in order to make the story a more exciting one and that's it. She just wants to move. The only problem with that is the character doesn't actually have a job to take her out of town so it's really frustrating to me.   for this reason I think I will only read this book once or twice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very nice book, but the ending was not. The characters were nice and interesting, but it just seemed like this was just the beginning. The book has a nice twist at the end, but I was left wanting more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a book about a young woman who decides to start her own religion. It's a lot of fun. It has a strong message. It is a good book. I loved it. But I feel it is missing a lot. It could have been a better book if the author had written it as a diary. It was really too short to make that a good idea. If it had been longer it could have really worked. But it just doesn't work that way. The best thing that could have happened would have been to write the story as a love story. The whole thing is about love and how love is not something that you can really have in a day. It doesn't make any sense. It just doesn the best to let it work in the way that it does.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not live up to the hype. I bought it in order to have a copy to give to friends who loved this book so much. They loved it but they weren't happy about what happened to the main character. I don't understand the "good guy" who is the protagonist and was the reason the book went on. The main character doesn't feel like a real person. I'm not sure why she didn't kill herself (or anyone else) instead of being a bad person and letting it be known that she is a "bad person". I don.t understand how she was able to stay sane while killing a person. The "good guys" don't get their due. I just don't see the logic in any of the "bad" actions. It's a shame because this was one of my favorite books of the year.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I really hated this book. I can't believe I went through it all. It was a waste of time."   I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I have been wanting to read a Harry Potter book for awhile. I've been looking at the book on Goodreads and I thought I would give it a shot. After reading all the reviews about how it was a terrible book I didn't want to buy it but I did so I guess I won't read any more Harry Potter books. The only thing I liked about it was the cover and I'm sure a lot of people like it too. The bad part was the author. He was terrible. He should have gone back to school and learned how to spell. I think he just didn't have a clue what he was doing.   The characters were like paper dolls. Harry Potter was written like a book he would read. They were all a little too perfect.   I didn not know if it was because I had read the book already but I really did not enjoy the characters at all. I know they are all fictional characters but they all seemed to have one or two flaws and I really hated them. I really don't like the idea of a world in which all the people are perfect, like a fantasy world.   is the worst Harry Potter novel I have ever read. The world building was terrible and I felt I really had no idea what was going on. I found it extremely confusing. The story was so boring that I had to go through all the books to see what happened to each character. This book should have been called "Harry Potter has been turned into a book." It is a book I can understand.   in this book, he writes about his own childhood. He is just a child and he didn't know how to talk to adults. He doesn't like magic, he doesn't know about wizards, and he doesn�t like Quidditch. It's a very sad book. It makes you want to curl up in a ball and never look at Harry Potter again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book's about a very sad story about a woman who falls in love with a dead man who then dies.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to give this book a low rating because I don't really feel like the author has really given the reader a solid plot line or a believable world. The world is too much of a sandbox and the characters don't seem to be developing a sense of history or purpose other than what is convenient. This is a really interesting world but it is too simplistic and has too many loose ends that the author doesn't seem interested in tying up. I have always thought that the book was really well-written and I do think the world was good. However, it's a pretty disappointing book and I don�t think I'll ever pick up another book in this series. It was good but I can�t recommend it to anyone.   Review:   This is a very interesting world and I really like that the world is a lot more detailed and interesting than most fantasy worlds. There are a lot of things that make the world interesting. For one, there is a ton of history and lore. There is also a strong sense of the world in the background that makes it more interesting and realistic. This world is not a world that is entirely static but it has changed a lot. In particular, the world of Koth has undergone a major change in the last thousand years or so. This change seems to have happened due to the influence of a "giant" who has been attacking the world for the last few thousand years. The giant is also responsible for the death of the previous king and the downfall of the king of Keth. This giant is known as "The Elder" and is an extremely powerful creature. It is said that he is the first to be born in the world and that his body is almost three times the size of a man�s. The Elder has been killing off many people in the past and in the present. This seems to be a major reason for the massive change in Koth.   (view spoiler) It is also said that the Elder has an unnatural ability to see the future. I really think this is a good thing and I think it would be interesting if the Elder could communicate with the gods and could manipulate events that way. This idea would be great if the characters could actually do this. The way the story is set up makes it seem as though the characters are completely powerless. The people of Katholus are pretty much helpless against the Elder and can only hope to survive the next hundred years. There isn't really
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________  "The most boring book I have ever read." "It's as boring as it is predictable. It was written to teach students how to be obedient to authority, and the author doesn't have the balls to say what the hell the author thinks. The most boring and predictable book I've ever read. There is a lot of information in it, but not much of anything in it is useful. The author is teaching students to be stupid and submissive. The only thing this book has in common with my other books is the author's personality." "What I learned was that the author was a child molester." "This book teaches children how to comply with authority. There are very few lessons that can be learned from it. In fact, it's just a book for people who want to be submissive to authority.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent book. The characters are well drawn and the plot is engaging. However, it has many flaws and I found it frustrating that the authors only attempted to add depth to the characters when it would have made the story better. It's really disappointing to have to come to this conclusion after reading over a thousand pages and seeing the characters I was supposed to like the most grow and change. In the end, it was a disappointing and frustrating read, but it was still a good book. The story starts off promisingly enough. A young girl who goes to the same college as the protagonist is found dead and there is a mysterious black box at the crime scene. As the book progresses, we see a lot of potential and the reader is constantly on the edge of their seat. There is a feeling of mystery at play, which makes the book interesting to read. The first half of the book is mostly spent setting up the mystery and the suspense, but the second half is where things start to fall apart. There were a lot more character development in the second section, which was the part that made me realize how bad the story was. The character development was mostly limited to how the characters felt about each other and their life, and none of it made sense. The author had a very strong grasp on how a story should work, but she fell into a very similar trap to the one I've mentioned in my last review of The Last Unicorn. The author was trying to add a lot to her story, but there was no depth to her characters or the plot, and the writing was incredibly clunky and clumsy. It was as if she had written a book that she then decided to add some depth to by writing all of the events as if they were real life. I don't know if the story would have been any better if the author hadn't decided to put all of her characters through some extremely awkward and awkward conversations about religion, and all of that went over my head. I think it would also have been better to just skip the religion section altogether and just focus on the character development. It would have given the reader a much more satisfying and satisfying story if she just left that section out. One of the most frustrating parts of the story is the fact that the author never really explains why there was a box at her murder scene. The entire time I was reading, I kept getting the feeling that this box was there for some other reason, which made me very
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. A terrible book. It is poorly written, poorly researched and is filled with errors. The only way to get out of this book is to read the original book, and read it with an open mind. The book's main character is very much a sociopath and he acts all over the place. The main character seems to be very intelligent and very well read. I do not want to read about the sociopath again. This book will not make you happy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to take a couple of weeks off from reading the books that are now my favorites, as I didn't enjoy reading the ones that I had read before. But the books were very good.  This is a great book about the real-life stories of a group of men who fought in the Pacific theater during WWII.   The book is a bit hard to follow, but if you really like WW II history, it is a must read. 1.   The Man Who Would Be King: A Life of Abraham Lincoln by David McCullough A biography of Abraham "Lincoln the Younger" Lincoln by a famous historian, McCullough is an accomplished and well known author of books on American history.  His book is about the last days of the great American President, and about Lincoln's life and career.  McCullough provides the most complete and in-depth portrait of the President that is possible, and this is the reason that his biography is so popular and so well known.  2.   A Man for All Seasons by Thomas Hardy A beautiful, moving, and sometimes disturbing novel about the life of Henry Cavendish and his relationship with his family.  This book has it all: a love story, a tragic love story and a tragic death.  I love this book for the way that Hardy conveys his characters' emotions, and the way he makes the reader think about and ponder what the characters are feeling.  Also, Hardy's prose is a pleasure to read, and his use of symbolism and the human mind are quite beautiful. 3.    The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper I first read this novel when I was in the seventh grade.  As a child, I had been exposed to this classic story of a young Mohawk boy, Sacagawea, who helped the colonists to take over the New World.  In the years since I have always loved this book.  It's a great story, and it's a classic in its own right.  The characters are compelling, and they are well developed.  What really makes this book, however, is the way Cooper tells his story.  One of the most interesting and original things about this book is that it is set during the American Revolution, which is a fascinating story in itself.  Cooper's writing is so vivid and realistic that it captures the feel of the time.  And, if you are a history fan
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********I was very excited about this book. It was the first of a trilogy, and I'm happy to say that I think it's a fantastic read, and one that is not only interesting, but thought-provoking as well. It is one of those books that, like most of what I have read, I was excited for, but then disappointed in. It's a book that, as a fan of fantasy, I would have loved to see in a bookshop, but, like many fantasy novels I've read, it's not for me. The characters are all very interesting, the world is interesting, and there are a lot of scenes that are enjoyable to read, but for me, the writing is just not as good as it could have been. The plot is very interesting and the ending is pretty cool, but the writing itself is not the strongest point of the book. I think that's just a personal preference, and is not because the book is bad. The writing is good enough to keep the reader engaged, but I'm not sure that it's enough to pull me through the pages of a book, if I'm a fan. The world building is fantastic, but it's just not enough to hold me over until the last two chapters. I just don't think the writing was enough to make me want to keep reading the whole book. Overall, it was a great read and a good addition to the fantasy genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was ok, but the plot is ridiculous. I don't know what happened to the characters after they met the witch. I'm just not feeling it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really did not like this book. I don't like fantasy. I like historical novels. This book was just a load of boring crap. It was boring to read because it had so many plot holes that I can't believe the author had the nerve to write this. The author had no clue how to make a story interesting. I found myself constantly wanting to know what happened next, and then the author would stop writing and start asking me "What happened to that character?". What the hell was this story about? And this book is really long. I got to the end of it and thought I had just wasted my money, and the author should be ashamed of himself for writing a book like this. This book had no redeeming quality to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is terrible, the entire time I was reading it.  The premise is that a woman is a prostitute and she falls in love with a man. I have nothing against this, I actually think the main character is a very strong female lead. I was completely unaware of the other books she has been involved with or the events that have happened since. It just doesn't add anything to the story, or really make sense. The first two pages were just boring. The book is told from her point of view but there are no other POV's and nothing is revealed. It's just a long monologue with the first few chapters being about how she is so broken that she is falling for this guy, and how much she loves him, and she feels so ashamed for doing this to herself. The next few chapters have her talking about all of her horrible experiences in the past, and then it goes into the next paragraph about the whole thing and how he is so wonderful. There are a lot of times that I just stopped reading. It is just so confusing, it just isn't good. I really hope this is the last of the books she writes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was ok, but there were some bad plot holes, plot inconsistencies, and some questionable writing. The character of the main character was very uninteresting, especially for a book with a supernatural theme. This is the kind of book where the main characters are a few characters. That doesn't make a good book, but it's not bad either. I have read the first four books in the series, and I must say that this book is better than the previous four. I will say that some of the characters are still kind of irritating, and there are some plot holes here and there, but overall this book was a much better book than the other four books. 8/10 It's an epic fantasy book that deals with a world where there is no magic, and where the gods of the gods are very different from humans. The main character, a young girl named Serenity, is very young, but is a powerful magician and has the ability to bend the world around her to her will. However, her abilities are very unstable and dangerous, and she can only control one thing at a time. The book revolves around the two most powerful and dangerous characters in the book: the Demon, who is very powerful and wants to control the world, and Serenite, who doesn't like Demon's control over her world. The plot of the book involves Serenitia trying to get back to the world where her ancestors lived, and then getting her friends to help her. It's not a perfect book, and it's a little slow at times, but I really enjoyed it. 6.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I didn't give this book a zero is that it was good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book. I was expecting a lot from it and was a little disappointed. It was good when it was done, but not good as a whole. I think the story of the book is a bit too complicated and boring. It's almost like the author wants to make a point. I mean, it does, but it's hard to get into. The story was very much focused on the mother and daughter relationship. I thought it was good that it was so hard to believe that the mother was in love with the daughter. I'm not sure how much the reader should believe that. I also felt like the mother had some secrets that were hard to understand. I don't know why the book kept going into these weird areas, but I found it a little distracting. I guess I'm a little too used to reading that kind of thing. I'd like to have seen a bit more of the world and how the two relate. I found the character writing was a bit rough around the edges, but still decent. I liked how the story progressed, but the ending was not what I wanted. I just wish the book had ended more on a good note.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have read this book several times, and I always feel that I have something new to learn, but that I keep getting sucked in, and reading the book, and finding out nothing new or useful.   If you are going to read this, at least put it on a shelf somewhere so you won't get sucked in. I have now read this and watched the movie about a dozen times, so I have a much better idea of how the movie goes, and what's actually happening.  , and if you are reading this, you should at least take the time to check out the book. It has been out for a long time and is still good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad but it is very badly written. The author writes about a woman in a foreign country who has been given a new car by the government. This car is very old, has a bad engine, and has to be replaced every 3 months. The woman's husband dies and she feels like she is losing her identity. She does not want to leave the country because she does not like it. She gets a job at a large company but she finds that the men at work are not interested in her or she is the only woman at work. This story is just like that of the other female characters in this book. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was enjoyable and I am looking forward to reading the next one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like this book. I don't know why it's called "The Big Sleep". There are two or three characters who appear, they're just there, the rest of the story is told by an unnamed narrator. And there's only one scene.  The only scene that's not a flashback or flashback-like.  There are no characters I can relate to or relate to them enough to like them.  There's a woman who seems like she could be a good person, but is a bad person.  Her story, which takes place over a long period of time, is really hard to relate to.  She is a really good writer, but the author did not seem to care about the story and the characters and just wanted to put in all the details about the main character, who is not a very good writer.  I didn't like the ending.  The characters just kept running off and leaving the good guys behind, it was really not believable.  But then again, it wasn't the main plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had so much potential. The story was intriguing and the character development was fantastic. It was also very well written.  The plot is very exciting, it just could have been better. The writing style of this book was very stiff.   I'm sure I'll read more of his work in the future but this was a really lackluster novel and I would have rather just read The Dark Forest or The Uninvited. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is terrible. There are no character development or development in the plot. The characters are flat and the plot is lame.

It was a critical and commercial success." - The Wall Street Journal "When she was asked about the film she responded, 'I don't know anything about it. I can't imagine it being as exciting as it seems to be.' She also said, 'No, I don't want to be a princess.'" - People magazine "Princess Diana was not a Princess. She was a human being. A human being with a mind, feelings and feelings. A person who is worthy of love." - Queen Elizabeth II "Diana was a bit of a princess but not in the way the media has described." - People Magazine "It's all a big lie. People should just go to the movies and see how beautiful they are." - Diana on TV "That's just not true." - BBC News. I am very disappointed in this book. I bought this book hoping to read a fantasy story that would not involve dragons or orcs. I was expecting a fantasy with elves and wizards. I expected a book that was good. I got something very different. This book is not a fantasy. This is a book about a human princess and her people that is set in a world that is a little too medieval for me. I don the book a few times and find it hard to understand the characters. I know that I am reading a children's book but the world in this is a bit medieval. I feel like the author is trying to write a book set in modern times but the author doesn't know how to write. I understand that there are some people that don't like fantasy. They think that fantasy is about

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________   The thing I hate about this book is that it was poorly written and not well researched. I found this book to be a complete piece of garbage that should have never been published.   I found this to be the book that I was looking for to prove that I'm wrong about the'magic bullet' theory that can get anyone out of a depression and get them back into the game. It just wasn't that good and I'll never buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________   This book is a joke.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I love this book. I read this book at night and on the train, in the shower, with a book in my hand. I like the characters, I like their story. But I'm not a huge fan of the plot. I was surprised how little the book actually is about the main characters, and how much of the book is about a bunch of other people that the main character has a crush on.   to me, this book reads like a bunch other stories that I've read in a book club, but the author's trying to make it more serious than it actually is. And the author tries to make this book more about the plot and the character development than it really is.   "A book is not a movie, but a story about the events of a life" -Ralph Waldo Emerson   The story is told in three different chapters. The first one is about four year old E.S. and her mother, a woman who's a lot like your average mother: kind, caring, but also a little crazy. The second chapter is about her cousin, who is only eight years old and has a hard life. He has to take care of his older sister because she's sick and is constantly in and out of the hospital. The third chapter is of a girl named Lucy who is the last of her family and is very, very sick. She's the most sickly and is always sick. And I love Lucy.   The author makes a few mistakes with her characters, especially Lucy. She tells the story in a way that it sounds like the story is about two families, Lucy's and E.R.'s. In fact, Lucy has no family. She lives in a foster home. E.r. has a father that lives in an old house with a lot of dogs. Ers parents are kind and loving, but they have a hard time taking care of him because he is very sick and can't do a lot. They try to help him, but it's very hard to do, especially because his parents don't understand the way his life works and don't know what to do for him. It is made very clear to us how much trouble E.Rs parents have taking care off their own son. E is only four and the author is trying to show us the hardship E.rs parents
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book before Christmas and I really enjoyed it. The story was interesting and the characters were interesting. However, this book did not live up to my expectations. It is a bit of a disappointment to me because I really liked the book and I was looking forward to reading it again. I read it on a Kindle. This is a paperback, which I will not read again, and the cover is pretty good, but the writing is poor and the plot is not good at all. This book was really only good because I like the book, not because I think it is a good book. I did not like the characters or the plot and the ending was lame and the book was not exciting. I am disappointed and will not be re-reading this book again. I really want to love this book because it is so good, it's like a really good novel. I have no idea why I would have liked this book if it was a terrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed reading this book but I am so sorry it was not a better book.  The story is good but the writing is just bad.  This book is one of those that you are going to love it or hate it.  It is just that I am going to say to myself "How can it be that this book is so bad but I loved the story".  I know I am just being picky but I do not understand why it is so hard to write good writing.  For example I have read other books by the same author and they are all good books.  I really liked this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I read this book because I wanted to read a good book. This book was not good. I am a huge fan of a lot of the science fiction books that were made during the 1960's, and I was very excited to read this. I loved the story and the way it was told. But the writing was terrible. The dialogue was very poor, and there were times when it just made me feel sick to my stomach. I would have given this book a 1 star if I could have. It was a huge disappointment to me.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ When I got this book, I was expecting some kind of paranormal mystery novel. I've read about a half dozen of those lately, and the main difference is the "weirdness" in the story. Well, that's exactly what I got. The first couple of chapters, I thought the story was pretty interesting. I could tell it was a thriller, which I have seen many times before. Then the story went into some pretty boring territory and I gave up on the whole thing. I found it hard to get invested in the characters and the mystery, so I decided not to continue reading. I don't know if the author is trying to make a point, but I just found it to be a boring, poorly written story. I guess you could say I had a hard time getting into it. But I guess that's what I like to read. If you want something a little more serious, I would suggest reading some of the books by Stephen King, which is what inspired me to read this one. I just don't think that this one is going to appeal to a wide audience. I'll be back to it eventually, but probably not with this story in mind. (Posted on 1/23/2014)  The book is interesting and very intriguing. I enjoyed the story and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. (posted on 11/18/2013) . I bought the book on Amazon and am very excited to read it. It's been a while since I read a good book so this is a nice change. It was very well written. I thought it was interesting and thought-provoking. I liked the book and will be picking up the next one. It should be interesting. (November 2013)  is interesting. It is a well written thriller. The book is not very interesting or original but is well written and suspenseful. (October 2013)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit of a let down. There are a lot of problems with it, but the main one is that it's the second book by a writer that I'm not fond of. I don't know if I've mentioned this, but there are times when I feel that I've read a good book and I'm now stuck with the bad ones, and this is one of them. But I'm going to stick with it until I find out if there's a good one that I haven't read. I would recommend this book to people who are fans of horror stories that aren't in the horror genre, but not to fans of classic horror or people that love this type of stories. I'll probably read a sequel because it's just so darn fun to read and the characters are so interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to get this book, but the book sucked. I was expecting something with a more serious plot and plot twists, but I got boring plot and boring twists. The writing was awful, and the story was just boring. I guess I am not that interested in a book about two sisters that have to find a way to escape the evil wizard.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________  A few years ago, I read "Tomboy." I thought it was pretty good and then I bought the Kindle version, but I never really liked the book. I don't think it's a bad novel, but the whole premise and characters just don't seem to make much sense to me.  I also read the other three books in the series before this one, and they all seem to be very well written. I'm sure "TOMBOY" is a decent book, but my main issue with it is the premise, which seems so off that I was almost expecting to be hit by a truck in the middle of a road.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is a horrible person. The main character has no motivation to change. The author didn't really care about her and it made me really upset. I have had a bad experience with a lot of authors, but this was one of the worst experiences. I wanted to hate her so bad. I read this book in a few days and I was so angry with the book that I almost threw it away. I can't read a book that is just a waste of time. If you want to read a horrible book, this is your book. 12.5/10 "My first day at work, I was on the phone to the manager and the lady at the counter, asking if they could make a special sandwich for me. I was nervous because I was getting into my first real job in a while, but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. I had been working there for a year and I didn;t have to worry about anything. When I arrived at the deli counter, I asked the cashier if he could put the turkey in the sandwich. He said no, that it was too big, so I took the sandwich and asked him to cut it up into smaller pieces. When he came back, I told him I needed to make a small sandwich and that it wasn't big enough, and he said he wouldn't make it. I went over to the other cashier and told her what happened. She looked at me like I was crazy and said that she wouldn't cut it into small pieces because she couldn't fit the turkey. Then she said that the turkey was a special order and that she wasn't supposed to make it bigger, but she could make it small. I felt so frustrated, so upset. This book was very well written. I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you like a good, bad, funny book, you should try this book. I will probably be reading it over and over again until I finish it." -Anonymous
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ ______________________.  5 Stars:  Good Read   Overall Rating: _____________________ _______________________   My wife gave this book a lot of good reviews and I must say, she was right. I really enjoyed this book and I have no idea why I didn't give it a five star rating until now. It's a very interesting read and very well written. It doesn't take itself too seriously and has the typical humor that many fantasy books have. This is one of those books I would recommend to all fantasy fans and to those who want a good read. I highly recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book, and I can't put it down. I'm not a huge fan of the main character, but this book has a lot of heart, and is a very funny book. The story is well written, and the characters are great, but the main problem I had was the ending. The book is over so quickly, it feels like the author didn't think it would work, but then it does. The final scene makes it seem like he's not going to finish the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The main character was so weak, he was so pathetic, that it was very hard to get behind him. I couldn't understand why the author felt it necessary to do this in a book about a young girl trying to find her way in the world. I could barely stomach it."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very poor book and I'm glad I didn't buy it. I got it because I wanted to read about the Civil War. I wanted the war to be the main event of the book, not something that was glossed over. Instead, the book is about the women of the Union and the women who fought for the Confederacy. It's not a bad thing, but it isn't what I was expecting. It didn't have the "feel" of the books I've read. I just didn't feel the emotion that I did with the books about the war.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I bought this book expecting it to be good. I have been waiting for a good horror book since I was a child. I was pleasantly surprised by this book, but unfortunately, it fell apart in the end. I'm really bummed out about this because the ending was great, and it had so much promise. The writing was great. The story was great! The story wasn't really scary or gory, but it was just enough. I would've given this book five stars if it was more of a horror book, because it was good. But it wasn't. I think that the ending of this book was a big problem. I feel like there was a point when I thought that this book would be a masterpiece, but instead it ended up being a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so frustrating to read. It was hard to get through, and then the ending was just so unsatisfying. It seemed like the author wanted to go somewhere, but wasn't sure where to go. I am going to be going back and reading this book. I hope the author does some more work on her characters and doesn't just tell a story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a fan of this book. I felt like it was a waste of time, and I did not like the characters. They felt like they were too nice for the situation.  I had no issues with the plot itself, but there was no emotional connection to the characters or their circumstances. It's all about the politics and the intrigue.  The book had a pretty long section about the history of the Drow, which was interesting but did not really add anything to the book. Rating: 1/5 This review is for the print edition of the book, which is hard to find. If you can find it, it's worth it, because it's really good. I can't speak much to the Kindle edition though, so it's just a 3 star. I would like to see the author's next book, because I really like the world and characters, but I'm not interested in reading a novel that is about politics and intrigue.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- The author's a complete and total ass, and I feel the need to say this. The whole book is about how women are just as flawed and imperfect as men, but only when it comes to romance. So, when she talks about how it's "hard to get women to like you," and then the author has a female character in a relationship with a man who is constantly complaining about women, that's "women being too hard to like." That's the entire book about how men have a hard time getting women to love them. You know, because women are human, and are not perfect like men are. The author also talks about why men like women, and they're just like men, just with different personalities, and it's like a total excuse for women to not like men. It's not even about men like other men. That's like saying men like skinny women, because a lot of people like skinny people, and a lot people prefer skinny people to fat people. It isn't about men wanting to be women, or men wanting women to be men. Women don't need to be "perfect" to be liked, they just need to like people who are similar to them, like themselves. I don't want to be friends with anyone who is like me, or like someone I admire. It sounds like this author doesn't know how to write a person.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so confused about what this book is trying to do. This is a very nice book, but I was very confused about the point of it, and that made it very frustrating to read. I don't understand why this book has a theme of a girl who was raised in a cult and then is "liberated" by her friends, and the group's leader. The book is so long that I can't follow everything in it, but the group and its leader were all I had to go on. I would have been much more interested if it had more of a theme that this group is a cult, and a girl can't be saved from it, even if she wants to. I feel like the author tried to make this about "rescuing" the girls from the cult, but they weren't actually rescued, they were simply rescued from the group. I really wanted to understand what happened to this girl, but all she does is go back to the cult and they "rescue" her. The author said the cult's leader said that she is "good", but I don a lot of that in my life. I think that the only reason that the author is trying so hard to make the group likeable is because the author loves the group, and is just trying to write a book to win a contest. It is very disappointing, and not worth the price of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of historical fiction in general but I found this book extremely boring. I did not really care about anything happening and the author made it very clear that she was going for a different kind of fantasy. I read the first book before I read this one and I found it to be very dull and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a very good reason: I love the characters and the story and the ending is perfect, but the book is just awful. I really enjoyed the first book, but I think I've read it a few times and I can't bring myself to re-read it. This is just a bad story with a horrible ending and a boring protagonist. It's also very long (over 200 pages), so I guess it's worth reading. But I would advise anyone who enjoys good fantasy to give this one a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very good at first, but as I progressed through it I started to dislike the characters. I really liked the idea of a man with a wife, but I found that the author wanted to put in a lot of unnecessary sexual tension between them and the reader.  4 out of 5 stars I am so glad to find this book at my local library. I've read a lot about this and thought it would be good, but my wife didn't enjoy it. It's not that the characters aren't interesting, it's just that the book didn't interest her at all. It did, however, interest my brother. So, this is definitely a good book, but not the best. I have some questions, however. It seems that the man is in his early 50's when the story takes place, and he's been married and divorced several times. He's a big guy, but he seems to be the type that can be ignored if he doesn't have any serious issues to deal with. Then, there is the fact that the husband has a mistress and a son who is in the Navy. I guess that could be a problem, but it's not really explained. It is possible that he's having an affair with his mistress and her son is a big influence on him, but why is he so fixated on his son? And what about his wife? The wife seems to love the son, and it would make sense if she had been able to help him with his relationship with his father, but if so why didn't he tell her about the affair? 4 stars out of 4 stars This is a book I really enjoy reading. I think that it is a good blend of psychology, philosophy and theology. It does deal with a number of moral issues, but there is always a reason for things and people's behavior. It has some interesting stories, some of which have been touched on here and there, and the ending is a nice touch. The only thing I would change would be that the character development wasn't as strong as it could have been. The author does have some good points to make about human nature and the world, but at times it's difficult to take everything to heart. This is probably a good read for the mature reader, but a bit hard to read for a child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had me feeling sad about the human race for some time after I finished it.  It was very depressing and there was a lot of negative talk about what a waste of time human life is and why we don't have anything better to do than to waste it on useless things like porn.    I have been reading for about 10 years and have never felt this sad before.  There is a little plot to the story that is entertaining and I wish I could like it more, but it didn't seem as strong as the main plot.    I feel bad for the author.  I think his story has a lot more potential, but I wish it would have been fleshed out better and more strongly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - This book is about the first war and all the war-related stories. In the middle of it you have a guy who is a little bit of a jerk and who is not really interested in being a soldier, and that is a big problem because the main theme is about being a real soldier, not a big-ass dick. I didn't like this book at all. It was a great read though. -

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ It is a good book. It has its flaws but the flaws are very small and if you can get past those you get a great read. It is very good, if not better than most books of its genre. I am a big fan of the Dresden Files series. I would recommend this book to those who like the Dresden series and people who are looking for a book to get into the Dresden world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was boring, the pacing was bad, and the ending sucked.  It was a book that was trying to make a point.  That point being that a story can be made by showing how people respond to their environment and how their actions affect the world around them.  It was trying hard to make the point that it is not how we feel about the characters or the world, but how we react to the world.  I don't know if that's true or not.  There is a point of view and that's what made this story interesting.  The fact that the author is a woman makes me think that the point she is trying to bring about is not necessarily about female empowerment.  But, I didn't care enough about the female characters to care about the point they were trying to get across. 3 of 5 stars I'm sorry that I did not love this book. I like my fantasy books with action and characters that fight. I do not like fantasy books that are boring or forgettable. I didn a lot of things about this book but one thing I cannot forgive is the author's grammar. The author made an excuse to not proofread the manuscript before it was submitted to the publishers.  She was too busy working to get the manuscript ready to send to publishers.  And, she did not proof read it at all.   The book had a lot to it and a lot more words than what was written in the manuscript.  I could not believe that the editor missed that one little word that should have been proofread.  When the manuscript was ready for the publisher, the editor and the publisher had a discussion.  The publisher said he would proofread it but the editor was still not happy with it.  So, he had a big fight with the author about the manuscript and she told him he could not have the manuscript until he proofread his manuscript. He said he had no intention of publishing a book if it didn't have proofread pages.  She was like 'if you don't want to publish a book, then you can't have a book'.  And, the publisher said, 'fine then, I'm going to publish it anyway and I'll get the proofreader and I will get my proofreader'.  And, the proofreaders and the editor never bothered to look at the manuscript again.  It's a shame that the book was published because it wasn't good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say that I loved this book. I thought it was a good book, but I just can't get past the fact that the writing is so awful that the reader has to struggle to even remember the characters names, let alone remember anything about the story.  The characters just come off as so bland, so shallow, so stupid, so likeable, that I found it difficult to get excited about the book.  I'm not really sure why I didn't get the book, I thought the premise was cool but I don't think it was well done, I didn?t care about the characters enough to care about their problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I am very sorry to have to write this review but I was extremely disappointed by this book. I read it as a prequel to the movie and although I enjoyed the movie it was never my favorite of the series. I would not recommend this book to someone who has not read the book first. I was expecting more of the same as it was a prelude to the film. The character of Kari is the one I hated the most and I never liked her character from the movie as well. I do not know how she was changed but she was really boring. She was always talking about how she wanted to be a model and her whole story was about how bad she wanted it. I really disliked how she started the story with a guy telling her what to do. She just ignored him and said she was going to get it on and go for it. That was the first thing I disliked about her. The other characters also were boring. I did not like the guy, he was too much like a child. The girl was just there to make things go better for Kari. The guy in the book was the same. He was always there to support Kari and do whatever he could to get her attention. The story itself is great, it was very well written and the actors were fantastic. The music was just amazing and the story was very enjoyable. There were no bad things about the book but I did hate Kari the most out of all of them.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was so incredibly long (300 pages, almost double the length of the average "filler" novel), I wanted to see what happens next and I got so annoyed I threw it away. I had the good fortune to read this in one sitting (I am a fast reader). I did not get a single character development, the plot was so poorly written I found it hard to believe they could have made this so much worse. It was boring and I was so fed up I threw this book away. If I have a complaint, it is that the ending is unsatisfying. I really wanted more and I can't figure out what happened next.   I'm going to have to find a book that doesn't take so long to finish, because I have too much time to waste on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book after seeing the review about how the author is a plagiarist, but I don't think that makes this a bad read, since there were a few things I didn't get or didn't understand. I'm a fan of the author, and I like the way he writes in the third person, but a lot of the things I don,t understand he just made up, so the story just kind of slipped away from me, I'm glad I found this book though, and will be re-reading it in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I am a huge fan of fantasy and I loved the book, but the characters were really annoying. I liked the premise, but some of the characters did not feel real to me. The main character, The Dark Lord, had a huge ego, and he was the only good guy in the book. He did not seem to be aware of the fact that he was a villain, and it just felt like he wanted to be more powerful than the others. I felt that he would have made a great character if he was more aware of what he was doing. The rest of the evil characters were all just kind of boring. And there were a lot of annoying little side characters. The only good characters were the ones who were fighting against the Dark Lord. All of the main characters were just not believable. I did not like the book at all. I wish that they would have stuck with the first book. I don't think that this is a good book for kids or adults. I am giving it a 4 because I would have given it a 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say that this book was not what I expected. It has the feel of a young adult novel (at least it did to me).

There are some very dark and disturbing things that happened in this book, and I think that's the only reason that I can give it a negative rating. I found it very hard to read, and there were some times that I felt like it was going to be a long time before I finished it. I just didn't get what was going on with the story, or what was happening with all the different characters.   The characters were really shallow and almost made no sense at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** (This is an excerpt from my review of "Inventing the Future" by the late John F. Kennedy.) The book is a classic, and deserves to be read by everyone who is interested in the future. As with any classic, there is something to be said for the author's vision and the style he uses to express it. I like how he manages to express the ideas of the future as they were presented in the book without going over the top and getting boring. However, I have to say that he has a way of going over his own head. In my opinion, the idea of having a "citizenry" that can be controlled by an elite is a terrible idea. In fact, it is far better to have a nation of citizens that has an understanding of their own rights and liberties. We need to have an informed citizenry that will be able to take charge of our own future. He also goes on at length about the "military industrial complex" and the dangers that this poses. This is a subject that needs to be addressed in order to take control of our future, but the way that he presents this is very flawed. I can see how he might be right in the fact that a military industrial complex is dangerous, but I cannot see how this can be used to control people. This makes his book extremely flawed and confusing. (I would say that I still like the ideas in the story, but that the way he presents them makes it more difficult to follow.) The final chapter of the book is the one that really made me want to get my money back. I found that his thoughts about the government were so powerful that I could not put the book down. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is trying to make sense of the present.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of romance. It's been a long time since I've read a bad one. I read this one.  The main characters, the author, the publisher, and the editor of the bookstore. _________________________________________ There is a moment in the book where the author's first name is spelled wrong, and I think that's really a shame.    It's really difficult to read because the author is clearly just a person who can't spell.  The book starts off with a prologue where we learn that the author had a difficult pregnancy, and she went through a miscarriage.  But she survived and gave birth to a baby boy.  When the baby was born, the father was very abusive.  In the prologue, the baby is seen as a kind of angel.  However, it turns out the father is an alcoholic, and his abusive behavior toward the mother causes her to take a knife and stab herself.  She is in a state of shock, and it is not clear if she is alive or dead at this point.  The book does not reveal who the father of the child is, but it is obvious that the man is not the father.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there is a woman living in this house.  This woman is a doctor who was in the hospital and became separated from her husband.  Apparently she is the father's child, and he is very abusive to her.  It seems the reason that the husband is abusive to the woman is because he doesn't want her to have the baby, and so she is not allowed to see it.  So we follow the woman, who is named "Marilyn", and her baby boy, "Ricky".  The first half of the book is very graphic, and has lots of sex, drug use, and a lot more violence.  I did enjoy the sex scenes, but the violence is not necessary to be read, and was just over the top.  There are a lot, a lot, of drugs in the first half.  Although the story is not a story about a man and a woman getting together, there are some scenes in the second half of this book that are about a woman and her daughter being raped by the father and his girlfriend.  One of the most disturbing scenes in this book is when the father goes into the bedroom where the mother and daughter are sleeping and rapes them.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time and money and is a complete waste of my time and time of everyone else in my family. It's also a complete disappointment and a waste my time. If you don't like the first two books in the series, you'll like this book. I don't know why, but I bought this book thinking I'd get something new from this series and instead I got another of the same old same old. I read a review somewhere that said it was the first book that they all loved, but the others were worse than this one. Well, that's not true, I like this one, but it's nothing special. I guess I should've read a more in depth review on the first books in this series, because they all suck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it did not end up being one of the worst books I have ever read.  This book was extremely boring, and it did NOT make me want to read the next book in the series, nor did it make me excited to read more about the characters.    I felt so un-enthused that I ended up skipping through the whole thing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great mystery with a good story to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poorly written book that suffers from poor writing and a lack of any real world relevance. The author's goal of a "fantasy" world is an impossible task. He has no idea what makes a fantasy world interesting or unique, nor what kind of magic or story is needed to create one. It's a good read though, with a fun story and a few characters that I'll remember.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "My brother got this book on the plane ride from Australia to New York. He was upset with me for not liking it and he got very angry and yelled at me. I told him he should have gone to a bookstore and bought it there and not in a convenience store."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am an aspiring author who really enjoyed reading this book. The story is great and I really like the premise. However, the book was boring and I found the pacing slow and repetitive. I think that the author should try a different approach to storytelling and story telling. The ending of the book felt really unsatisfying. This book was just a waste of time and I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not pleased with this book. The prose is really hard to get into and I am left with no feelings about it. I think this book was really written to promote the book and not to actually read it. The story is so poorly told and it's hard to believe any of the characters actually exist. The book had me wanting to flip the pages over and over again but I just couldn't because I didn't really care about any of them. This book was a waste of my time and I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________  This book was a very bad idea. I bought it for my husband and he enjoyed it. However, it took me 2 weeks to get through it. I am a very busy woman and this book did not allow me to read. It took me a week to finish it. The book had nothing good to say about the book, it was very confusing and confusing. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  If you think a book is a terrible piece of work that no one would ever want to read, it is. If you think it's a good book that everyone should read, you are dead wrong.   If I was an expert in anything, I would tell my children never to read books that are not written by professional authors.  , but, it's okay. I read them anyway, and I'm still reading them. I love them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's just not my cup of tea. So I was reading this book on Amazon because I wanted to support my local bookstore. This book was very good, and I enjoyed reading it a lot. I was also very intrigued by the fact that this book was written by an alien (a humanoid, at least in appearance). But the way the author presented the information about our world was not very good. The author made references to other planets and civilizations that were not that far away from our own, but the way he presented the fact about aliens on Earth was rather confusing. The book was also quite long, so the reader will have to take his/her time to read it. But in the end, I enjoyed the book quite a lot, and it was very easy to understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is an excellent novel. But, it is not a great novel. I found the ending to be predictable, which I found disappointing, but it is also too predictable. There is nothing wrong with the ending, but there are too many details and events that do not make much sense. There are several major changes to the story that I thought were unnecessary, but I think the author is trying to say that this is the beginning of a new life for the characters. This is all well and good, but a bit confusing. I have read reviews that say that the ending is ambiguous, and that this may be a spoiler, so I'll just say that I think there is still a great deal of mystery to be solved.   So, the story follows a woman named Lisa who is going through a divorce and looking for a job. Her sister, who is in her 50s, is also trying to find a job, and Lisa finds herself drawn to the job of a housekeeper at a house owned by a retired couple. But when Lisa starts to feel guilty about the job, she becomes a suspect in a murder, which her brother is now accused of. It turns out that the murder is the work of an old friend of Lisa's, and the murder seems to have been carried out with Lisa's knowledge.   in this case, there are several people that seem to have a part to play. There seems to be some sort of connection between Lisa and the woman who is the murder victim, and we are also shown a little bit of Lisa and her husband's history, including a marriage that ended in divorce, and an argument between the two of them. There's a bit of mystery as to what the murder actually was, and what the motive may be.  The plot is well paced and there are plenty of twists and turns, and I liked the way the author uses flashbacks to show us a bit about the history of the two characters. I also liked the fact that she used flashbacks to reveal details about the past, but this was done with a very slow and deliberate pace, so it was easy to forget what the flashbacks were about.   the story is very interesting, and there is a lot to read about. But this book isn't really one of my favorites. I don't feel that the author's writing is up to par with the best novels out there. There were a couple of places where the story took a turn for the worse, but the overall story
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping for a good book and instead received a book that was very boring and not at all entertaining.  The story was very unoriginal, the characters were poorly developed and there was no sense of the mystery to the plot.  The book had a great plotline with a great mystery but I just couldn't get invested in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very bad book. I would recommend against reading it, and I can't understand why it was made into a movie. The book is about a child with mental illness, who is sent to a mental institution. The characters are poorly written, and the story is poorly written.   1. The story is not very well written. It starts out with a very strange child who has been abused, but is treated better at the hospital than at home. It is only later that we learn that he is severely mentally ill, and he has been misdiagnosed in the past as a schizophrenic. The writer is a very good writer, and this child is clearly a very interesting character, but this story is too strange and convoluted to make sense. The author's style is very inconsistent. It reads like he wrote the story in one day, and then just threw it together as he went along. It's very strange to read.     2. The way the author handles the children in the story: The children are abused. The children suffer from severe mental illness. The mother is abusive. There is a great deal of violence in the book.  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was a complete disaster. The entire plot revolves around a man who is a fan of the book he read and he gets so much enjoyment out of the characters that he wants to see them again, so he writes a story about them, and the whole book is a bunch of fanservice scenes and nothing else. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the plot is ridiculous and just a waste of time. It's just a bad read. I'm going to give it one star because I'm a big fan of The Dresden Files.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about this book. The book starts out in the same way every good sci-fi story begins: with the arrival of the first alien probe. A few years after that first encounter, we meet a few of the people involved in the original event, and find out that there are still more alien probes out there. This is all very interesting, but there's one problem: the alien probes just don't come any more. This book is about a group of scientists who work for the US government, who are trying to figure out how to stop the alien probe from reaching the Earth, so they can be destroyed. This sounds like a really interesting premise. But as the book goes on, I kept waiting for a big twist that would let me know that the aliens weren't as dead as they thought. Instead, we end up with a bunch of scientists doing their best to figure things out. I'm not a huge fan of this style of sci-fiction. I just don`t get the excitement. It's just a bunch more science and technology talk. Maybe if this book was about an alien invasion, it might have worked. But, the book ends up feeling a lot like another boring, scientific, science fiction story. I have no idea what happened, or why this was the end result. It seems like a lot of work was put into this, but nothing is really explained. So, I'm going to give this book a 3 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I am very disappointed in this book. I wanted to like it. I did read a lot of books on this topic before I read this one. I also bought it as a gift for a friend. The thing is, I was expecting something with a lot more research and a lot better writing. I got the impression that this was written by a layperson who has just started studying Chinese. I think that would be a great idea for a Chinese college text book but it was a very poor one. The first half is boring, not because of the words but because of a lack of any interesting information. It was just a bunch of sentences from some of the textbooks. I don't know why I spent so much money on this book, I really didn't want to spend it on a book that had so little to offer. If you have never studied Chinese, then I recommend this one, but if you do have some Chinese knowledge, then you would probably be better off to read something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's really bad.  No offense to the author.    I loved the plot, but it is just a poor attempt at a paranormal novel that is just about as interesting as the title suggests. _______________________________________________________________ I'm a sucker for a good "why the hell didn't I think of that?" story. ________________________ This book was an amazing adventure! _______________________________ I bought this book as a gift for my son's sixth birthday, but I was unable to wait and got it in the mail just as he got his birthday present!  This is the first book in a series (for now).  I loved the story and the characters.  If you love stories about people who are super cool and just happen to be really stupid, then this book is for you.   I had no idea how much I wanted to read this book until I started it!    I think I can look forward to the next book in the series!  The plot is fun, but the characters were a let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I read this book and I just wanted to tell all the reviewers what a piece of garbage it is. The story is just so stupid, it's just so bad. I was so upset that it's not a book that will appeal to anyone, the characters are stupid, the story is stupid, I don't understand why someone would read this for a laugh. I think you should just throw it out, the authors should just get rid of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a terrible book. It was so bad I almost gave it a 0, but my boyfriend and I kept reading and it turned out to be ok. But it is an old book and I didn't know about the sequel so it wasn't good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't. I love this book and have recommended it to people and have been told it is an amazing story. But I just can not get past the beginning. It is like someone put a very basic and confusing story into a story book and then had them all read the story and were given the answers before reading the story. So I know the story is complex and there are different characters but I can't get past this. It's a story of a young man, but the characters and story don't seem to be. There is a story in this book, but it is just so confusing and the way the characters are described are just so off. I am sorry, but I am giving this book 2 stars and not a 3.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A great story, but too many details are thrown in, and a lot of them seem like they were added just to make the book more "cool". It's like a book from a high school English class with no attention to grammar, or to how the story is told. The story is good, but it's definitely not my kind of thing, and I'd pass on it unless you're looking for a good urban fantasy story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________   "I have been looking for a book that will explain the concept of the 'unconscious' and have not found one that does a good job. The author's book is not very well written, and it is very difficult to follow. The book is full of the author's opinion, and if you follow it you will be a lost man. The only thing I found interesting is that I don't understand why so many people are convinced that they have a 'conscious' mind and that the conscious mind is just an illusion. I found the book very frustrating, and I was very upset that I wasted so much time with this book. I do not know if I will ever understand this theory, but I hope that the book has made you question your belief system.   ___________________________________________________  I was really hoping to find a book about the nature of the mind, and the unconscious, that would not be filled with opinions, and opinions are all well and good but it is hard to get a grasp on them.   the whole book is very hard to follow, the author makes lots of different points but not sure what he means and then in the end makes a bunch of conclusions that are so far from what the author intended to say, he just makes up his own mind and then tries to explain what he meant by it.  ... I could not find a good explanation about the 'conscious mind' which I have read in many books about this subject, I will not read any other books by this author...
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It was fun but I have seen the same story in a dozen other books." I don't remember the other books, but I do remember how fun the story was. This was fun, fun, Fun! I hope the author writes more stories in this style.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I loved the first few chapters of the book and I liked the author's passion for his subject. However, the plot is really poorly written and is more like an introduction than a story. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt that. I also found it hard to believe that the author could write such a boring book. He does have a nice voice, but it's very monotone. It's like a story he heard on the radio and he copied the story. There's a lot of bad language and I found it boring to listen to. The author does say a lot about science and he tries to give it some scientific credence, but he doesn't have much scientific credibility to back up his theories. I really think that this book was written to make money, and I think the author has a big heart. He has some really good ideas about the environment, but not a lot else.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________ I read this book and found it to be an amazing story and an amazing book! The story was amazing and I loved the characters and the way they were written. However, the writing is very confusing and not what I expected. I found the beginning confusing and I had to look up what was going on, so it took me a while to get the hang of what was happening. However the ending was just great! It was perfect. It made me cry and I could not put it down. I can't wait for the sequel! Thank you for writing a story like this!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem I had with this book is that the author doesn't know what he's doing with the narrative, and the narrative in this book was a complete mess.  For example, the author states that his main character is a wizard, but then suddenly the story switches to him being a wizard when he wants to make money, and he becomes a druid when he starts studying his spells.  This story also starts off with a very silly scene involving the main character, where he accidentally kills his pet bear, and it's like he's trying to say something important but fails at it.    The second half of the book has the main guy talking about how the wizard's spells are like an encyclopedia and you have to go through all the pages in order to learn about the magic, but the first half is just ridiculous, which is why I don't recommend this book.  I also thought the main hero had too many love interests.  One of them is the main heroine and her name is Anna.  She's a princess and she's a warrior.  Anna's a very annoying character, but her love interest, I felt, was just a generic love interest.  And then there's the main protagonist's friend, and her last name is…  And the last three characters that are introduced are not much more than side characters.  It seems like the author has never written a book before, but he has an easy style of writing that has a lot of words and very little grammar.  The book was also a little confusing, since he doesn't give you any explanation on what's going on and why he did certain things.  So it was difficult for me to understand what's happening in this world.  Overall, this is a book that I will not be reading again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ A lot of people seem to have a problem with this book, but I'm not one of them. This book is not so much a historical account as a psychological one. It is a "biographical account" of two men: the poet and the soldier, and of their love for each other. Both of them have a tragic life, but they are not so different that they are unredeemable; the war is the same, their feelings are not the same. I think the writer wanted to make a comparison between two great men, but his attempts are not as good as he would have liked.   The author writes the two men as if they were separate persons. This makes sense, since they are. He writes of them as if one was the lover of the other, and the other the soldier. But he also writes of the war as if it were the one constant, and that of course it was. He does not write of the two as individuals, but as if each was an "actor" in the war. I also read that the author wanted to write a romance about them, but that he did not get the chance to write it. I would like to see him try to write one about these two men.  :)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- There were times I really wanted to like this book. I had read it before and loved it. This time I had some reservations, but still really enjoyed the book. My favorite character was one that I knew nothing about, but it was easy to see how this character was being used by the author to add some comedy to the book: "A young girl named Lucy had never met anyone she didn't like, and that made her a little uncomfortable. Her favorite thing about being a schoolgirl was playing with other kids' toys. So she was glad when she found a magic book she could read." "She wasn't a witch, but she was very powerful and very scary. She'd used a little magic to put a lock on the door and then had put the key inside her own pocket. She was trying to figure out how to open it, and the lock clicked and rattled against the handle as she worked, but there was no way she could get it open." The author really did a good job creating the magic and mystery behind Lucy's character. There were some interesting and interesting characters, but unfortunately, the plot was rather weak. The author was a little too easy to fall for her characters and then when they were exposed as lies, she left them for dead. Some of the plots were so contrived and predictable. "Her father was a witch and her mother a werewolf." "The witch had been planning something for years, and her plan was to bring a friend from the outside world to visit them and help her destroy the witches." This is just one example. The plot was not the most interesting thing about the book, but the characters made up for it. The book was a good read, but at the end, I felt I could have done without some of the plot twists and turns. --------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I was given the book as a Christmas gift and have just finished it. It is an interesting read, but I can't really recommend it. There are no plot twists, no unexpected twists. I'm guessing that the author didn't really know what he was doing in writing the story. The characters have little depth, and the story itself is very simple. It would have been much better if he had spent a little more time in developing the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son was born in 2003 and he didn't read a book until he was in middle school. When he was 2 years old, I purchased him a book on his birthday, and it was a huge disappointment. The characters are so unrealistic, and the plot is ridiculous. He was very disappointed and did not read a single book until I brought him back this book. I have to say that I love it. I also highly recommend it to others.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ____________ _________ ___________  In the interest of full disclosure, I am a lifelong fan of The Twilight Saga, so I was a bit surprised when I first started this book. My initial read was a little underwhelming; it felt like it was missing a few steps and a lot of the characters were a little flat and a bit predictable, but I still thought it was a good read and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  This is not a good book. The book is terrible. I had a bad feeling about the book from the start and was completely disappointed in this book. It is not funny. It makes me think the writer is mentally unstable. I did not enjoy this book one bit. I will never purchase another book from this author again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ It was ok. It was an average book, nothing too special, and I did enjoy the plot. But it didn't have much in the way of characters or any development or excitement, which I found frustrating. It's just a typical "action/adventure" story. The characters were flat and uninteresting, and there was no suspense or danger. The ending sucked and left me a little confused, but overall it's just average. If you are looking for a good fantasy book with a unique plot and interesting characters, this is definitely not the one.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A book that I have not read, but have heard great things about.   It is a very well-written story about a family with very little money, and a very nice and caring mother who is always there for her children. They all have their own stories of abuse, and I do not know if the author knew about any of it, but she did not seem to. She also did not write any of the children into the story as if they were not real children, and made sure that none of the abuse happened to them. This is a good read if you are a little older and want to see how a family can cope with the poverty and other hardships that they face, but with a very happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very poorly written.  It is poorly written for two reasons: First, there is no plot.  I do not even know what a plot is.  The book is more of a story about an unknown person who is on a journey.  This makes it hard to understand.  Second, the characters are poorly developed.  There is no real story.  What we get is an interesting story of someone on a personal journey. But that is not why I hate this book.  As far as I can tell, the author does not like Harry Potter, and that is why he did not write a Harry Potter novel.  He made this book about his family.  We are told that he is very attached to them.  But that doesn't make any sense because his father has died and his mother is very sick.  And he has a daughter.  If that is the main reason for the book, why didn't he write a book about them?  I am going to give the book a 3 because it is a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ This book is a complete mess of a story and I had to put it down after about the first 100 pages. The author is a bit of a crackpot (I'm not saying that as a compliment), and even though he claims he has a PhD, I don't know how he got it. His stories are not well written at all. There are so many inconsistencies, the story is so unbelievable and convoluted, and it makes the book very hard to follow. I would not recommend this book at all, I would say that it is more of a bad comedy that is trying to pass itself off as a novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I can't stop reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I think this book is just terrible. I think it is a terrible book. It is written like an encyclopedia, but it is not a book, it is just a list of facts about animals, plants, etc. It contains nothing that can even be considered good science, and the facts are often wrong or outdated.   For example, there is a section about the history of the American Red Squirrel, and in that section there are pictures of squirrels, but the red squirrel is a gray squirrel that is not native to the US, but was introduced. Then there are a few pictures of red squirrels that were introduced into the US that were red and not gray, and there is also a picture of a squirrel that has red hair, but is not really a red squirrel.   I just could not understand how they came to this conclusion, because they had pictures of all the different red squirrel species in the US (there were several, but none were introduced in the states). I think they should have just included the pictures of the ones that were in the wild. Then again, if it wasn't for the fact that I am writing a review for a book that is about animals and not about a human being, then I might just give it a "meh" because I really don't care what the animal world thought of this book.   the fact is that I would never read anything written by a person who has not even looked at the actual biology of the animal they write about. If it is about a red rabbit, then a red red rabbit is not going to give me anything new, but if it is on a list about the "different" species of birds that live in a certain area, I am going to wonder if I am reading a list for some other species of bird that live on this planet.  . I don't think I have ever read anything so bad. I read a few books about animals in college, but they were books about the animal and not the person who wrote them. This book is full of bad science, bad information, and bad information about the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The author does a horrible job of writing a character. The woman is a horrible mother, she is a terrible mother to her children, and she is not even the most interesting part of the story. I don't think I have ever read anything with such a horrible main character, who I never cared about. The rest of the characters are really not much more than cardboard cut outs."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my nephew because I thought it would be interesting and good. He was extremely disappointed! He found the book to be very boring, very repetitive, and it had nothing to do with science. It was just a boring book and was not very interesting. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so intrigued by the story that I had to read it. It was fun. It wasn't too heavy. I like light books. I would recommend it to anyone.   In a nutshell:   "A man is killed and buried in a shallow grave in the woods near a lake. When he is discovered his life force is restored, he is given the name Kettle, and he becomes the new sheriff of the town. When the man, who's name is Lacy, comes back to life, he tells the townsfolk that he's been killed in a hunting accident, and that he has the ability to restore the lives of dead people. Lacy then has to find a way to convince the townspeople that he was murdered, and to prove it, he has to get Kettle and his friend to help him out. As Lacy's life force grows stronger he gets more and more jealous of Kettle's newfound powers and he begins to plot to kill Kettle. When Kettle gets the idea to become a supernatural investigator he decides to prove himself in a game of truth or dare. LACY has a very special ability that allows him to see ghosts and demons in the world and can communicate with them. It is up to Kettle to keep Lacy away from Lacy by trying to keep him from being possessed."   So I thought the plot was alright. It seemed like there was something really interesting happening in the background. There was a lot of plot in this book. It did start out slow, but it grew on me. It's very fast paced. The first time I finished this book I wasn't really interested. I was just kind of bored with it. I'm not a big mystery fan, and I've never really been that into paranormal stuff. This book, however, I really enjoyed. I don't really have any big gripes about the book. I think it's a good book for the paranormal fan.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished The Shadow at the Bottom of the World. It's a well written story, with some good characters, a good setting and the story is well done. But I was really disappointed in how the story ended. It wasn't a happy ending, which I like, but it was just too convenient for me. This book is rated 4.7 stars on Goodreads.com. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The last page of this book was so depressing that I couldn't bring myself to finish it.   The plot of this novel is a total bore and is not what I expected from this author.  The characters are poorly written and are not real at all.  I had to stop reading after about half way through this book.  In a way, I felt like the author had been given a lot of free time and time to write a novel about a group of people who all have mental issues and all have a dark past in which they all suffer from the same diseases.  And I suppose that this is what he wanted to do because he ended the novel on a cliffhanger. I was expecting a much better book because I know he is a very talented writer and this is not a good start to his novel.  Rating:  2.5 Stars for the plot. 1.5 for the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I got this book, I thought it was a good read but I did not enjoy it. The story was a bit predictable but that is not really the point of the book. The plot is not interesting at all. There were a few times when I wanted to laugh but I had to force myself not to because I did so. Also I felt the author's opinion was a little out of touch with the average person's opinion on the internet. I do not think I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book, read it in about 2-3 days, then threw it in the trash because it was a terrible book. It was written by a young woman who was just going through a bad time in her life, so I suppose she thought she could have fun with the subject. She didn't realize that a lot of people have problems with this subject, and she didn't know how to write about it. She's a very intelligent person, and I believe she tried to be honest about what she was going through, but she got so caught up in the story and the plot that she forgot about the fact that her characters were human beings. The story is just so rushed and rushed out that it is hard to keep up. The characters just aren't believable and they are flat and boring, and there is a lot more action than there is plot. I was also disappointed that she didn´t go into a lot about what makes her sick. I think that's what made the book so disappointing. I had so much fun with it, but it really isn't anything I would recommend, and for that I give it only a two star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I have not read a book this bad in a long time, maybe ever. I'm so disgusted with this book that I feel like I could vomit if I read it again. First of all, the whole "they're really dead" plot point. This is a bad idea from the start, and the whole book is based on this plot point, as if this were the first book in a series. The main characters are just as uninspired as the book itself. And the "love triangle" just gets annoying after a while. I mean, this is supposed to be a book about a love triangle between a vampire, a werewolf, and a vampire. The only thing I found interesting about this story was that it is about a vampire and a werecat, which is pretty weird. I really wish that they had just made that a part of the plot instead of using it as a plot point in this book. Then there's the whole thing about vampires that "can turn into werewolves." This is just another stupid concept that the author came up with. I know the concept is cool, but this is just ridiculous. And there's also the fact that it's supposed to all be a metaphor for how vampires need to be more accepting and accepting of each other. I guess this is all supposed to work in the end, but in the process it just makes the entire thing ridiculous. If there's one thing I've learned from reading this book, it's that the best ideas are the ones that don't work. It was pretty clear to me after I finished this book as to why this book was a flop. I'll probably still read the sequel because it sounds like it's still got a lot of potential, but I can't recommend this book to anyone. It's just not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************   This book is horrible. I would give it 1 star but then again 1 star is just not enough. The story is about a group of people trying to save a village from a band of evil goblins and then it just goes downhill from there. The book is poorly written. It's so poorly written that I almost had a heart attack when I started to read the book. The characters are also poorly written, not only the main character but also the main antagonist and a couple of the other characters.   The main character, "C.K." is one of the worst I have ever read about. His character is so shallow and so much of a clichéd character that I could barely take any interest in his life or any of the plot because of how boring he was. I'm going to start with the good stuff because I want to talk about it: he's a young man who is a wizard. He's a very powerful wizard and one of a few wizards who have ever lived. One of his spells, called the "Wand of the Heavens," allows him to summon a large amount of energy from the heavens to use for his own purposes. However, C.K. is so much more than that. He is so rich and powerful that his wealth and power make him practically untouchable. He can call upon the stars and planets to do his bidding. He has even created his own kingdom which is ruled by him and his son. One thing that was a bit funny was that he had to be on the top of the list of people to invite to a "humble" dinner and then be invited to a dinner of kings.   I can't really say much about C.J. because he is such a generic, unlikable character. There are other characters in the book, but they are not as likable as C.C. They are not even that memorable. The worst thing is that I was actually rooting for him to win at the end because he was the only person in the entire book that wasn't a complete jerk. He didn't even have a redeeming quality. It wasn't until the end of the book that I felt bad for him because he had really messed up his entire life. It just makes me angry to see a book that has a good main character that is basically a cardboard cut out that is just a glorified cardboard cutout.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I read this book in one day because my friend recommended it. I loved the story but was disappointed by the end. It was just a bit too long for me to finish. It had a lot of plot holes that weren't explained and I felt cheated.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so eager to get to this book and I was so disappointed, it took forever to get started, I can't wait for the sequel.  What is it with these books and the author's and the publishers' tendency to keep writing the same thing over and over again?  They are so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only negative review I can think of is "Bad book" because that is how I feel about this book. I do not feel bad for having wasted my money.  I have spent almost three hundred dollars on this book over the past few months and have never been more disappointed in a book.  This book is a collection of short stories about a group of people living in a small, rural town.  It was a little slow at times but that is due to my attention being focused elsewhere.   These stories are about the people that are living their lives in a world where their very existence is a source of misery.  The stories are funny but at times really depressing and a little disturbing.  This book is not a good read for anyone under 12.  For the more mature readers, this may be a little hard to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always been a fan of the genre. I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, but I was a bit worried when the first trilogy got the remake treatment. I'm happy that The Force Awakens got the reboot treatment, but it just didn't do it for me.   It's hard to get into a book if you're expecting a Star Wars film. This book does have the original trilogy elements, but at times it feels like it's trying too hard to be Star Wars. The first half of the book is a series of flashbacks, but there's really nothing interesting happening. Then there's a big battle that feels like a rehash of The Battle of Hoth, and that's where the book really starts to lose me. It's hard not to be a fanboy, but the story doesn't really take off.   the characters are flat, and the story itself is predictable: a princess, a dark knight, a warlord, and a droid with an eye patch. I don't know why they kept going on about the robot with the eye patch and the princess when I know it's just going to get tiresome.   at least the novel does have a few cool moments: The princess fights a lightsaber with her mouth, and her battle droid does not have a helmet. The droid's name is BB-8, and he's adorable.   This is a solid, fun read. I just wish it would have taken off a bit more.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- "A great read but the last 50 pages were not as good as the first 50." (3/5) This book is good and I'm looking forward to the next installment. I just wish it were longer. I also wish it wasn't as boring as the rest of the series.  My Rating: 5/5 stars  Posted by: Michael (Bellingham, WA) on 06/26/2014  This is the most entertaining series of books I've ever read. I was hooked by the first book, The House of Shadow and Bone. I had never read a book where the characters were so compelling and the world so well described. I've since read all of the books and they continue to keep me reading. My only complaint is that they were released in a hardcover rather than in paperback.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a bad and poorly written book.   This is a great book about the life of the great scientist Nikola Tesla, who was one of the most brilliant men of the 19th century.

I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in the life and accomplishments of this great scientist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a review about this book and found it so very frustrating. The author has written a very good book, it has a great story, great characters and is one of the best books I have read in a long time. However, this review was a complete disappointment to me. The first paragraph states: "The main character's parents died in a car crash in his teenage years. The boy was adopted by his father's family. A year later, he is a grown man and the only person in his family who still remembers the death of his parents. This is a tragedy and I feel for him. The book is about a father and son who are trying to survive and figure out what they want to do with their lives. I found this to be a very interesting and well written story."  This is the very first paragraph of the review and it really has nothing to do, to me, with the story. A person who has lost his father, an older man who he barely knew, and the child of a murdered father is struggling with trying to figure out how to live his life? The book ends when the father is dead, so there is no hope, no happiness, no possibility of anything. This paragraph, in my opinion, really doesn't belong in this book. The review ends with a recommendation to buy the book for the characters, so he can go to his father. I find it ironic that the reviewer has read a book about two people trying to make their lives as they go along, but has decided to write a review of this book based on a few paragraphs? He clearly didn't read the book and he didn't understand the character he had reviewed.  Another example of this reviewer who just doesn't read: "I also felt a little sorry for the father because the boy's mother died, his own mother died and he still has to raise his son. I also felt sorry for him because he was so desperate to make something out of his life, but he had lost everything. The best part about this story is that it is about growing up and making your own choices." I don't know what his problem is with the father, but I do know what I like about this father. He is a very loving, kind, caring, strong, intelligent and thoughtful man. He has an idea for what he wants to do in life, and he will not be denied. His son is not allowed to say a word because he will have
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I loved this book. It was the first time I had read about a person that has a problem with his own body. I'm always on the lookout for books that have a positive, and at the same time informative perspective on the issue of body dysmorphia. I can't really think of anything that comes close to this book, as it's an honest look at someone who has a strong sense of self-loathing, and how it affects his ability to function and live a normal life. It's a great read, and it's something that you'll be able to relate to.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ I would say that this book should be called: __________________________________________ I would be grateful for an e-book version of this book. The quality of this work is good, but the writing is sloppy and unorganized. I do not understand why the author thinks the author's book is a collection of short stories. It is more of a novel than a collection. It has many different plots and characters and it's a very long book. I am not sure if it will be a good book for me. I will just try to learn from it and read other books by her. If it's good enough for her then I will definitely buy it! (reviewed 8/28/2010)  Recommended for students of literature, not for readers. (reviewed 7/26/2010 )  Novelist rating: 3.5 stars out of 5  Overall rating: Not Recommended for readers of this title: No (reviewed 3/14/2010, 1 comment)  on Goodreads   I just finished this book and it really disappointed me.   The writing style was  I have not read any of the books by L. Sprague de Camp, but it is not hard to imagine a similar book, but with a different ending.  . The story was about a man who has an affair with his brother's wife. The man is so jealous that he wants to commit suicide. He is given a choice: If he commits suicide, his brother will marry his widow. But if he doesn't commit suicide, the wife will not marry him. I didn't like this book very much. I felt like I was reading about the same character that I have read before. The writing was very clunky and confusing, as if the author just wanted to tell his story. The way that the author described things was not helpful to me either. I don't understand how anyone would read the book and think that they would enjoy it.   I was expecting a better book from a book review site such as Goodreads. But I guess that's what happens when you try to review something that is not written by you and a reviewer doesn't like it. It's hard to know what to say about a book that doesn't even come close to the way you imagine it should be. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in literature, but not interested in reading a book from this author.  …

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book had a lot of potential, but it just got a lot more confusing. This is not a very good book, but I will be reading a sequel. The ending is just not satisfying to me. I wish there was more to this story. ***********   Review: The plot was intriguing, as it seemed to take place in two places at once, with one side of the story taking place in a fantasy world with dragons, wizards and dragons. I had heard about the author, and thought that I would like what I heard about her book. Unfortunately, this was a bad decision, as the story is extremely confusing and I was left feeling like I just got sucked into a poorly written fantasy story, which is not very appealing. The characters were also very poorly written, with some characters acting very badly and some characters just being flat. The plot is very unclear as well.   As for the ending, I think that the author wanted to make a very emotional, very complex ending, but she unfortunately made it very confusing. I'm a huge fan of complex endings, and I'm sure that this ending is extremely difficult to get through. This book should have ended with a nice happy ending.   at least the book was a bit better than the one that was in the movie (which was a very bad movie).
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ This book has no point. It has nothing to do with the original game, it's not a sequel, and the characters are nothing like the original.   It's not the story that's the problem. I really wanted to like this book, but the writing style just felt off to me. I'm pretty good at wordplay, but it just didn't work for me here. The characters sounded so wooden and lifeless. The dialog sounded so forced. The writing felt so forced, so fake. I was trying so hard to like the characters, but I just couldn't.  . The story follows a group of people who are trying to make a name for themselves in a world that hates all of them. They are called the Order of the Broken Sky. They come from all over the world and all over time and all have something to prove. They live in this secret bunker in the middle of nowhere, the Order's bunker, and they have this code word they can use to communicate:   "The Order is forever, never forget that."   And, well, I did. It's one of the best books I've ever read, and one of my favorite series ever, The Dresden Files. It is a fantastic series that just needs a great story told by a fantastic writer to live up to the hype. I couldn't really help but love this book because it has some of the greatest quotes in the world. This book is great because it's about something else entirely. It doesn't focus on the Dresden Files as a whole, it focuses on a group that needs to prove themselves in the face of a horrible world.  , I loved the Dresden books. They were amazing, they were original, they had a sense of humor, they kept you hooked throughout. The only problem I had with them was the writing. They just sounded so terrible. I would often find myself thinking, "why can't I just like this series better?" but I couldn the books, I read them and I loved them. This new Dresden book doesn't do that. It just doesn't work. I just didn in. The dialogue was forced and unnatural, the writing was awkward and awkward. It was just too much of a let down for me. If you've been a fan of the Dresden series, you know what I'm talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********I was really hoping this book would be about the importance of having the courage to stand up for your beliefs. Instead it is about the consequences of a woman trying to stand her ground. It was a sad read because this was supposed to be a story about the empowerment of a young girl to stand by her beliefs even when it is not the easiest to do. But instead it was just another example of how weak the story is because it was not believable. It is not believable because she is not strong enough to stand on her own two feet without help. This book is not about a young woman being a victim. I have read other books about how the only person she could stand up to was her father. It makes it very difficult to see the woman as a victim in this case. Instead the only thing that was wrong with her was that she had a father that she could not stand up and tell him what she really thought. I feel like she was just trying to have a conversation and it turned into a rant against her father because he was not doing the right thing. I thought the ending was very sad and I am not sure why she was so sure she would win. I could have done without the ending. I know that it is an old book but I think this is one of those books where you would have a different view if you read it first. There were parts that I didn't agree with but I did not care enough to write a review. I just wanted to get back to the start. I would not recommend this book to someone that is looking for a story of a strong young woman standing up for herself against her parents. It did not happen.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book. The story is very slow, and the character development is minimal. The protagonist, L.O., is a very boring and uninspired character, and I couldn't relate to her or her life at all. I also felt that the author is trying too hard to portray a young woman as a good person. The author really tries to give us a "good" story and a "happy ending" but it's really not there. I'm not sure if I liked the characters, or if they were just not well-developed. But I will admit, the story is a great concept for a book, and it's a shame that the story turned out to be so uninteresting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really loved this book. It's not a very good book at all, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I did, it was a really good read. I loved the way the story was told, the characters were well developed, and the worldbuilding was really interesting. The author did an excellent job of making the reader care about what is going on in this world. I think it would be worth reading just for that. I would recommend this to any fan of fantasy or science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author does a poor job at presenting the concept of the relationship between man and woman, and the various problems of the situation. The book is full of clichés, and it does not follow through with any of the ideas it presents. It is a "filler" with little substance, but I think the main problem is that the author's message is so weak.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It's about a boy who has lost his parents to a car accident and his only sister to cancer, and when the book starts the brother has just had his first girlfriend (who also died) and is still struggling with the death of his sister. It is also about a group of friends who go to a summer camp together and the relationship between them, and how the two are related. The book is told from the perspective of one of these friends and from that perspective, it is pretty awful. The story is so horrible that you want the characters to die so that you don't have to read another word. And that's what happens. I was just waiting for the last sentence to end so that I could stop reading, but the last page kept going and going and I just kept going back to it. I kept reading it because it had some good parts, but I didn't even finish it. There are so many problems with this book that I cannot explain in a review, but you should probably try it and see for yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was absolutely awful. It's about a teenager who's living with his family in their new house. He's the only one not in the house when a neighbor, a very sick woman, comes into their yard and demands to see his son. They go to the neighbor's house and he's very drunk. They all go back to the boy's house, and he just lies down and goes to sleep. The next day his family goes to his house, the man has a huge erection, and tells the boy that if he goes to the hospital that his wife will come with him, and then has sex with him. He also demands that the boy watch the man having sex with the boy. That was very disturbing.  It was written very poorly, it was terrible. I was so disappointed in this book, and I just want my money back!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book, and was happy that I could get the first one in the series (it was out of print at the time I read it), but I found it to be lacking in the plot department, and the characters didn't seem very believable.   This book had some of the worst writing I've ever read, which made it a real drag. It felt like there was a story in the back of the book, but the writer never seemed to get to it. The writing was awful. The characters were not realistic, and it seemed that there was no point in trying to develop the characters. They were basically cardboard cut outs. The world that they inhabit was pretty lame.   the main plot of this book was interesting but the author did not do much with it. She didn't really show how she got to her point. It was also unclear why her son was so obsessed with the books.  , and that's just one of the many problems.The book's main theme is about how there is no such thing as good or evil. Everyone is a piece of shit, and they all have a story to tell, and no one cares about anyone but themselves. The only one that seems to be able to be sympathetic is the character of her son. He had a hard time with the events that happened in the story, and is very depressed about it, but he's not a monster, he's just sad. This is a typical YA book plot. I was so excited to get a new book, thinking I would get a fresh story. But the author just kept making me feel like I was being taken for a ride.I also had a problem with the way she was writing the characters, since I don't know if it's her fault, or if I'm just bad at picking up on characters' emotional states. The main character is really flat, and she seems to have little emotion, and even the things that she does are pretty boring. She has a very boring and unemotional father, and a boring and unlikable mother. The whole book seemed like a chore to me. The ending was just so stupid, but it was so hard to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- -------------- A terrible book. There are no redeeming qualities to the story or the writing, it's just a bad story and a bad read. The characters were all cardboard cutouts, no personality, just a lot of plot. The ending is also not satisfying, I don't feel like it was really worth reading or that there was anything at all to be gained by reading it. This book is just too generic and too bad, it really is a waste of my time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not really a fan of the first half of this book. The book itself was a bit boring, but the introduction to the world and the main character was a nice twist. But after the main characters' backstory was explained, it seemed as if they got dragged into a story that didn't have much of a beginning or middle. The plot was too convoluted to make any sense. The ending was also a bit confusing, since the author said in an interview that the ending was supposed to be different but couldn't figure out how. I think this is just because I haven't finished the book yet, so I can't say if the author did it right or not. The author's bio says she has written books on the subject of "psychological trauma and recovery", but I'm not sure what she has done about that. I didn't see anything in this book that would help a person recover from traumatic experience. She also seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from books on "paranormal and supernatural phenomena" and has made her book into a book of supernatural stories, but this book seems more about "paranoia" and "parasitic spirits" than any paranormal phenomenon. One of the most frustrating aspects of this novel was that, at the beginning, there was a "twist" at the end that made it look like the author was going to give us a better ending. But in the end, it still didn't make sense, and that made the book even worse. Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is a good example of how not to do a science fiction novel. I had high hopes for this book, since I really like space opera, but it's a really boring read. The author doesn't have a good grasp of the science involved, and the way that the space travel is described and explained is not even close to what actually happens in the book. The character motivations are a mess as well, and there's no way to understand what is going on with the main character. The characters are mostly bland and one dimensional. I can understand that some people don't like space, but I think the author did a poor job of making this one interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book about a person who thinks she is a demon, but it's not a good read. It's an extremely long book and the writing is very slow. I did find myself going back and reading the second half because I had so much to think about. I just don't know if it's supposed to be a paranormal novel or a book about how humans are the demon. It seems to be the exact opposite of that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I mean, really terrible. It was a complete waste of my time. The main character was a really boring, obnoxious, arrogant, arrogant asshole who would do anything to be the best, and the story itself was just too bad to even read. I'm sure it will be a hit on the book club, but I'm not going to be able to keep myself from buying the next book in the series, which is about how bad he is. He's already so bad that he's a little scary.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ The book is not as good as I expected. It is boring and does not cover much interesting information. It also is very hard to read. The ending is confusing and does take the reader out of the book a bit.   I liked the book and I think I could have been a better reader than I was. I have found that many of my reviews tend to be positive, but I will say that this one is probably the most negative one I have written, and that is not a good sign.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just can't stand these books. I don't even care if the author writes good books. The writing is all over the place and the characters are either boring or unlikable. I didn't enjoy reading this book at all. I've already read the first four, and I was so excited to read this last one. I hate the whole premise. I can't believe the author thought this would be a good idea. It was such a waste of my time. I think it was supposed to be a one off. It is just so terrible. I would never want to read another book from her.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive thing I can say about this book is that I found the author's description for the character that is the protagonist to be accurate.  The description is so accurate that I didn't even feel like I was reading the book.  I am so glad that I did, because the book is so bad that I can't say anything positive about it.  If I were going to give this book a zero I would probably give it a five.  It's just so bad.  So bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book has nothing to do with the book. The only thing I disliked about it was the characters. They were bland, like all the others I've read. --------------- The only reason I kept reading this book was because of how well written it was. The author did a great job creating a world that you want to live in, that you would love to be in. I have always wanted to live on an alien world, and I think this book would be my perfect way to make it happen. -------------- I love sci-fi. I don't know what it is about these books, but I find it very easy to read. I love the stories, the characters, the action, the plot, and the writing is easy to follow. The books are very well written and I've only read one of them so far. I'm interested in how this book will end and I hope that the author can make this into a series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many good books by different authors, but none have been so wrong on so many levels as this book.   I had read the first three books by this author before he decided to write this one. It is not as bad as the first, and a bit more believable, but not by much.   is not just a book about a young girl with no memory. The story is told through her point of view. The way it is told is in a first person narrative, but she is narrating from her perspective. There is nothing wrong with that, but it does make the writing feel a little stilted and forced. The prose is so incredibly dull that the author could not even write an effective paragraph. I have no idea what the author is trying to say, or why, because he just doesn't have the gift of a good story to tell.   The main characters of the book are: A young woman, Sarah, and her friend, Lisa. Sarah is a 17 year old who has been told that she has a condition that causes her to have no memory of anything she has seen or done. She also does not remember much about her life as a kid. Lisa is a teenager who has had no memory for over 10 years. Sarah and Lisa are supposed to be a couple, but are in fact completely different people. Sarah was told she has no memory because her parents are not married. Lisa was told her memory had been wiped, but that the memory itself had been erased by a doctor. When they go on a trip, they are told it is not the time for them to be together. They spend the trip in each others' houses, and the only way they can have a meaningful interaction is by doing things like taking baths, and eating meals together. But the two girls end up breaking up because of the time they spend together, and they end up going to live in different cities, and Lisa ends up becoming an alcoholic. The author never gives a good reason why these two girls are so different, and there is nothing about the characters that makes you like them. They are just too dull to care about. They end up not only fighting each other but also the entire world around them.   in a way, the ending is a happy ending, but the way the author does it is wrong. He takes a happy couple, who have just broken up, and creates a world where they are meant to be one again. In this
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an exercise in futility.  It has been made into a film by the producers of the TV series "24".  The book, on the other hand, has been a great success and it is a great example of a classic work of fiction that has been rendered obsolete by the technological advances of the 20th century.  I'm sure this book was a best seller back in the day, but I don't remember it being so popular back then, so I'm guessing this book didn't sell as well as I remembered.  I think the only reason it got any popularity is because it's a really good read and was a popular book in the late 1970s.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   This is an interesting and well-written book on the effects of exposure to violent video games on children. However, it is an unbalanced and biased book. For example, the authors discuss the negative effects of violent video game exposure on aggressive behavior but fail to mention that there is no empirical evidence that violent video gaming causes aggressive behavior. In fact, it seems to be the opposite. In a review of the literature on video game violence, psychologist Robert Cialdini found that aggressive video game use increases aggressive behavior in children. So, why do the authors ignore that important information? It is quite ironic that the book cites the work of Robert C. Cialdi.   The authors of this book also make a few statements that are questionable. For instance, they state that the studies on violent videogame use "do not seem to show a causal link between violent video-game play and later aggressive behavior." However, there are a few studies that do show a link between increased video game play and increased aggression. For this reason, I cannot say that this is a convincing argument. The authors also claim that "it is well established that exposure to media violence increases aggressive behaviors." However the studies reviewed by Cialdis indicate that there are several variables which may be related to increased aggressive behavior including age, gender, race, family structure, and the type of media being used. For these reasons, I do not believe that it is possible to conclude that exposure is responsible for aggressive behavior by children.   the book is well researched and is well-structured. However the book does not provide a complete explanation of the factors that may be involved in the causation of violent behavior. The book could have benefited from a more systematic approach to examine the factors involved in violent behavior and the effects video games may have on them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I can think of is that it's not the book it claims to be, the plot and characters are just plain bad, and the characters are not developed at all.  But still it was very enjoyable and made me laugh quite a lot.  "I don't think you're a little girl." My only issue with this book was that the author just didn't seem to know where the story was going.  This story was pretty confusing to me, as I really don't know what happens next.  I don't remember much about this book.  But I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a good book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is terrible. The whole thing is just a lot of nonsense. There is no real story, no real point to the whole thing, it just is all a lot to read, and that is really what this book is all about, reading. The characters are so annoying, I have to put them in quotes. They are such complete idiots, and the story has no purpose, just to get through this thing and then to forget about it, the characters are just so annoying. I have a feeling this book was written in a weekend and then thrown out. I just wish I could get my money back for the price I paid for it, I would rather buy a good book from Amazon for the same price.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have to say that this book is a horrible read. The story is completely nonsensical and makes no sense at all. I had to keep going back to get a clear picture of what was happening and who was doing what. Even with the explanation of what is going on it still leaves me confused. The characters are also very confusing and don't add anything to the story. The writing is very hard to understand. There are times where I was just completely lost in the book. I ended up going back and reading the synopsis of the book over and over just to make sure I had the whole story. So many things are wrong with this book and it should not have been released. I am so disappointed and have already given up on the whole series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book because I have been interested in philosophy for a long time and it was one of my favorites. I was really hoping to like it. The only thing that disappointed me was that they have a very short life span and that it is only a little over 600 pages long. I wish that they would have had more chapters on other philosophical theories, or even on other fields of philosophy, and less on the main topic (life and death). Also, I wish they would've written the book in the third person and given some background on the characters, like how they got where they are today. This book is good if you're a philosopher and it's not about the death or afterlife, it's about something you would do when you die.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I'm not even sure what to say about this book. It was a waste of time and money. It's basically a compilation of bad writing by some of the most unprofessional authors on the planet. I would give it 1 star but for the last 2 stories it was really disappointing. They were all so bad. The last one was a total waste of my time. It made me want to throw the book out of the window. I really wanted to read a good book and to learn more about the world. This book was a joke. I will never be going to any of these book signings anymore. This was just a waste.  I will be sure to avoid any more from this author.  to make it clear: This book is not a bad one, just a bad read.   *Story - 3/5  The story itself is not bad, but it's not great either. The main character was annoying as well as the fact that it was written in a third person perspective. I just didn't get a good sense of the setting. The only thing I liked was that it had a happy ending, and the characters were all good.   in short: the story is just okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was not at all impressed with this book. The book's premise is interesting, but not well executed. The author's claim to fame is a very famous "hippy diet" (which is nothing more than a diet of "fruits and vegetables" with a high percentage of protein, and a low percentage of calories). In fact, the book is not about diet but rather a very detailed and thought-provoking history of the diet that has inspired the book. It would be nice if the author would have been able to show more of the history of this famous diet, and how it has been misrepresented and misused. As it is, the author is more interested in getting people to think that eating fruits and vegetables is the best thing they could do for their health, than in providing factual information about the diet itself. That said, this is not a bad read at all, but I'm disappointed that it is not better. I give it a B-."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very dull book.  The author tries to make a political point by doing the "tough guy" thing, but his tone of voice and the way he says things just don't work.  So he does this, he takes the guy to an airport to be interrogated.  Then he takes a bus to the border to take a picture of the guy.  He's just being so aggressive and the tone of the book just makes you not want to read it, it's so annoying.  The guy is a real dickhead.   He is just an asshole.  It's like he was trying to get you to hate him.  In fact, I'm pretty sure he was just trying to be an asshole so he could get a picture.  This book was so boring.  I was like, "what the fuck?"     I had to go back to my library and get another copy of this book just to have something to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   The book was really good at one point. However, it was the ending that made me think it had gone downhill from the beginning. It was almost a slap in the face to me that I couldn't figure out what was going on. It really just made me wonder what is going on in the book, and it made me sad. The end was really weird and confusing.   I would definitely give this book 5 stars. I really liked it, and I know it could have been a little better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I was so excited about this book that I was a little nervous at the beginning. I've read other reviews that were more negative, but I have to say that I liked the story quite a bit. I didn't like how I felt about the ending. I was expecting a happy ending, but it was sad. I felt like there was a good amount of character development, but that was overshadowed by the ending, which was a bit anticlimactic.   If you enjoy suspense, then this is a good book to pick up. It had some good twists, but was overall kind of confusing. I would definitely read it again, but not the next time I read a book by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I didn't like this book at all. It was the same story of how a family member dies and then a young girl moves in with the family. The mother has a hard time dealing with the situation but the father gets all the blame. I liked the story of a woman trying to make her life work in a house with her two children. The problem is the story is boring. I couldn't get into it. I don't think the author would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had a huge flaw in it, it's not the plot or the characters, it was the writing style of the author. He made me feel very stupid and he didn't even explain what he was doing.  He did say that he's not a story teller, but this book had the exact same plot like the Harry Potter series, only the book didn't give the readers anything to do, it didn't explain anything, the characters had the same problem, they had to fight the same battles that they always have to fight, it wasn't interesting at all.  a book for kids, I'd give it a 6 or 7.  I will give this book a 4 because of the fun but it could be a 5 or even a 7 if the author would write better and give a more entertaining story.  is it really that bad? no.  the book is funny and the author made a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It was a good read and it was worth the time but the ending sucked. There are only 3 characters, a girl, a boy and an old man. The boy has a really annoying habit of talking like a girl and it is really annoying because you have to hear him talking like that every chapter. I'm a boy but when I hear a boy I think "whoa." The girl is a complete douche, she is too perfect, she talks in the past tense, she can't say she loves anyone but herself and she never apologizes for her faults. The old man is really dull, he is a man with a family and he just tells the story with no thought to what he is saying. I have no interest in reading a book about three characters in a city. This book is like a movie made by an annoying teen. I wouldn't recommend this book. I just don't care. I did enjoy the last scene though. I'm not a fan of books that have a main character in the middle of a book.  The last three books in the series have been about this guy who is the middle man.  A lot of this book was me thinking "who is this guy?"   I had a good time reading this book, but I would not read this book again.

It was a great concept for a novel, but it just wasn't executed well enough to justify the cost.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read, but I'm glad I read it.  I was really hoping for more out of this book.  This is a good book for people who are into horror, as the story is told in the first person.  It is a dark book but there are a lot of twists and turns, so you'll probably be confused at some point, especially if you are into the zombie genre.  The book also contains some sexy scenes, so if you like sex you should probably read this.  I think this book is a little too short to really understand the story, but there is enough to make you want to read the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard great things about this book. It was my first time reading a book by a young author and I was excited to give it a try.   However, it turned out to be a very bad book. I found the story to be quite confusing, and the characters to be very uninteresting. I did not care for the main character. She was a very bland and forgettable heroine.   The writing was poor. I have a hard time following any of the characters' thoughts.   and the ending was a complete waste of time. I felt as if I was watching the author run his mouth without making any meaningful decisions.  .  My rating is 3 stars.  , January 12, 2009
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I had the misfortune to have this book read to me by a fellow graduate student at the University of Toronto. He read it on the train back from the U of T library, and I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I could not get through it, but I did enjoy it. I had a hard time believing that this book was not just another self-help book, and that it was something more. There are several problems with it: The author's advice is almost exclusively based on the research of Dr. James Dobson (he is the father of the "Focus on the Family" movement). The author doesn't seem to understand that research on the family does not contradict his theory of "The Five Love Languages" which he promotes as a cure for divorce, divorce and remarriage. Dobson is a former Mormon, and he was a key member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His theories about the "Five Love Languages", which he presents as a way to cure divorce, are based on a faulty understanding of the research on family, and they are extremely misleading. The authors of The Five Love languages do not recommend the "five love languages" as a remedy for divorce. Dr. Doberson's research was done on couples who had been married for more than 40 years and who had divorced. He found that those couples who were in a relationship with each other for five years or more had no less sex than those who had broken up. This does not mean that the five love languages do NOT work. But, as with most other theories, it depends on how you use them, and the way in which you apply them. Most of what Dobson says about the five loves languages is not really relevant to most couples who are divorced, as they are not married for that long. And, there is no research that shows that the couples who get divorced, actually get divorced. The author also recommends that couples try to "reconnect" after a divorce. In a nutshell, he suggests that the most important thing is to try to get back together. But that is NOT true. Dr Dobson's theory is based on one study where couples were asked to talk to each other about their problems after the divorce. The couples who got back together, did not talk about the problems that they had had after the marriage. This shows that couples who try to talk about their divorce problems are not likely to be successful. Dr J

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________I am a huge fan of Michael Chabon. My wife and I recently had the pleasure of reading a few of his books. This one was one of them. I found it to be a very, very good book. I have to say that I would have given this a 4.5 stars if the first half of the book had been as good as the last half. It was very interesting to me and it was very entertaining. The characters are very well developed and there was no lack of humor. The book was a little slow paced for my taste but I'm sure the reason is that the plot is very complex and it takes a lot of time to read. The author made the book a little more complex as well. Overall, a very good read. I will be purchasing the next book in the series, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, in order to complete my reading list.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book is poorly written. The prose is bad and sometimes incomprehensible, with too much exposition. I think the author's intention was to convey a feeling that the author was writing from the perspective of a kid who had just discovered the wonders of the world of computer games. This is not the case. The author clearly had a very limited experience in computing, which is why he can't get computer games to run smoothly. There are a number of problems in this book, but the worst is the use of the words "weird" and "crazy". This book was written by a 13 year old who was not mentally ready to write. If he were 18 today he would not be a competent writer. "   - J.B. of California   This book was published in 1996. How could the writer of this book possibly have had a good grasp of the subject matter? Why does this book exist?   For the answer to these questions, please see the review by Chris at the end of this review.   I really enjoyed reading this book. I was able to learn a lot about the subject and what I believe is a good description of how computers work and what their uses are. The descriptions of how a computer works and how a program works are very clear.   the problem I have is that the book is full of technical terms that I don't understand. I am not an engineer and I have a difficult time understanding how to program. I will be reading the book in order to learn how to write computer programs. I did find the chapter on using the Internet a little dated, as the author seemed to be writing this in 1996 and not sure about what the Internet is now like.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________  I've read this book twice now, and each time it has been a bit less than I was expecting. The characters are so bland. The main character, a girl who is a bit shy, is so bland that she's like the character from The Catcher in the Rye. I like the book, and I think it's well written. I just wish it had more depth. I think this could be a great read for people who enjoy the kind of romance that is a little bit lighter and more modern, and not so heavy that it becomes boring. However, if you are looking for a really good book that is well written, but doesn't have a lot of depth, I would not recommend this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book. I like the idea of a series about an American boy who falls in love with a German girl. I did not really care about the book or what happened to the main character. The author uses the whole book to describe the differences between the American and German languages, which I found distracting. The writing is too repetitive, the plot doesn't really make sense, and there are no twists. I didn't enjoy this book, and I was hoping to like it, but the story didn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too long and confusing. The author did not even mention a source. The characters are just too confusing and I just didn't feel connected to them. I was confused about why these characters are involved in a situation they shouldn't be in. It seemed like they were trying to accomplish too much. I thought that the ending was pretty lame. I felt like the book should have just ended after that scene, because it didn't really add anything to the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, in the introduction to his book, tells us that he wants to change the way we view the history of the world. His approach is that the events of the past are no longer valid, so the future will be different. The problems with his ideas are two-fold.  First, as the book is not historical in nature, he cannot claim that the world would be different if he were writing the history now.  Second, even if he was, I do not believe the world is different now. It is true that our current society is much more egalitarian and much more equal, but that is due to the fact that our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents were all very equal.   I can't give this book a positive review, as it was not the greatest book I have ever read, but it was still a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping to read something interesting about the history of the New York City subways. Unfortunately, it is full of historical inaccuracies, such as the incorrect name of the original Grand Central Station, the incorrect date of construction of the IND/ROW line and the inaccurate location of the first station on the line. There is also a description of the current station at Grand Central, but it is also incorrect. It is actually located at the northern end of the station, near the western edge of the Grand Central Market. As for the history, the first subway lines were built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the early 1920s and ran for about a decade until the end of World War II. The IND, ROW, IND and IND/WL were originally called the Grand Trunk Railroad. The ROW and IND trains are all named for the initials of the initials (ROW for the Brooklyn and Harlem Lines, IND for the Manhattan and Queens Lines and INDWL for the Long Island Rail Road).  I think that most people would agree that this book is a bit too inaccurate for a history book. I'm glad that the author included some good historical information and pictures in this book, though. The photos in this volume are good, but the photos in the other volumes are much better. I also appreciate the fact that the publisher included a chapter on the original station and how it was built. The best part of this book though is the section that discusses the current Grand Central station. This chapter explains how the station was built and how they built the first stations to go under the station. The pictures are great and the text is also very good. If you have kids in school, this is a great book for them.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This is an absolute joke. It is the most tedious book I have ever read. This book is filled with bad grammar, spelling errors, poor writing, poor story and terrible characters. The story starts off with a typical story about a boy named Rube who is bullied by his classmates. Then a story about how the bully is killed by a vampire. The vampire is the main character, and it's interesting. Then he is killed, but then he gets revived by a doctor and is now a vampire again. Then the story about him getting killed again starts. It just gets worse and worse and the story is so bad that I can't even read anymore. I'm almost done with this book and I'm not sure I want to read it.  I'm so disappointed. ,  "  The main characters are terrible and there is no suspense or tension at all. It's like a bad episode of the TV show "Dawson's Creek". The main characters were boring and their motivations for doing anything were very questionable. They were all evil and they did nothing but cause trouble for the world, and to me that's the most disgusting thing I can think of.  I could have gotten over this book. I was just so disappointed in it.   There is so much wrong with this story that it's not even funny. I could understand the plot if they just went back and rewrote everything so that it didn't sound so stupid and dumb.   I feel bad for the characters because I'm sure they were likeable and I liked Rube and his friends. But it just didn't work. The characters are awful and I don't want to know anything about them. I feel like I'm reading a book about a bunch of stupid kids that have no life or any life at all and have nothing going on in their lives except for being stupid. And I just can't stand it. It seems like the writer was trying to make some kind of a statement about bullying and people being mean to each other, but in reality it's just bad writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a bit disappointed with this book. It is an interesting study of how the human mind works, but it seems like the author is trying too hard to impress his own opinion on the reader. I think that his writing style is so amateurish and so difficult to understand that the reader might be better served reading something more professional (which is exactly what he wrote his book as, a professional, academic work). There is a lot of information about the science behind the book, but there are also a lot more personal opinions and stories about his own experiences. I have always thought that the best scientific studies should be easy to understand, and not so much about the details. The book has a very difficult time explaining the science that the author tries to cover in a very readable and simple way. I would say that this is a very good book, however, there are probably better books out there that cover similar topics in a much more interesting way.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________, this book was so disappointing to me. I wanted to love this book, I wanted it to be one of my favorite books ever. But it wasn't. I really didn't like how the author talked about the sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his father, and how his father turned against him and how he was unable to tell anyone because he felt ashamed and guilty about it. This book did not feel true to me and didn't give me a true picture of what happened. I also found the sex scenes, even though they are described, not that exciting to read about. I was also disappointed by the fact that there is no real character development in this book. I thought that this book could have been a really great book, but instead I felt like it was a really bad book. _________________________________________   This book was just too long to be very enjoyable for me. If you're looking for a really good book about abuse, you'll find it here, but the book felt like a bad adaptation of a true story, and it wasn  This is a good book for those that want to read something that is true, and for those who have had a similar experience to someone else. But if you don't like being touched, you will not like this book...
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************************   My wife and I were going to buy this book because it is an excellent reference on the subject. However, I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books and I had to be very careful about this book. It was difficult to put it down. There were times that I just could not put it aside and it was really boring and repetitive. It seemed like it was written by a fan who was writing for a fan and had no idea about the subject matter. It just made me feel bored and I am not a fan of repetition.   I thought it was a good book and if you are a fan like me then I think you will enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I found it interesting, and not a bad read. But I can't recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I was disappointed with this book. I was very excited about reading this book as a fan of the author's writing and the characters in it. This book, though, did not meet my expectations. The story is pretty good, but it has one major flaw that made me dislike the book: the author uses the characters to help him write a story. The characters are just too cute and nice to be a realistic character in a book about war. It's not that the characters are all horrible, but that they're just too perfect to be realistic. The book tries to make up for that, but I think it didn't quite succeed. I will admit that there were parts of the book that were really enjoyable to read, but other parts I really did not care about. This was a book I read because of the title, but not because of what the author had to say about the war.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is an obvious copy of a great book called "The Book of Life".  This book has a similar premise, but it's not as good.  The author did an excellent job with this book, but the book lacks that originality and depth. _____________________________________ 5/5 I found this book to be a very interesting, albeit slightly disturbing, look at the mental health of an aging person.  I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ is a good read, and if you have any interest in the field of quantum gravity, this will be a must read. However, it is a poorly written book. It is the standard work, and the authors clearly have the right ideas, but the writing is poor. The author should not have allowed the title to be used in such a way, for if it were a science book it would have been better written. The authors clearly do not know much about quantum gravity. I wish they had gone into more detail about the problem of the singularity (the point of no return) and the cosmological constant, as well as the other issues in the theory.  Review by: Andrew L. Smith on May 22, 2013 :  I really enjoyed this book.   In summary, this book is a review of the current state of research and does not attempt to explain it in a technical sense, or to explain the current scientific debate about the subject, but rather discusses the current problems of understanding the nature of reality in general, and quantum gravity in particular.  , a quantum gravity text that I found to be very interesting and readable. I was also interested to learn more about the history of the field, and was surprised to learn that the authors were not in agreement with each other on the fundamental ideas of quantum field theory. I think it is important to read these books because they help us to understand what the various schools of thought are saying, as the different camps in the debate are often not entirely clear on what they are saying.I found the book to be extremely well written. I especially enjoyed the first two chapters, which are more in depth, although I found the later chapters to be more difficult to read. I found it to be a bit dry, and somewhat lacking in some of the science and theory, although it does attempt to give a good overview of what has been done and is going on.I think the book is well written, but I would not recommend it to a non-physicist. The text does not require any prior knowledge of quantum mechanics or relativity to understand. I would recommend it for physicists and other people with an interest in physics and general theoretical science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is nothing but bad. This book is a poor representation of the world of the original, and it was not what I had hoped for. The book is written by a guy who was involved in the first book, and as such has the same problems as everyone else. The plot is very predictable, the characters are bland, and the story doesn't make sense. The last two chapters were incredibly frustrating, and there was a huge amount of pointless exposition in the middle of the book. I'm glad I don't have to read it, and I highly doubt that I will ever be able to read another book written by the same author, ever again. 3.5 stars:   Very mediocre.  This book was so terrible that I was going to give it only one star.  This book is by a writer who has a good grasp on world building.  There are a lot of interesting details in this book, like the way the world works, the fact that there are many different races, and that it is ruled by the government.  The problem is that this is all presented in a very dry, bland way, which doesn't really show much of what the world is really like.  I have no idea how the government operates, and they really didn't explain how it works for me.   I also noticed that the main character of this book was very bland and forgettable.  He's the protagonist of the first novel, and even his name was changed to something similar.  At least the main characters of the previous book were more interesting, and this character was just kind of annoying.  Another thing that annoyed me is that the book seemed to be very generic.  We have a main character who is constantly whining about the bad things happening to him, and a main villain who just seems to be there to annoy everyone.  It is almost as if the author wanted to give us a typical story, but then he just couldn't think of anything original to do.  To be fair, this is a first book and the author has never written a bad novel, but I'm pretty sure this book could have been better. 5 stars, because:   I enjoyed reading this book.  This book was an improvement on the previous, in that it didn't feel like a generic story about a character who was doing a typical plot.  Instead, it was about the world and the people that live in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book! It was a fun read that got me thinking about my own experiences. I thought it was a good book for people who like to think and talk about the big ideas, but also like to have fun. It was interesting, and a good read.  The only thing I dislike about this is the characters. The characters were very one-dimensional. The main character had no real personality, and he was pretty annoying. The other characters were also pretty one-note, but they did have a bit of development. I don't know if I would like to read a book about an autistic person, but I definitely enjoyed this book.   I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I found a very interesting book while in the library. I had a very difficult time finishing it. I am an English major with a general knowledge of the history of science. My professor said he had seen this book many times before and that the author was very good at putting his thoughts into words. It was an interesting read, but the writing did not keep up with the topic. I felt as though it was very disjointed and did not give me the necessary background to understand the topics it covered. ________________________________________________ It is the usual tale of the triumph of science over myth, but at a price. _______________________________________________________________________________ The story is set in the year 1764. Scientists and theologians are in a fierce debate about whether or not God is the creator of the world. They have been unable to agree on the question, and now the French philosopher Descartes, an atheist, believes he has the solution. He proposes a method of studying the universe called natural philosophy, which involves studying the natural world. ______________________________ When I was a kid, I was fascinated by this book. I still am, although I'm not sure I still read it. _____________ I have been looking for a book about the origin of the universe. I have found a book that answers that question. It is a very well-written book, and I found myself wanting to read more about the author and his ideas. The book was very well researched, and the author, Michael Shermer, was a pleasure to listen to. I can't say enough about this book! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the evolution of the human mind. ______________________ The book is a good introduction to the ideas of the author.  I was very impressed with this book, although the last third of the book seemed to be a little too theoretical for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a few very bad ideas that are completely ignored in favor of the most bizarre, convoluted, and nonsensical ideas. The author tries to make a "big" story about a huge earthquake and tsunami and somehow manages to make it seem small and irrelevant. The most notable thing about the earthquake is that it's huge and it's a very bad earthquake, and not in a good way. The tsunamis are just as bad.   The author is clearly trying to make his book seem very important by using the tsunami as a major character in his story. But that's a terrible use of the tsunami. The tsunami is a major natural disaster that happens a lot. And it's not the only natural disaster in the book. I'd say the author has done a poor job in making this book seem big and important.   and I do not know how you make the whole thing about a earthquake, an earthquake that was caused by the volcano that's still active, and the volcano's eruption in the Pacific, but you can't make it about the tsunami because the tsunami is very small and not even the biggest natural disaster of the century. So that was very stupid of the author to do that.  - it's very important to remember that the author is just a writer who happens to be in a coma. His dreams are just that, dreams. If you read it, don't think about what it means and just read the book for the story. I am sorry the story is so poor. I really like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring. There are no real surprises in the story and there are no characters. This book does nothing for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a nice read but it's boring and boring characters. I have read other books by this author. But I always feel that the character development is not real enough. And it is all about the "plot" and not about the actual story. The characters are boring and it is not fun to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed the first three books but it seems like all of the characters have gone from cool to really annoying since the last book. There are too many characters, too much drama and it's just really hard to keep your mind focused on what's important and what isn't. The new characters seem like they are made to take the place of the old characters because they have more depth than the others. It's so sad. There is also some sex but that is so much overshadowed by the other crap in the book. I don't know why this book is getting so many reviews. I honestly couldn't finish it because it is so boring. If you want to read some good fantasy, then go read one of the other books in the series but I wouldn't waste my time on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It was a little too short, and the ending was a bit unsatisfying (the story is good though) but the story is still worth reading. A great book for a bookworm to read! (reviewed 7/14/2006)  Review of: The Red Tent: A Novel (The Book of the Dead) by Michael Moorcock (paperback) [Review by Michael] I was never a huge Moorcock fan, but he's one of my favorite writers. I bought The Red Tents for the audiobook and loved it. It's a great read, the only downside is that there is a bit of a cliffhanger, but it's worth the read. (reviewed 8/10/2006)"  "I love the audiobooks, it's great listening to someone who doesn't have any prior experience with a genre, and I love that he is a professional narrator and can keep up with my slow reading pace. This is a great book to read on the subway."  The Red Tent is a unique story about a man and his dog, and his relationship with the mysterious Red Tent, a mysterious tent in the middle of the woods. This tent has been in the woods for thousands of years and was made by the "Old Ones" as a way to hide their secret knowledge from the "New Ones". But what is the Old Ones and what is this secret knowledge? The narrator of the book is a writer who has never heard of the Red Tent. As he makes his way through the woods to find the Red Tented he finds himself in a struggle between a young woman and her husband. I enjoyed this book so much that I bought the hardcover edition. (review published 10/14)  the red tent was a good book to listen to as I read it, but the ending did not live up to the rest of the story. it is a good read for a mystery listener but i wish the author wrote more books like this  I really enjoyed reading this book. It is an interesting story about the tent that the old ones hid their knowledge in. It has a lot of twists and turns. The narrator, Michael Moorck  was excellent as a narrator, I loved his voice. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the world of The Red Men. (Reviewed 10/7/2006 by Lillian)  of: Review by a fan: This book has it all - the suspense,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I don't recommend this book. It is very unoriginal and the book was poorly written.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is terrible. It's boring, slow, and completely out of touch with contemporary American values. The author is trying to get to grips with an "unpopular" idea - that the U.S. is a "patriarchal" society. And that it's actually more democratic and more egalitarian than many people realize. And it's completely wrong. The "patrician" system was created to protect the "patriot" (read: aristocratic) class from the "democrat" class. It is not, and has never been, about equality. It never was. The idea that the United States is a democratic, egalitarian country is a myth created by elites who have an interest in protecting the status quo and preserving their power and privilege. The book is filled with such contradictions that it is not even clear what the author is getting at. The whole premise is wrong and the book is just an example of this. This book will not change anyone's mind, and I would recommend it only to people who are trying to be "conscientious objectors" to the "democratic" agenda. ********* This book has no intellectual merit. It does not have any argument to support its arguments. There is nothing here that is not wrong. No one can think of a single good thing that is written here. I don't have a problem with a good book being written that is against a bad idea. But this book is not good. It lacks any intellectual content and it's just plain bad.  Review by: J.W. Stoddard on Aug. 16, 2012 :  This book has been on my wish list for a while. It was a fun read. The fact that it doesn't have the author's name on the cover makes it even more special. If this was a book written by a college student who wanted to make a case against a "social justice warrior" society then I could understand its value. But the fact that this book was written by an actual academic makes it worth the read.   My main problem with the book was that I couldn't really follow it. I'm an English major and a huge fan of James Joyce. I was surprised by how little I actually understood. The chapter I didn't understand (chapter 8) was mostly a review of a book that had no influence on my understanding. The remainder of the book, however, was interesting. I do agree with the author that the "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total waste of time. I found this book extremely frustrating because there were no characters that were memorable. There were no real stories. I really did not care for this book. I could not stand the author.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I really enjoyed this book. But, like all good books, it gets to the point eventually. And that's a bummer.   The book begins with a short scene that is mostly about how she gets back into the game. She does not want to, and has to make a choice between staying in her room and going to the bar to play with her girlfriends. She is able to get a couple drinks in and play with them for a while.   the first half of the book is a story about how her relationship with her ex-husband has progressed.  :o I like how you don't just get back in the game right away. It's not just about you, it's about the game in general. And she does get back into it, but in the end, she still ends up not having the game that she wanted, or needs. I don't know what to think about this part of the story.  - The rest of the chapters follow her story. And I think it's interesting to see her relationship to her friends, and how she deals with it. She tries to get over her ex and she finds a new guy, and things are ok for a bit. But then things get worse, she finds out he's cheating on her with a guy she's never met. She breaks up with him, and starts looking for a new man to help her with the relationship. Then, there is the part where she is at the bar and the guy she had sex with at the beginning of the chapter has gone home. She finds out that the guy they were talking to at the start of the night had gone home to his girlfriend, and she can't understand why she wasn't able to do the same. She goes to her girlfriend and says she needs to talk to him. The girlfriend says she wants to be friends with them, but she doesn't feel like being friends. She also has this weird feeling that she wants him to have sex with her.   It's a weird part of this book that I wish it had gone a bit more in depth with. I felt like it was a bit too much about the "what if"s. What if he cheated on her? What if she had gone out to the party with him that night? I wish the book had gone more in-depth with that part. It was kind of a bs. I really liked the way she went after him, but I didn't feel

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- --------------- Good, but I think it is much too long. I have already seen the second book in the series. It's only about a third of the way through the book. I liked the story, and I'm glad I bought it. ---------------  Helpful if you're a fan of the series, but don't plan on reading it. The first few chapters were really interesting, and the author had a lot of good ideas about the setting, the world, and magic, but it seemed like it was running out of steam. It seems like the author is going to try and create a different kind of fantasy series. I can see how that would be exciting, but with the length of this book, I think you're better off waiting for a new book in a different setting. --------------

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ This book is terrible. It is not fun to read and it makes no sense at all. I am a huge fan of fantasy books, but this book just does not appeal to me. The author seems to know how to create a wonderful fantasy world but just does a horrible job at making it believable. The story does get better in the third book and I was really looking forward to that. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's not a bad story but it just does NOT work for me. I give it a 2.5 because I would read another book in this series but if you are a fan of this type of book, then you will not like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I was really looking forward to reading this book. I love the Hunger Games series and read it when I was a kid. I really enjoyed the first book. This one was the second book, and I'm sorry but I just didn't like it. It's not the author's fault, but it's just not a good book.   I liked how Katniss is a strong young woman, she has an amazing strength that she uses to defeat the powerful Capitol and win the games. However, she doesn't have a strong inner strength that helps her get over the grief and pain of losing her friends and loved ones, she just has the strength of the people around her, which is good but doesn't last very long.  ...   The main issue with this book is the characters. There is no Katnissa. There are many girls that are like Katnisca in the books. I know it sounds weird because she is a very powerful girl, but there are some characters that are not like Katnie. There's Peeta. Peeta is just a dumb boy that wants to win and has nothing to say. I hated Peeta so much. He is the dumbest character in the whole book. Katnisis is a great character, she is very strong and smart. I am sure that I will have to read the other books in the series and learn more about Katnisson because I really loved her character.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________.   Review Rating:   I have heard a lot of good things about this book. A very good read!   The bad:  I felt like I was reading the beginning of a novel about a person with no life experience. The author seems to be telling a story about an American girl living in the late 20th century, and yet I can't tell what country she's from. The whole story is very difficult to follow.  The ending seemed like a setup for the sequel. I was left with a sour taste in my mouth.   a reader who has read the book but is looking for a good book: This book is the best book I've read in ages. The characters are unique, the writing is good, the story is original, and the writing style is perfect. If you like short stories, then this is a good choice. If not, you will probably like it. I just wish it wasn't so short.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ I thought it was a fun read but a little disappointing. The characters are all interesting but are mostly just there for the reader to see them act like idiots in their own stories and in their lives. The main character, a young girl is one of my favorite characters in any book. She is smart, funny, and just a good person. But I felt the other characters were there for no other reason than to add drama and make the story more interesting. I guess the main character is the main attraction in the book. Other characters just come off as just not being very interesting. Overall a very nice read but would have been better if there was more depth to the characters and more character development. I can see why people like it though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to pick this up, and then realized that I don't actually like this book at all. I find the story to be lame, the characters boring, and the plot predictable.  It's like they went to school together and decided to write their own little story. This isn't a bad story, it just isn't something I can get excited about. Overall, it's a very average book.

It's hard to believe it's only 752 pages long and still packs in so much.   The author really captured the essence of what makes the world of Harry Potter so special. It is not a happy place, and it will challenge you to think on your feet and do what is necessary to survive.  , the narrator, does a wonderful job at showing us her world through her own eyes. She doesn't just tell the story of a young girl trying to survive and cope with her new life in the middle of a huge world, she also gives us an inside look at the magical world, how it's made, how some of the most powerful beings in the world think, and how they are connected with each other. The world of Hogwarts is a fascinating place and it is a pleasure to watch the author give us so many different perspectives on the same topic.   the magic system is well thought out and believable. There is a little bit of it in the books, but it's well done. The characters are likable and well developed, the world is very well done, and there is enough tension to keep the reader interested throughout.The author has also created a story that is very easy to follow. It starts off a little slow, but that is just because it is the first book. After the first chapter it picks up steam and gets very exciting. The book does have its flaws, but none of them is glaring.   is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is a disaster. It was poorly written and filled with mistakes. The premise is interesting enough but the way it is presented is horribly misleading. It starts out with a girl being kidnapped by a vampire and her mom is told she is a witch. The whole plot is based around her being taken to a town where the vampires are a common sight. The book does have a bit of a supernatural element to it but that doesn't stop it from being a horrible book. The main character is an absolute nightmare who tries to kill everyone and does almost anything to get what she wants. I just can't stand the girl and her horrible writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was horrible.  I was so looking forward to this book because I really liked the first book.  My husband got it for me as a Christmas gift and I've been reading it ever since.   I am extremely disappointed.  It's a great story and I loved it, but it was all about the sex.  I don't think that was what I wanted from the book. I loved the first novel.  This is an excellent book, but I feel it was a waste of my time.  There are so many things that I didn't care for.  The story, the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the description...all of it.  As a reader, I really wanted to like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst.  The book is supposed to teach how to be a better Christian.  I am so confused, I got it from my church group and it is a wonderful book.  But I just don't see how a person can read a book like this and come away with such a strong negative opinion about it.  It is very hard to find an unbiased review on the internet so I'm not sure how I can give this book a positive review.  I'm just really confused by this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a bunch of useless nonsense. If you want a story about an alien invasion, this book will help you, but if you want an interesting book with a lot of action, then this book is for you.  I don't care for the alien invasion or the aliens, it's just too boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the most dis-organized book I have ever read. The first chapter goes over the whole plot of the book. There are many pages of information about the characters and the story. Then it goes over a bit of the background of the characters. There is very little information about what the characters are really thinking and what the author is actually writing about. It is very hard to read a story that has such little description. It does seem that the author has no idea how to write a story. The ending was very unsatisfying, as I did not feel that I was learning anything about the character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just a boring book.  The writing is not that interesting, and the characters don't move the plot. __________________________________________ What I love about this book:   The premise:  "As a man who's spent the last 30 years living in a tiny space, the thought of a new house is thrilling.  But when I learned it was going to cost $25 million, I couldn't help but think:  This will be the worst house ever.  "   I think I would like a house that's even cheaper.  The writing: __________________________________ This is a boring, predictable book.  I can't see how a house like that could ever cost less than $25M.  I'm just not buying it.  And even if it did cost less, I would still think it was a bad house.  If I want a home with a pool and a fire pit, I'll take a house with that.  It's just that a $25m house is a little too expensive for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- The plot is bad. It's too long, and the book takes too long to get to what it's about. The characters were boring, uninteresting, and not believable. I got bored very quickly, and by the end, it just felt like I was reading about a character's life. It didn't seem real. I felt cheated. I don't know what else to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I read a good portion of the series. I had no problems with the characters, except for the fact that the main female character is not very attractive. I liked that the series was not over-the-top like the books, and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat. I'm sure the author's future stories will be good, but for now, I'd rather get the book I bought from Amazon.com for about half the price.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book.  The characters were all the same (I know, I know, the plot was different, but I've seen a lot of books in my life and this is the one that made me really want to look up the authors), and the setting is just plain weird.  In the past, I've enjoyed stories about "soul mates" and "brothers" and other weirdness.   I think it's just too weird to be real.  The author had the ability to get me to the end of the book without giving me anything to chew on or anything to think about.  This book wasn't any better than the others, and I don't think it had much of a plot either.  It just had the characters sitting around, having fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________  I loved this book. It was a fast paced book that I had to keep up with, but I think I enjoyed it. I loved how the characters changed so much and how they all had different goals in mind, even though their goals may have seemed similar at first. They all got what they wanted, but it was their own goals that drove them. I think the only thing I didn't like was the ending. It felt rushed and it was pretty confusing.  13 of 15 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is really a bad read. The story has some interesting ideas, but the prose and the plot just don't work. This is a story about a young man who lives in a small town, and it doesn't help that the characters are all really stupid. They are almost all annoying, and when they aren't annoying they just seem like a bad person. I have no problems with the story, but I have issues with the characters. The Verdict:    I enjoyed this book and it was interesting, but this is a very poorly written book and the characters were very poorly developed. The main character was pretty well done, and the author did a good job of creating a likable character.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book and thought I was in for a good read. However, I have to say I was completely disappointed. This is not a good book. I feel like this book was made to appeal to people who are looking for a light read. There were no characters I cared about, and not even the main character, Nona, was memorable.   The story revolves around two characters Nona and Sanya. Sanya is a female friend of Nona's and she's a bit shy. I really liked Sanya's character because she was not afraid to express herself. Unfortunately, the story goes from Nona befriending Sanya and Sanyaa being friends with Nona to Sanyaaa getting in trouble with Nanna.   "I'm just a big fangirl," I thought. "This isn't going to work."   Nona is just trying to get away from Sanya because Sanya doesn't have any friends of her own. However as soon as she's gone, Sanyaaaa goes out and starts acting like an obnoxious brat. Nona doesn't understand why Sanyany is acting like a jerk and she even tries to talk to Sanya but Sanyayd is just too mean and she doesn't even listen.   I don't think Nona would get along with Sanyda because Sanyd is a jerk. However Nona does fall in love with a boy who just happens to be her new best friend. I don  I really liked the first half of the book. The story has a good pace and it had a good balance of comedy and drama. However when the story switches to the main characters we start getting into the drama. I would have preferred a slower pace but I was still interested in the characters and the plot.  , and I was so disappointed. The main character Nona was just so annoying. She was so over the top and she had no real character. It just didn't seem like she was going to be around for long. I felt like I was reading a book with a male lead and I didn't feel like it was ever going to end. The only reason I was actually interested in this book is because of the comedy that was coming out of her mouth. It was so funny, but it was just way too much for my taste.   The main male character, the main male protagonist, is just so boring. I couldn't
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as a gift from my parents. I read the first half of it and liked it. The second half of the book was like reading a page out of a story book, but it was not a story. The characters in this book were all different. It was a very slow paced book. I have tried to read many fantasy books. I found this book to be a lot harder than most. The author really needed to have some kind of background on the world in order to make the characters interesting. The writing was very slow and had a lot of grammar errors and bad word choices. I gave it 3 stars because I really enjoyed the story line and the characters. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ I was excited to read this book, because I have had a long standing interest in the history of science, and particularly in the early history of the chemistry of the seventeenth century. However, I found that I had to take my time with this book. The author's style is a bit stiff, and I think he is at times too eager to show us how "the world has been transformed". He also seems to use too many terms that have no particular meaning, but which seem to make the author sound much smarter than he is. Overall I found the book somewhat unsatisfying.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ was the first book I read about this horrible woman who did these terrible things. The book is very biased in the author's favor, so you get this whole view of her being a nice person who's evil. Her behavior is so evil that I couldn't even believe that she did these things. This book is written for people who think that the worst people in the world are usually psychopaths. She's the only one I know who actually did these horrible things to people. If you have a psychopath in your life, read this book. I wish I could have gotten some help with it. I would have saved so many people from this awful woman."   Award for Excellence in the field of Self-help: ___________________ "This book will help you get rid of your most destructive personality traits. It is a very good, easy to read book, with good tips and examples. The author was a very nice person to talk to, and his style is very easy to understand."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's really a waste of time to read a book that has been written about but not done yet, or worse, a book about a terrible book about bad books, and not only that but a book with a terrible premise, and a mediocre story, and the most disappointing plot twist. I guess this book was written by someone who was really unhappy with all the other books she'd read, because she seems to have spent a lot of time trying to make it work, but it just comes off as a really bad attempt to give it a chance. There are so many good things about the book that I wish I could give it more stars, but I have to rate it a 3 because there are some parts that I was so disappointed by that I really can't give it 5 stars.  But there are parts of it that I liked that were so frustrating I just can't see the author's point in it, so 3 stars. The only good thing about this book is that it is not a book written by a woman, but by a man.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really didn't enjoy this book. It seemed like it was written to push a political agenda, not an educational one. I read it expecting a good story and found it to be a disappointing one. It was also very preachy in its political messages and I couldn't stand it. The author had to go to a political convention and he had a lot of great advice to give the people there but it didn't work for me. I feel like he was trying to push his agenda and I felt that he was going to tell us what to think but instead he gave us very little information about the subject at hand. The writing was very sloppy and the style was very unprofessional. I just don't feel like it will have the same impact on people that his other books did. I guess I'm not really an educator so that wasn't really my thing. Overall: 3.5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know about this one, I really enjoyed this book and the story was very enjoyable. The problem was the way the author uses the characters. We all know that there are bad people in the world but I was never sure how the author was going to use the bad people. Most of the time the characters would act the same and the only difference is they are bad. Some of the characters were even kind of funny, even the main character. There were no characters that I cared about because most of them acted the same way, so the story felt like a bad story with a bad ending. I don't like how he ends the book. It's not a bad idea to end the book with a good ending but that's just what this book ended with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that's not about any of the things it claims to be about: a history of the First World War. There's not enough history of this conflict. The author has a lot of things to say about his own military service, but his subject is a very short one. He says there are no heroes in the war. The first part is about his experiences, not about the war, which I don't agree with at all. He's not interested in that either, though I don the fact that he's from England.   The second part, about the French, is also bad. The French have done well in WWI, and are still a major power, but they didn't do that well in WWII. They didn't even have any infantry divisions! They had a bunch of colonial forces, which made it worse. There is a lot about the Germans, but very little about the Allied powers. There are some good quotes from some of the men who did the fighting, but none of it is anything to write home about. It's not a bad read, but I wish the author had spent more time on the actual war, and less on his own experiences.   a bad review:   This is a bad history book. The First World  I'm a history major, but even I'm not that knowledgeable. I do know a lot, but not a lot is really covered in this book. I didn't know anything about the First Battle of Ypres. I also didn't have much of an interest in the WWI or Second World War, so I never really cared about this one. I'm glad the author says that the British had a lot more to gain by going to the war than the Germans did, but that's about it. The Germans had a much bigger army, and the British, despite having a lot smaller army, did a much better job fighting them. I suppose that the French could have done a better job, but the war had already started, so they didn not have much more to lose than the other allies.   is a good read for the people who want to know more about the Great War. I think it is a better read than a lot other books on the topic. I'd like to see a book about WWI that has more detail about it than this one, though. The book is short, and it's not really the sort of thing that I'd want to read in
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________   When I was first introduced to this series, I thought the writing was fantastic and that the characters were real and relatable. However, I quickly found that the plot, the world, and the setting were all shallow and not as interesting as the characters. I felt as if I had just read a "cheapie" fantasy. The author seemed to have a knack for writing about people who were more interesting than his characters and it's hard to enjoy a book if you feel the author is just using you to get more pages out of the book. I've had my eye on this series since I first read it in the beginning of 2002. After all, it was the first time I'd seen the series on the market. But after reading this book, I am very glad I didn't waste my money. This book has been a total disappointment. I found myself yawning throughout the whole book and just wishing I could stop reading. The world building is incredibly shallow and the characters are almost non-existent. I'm very disappointed that this series was created by this author, since I really loved the original book series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a collection of short stories about a little girl, which in itself is not bad, but it is very strange. It is also very poorly written, so much so that I almost threw it out. This is a very odd story, but then it is weird, and I don't really think it is meant to be a story. It also lacks plot, so it's not really the kind of story I would be interested in reading. I think I would like it better if the author had taken out the supernatural elements and had just given us some short stories. I also think it would have been better if she had tried to have some kind of plot going, or at least to give some kind... The story:   The little girl lives in a small town in the country. She has a dog named Spot, who is the first thing she ever thought about when she was a little kid. Her dad is a cop and her mom is a school teacher. Her house is always filled with her pets, and her dad is always gone to work, but she has lots of friends who come over, like the girls who are in the picture on the cover. One day, a girl comes over who is really strange. She is really skinny, but her eyes are huge. Her hair is always dirty and always looks like it's been on fire. She also seems to have a really strong smell and can't stand her own smell. She likes to run around naked, and is a bit of a "bad girl." The girl goes by the name "Dottie." She likes reading and dancing, and the other girls who visit are all in love with her. Dottie also has a really strange pet that is named Tippy. Tippy is like a dog but has long legs and a tail that's like a snake. The girls who stay over try to get Tippy to be friendly, but he just gets mad. The weird thing is, he seems to think he is really big and good-looking. It turns out that Tippy has the same sort of personality as Dotties, but that she has more power. One day, Tippy makes a little boy that Dotty calls "Little Man." Little Man is very happy, but Dottsie doesn't like him very much. Dowsie doesn't trust her friends, and they have a lot of trouble with her when they visit. The whole time Dottiel
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a really hard time putting this book down. It's one of those rare stories that I loved so much I read it all in one sitting (a lot of the stories are like this, I just couldn't put them down). It's also one of the only books I've ever read in which the main character is actually a little bit sympathetic to her antagonists. The characters are complex, and I enjoyed the way they were written. It was a little confusing at times, but I still enjoyed it.  Overall, I'd recommend this book. _______________________________________________________  My review  A bit of a mixed bag.  ___________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a train wreck. It was so poorly written and so confusing. I had to look up what the hell was going on for most of the book. I was very frustrated because it was just so hard to follow. I have been in a situation where I felt that I just did not know what was going to happen and the plot had no reason to continue so the book ended very abruptly. This book was so bad and I will be trying to avoid it for my future reads.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I bought this book expecting to love it. I read it on a plane on a flight from NYC to FL in the winter. It was so bad that I was disappointed. The main character, who is supposed to be a strong woman, is not a strong person. She's very weak and is weak in the face of many things. She is not strong and independent in the slightest. The other characters who are supposed to act like strong women are weak too. They do not act like the strong people we are supposed too. And I thought it was really weird that the author called them "strong women". It seems to me that if you are a woman, you are supposed not to be weak. It seems that he has chosen not to include strong female characters and have written just about weak female characters. I did not enjoy this book. --------------------------   It was really hard for me to get through this book, it is so bad it is hard to even write a review about it. My son and I both read it together, he was just having fun, but the book is so terrible I just wanted to throw it across the room. There were so many problems in the book. It is like the author decided that the way a girl talks is more important than how she acts and the book just devolves from there. There are so many plot holes that I just did not know where to start. There is no character development at all. The woman who is the protagonist is very much like a character from a fantasy book, she is weak, weak willed, weak and stupid. She doesn't know what she wants and she doesn't act like a strong or independent woman. The rest of the characters are weak and there are just so many issues that come up. I just can't recommend this book to anyone.   My rating:  No Rating   I am not giving this book a positive review. This book is terrible. I am sorry, but I just do not believe that this author has ever actually met a female who was strong and strong-willed. He is so ignorant and does not even know how to write a female character who is not weak and dependent. He does not know what a strong female is. I hope that someone will review this book and point out all the plot holes and problems. I want this book removed from the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the worst book I have ever read, and the worst I've ever had the displeasure of trying. The characters are all so one dimensional, I felt like I was reading a parody of the 90's. And when the plot got boring and the characters were uninteresting, the book just got old and uninteresting. If this is the sort of thing that bothers you, you're better off avoiding this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ The book was terrible, and it is the best part of the series. I can't imagine how anyone would read the book and still be interested. I just wanted to see what happened next and that it was going to be a bad experience. The book is not worth the price of admission. The bad writing and characters makes the book unlistenable. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a fraud. It is all a lie.   " " I am glad I didn't buy it.  "   I can't believe someone would actually do something like this.  I bought this book from Amazon in November 2013, but it didn't arrive until February 2015. I got it, but I didn`t really have a reason to open it until recently. I guess I am curious about how it came about, so I went to the bookstore today and asked the clerk if I could open it. I just happened to come across it on a shelf in a bookcase on the second floor of a grocery store. I opened it to find the book was a fake. The blurb says "The world is in great turmoil as it prepares for the upcoming war. It seems that the world leaders are about to announce a ceasefire in the war between the forces of good and evil. They have been preparing this announcement for years, but nobody seemed to listen to their warnings. The reason for this is that the United States and other nations are trying to steal the technology of the alien race known as the Xemu. The Xemus have been developing their own advanced technology since ancient times, and their technology has been used in wars against the XeMe. The United States wants to take their technology for their own use, but the Xelians have refused. The two forces of Good and Evil are about the be about to destroy each other. In this book, a group of Xemuit warriors is sent to Earth to warn humanity of the impending danger. They are led by a man named Xul, a Xemue warrior who was killed in a battle against the Evil Forces and is now being resurrected. He has been sent to warn the humans of the dangers they face in this conflict. After the book had ended I was quite confused. I did not know why this book was called "War of the Xeems" and the author referred to it as a "book". I was a little scared because the first thing the book does is tell us the bad things that will happen in this war. I was very surprised when I found out that the author used a photograph of a man in the book as a photo reference for the character named Xelul. There is no indication that he is a real person, just a model. I also found out through google that the book is an un-published work by a Russian author.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- "I have read many books, but this book is a real shame. The author uses his research on the subject and tries to give us the truth, but fails to make any of his arguments. He gives us many examples of how he has dealt with bullies, but he doesn't give any examples of why he feels that it is wrong to punish those who bully, he also doesn't have any examples about how his own father dealt with it. " - Michael C.  "A little over three hundred pages of bullying, in an interesting book. The title and the cover are very misleading. This is a book about a small town. And that's all. " -------------------------  Review of "Bullying: A Book About What We Tell Our Kids" by John H. Coontz. The review states that it has a good deal of information about bullying, but doesn't address the main point: how to deal with it, and in particular, how to prevent bullying. That is a very important issue, because the issue of bullying is so often treated as a taboo subject. In fact, there are many good books about bullying. One such book is "Grow Up: Why Children Have to Be Bullied" by Susan Cain. (Cain's book is about a much more serious issue, namely child abuse, not bullying.) There is also a book called "Bullied: A Hidden Crisis" by Peter Bearman. (Bearman's book deals with how parents can prevent child abuse.) Bearman also has a more general book, "Bullies: How to Make Friends, Avoid Trouble, and Thrive in a World Gone Mad," which I've also read. "Bullying" by Coontze and the authors' explanations of what they mean by bullying seem to me to be at odds with each other, especially the title. It seems to me that bullying should be defined by the child who bullies, not the child bullied. For example, if a child is being physically abused by a sibling, the child may be "bullied" because he is being bullied, not because he's being physically harmed by the sibling. Similarly, if he's a bully to other children, the bully may be the child being bullied. This definition of bullying also seems to apply to a lot of other behaviors that children do that adults disapprove of: using violence to gain attention, making unreasonable demands, bullying others because they don't look like them, or

The main character is really fun to read about and I really loved that he kept saying "I'm sorry, mom." I didn't like the ending because I don't want my parents to die in a car crash and I feel bad that my mom is going to get sick. However, it is a great read and I'm glad I gave it a chance.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only read the first half and have not yet finished the second half. This book was very interesting to me, but the plot is pretty much non-existent. In the beginning, we have a very nice woman (Lilly) who has a very weird family life. We are told that Lilly has an older brother who was killed in Vietnam and that she has an alcoholic father and a mother who does not care about her. Lilly and her mother move to the countryside where her mother lives in a large mansion and Lilly has to live in a trailer with her uncle who is also her uncle's son. Her mother is very strict and she makes it very clear that she does not want Lilly around. Lilly has a sister who lives with her parents. Lilly decides to live with her aunt and uncle, but they refuse to take her in. Lilly becomes depressed and decides to end her life. At this point, the book becomes very interesting. Lilly tries to kill herself by driving off a cliff and the next morning she wakes up in the trailer. The aunt and the uncle take her to a hospital, where she learns that she had a heart attack while sleeping. This is followed by an interesting book about the life of the hospital nurse, Mrs. Soto, who is a very different person than what we are told about her in the book. The book ends with Lilly's death by drowning in the river. I found this book to be very interesting and I enjoyed the characters, but I would like to have been told more about Lilly's family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent and unique take on the genre of a book about a man who must protect his family from his estranged father, who is trying to take the family's land away from them. The story is very entertaining and is very different from the usual family saga of the book, as the main character is a hunter and hunts by himself. The author has done a great job of making his main character a very likable and sympathetic character. The main story is a good one and it is very interesting to follow.   I wish there was a more positive review that would sum up the story a little better. It is just not as good as the story is. The first half of the story takes place in the first half and the last half of this story takes places in the second half. So there is a lot of time wasted in this. There are no new details in this book and the only new thing I did not like about this book was the author not putting the story in the background. I know this sounds silly, but it makes the book less exciting. The last story in this trilogy, which was the worst in my opinion, took place before the main story took place and this book is a waste of time because it does not make the main tale any better. The end of the novel had a lot going for it but it is just a waste.   (hide spoiler)   In the end, I found the book quite enjoyable and will definitely read the next book in the series. I would recommend this book for readers who like fantasy and science fiction, and who are interested in the main characters. The book is short and can be read in one sitting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read all the books in this series and have loved it, but this one was just awful. This is the worst book I have ever read and I have read a lot of horrible books. This book was just a mess. I will give it two stars because the story was great and the characters were great. It was just terrible. I really hate bad books, but in this case, I just can't stand it. I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and this was just like every other bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no idea how the writer is still writing these books. I read this one last year and thought it was a good story with interesting characters and it was just too boring after that. This was another one of those "don't read this if you like books with action" books. The action is completely missing from this book and the main character is too dumb to be a bad guy. He does get some nice moments in the book, but it's still so boring I could have done without. I am just going to ignore this book because it's so boring and nothing interesting happens to the characters. The writing is just bad. This book was like watching a bad movie.   This book is just too bad to even review. It's so bad I can't even tell you how bad it is.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book was an utter disappointment to me. It wasn't bad by any means, but I would never want to read another one of his. It was more like a one-star book, with just a few of the bad parts. I did not like the writing style, it was so cliche. It had a lot of repetition and it made me cringe to the end. This book is not what I thought it would be, and I won't be picking it up any time soon. - August 22, 2017Disappointing  Reviewer: The Good Doctor - favorite favorite favorite - July 23, 2017  Subject: Too bad it's been done before I agree that this is not a novel worth reading. I know some people enjoy reading these kinds of stories, but for me, it's a chore. It's also worth mentioning that this book has a strong Christian message. I can't imagine being a Christian and reading this, it would make me think that Christianity is a terrible religion. It seems that a lot is made of the "sexual" parts, but they are almost all done at the end of the book when there is no payoff. I would suggest to avoid this book. - July 3, 2017Too bad it has been done already  Review of Over the Edge: An Unfinished Novel:   I'm just going to start this review off with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of the author's style.   His writing style is extremely predictable and doesn't really feel natural to me at all. His dialogue is very dry and doesn.t feel like a real conversation between two people. His narration is almost always monotone, very monotonous and it makes the book very hard to listen to.   the writing is very much like the narration.   (I'm going to have to re-read this book for a better review because I'm getting very annoyed with this one)   But for those of you who enjoy good horror stories, this is a good read.   of course, I'm just getting started with the bad stuff...   First off, it doesn't even come close to finishing. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying.   The author seems to be using this as an introduction to another book in the series. So far I have only read the first book, but it doesn.'t seem to be a good introduction.  's style is very predictable and isn't really natural
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I loved the concept of the book, and enjoyed reading it. It has some good ideas and was an interesting read. The characters are not very interesting, but they are all real. The author was a little cheesy, but I thought it was part of the charm of the story. I really liked the author's use of the "fate" system, and the fact that the author is a very good writer. I do not understand the premise of the novel though, the characters were very one dimensional. I think this is a book that people would enjoy reading and I really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  This is one of those books that made me question the validity of my own intelligence. This is a book about how to lose your mind. It's not a book you read to improve your own life, but a book that has no place in a sane world.   First off, I should say that I'm not really a book lover. I've read maybe one book in my life, a novel called The Book of Lost Children. I don't think I can even remember what the book was about. It was something about children who get lost in the woods and need to find their way home. The book ended with a little girl coming to a realization that she's going to be a grownup in her own right one day. I had no interest in that book, but I had a vague interest in this book, and I decided to give it a shot.   I was never sure what to expect from this book. I thought that maybe I was going to get some insight into my own mental illness, but that's about the extent of what this book really has to offer.   to be continued...
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had many a time, when I was on the verge of a good book I have not finished it due to its boringness. I was very pleased with the cover, but the content was dull and I finished it with a headache. I hope to find a better book, because I was going to finish it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- This book is so bad it's a wonder how it got published. If you buy this book, you will get sucked into the world of the author's imagination and you will think that you are in that world. If the author had actually read any of the other books he wrote, he would have realized that the story he was telling was impossible and it would be obvious that he had no idea what he was talking about. I was so disappointed when I opened the book because I knew it was a work of fiction, but I had to read it to see if it was really true. It wasn't. I will not be reading another one of his books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The book starts out well. There is a lot of history of the town of Amherst that I liked, and some of the story lines of the characters were interesting. However, after the first few pages, I couldn't get invested in the book. The author did a good job of explaining the town's history, but the characters didn't feel like they had a strong connection to the events. I felt like the characters got off on the wrong foot because of the way they started the book, and I just didn't care. The story was just too rushed, and the characters felt like they didn't have a reason to be there. I'm still looking forward to the next book, but I just found this book not worth the time I put into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think it is a bad choice to read this book.  There is so much wrong with this book, but the author does so much to try and justify why the book is good.  She has a history degree and writes about her experience at a community college, a women's college, and a liberal arts college.  It is clear that she is trying to portray herself as someone who has been a good student and an intelligent person.  As a former college student, I can tell you, that is a load of bullshit.  The main characters in the book, all of them are college students, but they are not all in the same class.  They are not as smart as they should be.  Their writing is terrible.  In fact, this book is so bad that I am going to use the words "stupid" and "stereotypical" here to describe it.  If you have not read it, do yourself a favor and read it.            This book, however, has one redeeming feature:  the characters.  When it comes to writing, it's very important to have believable characters, and I think this book has a very good one.  I would say that all of the main characters are flawed, but in different ways.  1.  A girl who was raised by a single mom who is in an abusive relationship with her daughter, but is so desperate to give her daughter a good education that she goes to the best liberal arts school she can find.  (I was thinking, how did she even find this place?  It's so far out of her way to even get on the bus.)         The only reason I found this a bit annoying was that it was so predictable.  That is, the main character would have had the same exact conversation over and over again with herself.  She would always have that one person who would tell her, "don't worry, you can get a good job at any college if you study hard" and then she would go back to being an abusive mother.  But that was okay.  Because she was smart enough to see that she was in a bad situation.  Also, this was a great character because she had a strong independent streak.            2.  Someone who was really into hip hop music, but couldn't get his music on in the morning because the music was so loud.      
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I don't know why the reviewers think it's an improvement. It's a book about a kid that can't be friends with other kids because he can't understand why everyone has to get along with him and his friends. So, when he's bored, he'll get a book, read it and then go back to the other kids and make fun of them and have fun with them. It makes him so annoying. The only good thing about the book is the ending, where the kid is happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The most disappointing aspect of this book is that it is the book that started me on the path to becoming a'skeptic' of the paranormal, which in turn got me reading more skeptical books. I am disappointed that this book has nothing new to offer. This is not to say that I do not like the author's stories about her research, but they do not seem to be based on solid evidence. The book ends in a way that leaves many questions unanswered and leaves me unsatisfied. As a skeptic, I find this book disappointing and I'm disappointed that I would read another book by the same author about the paranormal." 4 out of 5 stars:    What I found most surprising about this book was the fact that the author had a personal story that was at the heart of her interest in the paranormal. I have known this woman for over 30 years, and she has always been an incredibly friendly and enthusiastic woman. She has always made the paranormal look interesting and accessible, so I expected that her book would be of that ilk. She tells the story of a woman named Ruth, who was in her late 40's at the time of her daughter's first death. She was devastated. She had gone to her local cemetery and had prayed over it and even went to the cemetery herself to pray over the grave of her child. However, at the grave site, she was met by a young boy with a stick, and the boy asked if she wanted to talk to him. Ruth agreed and the two spent a few minutes together, during which the boy said that he was the one that buried the child. After a few more minutes, he disappeared. Ruth was very shaken, and thought about how strange it was that this boy would be there, and then disappear. She didn't know anything about the boy or his past, so she started asking around, and one day she came across a local cemetery. She went to see the man who was burying the graves, and he was quite surprised to see a child in the cemetery. He asked the boy about him and told him that he had died when he was 4 years old, but his mother was buried in the graveyard and that he would be able to visit her soon. The boy, named John, asked if Ruth wanted to go and see his grave, and they went to visit the graves. John's mother was the only child to have ever been buried in a cemetery, and it was his first
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a way, this book is a book about the wrong kind of right. I am a fan of the original trilogy, but this book has some major issues, such as the fact that the "hero" is not actually the hero at all. There is no real "reason" behind the decisions he makes, no real logic behind his actions and actions are very often "mixed up" or outright wrong.  He does get saved by a woman he loves, but that woman is not really a woman, she is a woman who is really just a woman for the sake of the plot and the author. He does get his heart broken, but no one really believes that he ever really loved anyone in the first place. It is clear that he is going to be a good person in the end, but he doesn't care and it is obvious that he has the ability to be very bad. He doesn't want to change his bad ways and he does end up with a wife and kids. This is the kind of book where the story should have ended before it started and I wish the author had not continued it, but she did and it didn't work.  (review of free book)  Review by: J.W. Tuck  This was the first of the "Star Wars" series and the first in the "Galactic Empire" trilogy. I had read this book in junior high and my dad read it to me. The first thing that struck me about it was the title. The whole book was called "Galaxy of Fear" but I don't think it really fit the theme. It was dark and depressing. I'm not sure if this book was intended as a parody or not. The only good thing about it, was the fact it was written by a female author.   I liked the main character but he just didn't seem real to me at all (the other characters were more like caricatures). The story was about him falling in love with a female alien who had been enslaved by a race of evil aliens. He went out and rescued her and was given the chance to marry her. I couldn't relate to the story at all and it made me feel very bad about myself.  of the main characters, there was only one character who actually seemed to care about the others, even if he was just trying to protect them. I think the author got a bit carried away with the "galaxy of fear
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete mess, a horrible book that's just not good at all. It's got some interesting ideas and some very good ideas that aren't properly implemented. It also has an awful plot that's only there to fill up the time. The book is full of errors that should have been caught by an editor. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book.  I'm a fan of the Star Wars franchise and love that the writers at least attempted to get the characters in the book in line with the films. The book is well written and paced. The action is very good and the characters have depth.  It just isn't very good.  The action scenes are cheesy and the main character is a cardboard cut out.  There are plenty of great things about the book and I'll recommend it to people who like Star Wars but the book isn't worth the money I paid for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. The plot is pretty standard fantasy and I really didn't care about anything happening. The magic was okay and there were a lot of great details in the world, but the characters were just flat. This book is for people who like good fantasy and want something different than what is out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book ever. The first 5 pages is great. I'm not even sure what the book is about and I think it's a bit of a love story but it's so bad that it's just too boring. I've been reading a lot of horror lately but this one was a big let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. I have the entire set in my bedroom and read them all the time. This book is a step back for the series. The writing style is a little dry, the character development is lacking, and the plot is a bit too convoluted. The characters are not as interesting as the Harry, and they do not really get to go through their emotional growth as much as I would like. They are still fun though and are not the typical angst-ridden characters that you are usually presented with. I did enjoy reading about the war in Europe. The book was a lot of fun, but it was a bit boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I don't care what you say about this book, but the author is a fraud. The story is just about the story." -Izzy - The Truth about the Great Depression - "This book is about the great depression and is a little dated, but it is an excellent read and well worth the read." -Molly "You will not find a better book than this one on the Great depression." -Linda
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, and I was so excited. I had to wait a while to get it because it sold out, but it's a great read! I'm glad I read it. It was a real learning experience for me. I hope to read more books by her in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character's mother was really annoying. I can understand why a girl would want to be with a father like that, but he was a very stereotypical father, so annoying that I wanted him to get his own book instead. I could go on and on about her and her constant complaining and not wanting to get out of the house, but she just annoyed me the entire time. The other girl is annoying too, but I guess the point is that the main character was the only one who wasn't annoying, and she's not even that good. The book doesn't even have enough characters for that to be an issue. 7) The second book is really long and kind of hard to get through. It has a lot of action and is pretty brutal, and then it gets more and more difficult to get to the story, as the plot gets more complex and hard to follow, but at the same time it's a good book and you should try it. The characters are all very unique, with their own quirks and personalities and backgrounds and history, and I really like the main guy. The setting and the story are great, and you can't really go wrong with a book about a world where people are obsessed with the past and the future, but the ending is pretty anticlimactic and it was hard to keep my attention. I think I would probably enjoy this book if I had already read the first, but if you don't mind the long read, give it a try. It is long, but it's well worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part about this book was the fact that it was written by a professional. I'm pretty sure this book would have been a good book if it was published by a less reputable company. The book was about a character who was really smart but didn't know it. She would often ask questions that seemed very smart but were really stupid. One time she asked why is it that the universe is always so stupid and always makes mistakes. Another time she asks why is there a need to know if you're right. I also noticed a pattern in her questions. In one book, she asks the question why is the universe so stupid. In the next book she asks a question that sounds exactly the same as the first one but is very specific. The same question in the next books is: Why does the universe make mistakes. This pattern kept repeating itself. I don't know why she does this. It was really annoying. I didn't like this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ It is a wonderful book but it was a mistake to read it. I was a little confused by the book because the plot is very good, but there were so many things I didn't like about the book that I didn`t get very much out of it. The book was too long and didn`T give enough information about the characters or the story. I would have liked to have seen more from the characters in the end of the book, but I didn´t think there was enough to be learned from the book. The ending was very disappointing to me because I thought it would have been nice to know more about the two characters. The only other thing I can say about the novel is that I will have to read another book by the author in order to be able to understand how the plot went in the book (because I am still confused by how things went in that book).   I really enjoyed the book and I think I`m glad I read it, but the book was just too long to be useful. I have a lot of good books that are only about a page long and this book was like about half a page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very disheartening. There was a lot of negative feedback on Amazon, so I just read the positive comments and decided to leave it alone.  Then, my mom posted a review that I thought was well written and helpful, but it made me feel like I wasn't a real reader. _________________________________________________________ What I Liked:  The characters are complex and fun.  They have interesting personalities.   The writing is witty and engaging.  It's easy to read and fun to read.  The characters are likeable.  I found the story to be really well paced and the plot to be very interesting.  Overall, this book was very enjoyable and I think it's a fun read. What didn't I like:   It was a bit too slow to start.  There are a lot more romance stories than there were characters in this book.  So, I had to read it twice, which is annoying.  As the plot goes, there is a lot going on, but there's not much happening.  That's because there's so much going on that it's hard to follow.  But, I'm sure I'll read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a piece of crap and does not contain the information the author promised to give. The story is about a guy who is going through a divorce and is trying to get back together with his ex-wife and the kids. He starts having strange dreams about a woman and has a hard time figuring out what they mean. After reading the book, I was hoping for more information about this woman but I don't think it was as good as the author claimed. I am still going to give the book a 2.0, because it was a good read and I like the book!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was really hard to read because I just couldn't get into the storyline. I wanted to love this book but it just wasn't there. It was boring and I just didn't care for this character. I don't know if this book is going to be a good read or not, but the character was really annoying. It seemed like he just wanted to be popular and I could see that but he was just way too annoying. The main story was boring. It just was just a bunch of events and he didn't have any real development at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This is an okay book, but it is a little hard to understand and get the gist of the story. The characters are really annoying. I found them to be so unsympathetic and boring that I really didn't care about what was going on with them. If you are looking for a fun book, this is probably a good one. If not, it's a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm very pleased with this book. I really enjoyed it and it was really well written. I don't know how this author is still alive because this book has so many problems. First off the main character, Eliza, is a very weak character. I felt like I knew more about her than her parents. She's very nice but it's hard to get into her head because it's so shallow. I didn't care about her and that's a huge problem. She doesn't know what she wants and what she thinks about anything at all. She just goes along with whatever her parents tell her to do. I feel like she just wants to fit in with other kids but she's so self absorbed she doesn't realize she's being a dumbass. She has a friend who helps her out but she doesn' really know anything about anything. She only thinks about herself. Her parents think she's a really great student but that's not true because she's just a ditz. She gets in trouble a lot for things that aren't even her fault. She needs a mother figure. She also needs a father figure because she has nothing to hold on to. The problem is that she has a sister who is very annoying. She always has something to say and she's loud and annoying. There's a reason she's in high school. She can't go out. She is a terrible student and she doesn´t know anything. But she's the perfect kid for her parents to love. I can't believe they're still together. I would have left her in the dumpster had I not known this book existed. If you want to read about the author's life check out this review by a former book reviewer. The ending was really weak. The last page of the book was really good. It ended with Eliza being in the woods with her friend but the next page showed that Eliza was missing. The book could have been much better but it was still a great book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I loved this book! It's about a young boy who was left by his parents in the woods after his mother got into a fight with his father and ran off with a man. This boy was found by a group of young boys and they raise him as their own. They teach him to fight and use his new found powers to fight off the evil in the world. The boy is actually a half-elf. This part of the story is what made the book what it is. The characters are so likeable and there's no reason to hate them. The only reason I couldn't give it 4 stars is because I didn't like the ending. The kids don't go to the wizard's school because they can't afford it and then the boy doesn't go. It was a short story that just got to the end. The ending didn't make sense, it made the characters seem more like they had done something bad. Overall, I loved it and recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter, a young person that is alone in the real world. It's a great book that is not too short.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I have been reading a lot of novels recently and it is amazing how often the author makes me feel like I have no hope. The protagonist in this book is a nice guy, but his entire existence is to please this woman. He's the best, but in a lot more ways than I care to admit. I was also confused on how the author would explain why a woman like this, a woman who is so self-absorbed, is attracted to someone so good looking. I have never understood that. This is a woman that has everything and she can't accept a man who isn't like her. I felt this was a cop out. I also felt like the writer was trying to show the reader that this guy is the one that will change her life. I'm not sure if that's the intention or not, but that was a bit of a cop-out. I could also relate to how she felt that the man was too good for her. If I was a man, I would have been angry that I was being told that I would be the only one that could satisfy a woman. The man doesn't need the woman to change and be perfect for him to have any success with her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very long book, so it would be nice if the author would make it more compact.   I would love to be able to read it on my commute, not so many pages to get through. I was very disappointed in the characters.  I do not know if I want to get back into the world of this series because of the way the main character has been treated. The characters have been poorly developed and are almost impossible to relate to.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or the genre as a whole, but not for the characters alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book! I had read other books about the topic but I didn't find this book that interesting.  It was very technical and the topics were complex but not very exciting.  I think that a book about how to be successful in the medical field should be more exciting than how to have a relationship with your spouse.   This book was really good but I really didn't feel it was about the science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is terrible. The character development is awful. The story itself is just a mess. It's so poorly written that it's actually kind of entertaining and funny to read the whole thing. I would have rather read the first book, which was much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ _____________________________________ I have been a fan of this series since it began, but the last volume is an absolute chore. The characters are the same, but now they are all in the same place, in a world where a magical plague has been unleashed and the only person that has any hope of surviving is a teenage boy. The only thing different from the first two volumes is the plot, but there is no new information to the plot and I found myself wanting to go back to the beginning just to get back to where I left off. There is so much story to be told in this series, but this is a major disappointment for me as a reader and for the author as a writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book was a disappointment. I had no interest in reading it and after the first chapter I was disappointed. After reading the first 4 pages I began to wonder if this book would be a good fit for a younger audience. It has some nice ideas, but they are not well developed or well presented. The characters are bland and uninteresting. I did not like the premise at all and I don't think the plot has a strong enough basis to support a novel. I felt that the author had the opportunity to write a better book, but didn't take it. The world building was interesting and the plot is interesting but I don�t see how it makes for a good book.   The only redeeming feature is the ending which was unexpected but satisfying. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys fantasy. I donít recommend it to anyone who likes gritty realistic fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a man who finds out that his ex-girlfriend has been cheating on him and has had a son from the previous relationship. He decides to keep his ex. But the relationship starts to go downhill as his ex begins to abuse the son. So there are two different types of abuse in this book. The first is that the ex- girlfriend is taking advantage of the son and that's ok because she is just acting like a child. The second is that she is acting like an adult and the son is a child so he needs to be protected. The abuse is more severe than that because she has had the son for a long time, he has never had a relationship with his father and his father is not there for him. The author goes into a lot of detail about why the son wants to be there for his father. I really don't know why. This book was written as a comedy book and I found it funny at first but then the story just dragged on. It really started to get depressing when the main character found out that he had been cheating. He doesn't really have a reason for it but the son does. I guess it's just a matter of taste. If you like a good book and funny you will like this one. If not, don't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is misleading. It's not a book about a woman, it's a book that's about a boy. It should've been called " How To Lose Your Virginity" or something like that, because that's what I learned about myself. I was trying to lose my virginity at the time, and this book basically taught me how to do it. The book itself is pretty much boring and uninteresting. I don't want to go into details because the book is only about one person. I did find the author's personality to be rather interesting, but her writing style isn't the best. The sex itself was pretty much the same as the first book (though it is a bit more intense, but that's a good thing). The sex scenes are not that exciting, they are basically just kissing, touching, and maybe a bit of foreplay. The author does mention that the book takes place in the 60's, so I assume that's where it got its inspiration, but I'm pretty sure it's only based on the fact that a lot of girls were into the 60s and there was a lot more stuff to do with girls. The actual sex scenes in this book were actually a bit boring and I found myself not really caring too much about the characters as a result. I guess if you're into that kind of thing then you'll probably like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________   This book is a piece of crap! The story is a terrible mess of bad writing, poorly conceived plot, poorly written characters, and awful plotting. If you enjoy reading books that are poorly written, poorly plotted, and poorly written and have characters that are so poorly conceived you could kill a fly, then you should read this book! If you are an intelligent person, and you do not enjoy a piece-of-crap story, then please, please do not buy this book, unless you have a huge book collection and you are in desperate need of entertainment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for the very first time a couple of months ago. I was not looking forward to reading it, because I have read the first three books in the series. The first three, while good, were not as good as the first book in the set. I do not want to get into a discussion about the flaws in the first series, but I feel like there was a big shift from book two to book three, where the plot became more confusing and plot points were not properly explained. This book is a very confusing book with very little plot and little to no real purpose, except to set up a sequel to the previous series. It's a very short book, so it is not a problem that I have with the book. The book was a bit disappointing, but not as bad as I expected. It did not take much effort to read it, so I was able to finish it in a few days. I like the book, but it is hard to recommend it to anyone who has read the previous books in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I had the pleasure of listening to this book at a conference at my university, and it was a lot of fun. The writing style was interesting and it seemed like the author did not really give a shit about the subject at hand. I found it to be a bit tedious and a bit too "technical" for me. The narration was a bit odd, and I had trouble following the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason to read this book is if you want to know how to make the perfect coffee.  You can't do that. Â The only thing this book has going for it is that it's a self-help book that includes the name of a book. _________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't say enough good things about this book. I love the way this book handles some of the more controversial topics in the atheist community. I found it refreshing to read a book that takes a critical look at some of those debates. I really hope that the next book in the series, which is a re-write of the previous book, will be better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after I started going to a Christian college and had to start taking classes in Christian ethics.  It was one of the very few books that I didn't feel like I needed to take notes to understand what the author was trying to say.    I do feel like he missed a lot of the Christian ethics that he is so fond of (in my opinion) but there are some nice things in there about what Jesus said to the rich young ruler, and how we can relate to him.  This is the first book I read by a non-Christian that really made me think about what it means to be a Christian.  There are many great things in this book and I highly recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was really well written and that it did not contain a single word that did not make sense. I have not read the other four books in the series so this is the first one that I will not re-read. I would like to thank the author for this brilliant and original idea and I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good story with a great ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of books, and I read quite a few bad ones.  This one was one of them.   It's a fairly generic crime story about a cop (who I won't name here, but who was an asshole) and a drug dealer who are trying to kill each other.  They have a gun, they have a little kid (who they kill by throwing a brick through the wall in the middle of the night), they get away with it and get arrested.  It's a really simple plot.  But what happens is so far beyond what the author could possibly imagine.  This book is about how fucked up and insane a person can get, because they are a terrible person, and they don't care.  And they're still in love with each other at the end.  I don't know, it's so fucked up, and it's such a perfect book, that it's hard to put it down.  The story is really well written, and the characters are so well drawn, that you feel like you're right there with them, experiencing their terrible moment.  A few things I didn't like about the book: 1)  The whole thing where he kills his own kid, because he's such an asshole.  2)  The fact that the whole thing with his kid is the reason he kills the other person.  3)  I just don't understand how he could keep his job after all that.  4)   It really bothered me that there were a few other people around at the time, but they were all so useless that it just didn't matter.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It was not good! I enjoyed the book. The first chapter was good. The writing was good and the characters were very well done. It is a long book so the writing got very repetitive and repetitive as the plot gets boring. There is no point to it. The story was just a rehash of the previous books and it was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ This book is a complete failure. I have tried to finish it 3 times and have never finished it. ___________________________________ This is the third book in a series I started because I wanted to read a book about a group of people that are not only interesting but also unique. The book was the first I have ever finished and I'm so glad I read it. I love how it is told through the stories of the characters, even the ones I never cared about. The narrator is great and makes the story very interesting. I did not feel like I was being cheated out of anything by this book. I felt that the book was good and that I didn't have to read the rest of the series. The only thing I wish was changed is the ending because I feel like that part was forced. But even then I liked it, so I'm not going to complain. I give it 4 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- If I had to choose one, I would choose The Road by Cormac McCarthy. It is one of my favorites from his catalog. I don't know if you're a Cormac fan, but I think you'll enjoy this one. A great novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was fun for a little while, but it was not enough to satisfy my appetite for a good story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a mess. The prose is awful. I was expecting more from a book that is billed as a classic. The author makes all the wrong turns in this book, from the end of the book, to the beginning, and back again. I could write an entire review about how he is an idiot, but I won't. The only reason I read this book is because I had a hard time believing what he was telling me. This book is not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed in this book. I'm a big fan of the Twilight series, so I was excited to see a continuation of that. The characters are so-so and I didn't enjoy any of them. The only one I was really excited for was the girl, but she's so-called-charmingly-smart and all I could think was "who the hell is she?". The boy (the only other person I cared about) is like a stereotypical bad boy but even I didn  I'm really disappointed. This is not a bad novel, but I don't care about the main character. I have a hard time reading a book where the main heroine is a complete moron and has to rely on the main male character for her survival. I don'  This book had a very strange premise. It is a book about two girls who were "born together". They are best friends, yet they have a strange bond. I thought this was very interesting, but it wasn't very good. The romance was a little annoying and the whole book felt like a long monologue. I didn' . The main character was very much like a cliché. She's a smart girl who is also pretty naive. She also has a bad side. The book was very easy to read. It was very light and very funny. The author does a good job with the writing and I just really liked her. The problem with the book is that it had a poor ending. It made me think the book had so much potential and I felt cheated because I didn',t get to enjoy it. It felt like it was a waste of time. It could have been a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  It is about a guy that had a girlfriend who had a boyfriend that cheated on her. Â It was written by a guy who wanted to be a writer.  Â The first few chapters of the book is like a train wreck.  The main character, Matt, is trying to figure out how he can make it better with his girlfriend.  Matt's girlfriend is a bit of a mess and constantly has her head in the clouds.  She thinks she is going to die and she has been living in a mansion.    She is also constantly talking about how she will marry the guy that she was cheating on with a dude named Brad.  While Matt is trying hard to make her happy, he constantly gets distracted by the thought of getting married.  They have sex at least once a week.  At the end of the third chapter, Matt tells her to go to the library.  Then he takes his shirt off and starts to play with himself in the shower.  I am not sure why this was even in the book.  A man should not be getting naked in a shower with his own girlfriend.   He has never seen a woman naked before so he can't even guess what is wrong with her.   It is at this point where the book loses any kind of credibility.  It is not a novel and it does not teach you a lesson.  In fact, it doesn't even teach a lesson to men.  This is a book that teaches nothing and just makes the man look like a total idiot.   I had to throw out the book because it just became embarrassing to read.  All in all, it was just bad.  If you are looking for a book to read, then this book is not for you.   This is one of those books where you don't need to read it and just put it in the trash.  3.  My Brother's Keeper:    I really enjoyed this book. I was really surprised by this book because I had thought it would be a book where my brother was the main character.  But he was the only character in the whole book. It started off with my brother being a "good guy" but then it turns into a book about my brother trying to become a better person.  He was able to turn his life around and became a better man and has become a very strong person. This is probably my favorite book that
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very strange book. This was not a good read for me. It was very difficult for me to get through. It's like someone who's not good at reading has to read a lot of books before they get good at it. It takes me a long time to get into the story and the characters. This is because the book has a lot to say and it seems to be telling me what to do but I don't understand. I don  This book has some problems with the author. One problem is that the author never seems to know how to make the book flow smoothly. The story is not clear and the book is too long.  I like to read books and this was one of the best. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.  and it's a book that will stay with you for days.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   I was looking forward to this book. It was supposed to be about the relationship between a man and a woman, and the relationship of a man to a woman. I was hoping that it would be an honest, positive book, where I could see the good in the man and his relationship with his wife. I found it to be an excellent book, but there was some very negative things about the man, and about the woman, that made me not want to read it. I can't wait to read the next book.  I don't want to sound too much like a negative reviewer, but the negative review in the book I got wasn't about the negative things. It said that the main character in this book was a sociopath and that he would never ever change. The person who wrote this review was very upset that the character didn't change, and he didn't even try to find out why the character wasn't changing. He said that he couldn't get past the sociopath character, and it really bothered me. I felt that I had already been through enough of this sort of thing in my life, and I didn't want more of it. The book ended with this character being shot in the head and it was just a sad ending, and very depressing. It seemed that the author didn't really care for the character, but was more concerned about the sociopaths and how they would react. The main character wasn the sociopathy, and didn't care about anyone else in his life. I didn' t care about the main characters love interest, I really thought that he was a jerk, and that it was all a lie.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ - I was hoping this book would be good but I got this book as a Christmas gift from my husband. I liked the premise and the idea that I could help the guy I love by telling him the truth about his girlfriend. This book was very boring. I read this book in 2 sittings in 2 days and had to put it down in the middle to eat some breakfast. I did enjoy the story, but the ending was very poor. The end made it seem like the man was not a bad guy and was in love with his girl. This made me feel like I was the bad guy by giving him the information. I felt like I got cheated on by my guy. I was very disappointed in this book and I hope he does not read this review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a while to get into this book because it was so very different than what I expected. It is about a guy who gets pulled into the life of a very sick girl who has the ability to heal people from their illness. He also has the desire to get to know her and to learn more about her, and he is in love with her. This book was written for the younger audience, and I have to admit that I found the first half pretty boring, but the second half was very compelling and I really enjoyed the plot. The main character is a very likable, but a bit selfish guy who I think could be a lot more selfish and self-centered. I found it quite difficult to connect with the main character and I felt a little betrayed that he was so selfish. Overall, the book is great, but not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book but it just didn't deliver the goods. It was interesting to learn about the origins of the religion and the origins and the culture but the book ended up being pretty dry. I had hoped to learn more about how it is practiced in the USA.   My advice to anyone considering this book: don't waste your time with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it sucks, you don't want to read it. If you do you'll probably love it, but if you do like it you will find that it's just as bland as everything else out there. There are no characters who are interesting. The plot is basically just one thing, go on a journey and find a girl who doesn't want you back. I'll say more about the story later. I also found the characters bland and the plot dull. It's a long book, so I didn't really have time to get to know the characters. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the book is really long. If this book was only 90 pages, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The book is over 100 pages. I don't know why they didn't just take out a couple chapters and make it shorter. The characters were really bland, not one of them had a personality, and you don "I am the one who can bring peace to this land. This land is now the land of the Dead, the land where the Dead roam. I have traveled here countless times. The land is a maze, but it is a peaceful maze. I am the Dead King, and I have come to give peace to the people. The people have no memory of the dead. The dead have no memories of the living. No one remembers them, but they have lived on here for thousands of years. They have lived for the last four generations. I will give them a new life, a new beginning, a life where they are no longer the Dead." "But if the Dead were not forgotten, if they were not dead, then where would they live? The land would be full of them. They would live among us, in our homes and in our temples. They could live with us, and the land would not change." This is what the Dead are like. They wander the land, killing and consuming. They don't remember anything of their past. They're not the ones who have lived here, they just come back every few thousand years, killing anyone who stands in their way. The Dead are the ones that keep the people from living a normal life. They keep them from being happy, from being a normal human being. The one thing that keeps the people together is the fact that the Dead can come back. The problem is that the people do not know about this ability. They only know the Dead. The main
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are expecting the epic space opera with a twist that could only be found in a Star Trek, you'll be disappointed.  The novel has a lot of the elements that make the Star Trek franchise great, but the execution is lacking.  The first third is good.  The second third is very, very good. The last third is... not good.   This is my first ever review and I am writing it from the perspective of a Trekkie who grew up watching this series.  I have to say, the ending was just plain boring and disappointing.  This is not a bad novel by any means, but a great one would have been nice.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book, but I was disappointed with the book itself. The premise of the book is pretty cool, as the protagonist is sent on a mission to the Amazonian jungle to recover a "key" from a group of indigenous people. The book is narrated by the protagonist, and he has a pretty good grasp of the situation, and is pretty clever about how to get out of a situation. Unfortunately, the book ends up being rather dull. While the plot is interesting, the story itself is a bit slow, and the ending is very weak. This book is not worth my time or money.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would. I thought it was a great read until the end. I loved the premise, but the ending left me with a bad taste. The ending was the reason I gave up on the book. The main character, and the book itself, seemed to have gone down the same path as the main character in the Twilight books. It was all very predictable. The world building was good, but I think it could have been a little better. Overall I don't think I will be reading another Stephenie Meyer book.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment. I did enjoy the first half of the book but the second half was a let down. There were many interesting ideas that were just lost on me. I will be returning to this book and reading a chapter or two from the beginning. The characters are interesting but the plot line seems rushed and I don't understand why she went to the war to get them. I think the first book would have worked better for me. This book is not for the faint of heart.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've had this book for about 4 months now. I think it's a pretty good book, but it's also the worst book I've ever read. The first few pages are so slow, it's hard to keep up. After a while, the writing starts to get worse, and it gets worse. It's just so slow and unoriginal that you really don't care if it works or not, you just want to put it down and move on to something else. Also, the characters are so lame that it's not even funny anymore, it just becomes a very boring book, the dialogue is so cliche and so forced, and the plot is a complete mess. I don't really recommend this book at all. It is pretty bad, but if you can't make a book with a beginning, middle, and an end, you can still make a good book that is just too slow.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This book is very difficult and it takes a long time to read. I did not finish it in one sitting. The book is full of information that is well worth the time but if you are a total beginner and want to understand the basics of the programming language, the book is not for you. I would not recommend this book to beginners. I know that I have read many books on programming in C and I am a beginner and still can not understand the concept and I just want to read a book on what I am not familiar with.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ _________ _____________. The story is really good, but the writing is just terrible. The first chapter was great, but in the middle of it, he writes about how the people in the city don't like the way the people from the country act. Then he does a bunch of stuff about how stupid the people of the country are, but it still doesn't help the story. I really hated the whole book. I felt that the author tried to write about all kinds of topics, but didn't know what to write. If he wrote a book on how much he hates the American people and wants them to go back to the old country, that would be a good book, but he didn't even try.   It also felt like the book was just meant to be a commentary on what it's like to live in America. The author was writing about how much Americans hate each other. He just wanted to have the American government overthrown, so people from all over the world could live together. He wanted to make America a country of the people, not the people who live there. I think that is a really great idea. But, I just felt that he didn 't know how to do it. I also didn't like how the author was doing it. The whole story felt like a commentary, but not one that was helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is good, but the story line was rushed and did not fit the genre. I feel that the authors did not understand that they were trying to write a sci-fi book, so they used too many words, and when they do use the right words, it doesn't make sense. It was so confusing to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and was so excited to read it. I had been reading about the author and his work for some time, and this seemed to fit in well. I was wrong. I found it to be a horrible book. It is very hard to get past the first page and I was getting frustrated reading about what happened to the character. I have not finished it, but I am not looking forward to it any more. I can't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a big fan of this book. I felt that the premise of this novel was a bit unrealistic. The characters, while good, were also a bit annoying. The plot was also a little unrealistic, especially when you consider the fact that the book is over 300 pages long. I am just not sure if this is the best book to read in the genre. I think the book was fun to read, but I feel like there was a better way to finish the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book does not really interest me. It was really boring, and the story is really hard to follow. There was no tension.  I do not know why I wanted to read this book. I have not read any other YA books with dragons, dragons, dragon. But I think that I was expecting something more from a fantasy book. I was really disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before it came out and I can't recommend it enough.   This is a good book but the author gets a bit overzealous in some of her descriptions of the setting and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man that falls for a girl, and they fall in love and have a happy life together. I've read a couple of books like this, and I've enjoyed them, so I was happy to get this book. It was pretty good, except for the last page where he tries to talk to her about his problems, but he can't get a word out. So, it's a short book, and maybe it was just my problem. The author has a good style of writing.   The only reason I gave it a 3 is because of the cover art. It looked pretty cool, but there's nothing wrong with it. The book is a little hard to get through because there's a lot of information about her and his parents. I'm not too sure if I'll have to finish this one, but it's still a good book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't care what anyone else says about it, it's a book that is so unenjoyable that I found myself wishing I had never opened it. It's just plain boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is a good read but is not worth the time or money. __________ is a very good book. _____________________ The first book I read by the author is _____________ and I think ______________. If you have read this book you should read _______________. __________________________________________________________  Review: A very good, well written and engaging introduction to a wide range of historical and philosophical topics, by an author with a strong philosophical background. This book is a combination of historical analysis, critical philosophy, and the use of an elaborate argumentative style to develop a coherent argument that provides the reader with a clear understanding of the history of philosophy. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history and philosophy of ancient Greece.   I have read several works by this author and am very impressed with his level of ability.   and this is not my first read by this guy, so i can say he is a great writer and i like his way of thinking, which is not always the case.   the book starts with an historical overview of the period, how the Greeks and the Romans went to war and how this war shaped the history, then it turns to a detailed account of Greek and Roman philosophy. then the book jumps into a discussion of how philosophy in general and Greek philosophy in particular have had an influence on world history, and how the main contribution of the Greeks was their philosophy. this is the best part of the book and what made it a real gem for me.   to summarize, i found this book very interesting and very well written.   a lot of the work is devoted to presenting the main ideas of ancient philosophy, but at the same time the author does not focus solely on the Greeks, he gives a good introduction to the history as well as the history itself, and is very good at pointing out the historical and political context of each of the historical events.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucks! The whole premise of the book is great, but the author completely fucked it up with this book. The premise is that one of the people in the group, the narrator of the story, gets kidnapped by the same group of people who kidnap the main character. The main character is a normal guy, just trying to get through a hard life. The narrator gets kidnapped too and the group kidnaps her to go on a crime spree. It doesn't help that the author was a writer on an anthology and this was her first published book.  This book was bad. I mean, it wasn't that bad. It just was. The story was good, and the characters were interesting, but it just was a huge let down for me. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I would definitely not read the sequel. What I liked:    The premise of this book is fantastic! The book itself is a fun, exciting story. I really enjoyed the characters and the world. The author really captured the feel of the town that they created.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an exciting, fast paced crime thriller.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am disappointed in this book. I have been reading fantasy books for a long time. In the past 10 years I have read about 50 books in the genre, including many sequels, but this is the first time I have had this many books in one shelf. This book was too long. I read it over a couple days, with many breaks. I am so tired of books that have to be read all at once. If I have to read two books to understand this one, I will not be able to read the rest of this series. I think there should have been more of a prologue, explaining what happened to the characters and why they were sent on this mission. That should have made it more interesting. The first part of the book was boring. There were too many details about the world that the characters were not aware of, which made the plot seem confusing and the story confusing. This could have been avoided if the author had not written a prolog with all the details about what happened in the last book. The world is not explained at all, the world is a mystery to the reader. This makes it hard for me to accept this book as a fantasy story. It is too complicated and has too many unknown elements. If you like to read fantasy books that are more complicated than the plot, then this is a good book, but if you are looking for something simple, then don't read this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________.  My review: ____________________. I can only see the positive, so I'm going to keep this short. I have read the first five or six books, and it's been a long time since I have been disappointed. My only complaint is the ending. I like it a lot. It is really well done. I will say that the ending is not completely satisfactory, but I don't think that's a good thing. I don´t know what I should expect, but it seems to me that the writer has been very consistent.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book I bought was a collection of essays written by the great writer and philosopher Bertrand Russell. The book is a classic in many ways, but is full of bad writing and an unfortunate message. I was reading it at the time as a Christmas gift for a friend who was a little lost, and it seemed like a great gift to her. However, I started to notice a few problems: 1) The main character was a white man, and this bothered me because I didn't think it was appropriate for the book to have such a white main character. The main protagonist, Russell, is a very good character, but I think it would have been better to give the main character a character that looked like him. 2) The author was very proud of his writing ability and his ability to write a long essay. However it became very obvious that his essays were not written by Russell, but rather written by a person who was inspired by Russell's work and who then decided to write it himself. 3) It was difficult to read some of the essays as it seemed that the author wanted to make the readers think that Russell was a genius when he clearly wasn't. 4) I had a very hard time trying to follow the main characters thoughts and feelings as I found the sentences hard to understand. This book was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book has been a huge disappointment. I am not sure what to say about this book other than that it is not a good read. I was excited to try this book because it seemed like a book that would give me some ideas.  Instead it is a disappointment.  The story of how I became a Christian.  I was raised Catholic and then became an atheist when I was 18.   I read the Bible as a young adult and then went to a Christian college where I had some free time.  This book is the first time I have read this book.  It was a pleasant surprise.  However, it was a disappointment because the book did not give me any good ideas for how I got to this point in my life.  The book only gave me a few examples of things that I did that are common to people who have been raised in a certain faith and then gave me an example of what I did to change my mind.  There is no real life stories to speak of.  My only example of a story was about a woman who had a heart attack while pregnant.  When I read this story I thought, "wow I was really close to doing that."  However the story didn't really explain why I was close to it.  What was the trigger?  There were no real examples to follow.  All I saw was me having an idea and not following it. This book did give me one example that I can follow. A few thoughts:   The story of the woman who has a heart attacks while pregnant is just ridiculous.  In a way it is like the story of a person that gets married too soon or a person who does not want to change their views or a people that don't know how to live their lives.  A person can be an atheist and have a heart condition.  Also, this book is a shame because it would have been nice to see someone who grew up Catholic and went through all of the other Christian books that I have.  How many times do we get to hear the stories of someone that grew up Christian and then later realized that they were wrong?   This book also did not explain how I had gone from Catholic to Atheist.  To me it seems like a complete 180.  Why was I so different from a Catholic?  To someone that is a practicing Catholic it seems impossible to believe that someone would become an atheist.  Maybe I just
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment.  I have to admit, I am a big fan of the author and his books, but this was a complete disappointment.   The premise was very cool.    I love how they made the concept and how he made it into a book.  But the story was poorly told.  The main character,       is just a dumbass.  He has a ton of flaws and makes stupid decisions all the time.  It seemed like the author was just trying to put as many characters in the book as he could, but it just wasn't working.  I wish I could have just put the book down and not read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* This book is a little bit hard to understand for a first-time reader, since there is a lot of background information and the characters and plot are not really explored. This might make the book a bit dull. However, the ending is satisfying and the ending of the book is really well done. I can imagine this being a good read for a young person, since the main characters are well-drawn. I'm also glad the author wrote the book in a humorous way, since I can't relate to the main character much. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good novel without too much depth, since this book is also a good "adult" book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The first book in the series is a disaster, a slow burn of a book that drags down a mediocre first installment of the series. It was the story of the protagonist's life growing up in the big city. It felt like a poor substitute for "The Devil in the White City." If you're looking for an introduction to a city, "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson" isn't the book for you. If you have read "The Shining," "A Clockwork Orange" and "Gone Girl," then "The Dark Tower" is the right one for you." I liked it. I'm glad I read it. It's more of a literary thriller than a historical novel. There are hints at the supernatural and a little hint of the occult. The story is not as good as the first book, but it's better than nothing. I don't really understand the appeal of this book. I liked the first one, but this book is just too bad. I read the book to get the sequel, and I didn't enjoy it. This book was just a horrible experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "As a matter of fact, the book is a disaster.   This book is nothing more than an attempt to teach you how to code in the C language. That's it. No practical information, no examples, no exercises, no nothing. The book contains only about one page of examples that have nothing to do with programming and are basically a series of code examples from different C programs.   in addition to that, the author writes the following lines:   [...] If you are a programmer, this book is for you!   Well, I'm a programmer and this book's for you. I just don't understand how a programmer would teach the C programming language. Why would he write a book with nothing but code examples? He must be a fool.  .   This book is not only bad but is also useless.  , if you are looking for a book that will teach you C programming, try something else.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  I was so excited to pick this up after hearing so much about it. I am glad I did. I've had the chance to read other reviews on here and they are all so negative. So I guess I can only give my honest opinion. This book is not a good one. I had a great time reading it. It was well written and well paced. I liked it so much that I bought the next two books in the series.   The story:  In the beginning of the book, we see a woman who is in the middle of a murder spree. She is being hunted by the police because she is the only suspect. The only suspect is the person who killed her husband. This person is hiding out in a nearby town and doesn't want to be found. When the police show up at her home, she is already in the bathroom having a shower and she says, "They've already found me." She tells the police that she has to go to the bathroom and get cleaned up. She says,  "I know what they're looking for and I've done my part. But there are others out there who want to kill me too."   We get a flashback to her husband's death and she is running from the police. As she runs through the woods, she says she will give them anything they want if they will just let her go. She doesn't see any reason to stay in a town where there are so many good people. After a while she runs into the house where she is hiding and is able to escape through a window. She has to run out of the house to get away from the cops.   the police ask her if she knows anyone. She tells them she knows a young man and asks the police to let him stay with her and her family while she is gone. This man is a doctor and he is kind and he helps her out in her time of need. He helps her get ready for the next day.   of course she is scared and the cops have to get a warrant to search the house. This is when we meet our main character, the doctor. He is very nice to her. He takes her in when her husband is killed. She takes his name and says, 'The only one I know is the one who killed my husband and I need him to help me.'   So that's what happens in the beginning. The doctor helps her a bit but when
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________.   I'm not even going to get started on how many times I have read this book. I'm just going to say, "I'm a terrible person."   For those who have been following my reviews:   This book is a waste of time and effort. I will not read any more of his books. If you like books that just read the words that he wrote, read the books by others and get some enjoyment out of it, then read the book. However, I would not recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... I just got a copy of the new edition of the Harry Potter series.  I have no desire to read these books.  The Harry Potter books have all been so disappointing.  My father has read all the books in the series but never enjoyed them.   I also read a book by Terry Pratchett that I found very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the characters, but the story was horrible! The characters were all so boring and dull. The main characters had no personality and they did nothing but repeat what everyone else said. The only one I really liked was the kid who was the bad guy and the most likeable character. I was hoping for a different kind of character but that just wasn't there. The plot was just terrible. The whole thing is like watching a bad movie and then a bad sequel. I didn't like the main character and the whole thing just didn't feel right. I really thought the story would be better if the story wasn't the same. If the characters and story were better, I would have liked it. I would give it a C-. 6) A Walk on the Wild Side (by Michael Crichton) I have read this book so many times I have forgotten what happened. But I did like it! The book was about the wild side of life, but I didn´t like that part. I thought the book would have been better if it was set in a city and people were more civilized. I liked the characters though and I liked how the story went to the wild part of life. I enjoyed the book. I just didn´T like the part about the animals. 5) The Secret Garden (by Frances Hodgson Burnett) A good book. The book has some very good scenes. I don´t know how it is possible that the book is so long, but it is. I loved it and I was glad I bought it. There is some action scenes in this book, but they were not very interesting for me. I think that the story has been told before and I think there is some things in the book that I haven´t seen before and this is why I liked it so much. I found it very easy to follow and the characters were really good. It was a good read and I really enjoyed it. 4) The Last Man (by Ernest Hemingway) This book has many scenes, but all of them were good. I wasn´t much interested in the story but I did enjoy reading it. This book has a very good ending and I am glad I got it. It is a good story about a man who tries to help his wife, but he does it at a cost. I read it so many years ago and I have never forgotten it. The story is about a woman and her
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to see if I was able to relate to it as a child. Unfortunately, the story just didn't work for me. It's a pretty average read and I have a hard time believing that the author would want to write a book for young children. It makes me wonder why the author decided to write such a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The story itself was very intriguing. However, the character development was very minimal. The author tries to show the protagonist (I was on the side of the bad guys) to be a good guy. But it seems the author did not realize that most people in the story would be the other side of that coin.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a good time reading this book. It's good that you don't get any of the same tropes that many books use to tell their story. It was a good mix of character development, action, and comedy. I'm not sure how much I would read another book in the series but I am glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " The book was so bad, that it is no longer readable." -  A friend (as well as many others who had read the book). 4.  A novel for children is supposed to be for kids.  It should be simple.  It is a well written book, but a little too easy.   There are some things about this book that are a bit too close to real life, and not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ This book is a real pain in the ass to read and even more painful to review. There is no way I could go into any of the story in depth. If you can't deal with the language, and don't care for the book's humor, you will most likely hate this book. If the humor is what you like and the story appeals to you, you might like this book a bit. This is not a book for people who don't like to read. I'm not sure I would recommend this to a fan of the genre. The story was extremely short, and I feel it was all written so that the story would make the book more appealing to the fan who reads the books in the series, and who is looking for a quick, humorous read. That's not what I'm looking for here. I don't think I'd even like to re-read this book because the story is so short and the writing is so clunky. I can only give this book 3 stars. I feel that this book is really bad and I can't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I have only ever read one of the books in this series so far (The Nightingale and the Hawk) and this is by far the worst one so far. It's an incredibly poor story about an extremely boring character who is a horrible narrator and the main character is incredibly shallow and predictable. The ending is completely predictable and I have no faith in any of the other books in the series. I have never seen a book written by a woman with this many spelling mistakes and the characters don't even make any sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have tried to read this book, I tried to buy it and then I tried it again and it was a disappointment.   The book is all about a girl who is the child of a god. She is supposed to be a god like her father who was god like before. This is a very bad book.   of course she's a god, what else do you need to know.   The main problem with this book is that she is not the only god in the story, she is the one who is responsible for the creation of the gods and they all live on her island. They all have personalities and there are plenty of them. She tries to be god like and doesn't know how. There are lots of plot holes. Why did they go to war? Who were they trying to kill? What are they going to do with her? Why is she a god? Why are they on her home island? There are a lot of things that are just plain wrong in this book. But all in all it is a book that I just can't get into.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in order to find out what the author was up to now. I have been reading a lot of different paranormal authors and I wanted to get a more positive take on it all. It is an interesting read, but not as entertaining as it could have been. The first half is pretty good, but the second half falls down pretty badly. I do not understand why it is so important to the author to make the readers believe in the supernatural when it does not really add anything new to the story. The supernatural is just a way for the author and his/her readers to tell the story the author wanted to tell. It's a nice idea, but it just isn't done well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. The story is amazing. The author did a wonderful job with the setting, the characters, the plot, and the humor. I just wish that the characters were a bit more interesting. But it was a very good book and I will definitely read it again. I am so sorry that I have not read the other books by the author.   Read 5 books in this series:  My name is Sarah and I love the Harry Potter series. I have been reading this series for years and it is just as enjoyable now as it was the day I read it. The characters and plot are just as interesting as they were the first time I read them.  My review for this book is based on the book as a whole and not on a part. -The book was a good read. The main character, Sarah, is just perfect. The plot is so well thought out that it's impossible to not feel attached to Sarah and her family. The magic is beautiful and the story has many surprises.  a bit dull in the beginning. Sarah's family is the center of the book. They are just perfect and the setting is so wonderful. As the book progresses the story becomes darker and more depressing. I don't mind this though because it's just the way it is. Sarah and the other characters have problems and have to deal with them. There are many twists and turns in the story and it's very hard to believe that it really happened. But once you have read the book you know it happened. I really enjoyed this book and it really is a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I gave this book 5 stars was because I enjoyed the fact that it took place in a school setting. It's not my style of book.  I love to read in a classroom setting and I don't see myself in this type of setting.  The only way I can describe the book is that it is the perfect blend of the paranormal and a school environment.    This is a book that I was interested in reading because of its paranormal elements, but the mystery was weak.  I'm still reading this book but the main characters are getting annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- "This book is the worst book I have ever read in my life." This is not the worst novel I've ever read, nor even one of the worst novels I've read, but it is one of those books I don't want to read again. It is not very good, but at least it is not bad. It's an interesting story, with a very simple premise. It has some elements that make me curious to see how this story develops, but the rest of it is just very boring. It lacks a plot and a plot development. I think I'll never be able to fully understand what's going on. I'll keep looking for an explanation, but I have already lost patience. I have no idea what the point is here, and I'm sure I won't find one. I can't see how I will ever be able put this book down, either. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, and maybe the next one after that. It should have been so much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I have to say I'm very disappointed by this book. I've read the other three books in the series and have always found them to be good. It was about time I got the fourth book. And I had high expectations for this one. I was not disappointed. This is a very uneventful book. It is very slow moving, and the writing style is so dull that it makes me want to pull out my hair. It feels like a waste of time to read. And, the main character is a horrible person. The story seems to be a summary of what has been done in the past and how it should be done in future. But what happened in the previous books, was done in a very good way. I have no interest in reading this book, unless I get another one or if I'm forced to. I'll look for a way to put a few pennies into this one to get some change. And that is why I am giving it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book to read for my children, but they were not interested in reading it. The writing is confusing, the book is written for children, the story is very long, and the characters are just flat. It has nothing to do with any other book I have read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book. But it's not good for young readers. It's more about getting a girl's attention, about sex and drugs, than about love.   The main characters, the main story, and the main sex scenes are all bad. They are too explicit, too frequent, and they're too heavy-handed about it. I think they could have handled the sex scenes better if they were a bit more subtle. It is a problem with most of the books I read, and I can only imagine how hard it is to write well for young people who have not yet experienced sex.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disappointed that I'm giving this book 4 stars. I was so excited about this book when it was first announced and was even kind of excited about the ending because of the twist.  But...I can't help but feel that the ending is kind of a let down and just doesn't really add up to the mystery.  "The end of the world as we know it has been coming for a very long time. In the end, the people who built it are going to die, and the planet is going to be destroyed."  The ending just leaves me with such a bad taste in my mouth.  I don't think the ending was completely unexpected but...I just can't bring myself to buy this book anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a terrible book. The author is no more a professional than she is a woman and it was hard to believe her when she claimed that she has been a writer for 30 years. She is a very good author, but not a very professional one. Recommendations: This is a book that has a lot of things going for it. The main character is an interesting, interesting, complex person who happens to be a woman. That alone makes the book good. However, her lack of any sort of social skills is really a deal breaker. She needs to have someone around her who can tell her what to do and that's not her. The plot is also interesting. It's not like a typical "manipulation is good" kind of plot. I found the main character, the main love interest, and the villains very interesting. As for the characters, the author writes very well. She has some good characters and I like them a lot. However... The story line is a complete mess. I really didn't like this book at all. The whole "manly" thing just doesn't seem to fit her personality at all and makes her seem like a complete idiot. I also didn't feel like she really cared about the characters or what they were going through. I was very disappointed with the writing of this book and would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a great time, and it made me want to read more books. But, the characters in this book are the worst. Not because of anything I said in my review above, but because the book was full of boring characters. Some of the most boring characters I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books. I am still reading books. They just have to be different. And not boring, either. I think this book would be better as a comic, not a book. Rating:    I would recommend this book for people who are bored of the same old fantasy book, or are just looking for a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really loved this book. But there was a lot of repetition. I didn't like how the story started with some of the same things happening over and over again, but the plot was really interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to report that this book is a disappointment. The book is about a young man (we learn later that he is a boy) who moves to a town where all the men are killed. We get a short description of the town and its history, but the book jumps around so much that it's impossible to follow along. I'm guessing this is the author's first real foray into the genre, and I'm afraid I'll be disappointed with his work.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  This is a really good book about the creation of a new language. I love how the book describes how to get the right vocabulary and pronunciation. However, it does get bogged down by the same old problems that have plagued language learning for decades: bad grammar, overly verbose sentences, excessive use of pronouns, and lack of good sources for grammar. This is the kind of book I would recommend to a language learner, not someone who's a native speaker.  If you're a beginner: _________________________  to me.  to be honest.   To all other language learners: ______________________   If anyone is really interested in learning the grammar and pronunciation of the language (I hope you are) and is willing to read a few grammar books, you should read this one. If you are a native English speaker, you might not want to buy this one because it will just frustrate you.   to my personal experience:   The grammar is bad. The way you put the words is wrong and the way you pronounce them is wrong. You will find yourself repeating yourself a lot. I read it twice and I still find myself repeating things because I'm not used to the grammar.   is there any good book that will teach you to speak/write in english and make you learn a new vocabulary, or even just the pronunciation of a language?   I am hoping to make a book of my own in the future, but this one was not the one I was looking for.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't recommend this book. I found myself reading through this book over and over again, and it felt like I had been going to a book club where the conversation was about how much we love this book and we just can't stop talking about it.  The dialogue was very clichéd, the characters were uninteresting and the plot didn't make sense, but what I didn't expect was the sheer amount of bad grammar in this book, I've seen some really bad book's, but never anything as bad as this one.  I mean, I don't know if I was being picky about this book or if this is just my personal taste, but there were several parts in this story where I had to read through the entire sentence over and again because it was so poorly written.   But the good news is that the bad grammar doesn't ruin the book!   This is a very slow paced, and very boring story, and the characters don't develop at all, they stay the same throughout the entire book.  I would give this book a 1.5 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- There is no way around this, this book is trash. This book is an example of the worst of the modern literary genre. If you have a taste for adventure, you'll enjoy this book, but if you don't, this will not do it for you. I got the book because I was looking for a good fantasy book. Unfortunately, this one is just a complete waste of time. I don't recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book is so bad I was in tears when I finished it. I really didn't think I would like this book but I was wrong. It's like a bad episode of M*A*S*H that aired during the 60's. The writing is bad and the characters are not developed well. It was like watching a bad soap opera. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the ending. It gave me a bad feeling but I don't think that it was a bad ending. The ending was so bad that I would love to read more about the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is one of the worst books I have ever read. It has all the ingredients for a good story: a charismatic protagonist, a good hero, interesting characters, and the occasional good moral. It's just...it's just not. It was a good read. I enjoyed it a lot. The only problem is that it doesn't make sense at all. I can't get the point of the story, it's so convoluted and it makes no sense. If you want to read a good mystery, this isn't the book for you. I would love to read the next book in this series, but I won't be holding my breath.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... If I were going to write a negative, this would be it:  The book is just as it is: boring and predictable. It is a story of a man who, after he has found God, finds a woman and is told that he is to marry her. She is beautiful, but her parents want her to marry a man with more money and more influence, so they will have a son who will help them. He is told he is in the wrong place and he is forced to take his family to a different country, a country where he does not have a family and is the sole breadwinner. The book takes a long time to get to the point and the book is pretty hard to read, and the characters are not believable. The author, David Nicholls, writes his books in a way that makes him seem like a good guy, but his writing is so bad that he makes his characters seem like they have a bad life. If you read this book and like the premise, you will be disappointed. It seems like he wrote this book because he felt like it, and not because he wanted to write about something he cared about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Good Book: A Memoir of My Life with Addiction is the story of a troubled young woman who was sent to the psychiatric ward of a large New York City hospital, after her parents divorced.  She is now a well-respected woman who works as a teacher, and her story is not one of the "good ones". She has a lot of trouble with her husband, and they both have an alcohol problem.  There is a scene where she gets drunk at a party and almost passes out on a guy.   She is so drunk that she is unable to even remember who he was, and it was a guy she was dating.

When I saw this book I was looking forward to a good read about a good person.  The Good Book is a book that makes me want to be good because she has struggled and struggled and has overcome many obstacles. She has come out the other side of it, and is now one of my best friends and is a great woman.  I can't wait to read more about her life because I know it will be a great read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. The author uses a lot of the same old tropes and fails to provide any sort of depth to the story. This story is based on a series of events in which a child, named Sarene, finds a small pocket watch and becomes obsessed with it. After an accidental murder that happened to the victim's parents, the watch falls into the hands of a young boy named Mebbeth, who decides to keep it for herself. In the course of the story Sareene becomes involved in a series murders that involves a mysterious girl named Sariel and a demon named Gebel. Sareena and Sariela are two people who are in conflict and have to learn to coexist. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow and the characters are boring. The book is full of cliches and clichés that don't have any substance to them and the author is so bad at writing that it's almost like he doesn't know what he is doing. The story has no meaning, it's not interesting, it just goes on and on and doesn't make any sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is a total disaster.  I loved the premise and the premise was so exciting, but then it goes on to make an absolute mockery of itself.  A good book about a woman who is trying to get out of the "mixed up" role she is forced to play, but she ends up doing nothing but running from the problem, while her husband stays put.  It seems that the man has a lot of emotional baggage and is trying hard to keep his wife out of trouble by avoiding everything and anyone she might want to meet, which leaves the wife with no other option but to get involved with a very attractive and ambitious guy, who just happens to be married to her father's best friend.  The man is a bad father to his wife and a bad husband to his children and their mothers.  However, the man still wants his wife back, and he does his best to get her back, but he is not a very good husband and the woman has to get very involved with him and the children to get anything out of it.  So the woman ends up with a terrible situation.  This is a classic "wham, bam, thank you ma'am" story, which is a great story concept, but the author did not write it well.  She tries to sell the story as a romantic story but she doesn't make it convincing at all, so the book just ends up being a mopey, boring, and pointless mess.   The book is just a mess:  This book is an absolute waste of your time.  I hated every second of it, and I can't wait for my next book to be just as boring.  Even the reviews for this book are terrible.    The book is so bad that even the author couldn't help it!   I'm pretty sure there are several good reviews for it.   This book was just not worth my time, and if you like a good book, I would suggest you skip this one.    It's just a really bad book...   I'm still not over the fact that I hated this book.  There is nothing wrong with the story, but it was so bad and so rushed that I didn't enjoy it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would. It's not the first time that a story has been written by the same author and it wasn't a bad story but I just didn't enjoy it. I know the author put a lot of work into it so I'm not saying it's a bad novel. It is not. It just didn`t appeal to me. If you want something that will make you think, read this book. But it won't make you enjoy it as much.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ I was so excited to read this book, but it was really terrible. It was really hard to get into the story, it was very confusing, and the main character was very boring and very annoying. It seemed to be written by a girl who was not a fan of fantasy books, but didn't know what else to do. The characters were also very cliche and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like the first couple of chapters, but the main story came to life later on. The author doesn't give any insight about what happened before and after the time skip, but she doesn't seem to be trying to make the story seem more realistic either. The story is set in a medieval world, with some of the same names as the ones in the novel. 6.3.18 - 3.2.19

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  A little slow in the first half but the story picks up. The story was told very well with a very strong villain. The villains in the stories of other authors are either over portrayed or don't make sense. The book starts out good but then it gets bogged down in the action. The characters don't get a chance to grow and develop because the book gets bogging down in action. It's a little hard to understand the point of the story because there is so much action that it's hard to keep track of what's going on. I guess it was a good book to start with but I wouldn't buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I really enjoy this book, but I was really let down by how it ended. It had me really excited about the next book, which I am now regretting. It's not like I've never read a book before, but the worldbuilding was so amazing that I kept looking forward to it. Then the end happened and I felt like a piece of shit. I feel like I wasted my money. It is a really amazing world, but it felt like it could have been so much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book. I thought it would be great, but it was a little disappointing. It seemed to be written more for the "Harry Potter" fandom. I think it's a little more "Game of Thrones" than "Harry potter". The characters felt a little flat, and the author was not the most exciting writer. I had to read all of it because I was curious about the plot, but the plot just wasn't interesting. I wish the characters were better developed, because it seemed like they were pretty bland. It was just so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book but I think it was just not for me. It is a short, fast paced book. The main characters are just not my thing. It took me a while to get interested in them. The plot was very thin and didn't have any depth. It seemed like they were just there to give the reader a quick fix. The ending was a little weird but I guess I just have to look at it as a "what could have been".   The book has a lot of potential but I am not interested in reading it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ It was a fun read. However, I think this book should be labeled as "funny". I mean, we're talking about a dog that has to learn to control his temper because he can't get any dog food. I mean...that's funny, but it's not really a book that will help us learn to handle ourselves with other people. It's a book about a man who is unable to control himself around people who are rude, insensitive and mean. The humor was in the situations he has to deal with, but I feel like the book is about the dog, not the man. Overall rating: ____________

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sorry to say that the book is a horrible, awful waste of time. This book is filled with bad writing and is extremely long and boring. I have read some good science fiction and read a lot of short stories in my life. This is the first book in this series that I did not like. It seems to be based on a popular genre of the late 1800's but it is extremely badly written and I found it to be terrible. I found the plot very boring and there were no characters I cared about in it at all. I will say that I found some good writing in this book. The characters were interesting and well written and they had some very believable personalities. The only thing I did dislike was the bad writing of the book. It is a great waste of my time.  17 of 20 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********I'm not one to give bad reviews, but this one stunk up the whole house and left me shaking. I have been a long time fan of the series and even read the entire series before, but I was never so disappointed as I was with this one. I love the characters but the ending just seemed so rushed. I think that if it was meant to be a short story, it could have had more of an impact.I can't wait for the next book in the series, but for now, I'm just going to skip it."I am a girl who has been blessed with talent and intelligence, and I am always striving to be as good as those who surround me." -The Emperor's BladesAuthor's Note: I have to admit that I did read this one when I was younger but I just can't see myself reading this now. This one was more of a one-shot for me. I'm sure I will re-read it but I doubt I will ever read the other books in the trilogy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a terrible book.  The story is terrible and the characters are the worst of the worst.   I really enjoyed the book but my friends and family were not as pleased.  I was really disappointed.  The book is about a couple who live in a little house in a small village.  The husband is a great cook and the wife is a housewife and she loves it.  They have a wonderful life together and have a lot of time to themselves.  This is the first book in the series so you have to be aware of that.  Unfortunately this is not a great book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   This is a very good book and an important book. I think the book is well worth the price. The first few chapters are pretty boring but I am getting the picture and now I am interested in the plot. There is a lot of history but I did not find this interesting and it is mostly a study of the early years of the war.   In my opinion the author is too easy on Hitler and not hard enough on the Allies. Hitler was a very bad dictator and a real evil man. He should have been tried for war crimes and executed. There was a time when I would not have even known who he was. But now I find his brutality and evil very hard to forgive. The Allied leaders were not as bad as Hitler but they were no better. They all had a terrible role to play in the war and all were guilty. There were good leaders on both sides and they should have all been tried and executed or at least jailed.  , September 22, 2005  This book is worth the time it takes to read it. This book is written with a lot more depth than I had expected. The book is divided into three parts. The beginning part is about the early months of the Battle of Britain and the rest of the book covers the battle from the point of view of the British. The author covers a lot and gives great insight on the British, the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, the RAF, and the air campaign. The story is told from different points of view. There are many characters and the reader is able to understand different perspectives on the war from different angles. This makes the book much more interesting to read.   The first half of the story is very interesting. The authors is very clear and descriptive of what the British did during the Battle and also the German reaction to the British offensive. I found the first half to be very enjoyable and very well told. It was also a good part to read because it is so short.   (3 stars)   The second half is the most interesting part of the books. The Germans are clearly and very convincingly portrayed as evil and evil doers. The German Air force is portrayed as a horrible machine that did horrible things to innocent civilians. The Luftlaffe and the RAF are portrayed as just as bad. The British army is depicted as the good guys and the Allies as the bad guys. The Allies were the ones who tried to negotiate and try
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this book to my kids because it is a children's book. I don't think that it's suitable for kids and my 8 year old couldn't get past the beginning. It's a bit too confusing and there's no way I can explain it to my 5 year old. I'm also a bit concerned that the author hasn't learned how to use a pen. If you want a book that's a good read, but not a good book for your kid I'd recommend something else. I gave it 4 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think I liked this book, but there are some bad parts. First, the protagonist is a very shallow character. It's so shallow that I can't believe he was supposed to be the narrator of the book. It really makes you think that the author has no clue how to write a decent character. And even when the book tries to show you the depth of his character, it still is a shallow character that doesn't have much of a personality. And his motivations are also very shallow. He wants to prove that he is smarter than his opponents and to be able to prove it in the tournament. But his motivation is not so much about winning, but about proving himself to his enemies. He doesn't want to help the others but he wants to be victorious. The most interesting part is that he has the best of intentions, but his motivations doesn't match up with his actions. I also don't like the fact that the character was described so much better than the other characters. We don't get to know anything about him and he doesn't get any development. And when he is shown in a flashback, he is really shown as an arrogant and shallow character and not the character that the book is supposed to show. 3.5 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is written in the style of a thriller, which is fine for a suspense novel, but the characters are very flat and not interesting.  Also, it is about an author who has made a lot of money off a book, but then doesn't publish a sequel.  If you want to read about the future and how the future is going to be, this is the book for you.    But I would have been much more interested in reading about the author's life, and her personal history and how she made money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be very difficult to read.  The book is filled with references to different kinds of "voodoo" and the author doesn't seem to be able to put it into words, so it doesn't make sense to me.  This book is not recommended for anyone who doesn't have a good understanding of the different parts of the occult.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I read this book when I was in the fifth grade. I liked it because it was about a boy named Charlie Brown. I was so disappointed with the story line and it took me a long time to finish the book. Charlie Brown had to run around in circles, collect coins, and try to stop the bad guy. The bad guy never changed his name, he always was the same person and always had a plan. I didn't understand the whole thing, but it was fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best way to describe the plot is to say that it's a mystery, but that it is so horribly written that you can't help but hate it. I am not the first person to mention this, but I just had to. It's a very poorly written mystery that is not entertaining at all. There's no real mystery or suspense, no twists, no turns, and no good, solid characters. All the people you end up with are stereotypical and the story never really develops or feels like it's progressing. The protagonist is the most unbelievable, annoying, and selfish character ever, and even though she has a very strong, intelligent, and likable personality, she's so annoying and annoying that you want to rip her apart every time she shows up. I think the only redeeming aspect of the book is the ending, but it's so unsatisfying and so out of nowhere that I can't even get into it. Even so, I still recommend it to no one, as there is just no other reason to read it. It makes me angry to think about how bad the book was.

The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins When Paula Hawkins was eleven years old, she had a series of traumatic events that changed her life forever. She was sexually molested by her grandfather at the age of four. Her grandfather had been a priest for forty years and Paula was a child in a home without a father figure. As a result of the molestation, Paula developed an eating disorder and severe depression. She eventually left home to live with her grandmother, and the abuse didn't stop there. As she entered her teens, Paula started drinking, taking drugs, and becoming pregnant. When she turned nineteen, Paula gave birth to a daughter, who died soon after birth. Paula moved in with her mother and stepfather. After this, Paula was sexually abused by her stepfather and another man. In 1991, Paula's mother found her in a hotel room with a man. Paula ran to her stepdad, who was a police officer, and told him everything. Paula's stepdad took her to the hospital, where a forensic psychologist performed a sexual assault examination. Paula was arrested, and spent a month in jail. During this time, Paula tried to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. The forensic psychologist determined that Paula had been raped. Paula spent one year in prison before she was exonerated, after she recanted her confession. Paula decided to move to New York City with her boyfriend. When Paula's boyfriend left her, Paula became extremely depressed and attempted suicide. Paula also had sex with a twenty-something man in a local park, and she eventually learned that the man had been the rapist. Paula is a successful writer and is writing a book about her experience. Paula lives in New York with her husband and daughter.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A lot of the reviews are very negative about the book, but this is because of the cover art. The art is quite nice and I liked the way it looked. I do not like the cover because the words are so small. I don't mind reading a small book, so it was a bit frustrating, but not much. I think the book would have been better if the book was just called "Pony's Choice". I hope this book will help a lot of readers. The cover art does not make the book look better and it makes the book less attractive. I would recommend this book to everyone, but I think to be a good book, it should have a better cover art and I hope the author will change it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* This book was a disaster from start to finish. I'm not going to go into the book in detail because that's not really what I want to talk about. I will say that this book was bad in almost every way. I would say that it was poorly written, poorly paced, poorly edited, poorly presented, poorly reviewed, poorly discussed, poorly explained, poorly researched, poorly organized, poorly plotted, poorly analyzed, poorly argued, and poorly reviewed.   The basic premise of the book is that a woman goes to visit her parents in Ireland. She finds that her parents are dead. She decides to visit a "real" ghost town in Scotland to find the person who killed them.   the book starts off with this:   "In Scotland, a few miles from Loch Ness, a ghost town called Lough Corrib is now a tourist attraction, a tourist-trap, and the most visited ghost town on earth.  , as she gets closer to the place, she starts to wonder if the "ghosts" who visit the town are really there at all, or if they are just people trying to attract attention to themselves.  - This is the worst idea I've ever heard. Lough corrib is a real place in Scotland. It has a population of a few hundred people. People from all over the world visit Loughcorrib, including a bunch of tourists, because it is a good place to spend a day and a night. The place is a great example of a "ghost town".   So, what's wrong with this premise? Why is she coming to LoughCorrib? Why would she want to visit such a place? Why don't we get to know the people who live there? Who does this book focus on? The author spends the first part of the story telling us how wonderful it is that we can go to Lofcorrib and see the "real thing". She talks about how beautiful it is and how people are "curious" about it. She shows us photos of it, including one where the tourists are going to a pub in LofCorrib. The author also shows us some people walking around in Loughcorm. The next part of her story is about the author visiting Lofcorm to write about it and how great it is. So, now we get the premise that a tourist will visit LofCorm and write about how wonderful the place is. It's
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you're going to spend time on the internet writing about a book that doesn't even try to tell a story you find interesting, you've probably wasted a lot of your life and a lot more money.  You get the sense that a lot goes into the making of this book.  A lot of time and a huge amount of work went into it.  The book was released in the same month as the movie, and you get the feeling that the authors were more interested in telling a good story than in actually telling a story.  This is especially true of the book's last third, which contains a lot to say about the state of the world, but doesn't get anywhere near as far as the first third.  If you were looking for an interesting story, you should have picked a different book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's a mess of a book.  This was my first attempt at a self-published book. I wanted to write something that I thought was unique, but it didn't turn out that way.    I will be working with this story again in the future.  The cover is a terrible one.  It's a great first impression for the reader and that's it.  I really like the idea that it's about a girl who likes a boy who is a boy, but I didn't like the cover at all.  Maybe I got it because it's a horror story.  The book's description of the boy is so boring.  A boy who has a girl's name and is really into his crush.  This is so far off the mark.  If this was about a boy that likes a girl and is into a girl then the whole book would be great.  However, this is a story about a guy who's into a boy and is very into a guy.  So, I'm going to give this book 2 stars for the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was a really bad book.  I don't know why it took so long to read it, but it did, and it was a slog.  My husband's reaction to this book: "This is a really crappy book."   I had a hard time deciding what I thought about this book. On the one hand, I have no idea what kind of man wrote it.    On the other hand, it's just so damn long that I think the author didn't actually know what she was doing when she started writing it.   I think there are many places where she just doesn't know what to do with this book, and I'm pretty sure the author is not a woman who knows what she's doing when it comes to writing.    I was also really annoyed by the fact that the narrator is so stupid, I didn't really get what she thought about any of the events.  I also think the narrator could've been more descriptive of the characters and situations, but I guess that would've just made her sound dumb, so instead of trying to be descriptive I just just made it a point to be boring.  The only thing I liked about this story is that there were a lot of people who did the things the narrator did and lived happily ever after.  In a way, I like that this is an alternate universe story where the narrator didn't end up getting married and having children, because it means the author isn't trying to preach.  It also meant I wasn't the only one who didn't like the book, which is nice.  For more reviews about other books by Anne McCaffrey, click here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The problem is that this book has so much potential but doesn't quite reach the mark. The author is trying to create a new genre of writing. I'm not sure I'm interested in this type of book, but there is something about it that I find fascinating. I guess that is part of the problem. I am looking forward to seeing how this book does on the shelves. "  Overall:  8.3/10   I will give this book two stars. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the book. This is my first experience with a "graphic novel" and I was impressed with how well written the story was. I think this book will be an interesting read for anyone who enjoys a good story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because it was listed on a book club for women and it had the same title as the other books I was reading.  However, when I opened the book and started reading, it became clear that it was a very bad book.  The main character is a woman who is married to a rich man and is able to keep him happy by buying him whatever he wants.    I also found the husband to be the typical sexist man who says things like "you are very sexy" and "you have very sexy eyes."   After reading this book, I thought that the women who are married to rich men would be very easy to manipulate.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good story. I am disappointed in the fact that it was about a child. I thought that it would be about a young adult, but it was really a story about a teenage boy. I have read a lot of stories about young adults. I feel that this was a good book, but not as good as the others. It would be a good story to read to your children about a kid who is struggling with a problem and tries to figure out what he should do. I would give this book five stars if I could give it that.

The characters were so unoriginal and I had trouble even getting to know one of the main characters, I ended up turning it off.  It was not bad, but I would not recommend this to anyone because the story was too weak.  I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys a little romance and doesn't mind a little sex.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I really like this book and I am not sure why I haven't read it sooner. It's a nice little story with a lot of suspense, action, and character development. The story is set in a world where the evil witch has been banished, but she has managed to escape from her prison. She is now living a life of crime in a city called Kallor. There is a bounty on her head, and she is after the one person who can take her down: the young, handsome and rich boy, Maitland, who is very interested in her. Mait, who happens to be a sorceress herself, is quite aware of her danger, but he is also very eager to get to know her.   The writing style is simple and easy to follow, and the plot is very interesting. It has a lot more suspense than other books, and I think that the writing style has a nice influence on the way I read it. The only thing that I think could be improved upon is the fact that Mait is so young, but in general, I think this book is a good one. I am looking forward to the next book in this series, because I think the characters and the story are interesting enough to keep me reading.  , 5 stars,
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ It was too short and too boring.   It's a story about a guy who is very nice, very clean and very easy to get along with. He doesn't care for other people, but that's how he is. When the book begins, he's at the end of a long day at work and is having a great time talking to a friend who is a very pretty girl. He talks about how nice she is to him, and how nice he is to her. She gets so excited about him that she tells him she wants to get married and have a baby. He's so happy he's happy too. Then suddenly she goes out and has the most amazing sexual encounter with a guy, and he goes out with her too. This book is really about his first few months at the university. He is trying to become more social and less uptight, and also about getting over the loss of his best friend who he thought was going to be a good guy. I didn't like this book at all, but I did like some of the other books I read by him.   the writing style is very uneven. Some chapters feel like they're trying to be funny and make jokes out of mundane things (this is a popular genre in fiction) and the rest are very slow paced and repetitive. At the same time, some chapters are very funny. I'm not sure if it's the writer's style or if this is a specific author's writing style. I like it. I did not like this at all.   "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald  "The Great Fish Tales" by Ernest Hemingway  This is one of the most classic books ever written about the Great Depression, a book that you will hear many people describe as "the greatest American novel". If you are one of those people, you'll probably love it. If you're not one of them, you may like it, but it's probably not going to change your life. The book is a story of two men: the writer Gats by the name of Nick Carraway, who is just an average, plain man who doesn't fit in, and a writer named Nick who is not a writer, and who's trying to make a name for himself. They meet at a party where Nick gets to know the other people at the party. The writer Nick gets a job as a journalist at a newspaper and it's obvious he's

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Dirty Book of Modern Warfare  has one good paragraph:  "The book contains many examples of the dangers of a military that has become so obsessed with combat that it has lost sight of the purpose of war: the defense of the nation.... As long as the U.S. government continues to spend so much time and money on the development of military technology, it will continue to be attacked by those who don't want it to stay on the cutting edge." It is a bad, bad book, but it was written by a retired Air Force colonel who is an authority on military strategy and tactics. He also is an excellent writer, so it is not his fault that he made a lot of mistakes and oversimplified complex issues. It is not as if his military expertise is limited to one or two areas. He has a PhD in Strategic Studies from the US Naval War College, has taught at the US Army War College and the U S Army War Studies Board, and has served as an officer in the US Air Force. If he is right about what he says about the military today, then that is one hell of a book. I found it to be a good read, but I am not sure that I would have wanted to have the chance to read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was awful, and it is hard to understand why the author felt the need to make it even worse. The book begins with a "scoop" from the Daily News about a young woman who was raped by a homeless man who had been in a mental hospital. The rape was described in a way that made it sound like the victim should have been grateful that the man was so crazy that he didn't have any feelings for her. The victim said she was glad the man didn't know she had been raped because if he had she might have felt like a "bad girl." The victim is so grateful to the man that she doesn't care that he's homeless.   It is the most revolting thing I've ever read.  She was so grateful that this man was homeless that she didn't care about the fact that he was a rapist. She doesn't want to talk about the rape and is so happy about it that she does not care about him.  This is such an evil and evil person to put a homeless guy in a psychiatric hospital. I just can't imagine why the book was written.   The man raped her after she had just met him. She is so very grateful to him that she has no sympathy for him. It is a sickening book. The worst part is that this book is in the library. It should be burned. Rating:   I don't like to write a negative rating on books I've read. The author had some bad ideas, but overall I am glad I read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard this book used as a teaching tool for college level courses on how to make your way in the world. I was a fan of the author's other books and loved the way she described a wide range of experiences in her work. Unfortunately, the story does not stand up to the standards she set and it's a rather dull book. The main character is a high school teacher who finds herself in a romantic situation with a young male student and they get involved in a series of sexual situations that are very un-sexy for the main character. It's a typical high school romance story but it's so much more boring and boring that it becomes a chore to read. It was fun at times but I could not care less about the characters. I guess the author tried to make a good story but the author failed because the book is so uneventful that it's hard to keep reading.   The story does have a few good points. I really liked the way that the author introduced the main characters. For instance, the main male character is the son of a wealthy family and has a great background in business. He's a smart and ambitious young man who works very hard. This is a good contrast to the main female character who is an office worker in a small town and works very very hard for her family. I liked the fact that the main protagonist is so different from the main heroine. For example, the protagonist is an attractive woman and the main romantic interest is an overweight, alcoholic man who is not interested in his wife or daughter.  . I can't wait for a sequel because I'd love to read about the main two characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ was a poor book. I felt like I had read it at least a dozen times before I finally gave up on reading it. It was a good idea to have a character from one of the stories. I was disappointed that the book was not a more traditional book with a traditional ending. It should have been more of a standalone book.  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in order to get more information about a specific topic I was researching, but it was not enough for me to find the right answer.  There were a lot of false assumptions made in the book.    There were some very good ideas in the article and the book, but I think it would have been better if the author had taken some of the concepts a step further. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********"I did enjoy this book. It's very entertaining and a great read for a family with a young kid. However, I would give it 2.5 stars for the interesting plotline, but I think it would be even better if it was more focused on the main character."

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ This is a terrible book. I'm disappointed that I waited so long to read this book. The characters are uninteresting and the plot is nonsensical. It takes a few chapters for the story to get going and the writing doesn't improve at all after that. I have to agree with others who are upset with the ending as well. It was confusing and not as good as the rest of the book. It is not my type of book but if you want to see a book about a war, it's fine. I don't recommend this book for anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure I'm the right person to write a review on this book. I don't think it's very good. I didn't like the plot much. The story was just not exciting. The characters were weak. The plot is very predictable and the ending was not very good at all. It's hard to say that this book will make any sense to me after reading this book, but I'm going to try to enjoy it just for the story. I can't say it was a bad read, but it wasn't my favorite book. I bought this book from a book store in a used book store, but my copy came in a nice big box with the original book cover. I'm not 100% sure why the book is called "The Best of the Narnia Chronicles." I've read The Last Battle (which I loved) and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and the first two books of the Chronicles are excellent and the N.R.K. books are fine. I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the books, and this one is the most recent. The first two volumes are great and this book doesn't come close to those two. I found it very boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ I was given the book by a friend who had recently bought a copy from a used book shop. I really enjoyed it. I loved the plot, the characters, the style, the humor, the ending. I did not feel that it was as good as the first one I read. There were some things in this one that I thought were a little off. However, I still enjoyed the book. I think the second one was better. I don't know if it is just that I read this one a few weeks after I had read the first, but the first book was a little less interesting than the second.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book was terrible. The plot was terrible, the characters were horrible, and the worldbuilding was just not that interesting. I'm not sure if I should say that I wasn't really into the plot or not, but I wasn  This book is pretty much just an excuse to make fun of science fiction. The science is so dumb that it's almost laughable. For example, they say that a human can't survive without gravity, but in the book, you're basically the star of a show that goes up in flames. This is a good way to kill off characters and I would've given it 3 stars if they didn't spend so much time mocking the science and using it as an excuse.   The characters: I don't want to say they're bad, but they're not interesting. A lot of them just show up and have their personality traits, but that's it. There is no development, no character development, nothing. I can't even remember a single name off the top of my head.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was given this book for free from a library and was totally blown away by it. It's a very enjoyable read. I'm going to pick it up again. It is a lot more than a 'good read.' This is a good read." "This book is not only about the Great Depression. It explains the economic and political aspects of the Depression as well as the lives of ordinary people. It does a good job of making the reader think about the big picture of the times and how we are still dealing with these issues today. I loved it." 5. A Man Without a Country by Tom Clancy This book has become a classic since it was first published in 1982. It tells the story of the first days of World War II as the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union. The author, Tom Clancy, is a very successful military writer. The book is set in World War I and covers the whole world and the battles in France and Germany. The events that take place are the most memorable part of the book and the author did a fantastic job of portraying the war as it was. The battle scenes are very good and the descriptions of life during the war are very realistic. "A Man Without A Country is a book about the war in Europe. It doesn't focus on the political, military, or diplomatic aspects. The focus is on the everyday lives of the people who lived through the war. Clancy captures the chaos of the early years of World Wars I and II with ease. The plot of the novel is a simple one. A group of Americans, called the "New York Rangers" is sent to France to help out. The Rangers, a special unit of the U.S. Army, are the elite, highly trained American soldiers that fought the German Wehrmacht. When the Rangers are sent to the front line to fight in the battle for France, they are confronted by the very real problems of the war, especially the loss of life. This is Clancy's best novel, and his greatest achievement. This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat for pages and pages. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in World Wars, American history, or military history. Tom Clancy was a military writer before he became a novelist."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of contradictions, half-truths and outright lies, but is still so fascinating and entertaining that you want to keep reading. I'm not a doctor but I believe the following to be true:   - The author has an unhealthy obsession with the word "honest".  He wants us to believe that anyone who doesn't lie is dishonest, but even if that were true, it would not be a bad thing.  There are only two kinds of honesty:  1) the honest lie (i.e. telling the truth) and 2) the dishonest lie (or telling a lie that is false).  The first kind of lie is bad, but not the second.   What I found truly fascinating is that the author actually says that lying is a good thing, because it forces people to face their problems and their weaknesses.    However, the more you lie, the worse you get at it, which means you're better at it the longer you're lying.  "You know, lying is the only way to get to the truth."   You know what else is a way to "get to the Truth"?  Not getting to the "Truth", that is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is not a good book. The ending is weak and the author never really explores the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be an excellent resource to learn about the subject of self-defense. It's easy to learn, and is written well enough that you can understand what you are learning and how to apply the concepts. The only reason I gave this book a low rating is because I find the explanations of the defensive maneuvers to be rather poor. I've used them a couple of times, and I don't get how it works. If this book were written by an instructor, I would have given it a higher rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is a boring book, filled with many repetitions and tedious discussions. In the last ten chapters, there are no new ideas or concepts. I read the book, but I have no intention of reading it again.   There are a few good ideas, but most of them were so repetitive and pointless that they did not interest me, especially when they were all brought together into the same place.   The author claims to have learned a lot about the topic. However, there were so many repetitious topics that I do not see how he could have learned that much, unless he has read hundreds of books about the subject.   to be continued.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great read. The writing is very well done. I enjoyed it. But it's very short and the characters are pretty shallow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The world was changing, the end of the world was near. We were all in a state of shock. We all had different reasons for being there and we were all very different people but we all had one thing in common: we were scared. We weren't ready. We had never done this before and our parents were telling us that we needed to do it, that we had to. We would not be allowed to be normal or just go through the day to day. I can't believe the things I read.  I have a good heart and I love the stories, but I am sorry this book was so poorly written and the characters so shallow.  It was hard to get past the fact that the author was trying so hard to be like an author I was familiar with, and the results were not pretty.    The characters are just flat, boring, uninteresting and it just made me cringe.  I would recommend this book for people that want to be entertained but are not interested in reading a book that they would hate. "The end of all that is, the End of all Things." This book was given to me by my sister.  It is a horror book that she read to me as a kid.  The story is about a girl who has to help her brother and her mother, who have to leave her to go get food.  When she is not with them, she runs around the woods in the woods chasing a black cat.  One of the things she finds is a book called "The End of All That is."  When her mother asks her to read it to her, the book tells the girl to be quiet and she will be safe.  What happens next is not the end for her or her mother but for the woods around them.  She has to find a way to get back to the house, and she must get out before the book is destroyed by a lightning bolt.  This is a story about a little girl who must do whatever it takes to survive in the face of a terrible thing.  At the end, the girl has a good ending, but for me, it was not a happy one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********"I have to say, the only thing I enjoyed about this book was the title! But the author's description is absolutely horrible. This book is not funny or interesting. I did not laugh a single time. I have read worse but I have never read anything like this. This is an utter waste of your time. The only thing this book did was give me the urge to look for other books like it."  (Posted on 4/23/2014)  Not a review, but a warning!  The story is funny, the language is funny but I'm afraid it's too dark for some.  This book is very dark, but I did enjoy it, and it was good fun, but as a stand-alone, I don't recommend it.  a nice laugh, but not a great book. -S.    *****  A good read! It's a well-written story and the art is nice!  a good laugh. It's dark and not for the squeamish.   -A.M.  (Posted on 3/26/2014 )  My first and last read  It was funny and well-liked by all. But I'm going to leave the book with a bad taste in my mouth. The art is just a waste of money, and the writing is very unprofessional. , so if you're interested in this book, I'd recommend that you don't bother reading it at all. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you're just looking for a laugh. I'm giving it a one star because of the art and the writer's incompetence. (Posted by B. on 2/29/2014; edited 4/13/2014  I thought it was a good read. I liked the art, and I did like the story. I do think it is dark, and for the most part, it is a good book. I just found the author to be very unorganized, and sometimes, I didn't get a very good idea of what was going on. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared for some difficult to follow, confusing writing.  that is a great story and I am glad I bought it. But, I was so confused about the story that I did a lot of reading and did not like the ending at all! I guess I am not a fan of the kind of dark, scary
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've read in years. I love the fantasy genre, but I don't like to read the same book over and over again. This is another book I wish I'd read before it was published. There are so many problems, from a lack of character development to an annoying plot. The book is over 300 pages long and I just can't get past the last 100 pages. I don´t like this type of book, but my only complaint is that I didn´t enjoy the reading experience. I will not be buying this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in this book. I didn't know I was going to be disappointed when I first picked up this book (which was on sale at the library). This book has everything you want from a good urban fantasy novel. It is an interesting story with a very interesting world and a very good cast of characters. I found the world building to be very good and the characters to be interesting and likable. But the writing just sucks. The writing was choppy, slow, and often awkward, and it never really seemed to be going anywhere, other than the point being made. There were many times when I was waiting for a character to be done talking and then nothing happened. I also found myself looking forward to when the author would get back to the action, but he would always cut me off. I can see why the book would appeal to the young adult crowd. There are a few times where I was looking forward for the story to get going again. But in the end, I just don't think it is the author's fault. I feel like he was trying too hard to make the characters interesting, but the story just wasn't there. I was actually surprised that the story took this long to come out because it seemed like it was going so fast. It just wasn"t written well and didn't really feel like a book. In fact, the whole book felt like a story that just happened to be told. If this is the case, then it really is disappointing to me. It may be the book that the author will try to write in the future. Maybe I will give it another shot, but I will not be reading more of his other books. I would have given this book a 3 star review if I could. I just didn't like it.  Read a book about vampires? You'll have a hard time getting through this one. The story is boring. It's about a bunch of people trying to find the fabled "Queen of Blood". It's a fantasy story that's been done a million times. The characters are interesting. The world is interesting. But this is a vampire story. There's not a lot of fighting or blood shed or death. I guess that's okay if you're looking for a more realistic vampire story but for this type of book, you can do better. This is a book that just isn't interesting. I wish the author had gotten rid of all the clichés
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's too short. I feel like I could read it all in one day.  Have you read any of the books in this series? If so, what did you think? If not, would you recommend this book to a friend?  I am going to start with this book because it's about an evil sorceress and she's a bad woman. This book is not about an awesome woman with superpowers who's trying to get what she wants. It's not about a good man who has an incredible love for his wife and family. It isn't about a man with super powers that saves the day. It doesn't have a happy ending. It has a bad ending.  The story is about the bad guy. He doesn't like to play nice. He is bad and evil. I'm glad to see this series is still going. It could be interesting. I really hope they don't stop making books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a bit dry and a bit too much about the politics of religion. I had to read a few more pages just to get past the first page.  But then it was fun.   I love that the book is about a boy in the 1960s and he is a religious zealot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy this book. I found the plot to be interesting, but it lacked a bit in the characters department. I had some problems with the story and I think the author should've kept it closer to the first book.   What I Liked:  The main character, a young girl named Sara is an incredibly likable and likable person. Sara is intelligent, and her desire to get her hands on a magical ring was really interesting. It was fun watching Sara try to figure out how to make her ring work, but I think that's what kept it from being the perfect book. The author didn't give her the chance to be the "evil" witch, she got to be a normal girl, and the story kept the reader wanting to see what would happen next.  I was really impressed with the ending. It wasn't perfect, but the author was clever enough to make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy this book. The premise is interesting, and I'm a fan of the "what if?" genre. The characters were also interesting. I would recommend this book for the genre fans and the people who want to read a story about a group of friends who discover a mysterious "vortex of light" (as it is referred to) on their college campus. The story is fast paced and the plot is solid.   The problem is that the author has very little imagination and doesn't give us a real sense of the world that she creates. I thought the "virus" (I guess the author is referring to the "light"?) was supposed to be an evil force, but the author just doesn't get that. Instead of having a virus of light that will be unleashed by the author, it is a virus that is just waiting for a host. It is also a virus which will eventually destroy the world, but only when a particular group of people are killed. I didn't think the story was all that bad, but I didn' think the author had any idea what she was writing about. It was all pretty much the same stuff we've read before.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- The plot was absolutely pathetic. It started out as an interesting and somewhat dark sci-fi/horror story about a man who is taken over by a giant insect and is forced to kill all the humans on the planet. The plot devolved into a bunch of boring sci- fi/horrific things, like the insect trying to kill its host and killing the people it was trying to assimilate. The only real plot point in the book was a scientist trying to save a young girl from being bitten by a strange bug. He had to have been on a very high dose of the wrong drug. Overall, I would have preferred a more action-packed book. I can't believe I even gave this book a 2. The story is just too dull to keep me reading for more than a few pages. I give this book 4 stars, but I think it should be 1-3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I had to recommend one book to a friend, it would be this one.

It's the only way I can deal with the horrible events of the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ is a complete waste of time. ____________ is a bad idea for a newbie. _________________________ is a ripoff. _____________________ is a disaster. I was looking forward to reading these books, because I like a good mystery. But I didn't want to go through all of the trouble of finding a copy. I found them on my library's hard drive and decided to give them a try. __________________________________________ was a complete fail. ____________________________________________________________________________ was the best of the bunch. It had a nice plot, but it is extremely hard to follow and there are several plot holes. _____ was a good idea for the first book in a series, but the second book was just a waste of reading.  __________________________________________________ is not the best mystery in the series.

I think that it would be better to read them in the order they were published, though I haven't read the second or third book in the trilogy. The books are very hard to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be incredibly frustrating and confusing. I had no idea what the heck I was supposed to do in this book, I kept losing track of what happened and had a hard time following the story. It is just a mess of a book, so much that I'm glad I'm not reading it myself. "I am so tired of people thinking I am an idiot, and that I am the reason I have to read this book." "Why are you so stupid? You have no idea how to make a relationship work." I wish I could give a higher rating, because it was a fun read, but it was so difficult to follow the story line that it really ruined the enjoyment of it for me. It was really annoying to find myself trying to figure out what exactly was going on at times. The ending was a let down.  The characters were so shallow, and there were so many inconsistencies that I felt like I was reading a poorly written and poorly edited story. I would have loved it if it was just about two people in a relationship and the author just let them have some fun and be silly, but she just goes into too much detail about every aspect of their relationship and how it makes them different and different is wrong. The whole book felt rushed and confusing, I felt so disappointed and cheated by it. It made me hate reading more books from this author because I feel like she is just not giving enough attention to the characters and what they are feeling, and it's making me feel bad about myself. I just wish I didn't have to have to put up with this book and it made me want to give up on romance for a while.  "That's the reason why I don't like you." The Good: It was a good book that kept me interested. It made me laugh. The Bad: I just don't feel like I can ever look at a romance book the same way again. Overall Rating: 3.5 out of 5

It is an old story that I would like to see translated into a movie. I don't know if I will ever read this again.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The plot was dull and the ending was a letdown. It was a long wait for the last chapter, so there's no way I'd have to read this again.  Review from The Great Book Club: ************ The story is very good and the author has a lot of good ideas. But, it is all too much and does not leave the reader satisfied. ... This book will not be recommended by any of the group members as they were just as bored as I was with the story. I am going to recommend this book to the "Good Book Club" but I will be putting it down in no time.  "The last chapter was the worst part." "This book is boring and predictable." "If the main character dies, it's going to be a huge shocker."  ***  What a disappointment!   The story is dull and predictable. The author does not seem to have a clue how to write a story or how to tell a story.   I love the author's ideas. He has a good imagination, but he seems to have no talent for telling a story in any way. He just thinks of all the great ideas and just goes for them. He does have an interesting idea for the story about an old lady who is looking for her husband. But what happens is that he uses that idea as an excuse for the whole plot. And that plot is boring as hell.  .. The ending is not a surprise and it does not really end anything. I could see how he had an ending in mind, but the story was completely different and the story does not make sense.  (I really wanted to know why she had to die.)   Overall, it did not get me interested in reading more about this story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ This book is just too boring. ______________________________________________________ I read this book because it is one of the few books I have ever seen about the Japanese samurai that is NOT about the war. The author's focus is on how the samurai treated women and their children. This was all done to maintain the order and power of the samurai class. It was a pretty good book, but it's not about the "War" - it's about how the ruling class dealt with people who did not follow the rules. The last three chapters about the last few years of the Shogunate are a bit too depressing to read, but I did like the fact that the book had a lot of humor in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have been searching for a book that could be the best yet and have come to the wrong place. The book is boring and dry. I don't understand why the author chose the same story over and over again. A good story will surprise you with something new, something different, and a good ending that leaves you wanting more. If I could give the book 0 stars I would. ---------------------------   In the beginning, we have a young boy who has to live in the backwoods of the USA with his mother. His father died when he was young and his mother is trying to be a good mother to her young son, but this doesn't help her. She has been living on welfare for years and doesn't have the money to put her son through college, and she has a job at a factory that makes plastic toys for children. The boy has always been attracted to the dark, twisted world of the woods and he wants to live there, but his mother can't keep her son there anymore. Her plans change when she meets a guy who says he's a hunter. They go to a cabin to meet the hunter, but the man tells her that the cabin is a trap and that he's going to kill the boy, and take his money. When the man comes back, he says he will let her live with him, but she still doesn't believe him and she tries to find her son in the woods, but he's not there. She runs away, but after running out of food, she falls into a river and drowns. The hunter sees her and finds her and she dies in his arms. After the funeral, the hunter is upset and tells the mother that she killed her son. He doesn't know where the boy is, so the woman goes back to the cabin. She finds the boy still in his crib and she brings him back to life. The woman is angry and doesn´t know what to do anymore, so she goes back into the woods. She gets lost and eventually meets the old man who is looking for his grandson who he says was kidnapped and taken to a man named Sam. The grandmother decides to go to Sam, but when she gets there, Sam is gone. The old man goes to the man and asks him what's going on, but Sam says the boy was dead and the old guy was trying to cover it up. The man doesn't say anything and the grandmother leaves. She goes to a bar where

The sandwich was bland, and just not the kind of sandwich I wanted.  Not worth the money I paid for it. Review:    This book is a must have for anyone who loves to make sandwich.   It has a good assortment of ingredients, and each recipe is written well.  Review :   This book is the best of the lot!   The only thing I didn't like about this book was the price!  This is the only one that you need to buy for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is horrible, the characters are terrible, the story is terrible, and the plot is horrible.  It was an interesting idea, but not worth the time. The only positive things I can say about the book is that it's fun, and I think it could have been interesting if the author would have done a bit more research and gotten some of the information correct.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a very boring book with lots of exposition. I wish they would stop writing novels with that kind of style, because it's not a very good one. I would prefer something like  The World of Ice and Fire  or  A Game of Thrones  with a bit more action. The best part is the end, where everything goes wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book at all. I found the plot a bit of a drag, the characters annoying and the story confusing. I don't even know why the author put a scene of the main character being raped at the end of the book. I'm sure it made her character more interesting but I was really put off by it. I guess that's my problem with this book. The author did such a good job in making a believable character but couldn't find a way to make her believable. It's just too hard to understand the character and why she acts as she does. The ending was also really disappointing. The last scene where the main female character is raped made me feel like I just had a bad experience with a person. I mean it wasn't that bad but I just didn't like the ending. There were many things I liked about this book but it wasn"t worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the book, but it left me feeling empty and sad. It was a sad book.  I was sad, and I loved the book. I didn't feel it was the best book I read that year.  The story was good, but the story wasn't the point. It made me think about the loss of a good friend.  There were moments where it felt like it was just the two of them, but that wasn't what the story was about.  It felt like there were two of us and it was sad that it was gone.  And I couldn't get through the end.  I really like the story, but I felt that there was something missing.  But I loved it, I really did. I liked it, but not enough to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to offer me.  It is a collection of short stories and a collection book, but the stories are boring and have nothing to do with the book.   The book's title is a joke, because it's hard to describe the book's story.  There is no story, just one collection of stories.  The only reason I was able to finish the book was because the first story is the best.  The first story in the book is a good start, but I have not been able to continue the story because I have a very hard time following the plot and the characters.  This book has very little in the way of story. The story is not very original.  A man gets stuck in a hole, and he needs help to get out.  But when the man gets out, the man finds that his life has been changed.  He no longer wants to be a man, he wants to live like a woman.  That is when the plot starts.  It's all very generic.  I just cannot find the point in the story, and the author has done a bad job of writing a story. The only good thing about this story is that the story is short.  Even if the story had been longer, I would have not liked the story at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had so many flaws. The first flaw is the title. The author claims that this book was about a female who has to make her way in the world, and that the book is about her making a new life for herself. That was not the case at all. This book was more about the woman's journey in finding out who she is, and who she can become. It was not about her trying to make a new home or family in the outside world, but rather about her learning to accept herself. This is something that I did not expect from a female protagonist. It is refreshing to read a book where a female character does not always know who she wants to be. In this book, she tries to learn how to be a better person by figuring out who that is. This was a good and entertaining book. I did have to pause the book a few times because the characters were making me feel bad for them. It took a little time to get into the story, but the ending made up for it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read, and I recommend this story to anyone looking for a novel with a good female protagonist and a story that leaves you wanting more.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you like the plot and the characters, you will enjoy this book.  The problem is the characters.  It's not that they are boring, but they are just too simple.   The main character is the only good character in the book, and is probably the best thing about the book. But the rest of the characters are just like, "Oh, I see that guy, he's got a problem with that girl.  He'll just have to deal with it later".  I'm not even going to talk about the author's name, because it doesn't do the book justice.  There's also a scene in the middle of the book where the main character (I think he is a vampire) is in a car accident and his girlfriend is in the car and gets killed.  I guess that is supposed to be a big shock.  If I ever read a book where a main character gets killed by his girlfriend, I would be seriously pissed.  Also, the book is only about about 10% about vampires and the other 90% is about a bunch of different groups.  It's about 80% just some people trying to survive in the end.  But I can still appreciate it, it's just not something I will recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the idea of reading this book. The book is written as if it was written by a 15 year old, which is a problem. The writing style is clunky and awkward. I've read other books with similar themes, but the writing style of this book is awkward and weird. The main character's voice is a bit too high pitched, which makes her sound childish. The ending is very abrupt and abrupt. I was not a fan of the main character. Her personality is very weird and I felt like she was a bit of a stereotype. It felt like I was reading a story from the 70s, which I am not a huge fan of. I didn't like how there was no middle ground between the two characters and the characters acted out of character. I found myself annoyed by how the author did not show the main characters' point of view, instead leaving them in the dark. I wanted to know what they thought. The characters are very stereotypical. The father, the daughter, the mother. I don't think that's a bad thing, it's just that they weren't likeable. It just seems like they are trying to be realistic. There's no reason why a father who is constantly trying to make the family happy should be so passive aggressive. I am annoyed by the ending because it was abrupt and not very satisfying. I feel like it should have ended a little bit more naturally. It's not like it was a big deal or anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book but it really doesn't hit the mark for me. It is written like a love story, but I'm not sure if it is because I'm a woman and love story is something I don't usually read. It has some very pretty language and the ending is just too perfect, but the romance is really too strong for me, and I am not sure it's a good thing for the book to have the romance. I would recommend this book to anyone, but it's not for me personally. I have heard good things about it from other people and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was so disappointed by this book. The book is a story about a girl that's supposed to be a young teen, and then it jumps around to different times and places in her life, while being very confused about where she is in her body. She has some issues about her body, and I guess she feels like she's been raped and impregnated as a young girl. The author didn't understand that it's not about that, but about her. It's a good book, but I can't recommend it. I think this is a book for older teens and up."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is boring.  The author is very inconsistent and the writing is awful.   In a world where it's always "just a couple more years," you can't find anyone who can help you with your life problems, so you get to be alone with your demons.  I like how it's just a couple of people in a room talking about their problems, but it's really just the author and her therapist, and they don't get along, which is why the book doesn't end well.  In fact, the whole thing is just a mess.  A very, very, VERY, mess.   A lot of people have said that this book is a lot like the one I reviewed last month: a book about how hard it is to be a parent in a world of "just one more year."  This book is about how people in general and especially people in their 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's have it really tough, because there is nothing they can do to make things better, and everything is bad.  The author is obviously trying to say that people in those categories can't get help, but I don't think that's the case.  One of the things I like about this book, and it's an obvious one, is that she doesn't focus on what "everyone else" has done wrong, but what she herself has done.  That's important.  And the "just me" in this book really helps it, because when I'm alone with my problems and my therapist, I tend to feel better.  I don' t think this book can do that, but if you've ever been alone and depressed or angry, you'll probably appreciate it, at least a little.  But it's not a great book and I wouldn't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The story is a bit too long and too repetitive, but the plot is interesting enough. The book is interesting because the author was very clever in developing a believable world and characters, and he manages to convey the complexity and uniqueness of those world. " "The book is very interesting because it has a great cast of characters. It is interesting to read the adventures of many different characters from different races and cultures. The author really made me understand a lot about many characters." "I have to admit that I really liked this book. The story is quite good and has a good mix of comedy and drama. It was very enjoyable to read and I think that I will definitely be reading more books from this author." Overall rating: 4.5/5 This is a very good book with a very interesting plot. The only problem is that it is very long, so I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to read a very long book. However, if you want a good book that's short and sweet, this is a great choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________.   "A wonderful, funny, heartwarming story. What a lovely surprise! "   The author has a great sense of humor and this story is no different. It is very heartwarming and has a wonderful sense of humour. I am so happy I picked up this book. I loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the book from Amazon and was expecting the typical "Dyslexia" type book that people on the internet tell you to get. I was so excited to get the book.  Then I opened it up and it was full of spelling and grammar errors.  The cover is pretty much a picture of a baby holding a book. The picture was supposed to be a picture from the book, but it was taken from a baby book I had, but that picture was never used in the book so it was just a waste of money.   If you like reading books and don't want to bother with a book to help you with your dyslexia, don't buy this book!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book is too confusing and I don't understand the whole story and I want to read the next book." I've heard all these criticisms, and in a way I understand their concerns. I can imagine how a reader could get lost in the story and not know where to go from there. I could write a whole review on the subject (which I will probably do once the second book comes out), but I'm just going to tell you a little about the story so you know where I'm coming from. The book opens with a group of kids at a party in a forest. A guy is there and tells them about the secret life of the gods. A big fight breaks out, but no one is hurt. The next morning, the kids all go to school, but the teacher tells them that they can't go to class because the gods have been in a fight. Next thing you know, they find the cave where the fight happened, and it's full of stone idols. There's a little boy and a girl in a cave. There are two other kids at the cave, but we never find out who they are. When the group goes back to the party, they're followed by a mysterious guy in a suit. They talk about the gods and he explains that he's a human who has been trapped in the cave. He goes on to say that the gods can only hear and see the images on the stone idols, but he can go into the idols and see what's happening inside. They then go back to his apartment and try to convince him to give them the idols. When he refuses, they take off. When they return to the cave that night, they discover the cave has been robbed. The stone idols have been stolen. So the next morning the kids go to the school. They tell the teacher about what happened. The teacher calls the police, but they can do nothing because the cave is now empty. The kids then head off to find the idols, which turns out to be an ancient castle. They start off with the first idol, but soon realize that it's not the right one, so they search for the right idol. They finally find the right image, but when they go to enter it, the door slams shut. The group then heads off to a cave with a big statue in it, and they enter the cave to find a statue inside the cave who tells them it's their destiny to save the gods
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********I was not looking forward to this book. It is a rehash of the original and the original is over 20 years old. What is the point in rehashing it? It does not change anything. I have not read the original so I have no idea what the plot is. I think this was a bad idea because the characters are completely flat and the author did not give the characters any depth.The main character is a boring girl who is the one who does the boring things in the book. There is nothing new or original about her except the fact that she is a bad and boring girl. The other characters are the usual. The best character in the story is the villain who is so boring that I did not even care about him at all. I do not care about the main characters so what does the author do? She writes a new main character. So the story goes on with the same characters and I do like the new characters but the characters just do not interest me. I am sure that the author could have done more with the original characters but she chose to go with the new ones. It just does not make any sense. I could see why the author wanted to make the story new but she did not make it worth it. It was a rehashed story that I do think was interesting but it was not worth the time and I am disappointed because I was looking forward for something different.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has a strange style, and the characters were too cliche. It's also not a great book, and as the author mentions in the beginning, there are other authors with far better plots.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** ********* It's just too short, too boring, too hard to understand, not that it was bad but it's just a bit too simple and boring. You will not find many more books that are better than this. I guess it will help you to write more complicated books but I would prefer to read more complicated book in the first place, it's not worth it for this book. It is just too easy to understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Book of Lies is a horrible book.  I was disappointed, and I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others.  The story is a bit confusing to me, as I'm used to the "mysterious stranger" archetype that seems to crop up in so many mystery novels, and the characters seem too good to be true.    The main character is a guy, and that's a pretty rare thing in the genre, but then there's also the girl, the daughter, and a couple of other characters that don't seem to fit in with the main character.  This is a mystery novel about a girl who is found dead in the woods, and after finding out that the dead girl was a child who had been killed, the man is convinced that the girl was involved in a crime.  While I don't find that hard to believe, I'm really hoping the author will write a more credible mystery novel and get rid of the "child killer" and the "savior" and other elements of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible disappointment. The author spends more time complaining about the writing than it does on the book itself. It's a book that will only work as a filler if you're a huge fan of a particular series. I mean sure, there are moments that are fun to read and there are some good ideas in there, but for the most part this book is more about the author's opinions on how things should be done than it is about anything actually happening in the story.   As a book it's great if you like a good story about a person who is trying to do something, but has some sort of flaw in his/her/their way that is hindering him/her. I love that sort of character, but this book doesn't have that sort at all. Instead, there is a man named Luke, who is a mercenary and a master thief. He is also a bit of a dick to everyone, and that is his greatest flaw. He has a very simple idea of what he should do in his life and how it should be, and his flaws are the way he approaches it. It gets even worse from there.   the book takes place in a world where it's a secret that Luke is a thief. There are no rules in this world, so there are no real criminals, so no one is really worried about him, and so he's free to do what he wants. So he does what he wishes, and he does it to the detriment of everyone around him, most notably the woman he loves.  ... And it gets worse. Luke is so bad that even his family isn't able to keep him in line. The way this book ends is actually a pretty good one. He's gone bad, and it's up to the woman who he loves to figure out how to get him to stop. But it is a little too perfect for my tastes, and I found it kind of annoying that she was supposed to figure it out in the end.   (hide spoiler)] [It's a shame that this book didn't have a different ending, because it's an absolutely terrible book. The main problem is that it doesn't really have a beginning, middle, and end. It goes from one adventure to the next, and all the while, Luke is just making more and more trouble for the people around him. He steals a horse from the village chief, and then he steals a house from the local lord
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've had a good read of this book but I can't give it 5 stars. It is well written and well-researched. There are a few mistakes but most of the time this is an excellent read. The author does a good job in explaining how different cultures think about marriage and family. However, the ending was a little too abrupt and didn't feel like a real ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book did not live up to its hype. The writing was clunky and poorly formatted. The book is very hard to read. There are a lot of characters, and it is hard to follow the story of any one character. The setting is a little bit off, with a few inconsistencies. I would not recommend this book. The Review: So...this was a good read.  The writing is not really my thing, but I enjoyed the story, and the setting.  There were a few issues with the book.   One was the characters.    The book does not go far enough in explaining how they are connected to each other, or how they each came to be in this mess.  I think the book was trying to say that there is a connection between the four of them, but it didn't quite get there.  There were also a few typos, which made me look up the book to check the spelling of some of the names.  As for the setting, the author could have taken a different approach.  The characters were really flat, but not unlike a high school clique.  While there is some humor, there is very little depth to the characters, who I feel were a little too perfect.  It was a fun read, with lots of action and a nice feel to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book very much. It is a very predictable story with very few surprises, and there were only a couple of scenes that really bothered me. I was hoping that there would be more mystery and more mystery about how this girl got out of that house, and what was going on in her mind, but there really wasn't much of anything. The mystery is not very well developed and the book does not offer much of a payoff.   If you are looking for a quick and entertaining read, I recommend you give this book a try. I found it a little predictable and not very compelling.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was just not very good. I thought it was going to be good because I like good books and all but I just didn't like it. It was ok but it was too short for me and the plot and characters were pretty generic and uninteresting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a HUGE fan of the first book, The Farthest Shore, and while this is a great story and I really enjoyed it, I'm disappointed in the lack of any real change. I've already seen it referred to as a sequel but I'm really not sure how that works. The Farted Shore was a standalone story with an entirely new cast of characters that had their own problems to deal with.  This book is very much an ensemble piece and the events are happening in the same time period, but the main focus is on the main characters, who are just as flawed as in the first story.  A story of betrayal, revenge and betrayal! A story of revenge, revenge, and more!  This is a book that I've been waiting for and have been waiting to read. It's a very enjoyable read that I can see myself going back to time and time again.   Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like the idea of this book, but it's very short.   The story starts out with the main character, Arianne Martell, and her father, Prince Doran. Ariannne is a beautiful girl who's married to a very strong and handsome man. Doran is also very handsome and very strong. She wants to be with her husband.   the couple go to the Eyrie to be wed, but they are intercepted by the king's small council and are imprisoned. After they are released, they return to the castle to celebrate. They make a huge feast for everyone and have a big party. A few days later, Arienne is walking by the castle courtyard when a young boy comes up to her and whispers "I bet you're not going to be a girl tonight".   Arienne turns around to see a man standing by the wall and says "I can't believe it, but I am!"   Then we get some dialogue from the boy:   "Is he mad? No, he's not mad. He's just shy, a girl who never wanted to be anything other than a man."   Well, he was a boy. I think he was just shy and Ariannes father was not so much in love with him. So we know Ariannen never wanted a girl to marry him, but now we also know he was only joking. It's really a shame, because the book is so good.  , and I had a lot of fun reading it. I like how the book begins with Ariannde's mother, Queen Ariannee, who has just given birth to Ariannea. I thought that was really funny.I really liked how the plot is structured. It starts with a very important character getting married and then we get a little bit of exposition on how the royal family works. It is interesting to learn about how each of the members of the royal house interact with each other. Ariennne's father, Doran Martell is a very wise man, but he is also an idiot. So the book takes us through a little while on how Doran was raised and what made him so great.I thought this book was really well written. I really like how Arianenne's mother and Ariennes father have a relationship. I also liked how Ariennen's mother has to cope with her son's new found status.The book
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  In general, I found this book to be a great read, though I was a bit underwhelmed by some of the content. I'm a huge fan of John's writing, so I had high hopes for this one. I wasn't particularly impressed with some of his more complex concepts or with the character of the main character. I think his writing can be improved with better editing and the addition of more information. I've found his book recommendations very helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- This is a book that I would not recommend for any person, especially a kid. The first chapter was terrible, as is the beginning of the book. It would be like a person starting a book by telling you about their childhood. The next three chapters were all about his mother. He goes through a horrible childhood with his mother, with his father and all the other kids at the school. At the end of the third chapter he gets sent to a different school. It seems like a real waste of time to have to go to school again. The second chapter was much better, but it is still terrible. The third chapter was really bad, and then the final chapter is horrible. I felt like I was in the middle of a bad horror movie, but instead of being scared I was annoyed with the book for being so terrible. If you do not want to be disappointed by this book, then do not read it. I would recommend this book to a kid, because it's an entertaining book. The writing style is a little strange, but I can see the author having fun with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to read this book, and was pretty disappointed that I didn't like it. The story was interesting and the writing was decent. I think it would be interesting to see a different take on the genre in the future, but the writing seemed a bit slow and repetitive.  The characters didn't seem real to me, the world felt more like a high school than a fantasy world, and I felt like the world and story had been explored before and were just repeating the same plot points. Â  Overall I thought this was a mediocre book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, is, well, a good book, but not an exceptional one. I was very happy to find this book, and was very glad that I purchased it. The story is well written and told, and the illustrations are beautiful. The problem with this book is that there is a ton of material in this book. It is a lot of information to take in and I did find myself having to stop a lot, not because I was bored, but because I had to think a bit about some of the information presented. The author has a good grasp of how the human body works and that it can be made to work to some extent. But it does take some work, and sometimes I was thinking that I was reading too much into this book (for instance, what do you mean when you say that there are no 'rules' when it comes to making a man's body a woman's?' I don't know that there really is). I am looking forward to seeing where the author goes with this story, and am sure that I will be back to the library to pick up this book again, and to check out her other works, which I have already mentioned. I give this book a three out of five stars, and will read the next book to see if the author does something that I have not seen before.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ My husband read this book when he was at college in a class where it was required to read all books written by white men. The book is very good at telling us how men think about women and what we can do about it. But I'm just not sure how he is going to solve this problem in our society when men are so uneducated and so ignorant about the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about sex or love or anything else you'd expect in a novel about relationships. It is about people. And the most frustrating thing is that so much of what happens in this book is predictable.  - JK, via e-mail, June 25, 2012  Read more...
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not very good. I have not been very pleased with this book since I started it. I do not care for the plot line. I was disappointed in the ending. It seems that the author does not care much about her characters or the plot. I think she tried to make the plot work but she was not very successful. I hope she comes up with something better. This book does not seem to be very well written. I am going to read something else that is written by another author.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________  This book should be required reading for every single high school senior in the United States. The author, a former FBI agent, is a master of his craft and a master at using his knowledge and experience to craft a realistic and interesting novel. His characters are so believable that they almost seem real. But more importantly, his writing is just that, well-written. In fact, I could only hope that the book would be a bestseller, and I have been eagerly awaiting the publication of this book.   The story centers around a highly-skilled federal agent named John O'Neill who works for the CIA. John has spent much of his life as a professional intelligence officer, but after leaving the CIA he discovers that he has been wrongfully discharged and now is a fugitive from the law. He eventually finds a job as an investigator for a small Florida law firm, which has a special interest in the case of a missing young man. O'Neil is assigned to the case as his first assignment as an attorney at the firm. This job is not what he expected and soon he is embroiled in the most complex investigation of his career. His story is filled with twists and turns that you won't be able to anticipate.  's narration of his story is absolutely superb. The voice is not at all shrill. The narrator is just a little gruff, but it doesn't detract from the narrative or the plot at all. There is just enough emphasis on each word and sentence to make the reader feel the tension that is building, and then there are plenty of times when the reader won't even know what is going to happen next. The book is a fast-paced thriller that is filled to the brim with action, suspense, and intrigue. It is a must read for anyone who is a fan of action thrillers.   the author does a wonderful job of building suspense. When a character is about to do something that will have a huge impact on the story, you can feel the suspense building in the air. The suspense builds as the character gets closer to doing what he or she has been planning for a while, and as he or he discovers something that might make his life difficult. The characters have a real chemistry, and it makes the reader really want to know how the story will end.   in my opinion the best character in this book is John. His motivations are realistic, his actions are realistic (sometimes), his interactions with other characters are realistic. I
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with some trepidation, but it was not the worst book I've ever read. It was definitely the least interesting book I have ever read, but that was not a good thing. It is a story that I did not enjoy at all. I would have liked to see some more of the people involved in the conspiracy. I felt that the story was rushed, and the ending was rushed as well. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no plot.  It's all about the characters.   I thought it was about a guy who is a detective but is very lazy, which is understandable.  I thought it would have been interesting if he didn't have to work all the time.  But it was like the detective didn't want to be a detective.  It's a bit boring and has no interesting characters.   I would like to read the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The story is well written and the characters are realistic, but the ending left me wondering if I should have just turned it off. It had nothing to do with the plot and everything to do to bring in some plot, which I'm fine with, but it was the main character who really brought the plot to a stop. There was no real tension for her to get caught or anything like that, as her husband was the one who did the stealing. I feel the story should have been about her finding a way to get back to her kids and herself. That would have been more satisfying. I wish it had ended with her getting caught, but not to the point where it was a letdown.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "My wife was a librarian for many years and when she was let go her last day, I asked her what she thought of the job. She said that it was a great job but they had no clue what they were doing. She also said that she'd had worse but the job was worth it." I've only read the first book in the series but the first half was very entertaining and very thought provoking. I don't know if the second book will be a disappointment to everyone. I guess I'll wait and see.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters were a bit flat. The protagonist is an average teenager who has problems, but doesn't get enough help to help her out. She also has a very boring first sexual experience. I don't like a lot of first sex scenes, but I found it quite boring. The sexual tension wasn't there for me either. If the story had gone into more detail about the characters I would have enjoyed it more. It's not a bad story, just a bit boring for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a story that is told in the first person (which I like) and it starts out by telling us the story of a girl that was a tomboy and her relationship with her father. It starts out as a fun little story and the way it was told was very well done, however the story starts to go downhill from there and it's just not very good. The ending is very abrupt and it leaves me with an empty feeling that the author left a lot of things out. I would say this is an ok book, however I would recommend it to those that are looking for a light story that's fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ The book had nothing interesting to it, and as a story about a book about a boy's adventures, it was boring. The story seemed to revolve around the boy and his dog and was very short, which was disappointing. ______________________________ (1 rating)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " I am so upset. This book is full of typos, spelling errors, grammar errors and other bad grammar. I would never read another book from this author. " - Kasey R. " It's hard to tell what I think of this book but I was so disgusted I could not put it down and had to keep going to the end. It is full and disgusting of bad grammar, typos and just plain bad writing." - Rene C. Review: This is an extremely well-written and researched book on the history of the drug war. The author's background is in history and in the law. This gives a strong bias in favor of the "war on drugs." However, the author also seems to believe that the War on Drugs has been a success. This is a very disturbing book. The only redeeming thing about this book is that it does contain a small bit of humor at the end that is quite enjoyable. I'd recommend this book to any student who is looking to study a subject that is in a state of constant change.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a lot of problems.  The first problem is the title.  The "punch" that gets him going is the fact that his mother is in a nursing home and needs him. Â He is there when she dies. Ã Â Â Unfortunately the book takes a turn when he finds out that her death was caused by her husband. � She did not die of natural causes. �� Â I had to put the book down after the first few chapters because it got too painful to read about a person who I wanted to be like. ��� I also did not like the fact �� that this man's wife, who is dying, is the main character. ������ The other problems are the descriptions of the nursing home.      I was really worried about the author�s writing style.  ��� He describes the rooms and the furniture in a way that makes you want to pick it up and read it.  ������� ��� �� The book gets worse when he talks about the nurses who are there to take care of the patients.    ��� They are described as not caring.  ���������������  I did not feel like I was in a home. I felt like I had been put in a hospital or a mental ward.  The main character, the woman who was his mother, is not only mentally unstable but is also a liar.  The title of this book was an interesting choice but it is not the title of the book.  This book has no punch whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great way to get a better understanding of the ancient Egyptian system of magic. It was fun to read, even though I have a lot of questions. But the book is not as helpful as I hoped it would be. The only thing that I will say about this book is that it has a nice cover and is very hardbound. It is very expensive but it is worth every penny. I hope this book helps someone else learn more about ancient Egyptian magic!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never had a bad experience reading anything written by L. Frank Baum. I am a huge fan of the books and all the movies and the TV series. I loved this book as well. I just didn't like the story. It is about the story about the family of an Indian who was sent to the American West and never returned to India. He lived out the rest of his life in the old west. He had a son and a daughter who lived out their lives. There is a story that his son died and he became a drunkard and the daughter became a prostitute. I didn't understand that at all. The son died in an accident and the father lived out his life. I was so bored by it. I wanted to go to the old West, and see the family again. This book is not the best but not bad either.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ I got the audiobook for this book, but didn't like it. I have been listening to the book since it came out. It is good. However, the story of the book is a little hard to follow and the voice acting can get a bit off-putting. The characters are pretty boring. I don't know why this book was not released as a movie. It has great characters, an excellent storyline, and the ending was so amazing that I didn't want to stop. It also has great music and sounds amazing. I'm not a big audiobook listener, but I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes action, science fiction, and horror.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a poorly written book. I got this book from the library and it was the worst book I've read in a long time. The plot is interesting and it is well written but it has a lot of holes. The characters are not fleshed out and the story was not well told. I found myself wondering if I would ever get a chance to read the rest of the series and was disappointed to read that the next book was canceled.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I bought this book thinking I would like it but I found myself utterly bored by it. I found the book boring to read and boring to write and I found it difficult to follow. The characters were not interesting and I was unable to sympathize with them. The plot was a bore and not as interesting as I expected it to be.   My rating: 4 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last couple of books I have read by Robert Aickman are the most interesting I have ever read. He was my introduction to a number of great writers.   However, the new one is a disappointment. I really wanted to like it and really think it is a great book. But the plot, characters and world are too similar to other Aickmans to be able to take much from it.  -The protagonist is a doctor. He is a wonderful writer, I'm sure his writing will bring out the best in this new book.  -The story takes place in a world similar to the one in the first two books. However, it is not very similar, the setting is very different. The characters are much better defined and the plot is much more engaging. , but the plot of this one is just too similar. It is about a doctor, a woman and a young boy. In both of these, the doctors are obsessed with the patient, and the patients is a little kid who has been diagnosed with cancer. They have been married for ten years, and their son, a toddler, is sick, and is unable to speak. It's about two people who have been together for a long time and still have that strong bond. The story does not feel like a real story and feels like a love story. The plot is more about a man (I can't remember his name) who tries to save his marriage and child by saving the child's life. In this, he meets a man who is not so good in love, and a girl who has had an abortion. Both the doctors and the boy have their reasons for wanting to save the child, but are they the right people? Are their intentions good or just? The plot was pretty interesting, but again, too similar, it was not a good story. I have been a fan of Aickmann for a while now, but this is the first book I haven't been able to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have nothing bad to say about this book.  It's just a bad read and it's a bit of a downer to finish the book and realize that it's not all that bad.  I don't think I have ever read a book in which the protagonist was such a poor character.  The characters are all so shallow and I was just so tired of the main character. I mean, it's like a kid's book, so why is he so annoying?  The only redeeming feature of the book is that the book doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  I'm not a big fan of the way this book is written and I can't see myself recommending it.  The narrator does a poor job of explaining the book's plot to me.   The only time I remember her explaining anything to me was in a paragraph in the middle of the book where she says something to the effect of, "When the protagonist has an idea, it's time to stop, take a deep breath, and figure out how to implement it."  The whole time I was reading the book I was waiting for her to say something like, "The idea is the main character is a dog" or something, but I couldn't hear anything.  I know she has her job to do, but this was a little disappointing.  The main character's best friend is a woman, not a man.  Also, the character who is the heroine's best mate is an old woman and she's the one who's the heroine is most attracted to.    It was just a bad, bad book.   I would recommend this book to people who are looking for something a little different from the typical romance books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The whole book was a waste of my time. I was trying to learn a skill, and was given too many things to read to learn. I'm pretty sure the book is not needed to teach this skill, but it was an excellent way to learn the skills and was well written. 5/5 stars - "In this book, you'll learn to get over the self-doubt, procrastination, and low self-esteem that are all too common for students who are struggling to learn, and that are preventing students from succeeding in their education. The author explains the concepts of learning styles and how to recognize them in order to be successful in learning." - The author does an excellent job in explaining the concepts and skills he teaches in this book. I learned a lot, and it's a good book to read for self-study. 4/5 star - A great book to get you started on the path to self-education. I think it is a great read for anyone interested in learning a new skill. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn something new, as the concepts are very relevant to the modern world. The book is very well-written and has a very good flow to it. The most useful thing I learned from this book is that I need to pay more attention to the details of my work so that I can get better at it. 3/5- This is a very interesting book but it didn't really help me learn anything. The only thing that really stood out to me was that the author uses a lot of analogies to illustrate the concepts. The more I read the book the less it helped me learn.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I'm not sure that I'd call it a bad novel, but I did get bored with it after a while, and I think it could have been a little more fleshed out. It was a great concept that would have been nice to see come to fruition, and then it went to the dark side, and it ended rather quickly. The characters were interesting and well done, but they were all pretty one note, so there's not much more I can say about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very slow-paced book that feels very tacked on and poorly written. I've never read anything so slow and uninspired, and it has me feeling like I'm reading something that was written to amuse the authors' kids and their friends. I feel like I read something that's just meant to be fun, but that's not what I got. It's a bad read. I wish I could give it 1 star but I can't do that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason I will read any book is for the book's cover.  I will read anything if it's on a good cover. So I read a bad review about the novel that had nothing to do with the book.  I read a review about this book, "It's so bad I don't want to read the book." I'm just going to let that one slide.  I read the first half of the book, and it's a good story.    I'm not really that interested in the politics of the story. I liked the ending, but I don 't like that the author decided to end the book with the first character in the story dying.  The ending of the second book was much better, but the first book was pretty good.  So, if you like your politics a little gritty, and the way people act, and people are really mean, I think you'll like this book. I read this book because it was advertised as a sequel to  The Martian  (although the title was changed) and I wanted to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I had been looking for a good book to read, so I bought this book, but found the book difficult to read. The writing style is very uninteresting and repetitive. I found myself wondering what happens in the book every time the same plot happens. The characters are not well developed and are not likable. I don't recommend this book to anyone, especially if you are not a fan of mysteries or crime novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  A couple of years ago, I bought a book by John Steinbeck. He was in the process of writing a novel and the book came to be called 'The Long Goodbye'. When I saw the title of the book, I knew right away that I was going to like it. Unfortunately, I also knew that it was a very long book. The book is well written, but the pacing is so slow that you can't really enjoy it as a whole. I'm not saying that you need to have the whole book to enjoy it, but I found that I could only enjoy the middle part of the novel. So it's not a bad novel, but it is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was terrible. It wasn't as bad as I expected, but the characters were unsympathetic and the plot was terrible, the characters weren't likable, and the whole thing just felt very cliche and boring. I won't go into detail, but I felt like the characters only existed to get into trouble and then go back to their lives without being in the slightest bit interesting. There wasn't much of a plot, and everything just felt rushed.  I guess that's the problem with this book: the whole story is very cliched. Â This isn't a bad read by any means, but it is cliches, and it just doesn't make for a good read. ___________________________________________________________ So I bought this book after reading reviews about how it was the only book to be turned into a movie (which I liked) and that I needed to read it.    Well, I did read it, but not the way the reviews said I should.  It is a book that I can say I enjoyed, and I did enjoy it. It's not the most entertaining book in the world, but at least I didn't hate it.  The story revolves around a young man who is a friend of the main character, and has a crush on him.  He meets up with his girlfriend and she introduces him to her best friend.  This is where the cliche happens.  The best friend of his crush is an ex-con who has an obsession with the main guy, and a crush of his own.  At first, the main protagonist doesn't like him, but then he does.  Eventually, they have sex, but they end up being friends again.  They also have a child.  In this book, the girl is the more interesting character.  She's very intelligent, and is a very nice girl.  But the main focus is on the guy who is the "perfect" guy.  I mean, he is an excellent student, and he is a great guy.   But he doesn't get a second date, or even a phone call after the first date.  After the first time, he ends up going back to his house and getting drunk, and then ends up getting into trouble with his ex-girlfriend.  So, you see, it's not that he isn't perfect, it is just that he is the only one in his school who
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a very well written and illustrated book about a very difficult topic. There is so much wrong with it, but the author did a very good job. The book starts out very slow and the author tries to teach about the concepts by showing you a couple examples.  I was hoping for a book that would teach me more and not just use the examples. I was also very disappointed with the ending because it just does not make sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a lot of stories about the occult and witchcraft. These are always so exciting, but not always believable. This one is no different.   This book was great for the story, the characters, the action, the writing, the themes and the writing style. I enjoyed the writing so much I almost gave it five stars. The prose is very good, and the prose is easy to follow.   The story is told in the first person from the point of view of the protagonist, and it's easy to relate to the story and the characters.   and that's what I liked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know that I would read this again. The story was very good, but the plot didn't make sense to me. It just kept getting more and more confusing as it went on. It also was very hard to follow the plot because there were so many sub plots and so many plot twists. This book was great, but it was very confusing and the plot never made any sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  The book is about a man who has a very low opinion of himself. It's a fairly simple book but it's also very interesting.   The author is a very good writer. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn a lot about the psychology of the self-esteem movement and to read a book that is entertaining and very interesting to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In short, this is a collection of short stories that do not contribute to a greater story. There is a lot of fluff in this collection, and it's not easy to follow where one story ends and the next begins. The story "Bones" is a good example of this. This is one of those stories where the characters all have a very different story. The only reason this one is in the book is because the main character is a female.   "Bones": The story begins with a couple who go to visit a friend. There, the friend has a surprise for the couple. The friend says he's going to be a grandfather soon and wants them to have a baby. He says he has two names, one male, one female, which is why the couple should get a girl. He wants the couple to name the baby after him, and they do. The woman names the baby "Sebastian." The man doesn't want to have anything to do with this because he doesn't like being called "Sandy." So he ends up calling the baby his own name, Sebastian. Sebastian ends up being the name of the baby. It's a really good story, and if it were longer, it would be interesting.  .   in the end, Seb's name is used to get him into trouble and ends up saving his life. He becomes a father and a grandfather. But then it turns out the couple had a third name and it turns into a horrible nightmare for the baby named Sebastian.   is a story about a couple that goes to visit their friend, Sebastian, at his house. The two girls, who were supposed to meet Sebastian in the morning, end up meeting him in the evening, which means he has a party for his two daughters. It turns out that Sebastian was trying to have an affair with the friend's wife, and Sebastian was cheating on his girlfriend. The main character, a man, has the biggest problem with this, but his friend, a woman, is much less angry.   (hide spoiler)   The other stories are really good, but I feel they're all pretty one-dimensional. I found the story about Sebastian's father a bit cliche and a bit too one-sided. The other stories about Sebastian were fine, but nothing really stood out to me as really being very special. I do feel the story "Sophia" is quite good, though.  , by
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________, it's not worth the read.  Read a positive review about the book: This book is the best book I've ever read! I've never heard a story this gripping and the characters are so believable. The writing is a little old fashioned but the story is so great. I'm so glad I read this book!  Review by: John J.  in California  Rating: 4 stars   The only one I would recommend.  and I am a great fan of Stephen King  review by: Mary  I'm a big fan of King and read the last four books of the Dark Tower series (The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, and The Dark Tower, in that order). I have to say that this book was an improvement on all the previous books in the series. It's more action packed than the previous four and there are more twists and turns than in the previous series. The world building is superb and King's writing is on point. ...   I read the book for the first time this morning and it took me a while to get through the story but once I got into it I found it to be a well written story. I liked that there was a great deal of action and that the characters were complex and interesting. There were a few parts that were very confusing for me but I read it through anyway. It was a good story and I liked it a lot. I would definitely read it again.  to give it 4 stars I think it is a good book and I would say it is an improvement over the previous Dark Tower books.  it's a great book.  for more reviews on the Dark tower series, please visit my Dark Tower Blog
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I am going to start off by saying that I love this book. I love the characters, the setting, the concept and I really enjoyed the way it was written. I do not hate this book but I do think that the author is being a little too hard on herself. The main problem that I have with the book is the character of Nella. She was my least favorite of the five main characters in the book. She is not very likable and she does a lot of stupid things. The book is set in the late 18th century and in some of the descriptions she sounds like a crazy old woman. I felt like she was trying to be too much like a 19th century character and she came off as annoying. However, she is still a good character and I will give her credit for having a good sense of humor. I think that Nella has to work on some of her bad habits. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted read. It is not my favorite book by the author, but it is a great read.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book has an unfortunate ending that makes me angry. I loved it. It's like the ending to a Disney movie with a happy ending but the happy ending isn't all that good. The book started out as a very funny story. After a few hundred pages of that I was hooked. The main character, Will, is a former high school quarterback and now a college student who has a very strange hobby: he's a writer. Will writes a column in his school paper about his unusual interests. I think it's his love of writing and sports that got him in trouble with his teachers. But, I really can't say anything bad about this book. If you're a fan of sports and you like a bit of humor, then this is the book for you. If that's not you, don't bother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are some interesting things about this book that I did not realize at the time. For one, the authors name is not mentioned in the book but is mentioned by the reviewer as a possible source of information about the book. I thought that he may have been an author or a reporter who had the opportunity to speak with the author, but after reading the book I am still unsure. The authors name was given in the beginning as "Kiran Desai" or "K.D. Desai". However, when the author was interviewed, it was not Kiran Desi that he mentioned, but Kiran Dassai.   Also, the author stated that he had some of the manuscript to look at after the book was published and that it was a hard book to write. Well, I didn't think that writing a book would be hard. So, why would he give it to an editor and then get him to cut out some parts of the book? I don't get this whole point.  .   a book review:   I have read this book and found it to be very interesting. The author did a good job at explaining his thoughts on the subject matter of the subject. The book is very good in terms of it's length and the amount of information it contains. The main idea behind the book is that the government is not the one to blame for the failure of the banks. In fact, they are the ones who made a lot of the mistakes.  , a book reviewed:  I don´t like to read books that have only a few pages about the author and his opinions. It is always a waste of time to read about somebody that is not really there in the story. The story in this book is good, but the characters are just there. They are not interesting. I donít think that there is a story in here that is worth the time or money. If you read this one, then buy a book about a writer or some other interesting person that you think might be good for your kids.     , a review: I found this book to be a bit difficult to read because it is not very easy to read in terms if the writing. I would not recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn about the history of banking. It would be better if the author gave us a brief history of the history so that we can understand why the banks failed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half is about a girl who is a member of the cult. This is really a problem in a book about a cult. The second half is all about her meeting an old friend, who she has to pretend she doesn't know, and about the strange things she learns about this new guy. But the book is about the cult and the book makes it a big deal.  I don't know if the book should have been called, "The Girl Who Wasn't Caught" or "The Cult That Didn't Exist."  But that's the title.  "The Cult that didn't exist"  My Rating: 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but it was a huge disappointment for me. I started out on a high note, and I think I'll end up reading more of her books, but I'm still very sad that I have to leave this book.   The characters were very well developed. The story is very good. The narrator did a good job. There is a lot of action, but the pacing is a bit too slow for my taste. I wish I had read it more quickly to keep up with the plot.     There is a strong and very disturbing sexual scene in this book (it was not graphic, and she warned me before I read it that I might not be able to handle graphic sexual scenes in books I'm reading), but I think that the story would have been better off without that. She told me that she thought the scene was too graphic to be suitable for the age group the book was aimed at, but my teenage son wasn't having it. It was also an interesting plot development that she developed later in the book that was a bit surprising and interesting.   (hide spoiler)  I read this book in one sitting, but in the end I wasn't able to finish it. I really wanted to like it, but this is the first book in a series I've read that made me feel so angry that I had to take a day off work to get out of the house.I loved reading this book because it was very good, and it is written very well. However, the characters were not very well written. I thought that the character who was the main character was very interesting. The author does a good jobs with descriptions and character development, and all of the characters feel real. I liked the main characters of the book, and they felt like real people.The story is a good one. There are a lot more sex scenes than I expected, but not too many. I also thought that there were a lot less characters than I thought. I was expecting to read about a lot longer chapters. I think this book could have been a little longer, but still had a lot to say. It could have used some more action. I'm glad that there are not a lot in this novel.There were a couple of characters that I did not like. One of the male characters felt like a stereotypical guy that I've seen many times. He was a bully and a jerk. There was a lot I disliked about this character

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really impressed by the quality of the book. The book is about the real life story of one man and his family during World War II in the Nazi occupied territories in Europe. He wrote the book in the 1950s. The story is told with great detail and detail. The first part of the story is about a young boy growing up in the ghetto, in a bad situation. He tries to get some money from his father. He was very poor, and his father didn't help him. The boy gets an opportunity to get food when he's 16, and he buys it, even though he had to borrow money from someone. The next story is of a young girl in a convent. She is pretty and she is really nice. When she is married, she is very happy. The man is very poor and he doesn't have enough money to support his family. He is trying to raise his daughter. The last story is that of a mother. She has been in a really bad situation and her husband was killed. She really loves her daughter. But she can't make her daughter do anything because she doesn't get enough money. She can't afford anything.   It's a nice book. It has all the details you'd want to know about life in Nazi occupied territory. I'm really glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad, terrible book.  I got this book because it was the last of a series, and I was really excited about it because it seemed like a good sequel. It wasn't. It was boring, slow, and not very well written. I really wanted to like this book but I just can't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a try, as I do every new book, but I had a really hard time reading it. I thought the characters were all so flat, and I was just really frustrated reading it, and then I realized that I have a hard time finishing a book without having to cry. I also feel like I wasted the 10 minutes I read it, because it seemed like it took forever for the story to get started, and when it did, it wasn't really that good. I don't recommend this book to people, as it doesn't really deserve it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I thought I was going to have a stroke by the time it was over. I'm so glad I waited. I really loved this book. I feel like I've read about it before but it's so good. The story is just as good as I remember it. The characters are just as likable as the books I remember reading. It's so nice to read a book about a time when people still cared about each other and didn't want to kill each other. It would have been nice to see how the story ended with a nice cliffhanger. But I'm glad that this book is over and I hope the author will write another one soon!

The story shows the struggle of the family and the doctor who tries to do something to help him. The doctor decides to do some tests on his organs and finds out that the problem is in his kidneys. It's a very sad story about a guy who really needs help.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring. There are a lot of characters who are constantly fighting each other, who never seem to make any progress in the story and never seem any closer to figuring out the puzzle. I don't know how much of this was intended to be a lighthearted fun read, but instead, the whole thing just felt like an excuse for the author to tell a bunch of silly, silly stories about people and events he knew from his own life. The characters, the setting, and the plot are all terrible. I'm not going to give the book a 1 star because it's really a bit of a mess and it has some fun moments in it, but it doesn't stand out as anything special and the overall quality of the book is just average.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book.  It was a waste of my time.   I think that you need to know that this book was written by a writer who has an interest in the paranormal.  So what's the story?  The main character is a doctor named John Burdett.  The main character was very upset when he learned about his son's suicide.  John B was so depressed about this that he went on a psychic journey in order to solve his sons death.  He found out that his son had died from a spirit who was haunting him.  But he also had a lot of other problems which is the main point of the book.   The main problem that the main character has is that he can't seem to get rid of this spirit.  At one point he even calls a psychic to try to solve this issue.  It seems to be a very cliche situation.  However, I think that the story is really bad.  There are a lot things that I don't get about the story.   But one thing that I did like was that John was trying to find out what his son was up to.  I think he did this for a reason.  This would be good to see if John B's son was involved in something else.  If he wasn't I think it would be a bit much. The plot is very cliched.  In the beginning John is going through the motions of solving his son problems.  Unfortunately, things start to go wrong.  When things start going wrong, John begins to believe that his psychic powers are working.  And this is where the story starts to get really bad and the plot really starts to fall apart.   At this point the story has turned into a book about a psychic who believes he is the son of a dead man.  Even though this is all made up.  Because of this it doesn't really add to the book as a whole.  After about the halfway mark I just got bored.  As for the story I just think it's terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you love a good story but find yourself frustrated with the plot twists, the characters, or the writing style, then you'll love this book. It's one of those books that I can't put down.  The worldbuilding and magic system are so interesting that I keep wanting to know more about it.  The world building is so good and so varied.  I love the fact that a book could be set in a world with elves and dwarves and magic and then also have it set in one where humans are at war with the elves and the dwarves.  It's so fun and inventive.    One of the biggest draws of the book for me is that the author is able to create characters so interesting and interesting that you can't help but love them.  This book is a great example of a world where there are no clear villains.  From the first page of the first book we know that there are going to be battles to fight, and we know those battles are going have winners and losers.  That's why I love books where I'm going to have a hard time picking a winner.  The main character,  Rolf, is a character who, as a human, is so intelligent and resourceful that he always gets a better outcome than the other characters.  There is no such thing as a good or bad guy in this world, only a winner or loser.  If you love good story-telling and a good challenge then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  (4.5 stars) Buy it on Amazon
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. I bought this book for a class I teach. It was not a very good book. I will admit that I am not a professional writer but I know how to use the dictionary. I read it and the words were too close to the definition and did not make sense. It is difficult to write a book in one sitting, but I am sure the reader can make it a good read.   I am a long-time reader of the Bible. I have been for the last 20 years. It has always been difficult to find a good book on the Bible that teaches what I think the Bible teaches. This is a book that I will look at again but not the next time.  13 of 15 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ ____________ The author does not understand the concept of a plot, nor does he even know how to plot. I found the story to be a mixture of fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery. ______________ I can't say that I enjoyed this book. The author has a strange way of writing about characters. It is almost like a child trying to explain something to adults. The story was just confusing, not interesting. ____ I do not recommend this book to people who want to read a good, well-written, well written, well plotted book. _______
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I think a good book should change your life, but sometimes books can't.   By: Peter J. St. Onge   2 stars for a bad, boring book.  , but if you have not read the original book you can't really judge this one. The book has all the makings of a classic science fiction/fantasy series. The world-building is good and the story has lots of adventure and action, but what really irks me is that the author, in the third book, actually tried to make it a romance (it's not), but then the author tried to shoehorn in a romance as well, so now he's trying to shoejack a romance into a fantasy book.I thought I was going to like this book, but I couldn't really get into it. It's a slow-moving book, with lots of characters talking to each other about what they've done. And, although I loved the first book, I just couldn't care any more about this book. The characters just kept on talking about stuff that didn't interest me. In the first one, we had a bunch of people on a ship that is in the middle of a war, and then there was the ship that was being used to fight the war. In this book we have a bunch who are fighting a war. I didn't care about anyone of those people. I'm sorry I don't care that much about the characters, but it's just not interesting to me. I'd give the book 2 stars, but only if it had had more action. I've read other books that had a lot more action, and they were better books. I just felt that this book didn't have enough action. But I will say that the action is good. I would have liked to see more of it.I read a lot of books in my youth, and I think that I've pretty much got it down. I love science fiction and fantasy, but even though I like all of them I prefer science fiction over fantasy. I think the thing that keeps me from reading a lot fantasy is that I just don't find the stories that I like to be fantasy. And I'm not talking about the elves and wizards, I'm talking about stories that are about how humans interact with each other and their environment. If it's about magic and monsters, it's not fantasy.If it's a good story that doesn't take itself too
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ I bought this book because I have been looking for an introduction to quantum physics that I can understand. However, this book is NOT the way to go about it. It's very hard to understand, with little pictures and confusing definitions of words. There are no explanations of the key concepts of the subject, which are essential for understanding. There is an interesting theory that is presented, but that doesn't make up for the lack of explanation. It seems like the authors are trying to teach the reader the theory, but not how to apply it to real life situations. In my opinion, this is a poor choice for a introductory book to quantum theory.  Book: I can't understand it at all, because it is too confusing. It is a little bit like quantum mechanics. I can see how it might be interesting to some, but for me it is just too hard to get the concepts across.  in general: this book should not be used as a reference, and the author should not try to sell this as a book to learn quantum mechanics, because this book does NOT teach quantum mechanics in any way.    Review: The book is written by two mathematicians. It starts off by describing how one can construct a quantum mechanical state. It describes the operation of quantum mechanical effects in a particular way, but does not describe how to actually use these effects to perform quantum mechanical calculations. Instead it uses a mathematical notation, which is hard to follow. It does have a lot of pictures of mathematical objects, but they are just a few pages and there are not many examples. The pictures are very hard for a beginner to follow, and it is very hard (and very confusing) to use the pictures. It has a lot more mathematics than most of the textbooks I've been using, and this is not a good way to learn math. There's a lot about the theory of quantum mechanics and the nature of particles, but this does not help much with the problem of understanding the book. I would not recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I thought it would be fun to read this book. The author has a lot of good points and I enjoyed her writing style. However, the book was just awful. It was full of bad writing, bad characterization, bad humor, and just horrible scenes that made the book seem less like a book and more like a series of bad porno films. The writing was extremely bad and I found myself thinking that it was just poorly written. The characters were also extremely stupid.   The main character, Jael, is a young woman who has been raised to be submissive and passive. Her father has never allowed her to make any decisions and her mother has always been a bitch. Her boyfriend is a loser who thinks that his girlfriend is a slut because she's always trying to get him to kiss her. The problem is that Jael is a very smart and capable woman and I think that she would be a better mother to her boyfriend if she wasn't such a submissive bitch.   the author is just plain bad and the book just dragged on so much. I hated this book and it's just sad that a good book could be this bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in the library, but my family members had to borrow it from me.  They were so disappointed they didn't take the book home with them.

I'm sure you have read a lot of books, but you've never read anything like this:  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------This book is a disaster! It is a story about the first time I have ever been sexually assaulted. The author tells the story from the first person perspective. What you get is a guy that was raped at 16 years old by a woman that is in her early 20's. The rape took place in the bathroom of a college party. He was unconscious for an hour. She did not even stop to say sorry. She just sat in the same position, and continued to fuck him. The next day she went to the police, and said she was sorry for what she did. The police found nothing in the apartment or the apartment house. The guy had a condom in his pocket. He just had no idea he was a rape victim. It was just an excuse for a wild night with a girl that turned him on. The second time she went back to the apartment, she broke the man's nose with her purse. The victim thought she was going to beat him up. Instead she threw him out and walked out the door. Then she got in a car and left. When the man went to call the cops, he was beaten unconscious. He has to spend six months in the hospital. Now the girl is still a student at the college. He can't even go home to his mother. He still has a huge scar on his face. I was very disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------  I bought this book in order to get a handle on the various theories of how human brains work. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to get through.   This book is a series of essays on the "Functional Model of Cognition", which is a theory which attempts to make the brain a purely computational device, and which is supposed to explain how our brains process sensory data, and how these processes are coordinated with each other in various cognitive tasks. I found this theory very appealing at first, but it has a number of problems, which are very serious. For example, one of the biggest problems with this theory is that it is very hard to test. In order to see if it works, we have to give it a lot of data, which can be very hard for many cognitive scientists. Furthermore, the functional model of cognition is very controversial in the cognitive sciences, so even if it does work in the brain, it is far from being a definitive theory of cognition. There are many other competing theories of cognitive processing, which I believe to be more scientific.   the main problem with this book is that the functionalist claims that the brain is purely a computational device is not only inconsistent, but is also a very dangerous theory. There is a good example in the book of a famous example of how the functional view is incompatible with neuroscience. This example is the case of "visual search" which is the brain's ability to process the visual world and learn what is important and not important about it. It is very difficult for us to think of the visual cortex as a purely "computational" device because we cannot see that there is a separate processing unit which is doing the work. The visual cortex is also extremely complex and we can only see its workings through the eyes of a person.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have just finished reading this book and found that the whole book is based on the idea that all human beings are basically good and want to live the good life. So the main character, the one that is supposed to be the most likeable, has a wife who is a very abusive and controlling wife who doesn't want to be a wife. She constantly makes him look bad and is constantly trying to make him miserable. This is all made even worse by the fact that he doesn't even want to talk about it to anyone. This book has nothing to do with good human relations and is really just a bunch of crap. The only good thing about this book is the fact it is very long so I could finish it before the end of the week. Overall, not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed that I could not find a way to make the story more exciting.  The book had enough action, but not enough drama or excitement.  I think it would have been a better book if the protagonist had more of a personal story to him.   I was not impressed with this book.  The characters were just okay.  There is not much of a story and I didn't care about the characters at all.  It was a very boring book and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete disaster for me.  I have read many books by John Masefield and his work is always good. Â This book was not.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book had a great premise, but it didn't deliver on that promise. I'm disappointed by the lack of characters. The plot is great and I wanted to be a part of it, but the lack thereof is disappointing. The main character is just a one dimensional jerk. The characters feel like they're being written to fill the role of the bad guy, and not the protagonist. The ending is a let down, and I expected something more from the author, who I consider to be one of the better writers in the genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the first 5 pages of this book, but then got distracted by some other reviews and had to go and look at the book online to see what the fuss was about.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say I didn't like this book. I had high hopes for this book because it had the word "Fantasy" in the title, but the story was really not that interesting to me. The author did not do anything that was really original. The story is not about magic and it is not really about "Magic", the story is about "A Hero and a Lady". I did not care much about the story, the characters were very generic, I would not like to be in their shoes. I didn' t even care about the main character because I didn`t care about him at all. This book was very short, I don`t understand how anyone could enjoy this book, I didn `t like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but I was very disappointed with the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ It's not that the book was bad, I thought it was just poorly written, and the writing style is not really suited to a book like this. The characters were flat and one-dimensional, and were very one-note and generic. If the author were to improve his style, I would say that this could be an okay book, but I just felt like the writing was awful and did not help the plot at all. I am looking forward to the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book before and it was so much better. I had read all the other reviews and thought that this book would be the same. I was wrong. This book was not as bad as the reviews suggested. The first half of the book was good. The second half was terrible. I can see the author's point but the author did not go into the details and did not give a detailed explanation. I have to say that I liked this book. I will be looking for other books by the same author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very disappointing. I don't know if I'm just a terrible reader, but I didn't find this book that interesting. I've seen many of the reviews saying how this book is a must read for all Star Trek fans. It is definitely an important book, and I can't help but wonder why people would even consider it, because it doesn't stand out from the crowd. I do feel that the characters are well developed and they have their own goals and feelings, but for me, it felt like a book written by someone who has never read the original series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I read this book and it was terrible. The author has to be one of the most terrible authors I have ever read. The characters were all bad, but most of all the plot. I really didn't like the plot, the story was not that interesting. The main character was a horrible character. The book was really bad and I couldn't even finish it. I would have liked to have heard more about the history of the castle and the other characters but I don't really like history, it's boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would say that the book is a good read for people who want a quick, entertaining read. However, I would not recommend it to a reader who wants to learn more about the history of the Middle East and why so many people in the region have such bad things to say about the Jewish state. This book is poorly researched, and there are several mistakes. I did find the historical information to be interesting, and it provided a few historical facts that were not mentioned in the text. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick read, but I would suggest that the reader read the book a few times before making a decision about the accuracy of the information presented in the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should have been called  A Short History of the Future  but was given the title of a book on the future. It is a nice short history of the future that is quite long and dense, but if you are a history major this book is not for you. It covers some interesting aspects of the history of technology, but the main topic is the future (which I thought would be the main subject of the book). The history covers the early history of computers and the invention of the digital computer, but they are treated as something completely different from the computers we use today (the digital computer). If you have not read this book before, you may want to do so, but you should be aware that you will be reading a history of a specific technology, and you should read it with an open mind. The main problems I had with this book were the lack of historical detail (no names, no dates, no specific technology).  The main problem I had was that the authors were not specific about when the digital computers were first invented, but I was not sure why. There were two main sources of information:   The first one is a book called  Digital Technology: A Short Look at a Major Revolution in Computers and Communications  by George M. Johnson.    The second one is from a book written by John J. Searle called  Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach  (which is a very interesting book). I was really looking forward to reading this book since I had a lot of questions about the digital computing and what it was like in the early 1980's, but since the information was a bit scattered and I could not find any information on the topic, I had to rely on the other sources.  I am also disappointed that the author did not give more information about the future of technology. I would have liked to have heard more about computers in the future, but again, that is something I am sure many people are interested in.  I read this to prepare for the Advanced Placement computer science exam (which is what this book will be used for), so I wanted to be ready for the big questions that are to come.  The author does give a fair amount of information on digital computing. He talks about the main computers of the time, how they worked, and the problems they solved (such as the one used to simulate a digital computer in the movie "Star Wars"). I liked this book a
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the Nazi's. It was good but was just a book about Nazis. I read it because of a few reviews, not because of the book itself. I do not understand how this book is about the Holocaust. I'm a history major, so that was my main interest in reading this. I am not interested in reading a book with a "message". I'm just interested in learning about the history of my country.  " A book on the Holocaust and the history, culture, and politics of Nazi Germany."  I'm glad to see that a book was written on the Nazis but I didn't like this one. I found it a bit too academic and very dry, which I don't usually like. I would not recommend this book for a class or general reading. It is too dry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that it is a poor example of science fiction.   I did not find much to like in this book.  The characters were the typical clichéd aliens, but I found the story boring.  There was nothing new here.  I just wish the story had been more engaging.  It's a very short book and very easy to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I bought this book for my wife as a Christmas present. I am a huge fan of Stephen King and I had to give him a shot. I can't believe that I gave him my money, but the book didn't live up to my expectations. It's the story of a boy, who is taken to a small town in New England where he is told that he can find answers to his questions in the form of a book that is a portal to the past. The boy eventually does find a book, but as soon as he reads it, the world around him changes. I was a little disappointed because the book seemed to be about a girl, but when she finally does find the book, it seems like she didn't find anything. The girl eventually does learn the answers she needs to understand her past. I thought the book was a lot of fun, but I can only recommend it to the fan of King.  "The Shining" (1977)   Reviewer: Lorna  Rating:  Review: I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so I was excited to get this book. It was a nice surprise that it was a re-telling of the book "The Shining". I was pretty excited, too, because I've always loved the movie. However, the re-writing of the film's ending really killed it for me. I have never read the book that it is based on, but even though I didn't like the ending of the movie, I still felt cheated that the book ended on a bad note. This book was definitely better than the movie! It didn't feel like it was trying to be the book and the movie; it was just its own thing. The ending was a bit disappointing, but then again, the movie was much better than this book!  Reviewer's Comment:  (From a reviewer who reviewed this book in 2007)  Read it again and again, but only with a light hand, as there are a few points of irritation that are quite hard to overlook. A great book, worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back in 2008 and I thought it was fantastic! This book had so much to offer! It was the best book I've ever read! The characters were so well developed and believable! I was shocked when I read the last few pages. The author had gone on a journey to learn more about what really happened to her father and her family and it was so well done! This is the first book I have ever read in which the author really made me feel like I was in her shoes!

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I had the opportunity to read a copy of "Dune" the other day, and I am still trying to decide if it is a good book or not. It's a long book, and it's hard to follow, even though the author is really clear on what he is trying to do. The world building is fantastic, and the characters are well developed. Unfortunately the story is weak, as the characters don't develop in the way you would expect. I don't know if it was just my copy or if it happens to a lot of people, but some characters seemed like they were written by two different people, which made it hard to understand their motivations or how they interacted with the people around them. There were also times when I didn't feel like the author was trying to be as original as possible, as his world building was just so standard and bland. So, overall I'd say it's a good read, but you won't be blown away by it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not worth it. I was looking forward to reading it, and it ended up being more of a drag than a joy. I didn't like the main characters. They had little depth to them, and they were so dull that it wasn't fun reading them. I don't know why the author wrote about the same old plot points over and over again. The author's writing style and his descriptions are boring. I had the same problem with my other books. I can't get into any of them. The only reason I still read them is that I love to have an escape from reality and this is my favourite kind of book. I am hoping that this book is a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I read this book on my way to college, and it is a good introduction to the history of the Roman Empire. The author explains that the Romans were a highly educated, and yet they were in a period of decline when they became decadent, greedy and corrupt. This was the time of Caesar and the Fall. The book is well written, and I loved the information given about the Roman culture. I found it to be very helpful and interesting. I would recommend this book to any history lover. I will read other works by this author in the future. It is well worth the time and effort.   Recommended: *************

I was expecting a bit more, but there are enough good things in the book to make up for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   It is an interesting study of the human psyche and psychology. However, I would like to see a better explanation of how it works, since it does not work on my end. I would have liked to know how the "mind is not only a physical substance but also a mental one." and how this is why people tend to get lost in their own minds when their lives start to go off the rails. I think that this is an easy book to read but I would love to see something a little more technical to really make it all make sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a horrible attempt to tell a story with a bunch of clichés, bad dialogue, and a poorly written story. There are a lot of problems with the story: the main character is boring, the plot is very poorly developed, the world is not very detailed, and the writing is horrible. The main character, the female main character in the book is described as "silly" by the author, but it is not explained why she is that way. In the book she says she is a "big girl" who has a crush on the guy and the guy tells her she is too small. This book tries to make the story about a guy and his crush on a girl, but the book really isn't that. The story is about a girl who wants to be loved and be loved by someone, and that's it. This author clearly had a very bad idea on how to tell such a story, but that is the main reason I gave this book 2 stars. I did enjoy reading this book, but I don't think this story was worth my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* ************* This book is the worst book I have ever read. I really enjoyed it but the ending was horrible. It was just a bunch of cliches. I could not believe it took me a while to read this book because it had so much potential. I am really disappointed and wish I had never purchased this book. It is just too bad that people buy this book for their children. It really didn't do any good to me.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first few pages of this book were extremely disheartening and disappointing, and I was already a bit let down by the book's second half. I was initially disappointed by how the main character was treated. She was a poor, abused girl who was abused and abandoned by her mother, and now she is the one that needs the most care and attention. Her father was killed in the war and now he was never around for her. She is also being treated unfairly, as she has to live off of the charity's income as a housewife, and yet it is a man who is the most worthy of her love and attention, and who also is in the same situation as her. I wanted her to be able to get her life back together and be independent. And then it got even worse. The man she was to marry turned out to be a violent sociopath who was abusive to her, and she still couldn't escape him. I didn't even like his sister as much as he did. I felt that the author, or at least the part of her that writes the story, had a very skewed perspective. I thought that the main characters were supposed to be flawed, yet here they were all perfect. They're perfect in a way that they are not human. And I felt as though I had been robbed. The ending was also very disappointing. I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I never got a clear picture of the author's feelings on the characters. I also felt as if I had wasted a lot of time. It would have been better if I hadn't read this book at all. I have been looking forward to the next book, but I won't be re-reading it. I can't wait for the next novel in this series to come out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm still not over how awful this book is. The story is the weakest part. I understand the story is a romance and that it's a "chosen one" story but I didn't care enough about the relationship to care about it. I have nothing but the most negative things to say about this book and will not be buying it again. 3 out of 5 stars T.C.B. It was good. The plot was interesting and the characters were interesting, but I can't really get behind the romance aspect. I'm going to pass. 4 out of 10 stars Tasha I found this book to be very interesting. The worldbuilding was interesting. It had an interesting, original plot and the main character was well-developed. However, the romance did not work for me. The main couple didn't really click with me. I felt like there were more character development in the book. Also, there was a lot of self-admiration. It's hard to take that in when the main couple were so self-centered. 5 out of 6 stars Lisa I really like this book! The main character is very unique, and there's a lot to like about her. The characters were also very well developed. This is the first book I've read by the author and I think it's one of the best I've ever read. 1 out of 2 stars Michelle I didn,t really like the book at all. It wasn't very good, it's very hard to follow. The whole plot seemed to be about the main love interest and how much she was doing to get him to love her. I didn' t really care about the romance at all and I was confused and frustrated when the romance didn't go anywhere. I know there's some romance in the story but it wasn't what I was expecting. 2 out of 4 stars A.M. This book was not very good. I thought the author was doing a good job writing about a very complex world and the love story that is really complicated. But I felt that the story fell apart when it was time to discuss the love relationship. The romance was just so shallow and didn't interest me. But the main relationship was just confusing. I really wanted to love the main characters but I just didn't. This was the worst book I have ever read by this author. 7 out of 11 stars K.H. I loved this book. The author has such
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ I'm sure I'm going to get flamed for this but I have to say that the book is about as good as I could have expected. It was nice to see that she was a little more open about her personal life. I'm sure she'd have been more open if the story were more personal, but I suppose this book was more about the people she's known and what they're like. It didn't really seem to be an autobiography, but rather a kind of story of friendship.   The book is a very good description of the kind of people she met during her time in the army, and her own relationships. Some of the guys she dated were pretty good-looking, but most of them weren't, and the ones who were were just plain ugly. There were a few guys who looked like they could have been in some cheesy 90's movie and she wasn't going to sleep with them, but she found that it didn't matter. They were nice guys.  -She got a little jealous when the guys were trying to find other girls for themselves. It seemed like she was trying to date some of them and not others.  's story is really a story of friendships, and while it's true that they were good friends at times, it's also true that it was hard for them to make a life together, because they were both pretty messed up in their own ways. I think it's the kinder part of the book where she talks about her parents and her sister. She describes how her parents were really nice people, but they were really sick, and it made it hard for her to get over the fact that she wasn. Her sister was always saying that she should have gone to college so she could have a better life, but it seems like she just couldn't get her mind to let that happen. It's kind of sad how she had to give up on her dreams and go out and fight and be a warrior for her country. She felt like she had failed her family.  . She's pretty much done with military life, and she's decided that she wants to become a nurse. She finds that her work as a nurse is way more rewarding than her time as a soldier, so she's willing to do whatever it takes to be a nurse, and eventually she gets a job as a receptionist.  The main problem with this book is that it's just a lot of a story about the guys that
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I just bought this book. The book was very well written, but it was very confusing, and the story didn't really connect to my memory of the books I've read. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I'm not sure how I got it, but I'm sure it wasn't in a bookstore.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ ___________   The book is really good. But the writing is bad. I like to write my reviews with quotes because I know that if you read the whole thing, you will get a good understanding of my feelings on a subject. Well, I don't know what to say about the writing, other than it was bad.   I was really looking forward to this book because I really loved the first one. The second one, I was a little disappointed. I was so looking forward because I thought it would be even better. And then I read the last book, and it just didn't do it for me.   and now I have a bunch of books to read before I read this one.  , not that it is a bad read. I have enjoyed the books before and I am sure I will enjoy the one after.   the characters are a little weak but I understand why they are that way. I just wish I didn't have to have so many characters in the book to make it interesting.   The last book was so good. I really enjoyed that book but it did not do it this time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I purchased this book for my mother. She is a college graduate with a master's degree in social work. She has been reading and studying for about a year and a half. She did not like this book. It is written for those who are not comfortable in the classroom and it is a very long book, with an abundance of notes and diagrams, but I found it very hard to understand. I don't have any problems with the material. I just think that the style of teaching was not what I would have liked. My mother didn't like the grammar and I felt that it was hard to read. I will not buy this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I would like to give a quick warning to those who might want to read this book, because I will not be responsible for the book's destruction. I've never met a book I couldn't throw out on a whim. It's full of horrible, pointless, pointless ideas. This book was just one of those. A lot of it is about people having sex, so it's not just about sex either, but a lot of the stories were about having sex with other people. I really don't like the premise of the book. It just got me wondering why anyone would want to have sex with people they don't know well enough to get an erection. The last part of the story is about a man who wants to be a big shot. The story is actually about a sex addiction. I don't understand why this is a thing in our society."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read so many bad books I can't keep track. I really wish that I could give this book one star but I can only give it two. The book is very long but that is only because there are so many details to cover. I was so excited about reading the book and I kept getting distracted because the book was so detailed. The first half of the book is mostly about the characters and their lives. There is a lot of detail and I liked the story line that was told. It was really interesting and the book really got my interest. There were some plot holes but I'm not sure if it is a plot hole if the author didn't know how to write. I feel like there were a lot more plot holes that were explained later on. After the second half of this book, I felt that I was just reading about someone else's life and I wasn't really invested in the story. I felt like there was a lot to be said but it wasn't very good. I wish that the author would have added more detail. I just feel like it was just a waste of time.

I get that a lot of people find it hard to believe that a book could be good when it is so bad. I'm just as surprised that people seem to find a good book to be good as the other way around. This book was actually very interesting to me because it is written by someone who has a good amount of experience in the publishing industry. I was not expecting the book to actually be very good. I wasn't expecting to hate it either. I actually enjoyed a lot the book because I am a fan of the genre that the author writes in. The book is not terrible. I don't think I'll read it again but it is a good read that I am sure I will read in the future.   The book is actually divided into 3 parts: The Story, the characters and the world. The story is told through the character of Lila
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read many, many books, but this is one of the worst ones I've ever had to put down. I was reading this book for my husband when I came across the part where she describes a friend's daughter having a miscarriage. She writes about how the daughter was the only child in a family of four children and the only one who did not receive a birth certificate for her first child because she was a boy. Then she goes on to say that this girl became a "happily married woman with three children" and she was "living a happy, prosperous life." This is a sad and terrible story. I don't know why she felt the need to write it, but she does. I found the ending to be incredibly cruel. I feel that it is the main reason she was unable to write another book. It made me sick to my stomach. Rating: 1/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- ------------------------- 1/5 --------------------------- I'm giving this book three stars because I found it very interesting. I was expecting it to be an easy read. It was hard for me to get through it. There were some good points, but I had trouble with some of the details. I do not know how the author plans to wrap this up. It seemed like there were too many loose ends that had not been tied up. I found myself wondering what happened next. This book was written so well and had so much plot it made me wonder what is next. The book was a bit hard to put down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful. The plot is badly written, and is very hard to follow. There are a number of characters that are all incredibly annoying and they don't add up to anything. The world building is very poor. I don't know how much of this world and time is going to be explained and how much is just a set up for later events. The characters are extremely shallow. I didn't care for any of them. I think there is a lot of potential in this story, but this is a terrible book. The ending is unsatisfying and doesn't feel as good as the rest of the book. I highly recommend this to the fans of the Dresden Files and Harry Potter series. I would love to read a book where the main characters are all Harry/Dresden types. I just don't feel like this book has the same potential.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book I've read from J.K. Rowling. I had no idea what to expect and I had a hard time finding this book. The book starts out strong with a story about a little girl who doesn't want to go to the magical school. The next chapter, though, is the worst I've ever read. The story turns into a book about the girl's relationship with a boy. It's all about him and how he's ruining the girl and making her cry. I think the main reason I didn't enjoy this book is because of how it turned into a story of a girl and a boy who are in love with each other. This is not what I wanted to read. I didn.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to read this book but after reading it I feel the author doesn't know what he is doing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The writing is not terrible. The characters are fleshed out nicely. The story is very interesting, and I was intrigued by how it would unfold. I'm glad it ended. However, the ending was too rushed, too obvious and too out there. It was hard to believe in the end, especially since I knew the book was not going to end well. I had to stop reading after the final scene. It's a shame, because the author was a decent writer. I thought the ending would be interesting, but I guess it wasn't. The bad writing and poor pacing are what stopped me from giving it 5 stars.  Helpful to those who are looking for a good, exciting read. I like that the story is set in the early 20th century, because it feels real and gives you a feeling for what the world was like then. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because of the ending. I liked the story, but there were too many plot holes that I was left wondering where the story would go next. It ended too abruptly, and left me disappointed. The ending just didn't add up, and leaves me wondering what could have been if the author took his time and really built up the tension throughout the story. This book is definitely worth a read, but you should be patient and take it slowly.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I don't know why I bothered to read this book. I wanted a story about two young women who are forced to marry each other to keep their families in order. But the author spends way too much time explaining what marriage is, how to find a good husband, and the dangers of cheating. They never seem to have much time for each other. The only character who seemed interesting was the man. I don 't know why the author decided to have the woman spend a lot of time on a man. He didn 't seem like the type who would be good at his job and keep the house in order, and I would have liked to see more from him. I also felt like the main character was just there to make her father seem like a bad man and the woman's family seem like they're just as bad. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but it is only one of many in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   I liked the concept, and the characters were likable, but the story was too simple and the ending was rushed.   This is a good book to read in a row. If you do not like action, read a different book. If it is a suspenseful book, read something else.   I would recommend this book for an action-oriented fantasy read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just boring and I have to force myself to read it. The plot is simple, just an old man wants to leave his wife and child behind. What's so interesting is that this old man has no choice in the matter, no choice but to follow his heart. This is why this book is so bad: the story is nothing but old man trying to follow the feelings of his heart and his children, but what do they want him to do? Rating: 5/10 I think the only good thing about this book was the fact that it was written in a very short story form (3 pages), which allows you to read more at a slower pace. It makes the reading experience more comfortable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book very confusing and the author didn't explain things well enough. I can't really find any logic in the world that the protagonist goes on the quest to be the greatest fighter in the universe. She was the only one with any talent. I think the book's premise is good, but I felt like the characters and plot were not. I found the whole thing to be too cliche, but that's just me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the writing sucks! It is as if the authors were trying to make the most of the fact that this book was written in the 1960s, when the Vietnam War was still raging. It was an era when men did not read.  The characters have no personality or personality traits to them at all. They are all stereotypical stereotypes, and the author has nothing new to say about them. The writing is terrible and it is one of the worst books I have ever read. I will never go back to this book." I just read this book. And I hated it. There was just so much to hate about this book, and so much I wished I had not read it at all, but it is an extremely poor read.  It is the most poorly written book I have read in years. It starts off so well. The setting is a college campus. There are two main characters. One is a girl and the other is a boy. The two main girls have different interests and backgrounds and have to come together in order to achieve their goals. They start out on a relationship that goes well, but then the author gets them all to act out in a ridiculous play that is very poorly written. The plot is pretty much nonexistent in this book as well. It is a bad attempt at comedy and it doesn't work. The only thing I can think of about the plot is that it was written to make us laugh at how bad the characters are, and I guess I can see that, but I don't think it is a good way to write a book. The other characters are all very stereotypical and the one that is the main character is extremely shallow and unlikable. One of the reasons why I really hate this book is that the author never explained how the college works. I don' t understand how there are classes or anything like that. It just seemed like a big plot hole that was never explained. The writing is very bad. I didn't think there was much to it at first, but when I was reading, I couldn't stop laughing at the horrible writing and awful characters. It doesn't make much sense to me, but at the same time I can't really complain about it because it is so poorly written that it is worth the read. It wasn't bad enough to be good, but there was no way it was good. I have not seen this book since
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a bad story.  I enjoyed it because of its premise, but it was poorly written.  The plot is a simple one: A young boy gets his hands on a magic book that can make anyone who touches it happy.   The author tries to use the book to make a quick buck by selling the books to children.  I found the book boring and uninteresting.  It was a little too slow to get going and the author did not really flesh out the world enough.  The story was also kind of repetitive.  This book was really only good because of the premise, not because of any other part of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as a gift and had no idea what to expect from it. I had no expectations for this book at all but was hoping for a good novel. I have to say I was disappointed. I don't even want to read another book by the author (and don't expect any other book from her either). This book is about a girl named Shiri who goes to live with her grandmother after her parents are killed in a car accident. I guess you could call her a princess for being a princess in this book. Her grandmother is an alcoholic and is a bit crazy. She doesn't know how to be a good mom but she still does everything she can to be with her grandson. She spends a lot of time with her granddaughter and gets her into a lot trouble with his friends. I just thought it was a bad read. The only reason why I read this book was because I'm a sucker for stories about the poor and the homeless. I like reading about the plight of these people, but this book doesn't give me any hope or a positive outlook. I just thought this book wasn't very interesting and that the characters in it were boring. The protagonist is also annoying and annoying characters don't get me interested in anything. I think the author did a good job making the reader sympathize with Shiri but at the same time, I didn't really care about her and it just got tiresome and annoying. Recommendation: don't read this unless you are a fan of a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say I enjoyed this book, but the way I felt about it was less than positive.  It seemed to me that this was an attempt to write an action novel.   The main character is a woman, but that's the least of it.  She is a very passive character.  In fact, she was very passive in this book.  There are some really awesome, interesting and engaging things that happen in this novel. It is the writing of this book that was the problem, however.  I think the author wrote her character a certain way that is not realistic.  As a woman with a husband and children I would like to see my female characters do more than sit back and do nothing.  It seems like the author thought she had to write a woman as an action hero because she wanted to.  This is not a realistic way to write women, and I am not sure why she thought it was a good idea.  Her character does not have to be an action heroine to make a story interesting.  What she needed was more time to grow and learn, and to make mistakes and grow from them.  My husband and I had to sit through this book because we were both sick of the passive female characters and this author seemed to be a huge fan of passive female protagonists.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, although good in parts, is an utter failure as a work of speculative fiction. It was badly written, poorly paced, and filled with poor characterization and a terrible plot. The only good thing about the book was the author's wit and the way he used his knowledge of the science of genetics to make his point. The book, however, is a poor read because it is simply too long and it is very difficult to keep up with the action. The characters, although well drawn and well developed, are a mess, and the story is just a mess. I would only recommend this book to people who are interested in the genetics and genetic engineering aspect of this story. 9 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I was very disappointed in this book. It was poorly written, with some poor grammar, and poor pacing. There was a lot of repetition, which I thought was a good thing for the first half, as it kept me on my toes and gave me something to look forward to in the second half, but after a while it became repetitive. The story is the usual "hero saves the world, and then goes off on a long journey, and everything is all downhill from there" but I didn't find it all that interesting. And it was really hard to get into, as the story didn't have enough character development, or really interesting ideas to explore. I'm sure I will like it once I finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem is the writing style. The main character is a girl who's pretty much an imbecile. The girl doesn't get anything done and constantly gets herself into trouble. The guy in the story is just a loser who's a pain in the ass. The book is also written in a style that is hard to follow and is so verbose that the reader doesn't know what's going on. It's a really annoying book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I read this book in one day, and I am still not completely over it. The book is basically about the effects of an infection. The infection is actually the death of a man who is a "skeptic" and who thinks that the whole "science" about how the universe is all connected is "just a big lie".   The whole book, though, seems to focus on the problem with the infection: the virus. The problem with this virus, however, is that it seems to be a virus that is killing everyone in a very specific area, and there is no way to stop it. That leaves you with two choices: you can either give up on science and hope that some day science will come up with a cure, or you can fight the infection by using a device that is used to kill the virus by "dissolving" it.   Well, there is a problem with that, too. The cure is a cure that is very easy to create, and a lot cheaper than the whole process of "dipping" the virus in a solution and dissolving it. It's just a matter of finding a way to make it. Of course, that leaves the person who has the cure without a way of getting rid of it, and that leaves everyone who has been infected without a cure.   in the end, the solution is just another way of "killing the virus". The people who have the cure are basically just left with "deadly infections" that are killing them, while the people who are infected and have no cure are just left like the "living dead" or something. I am sorry that I did not enjoy this book as much as I could have.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I'm very disappointed with this book. I'm an avid reader, but this book did not impress me. I didn't understand the book at all. I mean, I was trying to follow along, but it just wasn't the book I was looking for. I was hoping it would be an interesting and informative book, but I think the author just forgot about the book and just went with the plot. I did like the concept of the book, which is that "everywhere is the devil". It's a nice thought, but the plot and characters don't mesh well. There is one scene where one of the characters, a very powerful person, goes to a party and is not invited. When she tries to get invited, the people are afraid she's going to spill the beans about the evil, so they all go after her and try to force her into staying away. So, she is forced to leave and she ends up at a motel, where a couple of characters from the book are trying to force a young woman into being a prostitute. She tries to tell them she is a woman who is not like the other women, but they won't listen and try again and again to get her to do what they want her to. It's just very cliche. It was very, very boring and I didn the book over and over and I was just so frustrated. I wanted to get to the next scene, but instead I just had to wait for the next chapter. It felt like this was just a rushed attempt to get some money out of the story, rather than a proper book.   I also thought the cover art was very bad. The picture looked very out of date. It looked like the author had taken a photo of a bunch of pictures from the 1970s and just pasted them on a poster board. I felt it was really offputting and not very good.   the book: 1) There were a lot of scenes where I wanted the author to tell me something. But he never really tells us anything. He just goes through the motions and tells us the action. He didn't even bother to include a character's name, so you don't even know if it's a good or bad character, if they're a good character or bad. 2) The ending didn't make sense to me. Why did the character get involved with the devil in the first place? I mean she has already been forced to do bad things by
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a good book, but I did enjoy it. There is nothing interesting about it. I wish the author had done a better job with the character. The guy just doesn't have any depth to him. It's like he was written in a hurry. The writing is pretty good too. I just wish I'd read the first few chapters of the book before giving it a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   It is hard to get to grips with this book. It is not clear what the message is, and it is not always clear what is being explained. It was difficult to follow the argument and was difficult for me to accept what I had read. I was frustrated.   The author, I believe, thinks that all books are bad, and so this book is an attack on all books, in all genres, because it is a "book about books". That's just rubbish. The author also thinks that there is a difference between good books and bad books. But it is really about how many of the authors are really terrible, so that it is hard for me not to agree with them.   "The author is also very quick to point out that he is not saying this book does not deserve to be written, only that it deserves to be read." But it was clear that the book was not written well, and in the way it was written it was very difficult to understand. It did not really feel like a story.  . The story is about a girl who goes to visit her parents, who are dying of cancer. The parents are dying in the last months of their lives, and the parents don't want their child to go to the funeral, because she is going to be dead before they can be reunited. So they are willing to let her go to visit them, because if she visits them at the last minute they will have a final farewell.   the parents do not know they are dying, but the girl does. It has some pretty sad moments, and I found it hard to feel sorry for them. I also found the ending to be a little disappointing. The character is not a strong character and the ending just feels forced. I felt that there could have been a better ending.   a better book would have been good enough for me, I guess.     I think the best way to explain the message in this book would be to read some of the reviews and comments by other people who have read the book. They all seem to agree that the author does not really understand what he is talking about, but he is so determined to prove that he does understand what it is that makes a book good.   and I agree with him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited to find this book, but it really was a let down. The characters were poorly written. It's so hard to relate to these characters. The book seemed to be about a woman who can't get over a bad relationship with her father. I didn't really get what the problem was, or why she felt so sad. I was hoping she was going to be able to break up with him, or that she would find love again in another man. The author didn't know how to convey her feelings, or the reason why she was so sad, or even what a good relationship looks like. I think I was just expecting more of a happy ending, so I didn' t enjoy this book as much as I expected. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry but this book is a massive waste of time.  If you're looking for a great sci-fi novel that explores the concept of mind reading and the implications of technology and how they may be used to manipulate people and influence people's behavior this book isn't for you.    The first time I read it I was immediately intrigued but when the author tried to explain mind reading to me it became clear to me that this wasn't a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think I'll ever find another book like this one again. This book is so well written and I really like it. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it. The book is written so well and I have no reason to not read more. This is the best book I've read in a long time and it has the best beginning and ending. I can't wait for the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________, This book was not as bad as I had expected. It was just a good read, not that bad. The book is about a man who decides to take his own life, and the problems that follow. The problems are not the main thing I did not like. The main thing was the characters. I have never heard a man say so many awful things in so many different ways. The writing style is terrible, the story is not the best but not the worst either. The characters were a little too "weird", I think. One character, "Mr. Smith", seems to think that he is in love with his wife, and one character, Mr. W., seemed to be in love. The story, like the writing, was just not good enough for me. I really want to read the sequel, but it was not available at the time.   The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4, is that I felt that it was just good enough. The first book was much better. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story, but who is not so bothered by the horrible writing that I am.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ is an excellent book. However, as a non-Christian, I would have preferred to be able to skip over the Christian stuff and focus on the historical stuff instead. The author is a great writer and I enjoyed the historical aspects of his story. However...I felt like I had to read it to understand the Christian themes. It was a difficult read. If you want to read about Christianity, you should definitely read this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book is not worth the time or money. The author has a tendency to write long, incoherent paragraphs about nothing. The story is not very well written. I feel like the author just wanted to create a lot of trouble for himself and it doesn't work.   Overall rating: _________________   This is a short book. It has a lot going on in it, but it's hard to keep track of it all.  's story is basically a story about a man named "Joe" who has a very peculiar problem. Joe's problem is that he is not able to remember anything he has done in the past. It's the same problem as people who have aphasia or other forms of dementia. Joe also has a habit of going out on the town and forgetting what he did in there.   and the book starts out with this: "Joe had a problem with remembering things." He goes out on a trip to see some old friends, and while on the way he loses a lot (as a person) and finds some new ones.  . The only reason he is able to retain this information is because of the drug he takes to keep his memory clear. It works, but for some reason, it's a very weak drug, and he keeps on forgetting things. It eventually makes him see his friend, who he thought was dead, but was actually alive and well in an entirely different place.    This is where the story begins to get interesting. As the story continues, we find out that "Joe's" problem is not just a little thing like a little memory loss. It is a very, very severe problem.   And the problem gets more and more severe as the story goes on. It gets to the point where "Joe was getting worse and worse every day. Joe had forgotten what he had done, but he had no idea how or why it had happened. Joe was becoming a complete wreck." And, after a while, the whole town is finding out about Joe's condition and thinking that it's because of some sort of curse. And the people in town aren't sure why the town seems to have such a high rate of "disappearance" cases. But, Joe has something that everyone else doesn't: "He was a highly intelligent, successful man with a promising career in a prestigious company." The people who are most worried about him aren't doctors, psychologists, or psychotherapists. It turns

I would have been better off reading something else._____________________________It was a very good read and very easy to follow. It had a nice variety of characters, even if I didn't know them well. There was a lot of action and excitement as the story unfolded. It was well written and I enjoyed it.______________________________If you liked this book, I recommend checking out my book, 'Saving a Princess' which follows the same basic concept of the first book but in a different world. It has the same characters, same setting and all of the same plot elements, however, it's a very different book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The first time I saw this book I thought I was going to have a stroke. It's just so...  "There is a place in the heart where the past is like a bad dream, a nightmare, a place where you can forget about the present."   ... , so I was all excited about this book. Then I got through the first few pages and I thought "No way am I going to finish this book." I'm a fan of the Dresden Files and I always thought that if I read more of his stuff I'd find a good series to pick up. This book had so many flaws I was almost giving it one star. I can understand wanting to write something different, but this is the only thing I can think of that I could call an epic fantasy novel that doesn't fall flat.   I didn't read the other two books in this series, so it's hard for me to judge them. I'm not really sure if it's the book's faults that made me not enjoy it, but I also didn't like it. I've read the first book in the series, and found it to be great. It just didn't seem that way to me.   the only redeeming feature is that the series is long, so you might want to pick it up twice before you run out of steam.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book. I really liked this.  The only thing that was a let down was that I expected to find a better version of this. It was not the worst book I have ever read, but it was not great either. I would still recommend this to a friend and I will look for a copy to read myself.  I am so glad I read this book, because it is a great read!  I loved the first chapter and found myself really interested in the story, but I didn't want to put the book down.   The main characters in this book are good.  They are all real people and I was really interested to know their story.  I found that I liked the book more when the plot developed more and more.    I also liked the story because I really enjoyed the author's words. I have to say, that if I could have any book, I would like this book!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book because I'm really into the whole fantasy genre. It's one of those things I just had to read because I love fantasy. The book itself was ok but I was expecting much more. The characters are pretty dull. I did like how the main character didn't seem like she was a main character. The story is really repetitive so it's hard to keep reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a family member. It was the only thing I could find that had any information on what to do with a child with a severe eating disorder. The author does not use her own experiences with an eating disorder, but gives us a lot of information on how to deal with eating disorders in children. She does not give a child a diagnosis or anything, but it does give a lot info on what we should do if we find our child with an extreme eating disorder (which, yes, most of them do). I think this book is excellent and I would recommend it to everyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is great and the characters are a lot more interesting than I expected. However, the plot holes are too big to ignore, especially when you have a good plot and a good, solid ending. I really wanted to love this book but I just couldn't. The ending was way too abrupt. If I'd known this was going to happen I would have read it before I started to read the book and then made a note in my diary about how much I disliked it before finishing it. 5/10.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, I'm a huge fan of the original series, but I didn't find it all that good here. I was disappointed that the plot had such a different feel from the original trilogy. I would've loved a sequel that focused on a whole new cast of characters. There are also a couple of plot holes that were unexplained.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book.  It had great plot, great characters, great writing, and it made me feel as if I was in a real time and place, like a true crime book. However, the book did not really live up to the hype.   The main character was a bit too strong.  I found her to be a bit over the top and not as believable as she should have been.  Also, I felt like her husband was overbearing and annoying.  While I think I liked her a lot, I just did not like the way her husband acted and her husband's behavior, which was not what I expected.  And then there is the fact that the book was very slow to begin with, even if the plot was good.  Overall, I found the book to be okay.  It had good story, characters, and writing, but the pacing was just not there and it really was just a bad idea that just didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "the book is filled with boring characters and repetitive plot lines. " My review:  A very enjoyable book about an adventure in a very interesting and unusual place. The story takes place in a village in a country that is not as developed as the main characters from this novel would like. The village is a bit weird and the atmosphere is very unique. A young man named Peter, who has been orphaned since childhood and has been on the run for a long time, is looking for his father who he has never met. He is very intelligent, cunning, and has a good sense of humor. He meets a girl named Astrid who seems to be his only friend. They decide to travel together and get information about their father and their mother. While doing so, they are confronted by the villagers who have a different opinion about the man they call Peter and Astrids mother. The villagers are not too nice, they think that Astrides mother was a whore and her father is a coward. They hate Peter and think he is a disgrace to their society. Astride even takes her own life. Peter is now on the road and wants to get his revenge against the people who have hated him for years. I loved the characters of Peter and his mother, they were very interesting. As I was reading the book I was really impressed with the setting of the story. I think that this novel has been written well and I think it will be an interesting read for people who like the genre of paranormal/mystery.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I bought this book for my boyfriend's birthday. I love books that make you think. I have a very open mind. This book was very disappointing to me. I liked the premise. I had heard so many good things about this book. I was excited to read this book, because I have been trying to find a good romance novel that will have a good plot. I am a sucker for a good story and I was expecting the story to be very good. I think this book did a poor job at delivering the story. The book was confusing. The characters felt very generic. I couldn't tell you a thing about the two main characters. The romance is so shallow. The story was very predictable. I don't know how the author could have thought this book would be a good one, if the story was so predictable. It didn't help that the author has a very poor sense of humor. She makes fun of herself in the book, and she makes fun about her readers in the end. It's hard to like this book and be surprised by the end, because the ending was not a surprise to me at all. I can't say I didn't enjoy the book. It was a fun read. I just wish I would have known that this was just another one of those books that I should skip and try again. I did read this for my own pleasure. But I think I should have read it first and read it as a fan of romance. I know it's supposed to be funny, but it just didn't work for me.  12 of 12 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ I bought this book because I was going to have to read a book in preparation for my upcoming career in journalism. This book did not meet my expectations at all. It was so much information that I felt that it was not going to make me a better journalist. The author doesn't do a good job of explaining anything that she doesn't know about. The writing is very dry and uninspiring. I don't see how someone could possibly make it as a journalist in the current climate of misinformation. I am disappointed in this book, as I thought it was going make me look smart. I will not be recommending this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- The book is very good and well written. It would have been better if the author had added more details about the history of the book. The book starts out with a lot of information and then just dumps it all out in one paragraph. It just becomes confusing. Also the first half of the story is too slow to be really interesting. The author is good at making you want to keep reading but he could have condensed some of the more complex details so that the reader wouldn't have to think about them. He could have added more detail about how the author became a spy, what she did during her time in the army, her time on the train to Germany and more. There are also some parts that are very hard to follow and it would have made the book better. I can't recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not one for spoilers, but I will say that there is no way in the world this is going to make me enjoy the book as much as I did the first. This was the first book that I read where I felt as if I was reading the story of a child rather than a grown man. The writing style was a bit rough and it made the story seem even more like a child's story. This book is a great read for those who love a good story, but it's not going to be a good read for everyone else.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  This book is so terrible that I almost gave it 4 stars instead of 2. I have read all the Harry Potter books, and I am not a big fan of the Potter books. They seem to be made by the same people that made The Twilight Saga, and that is just not my thing. I mean I have heard great things about them, but I just don't think they're worth my time. I don't know if it's the characters, the plot, or the books themselves. This book is just bad. I will say that I am a fan of a good romance, and this book was definitely not a good one. I was actually pretty turned off by it. I thought that if there was a story here then I would like it. It just felt like a cheap romance. I can see how it could have been a nice story. I just didn't think that it was. I didn't know what to think about it. If it wasn't a bad romance, I might have read it again. I guess it was just so bad that I can't imagine reading it again in a good mood.  I am sorry to have to give this book 2 stars. I know it is hard to review a book that I know I will hate. It's not like I will be reading it to my husband or my children. I am writing this review for myself, but it has to be said. I'm sure it won't bother anyone that is reading this review, but just wanted to let people know that I did not like this book. I hope that they don't mind that I do. It isn't a very nice book to read either, and if it isn't bad then it isn of high quality.  the review is long but I wanted to say that this book really wasn't bad. It was just very bad.

The plot is very interesting, I liked that the main character was a scientist, and he went on a journey, where he meets his wife. I like that this story took place on the Moon, and it was a good read. The plot was interesting. But the ending was horrible, and I couldn't stand it. I liked the first part, but that part just killed it for me. The ending was very cliche, and really sad, and the whole book seemed to be about his death and the way he was remembered. I also didn't like the way the author used the phrase, "I don't even remember what happened last time I saw her". I just didn't find the book good, or a good use of space in my reading.   is a book about a scientist who gets kidnapped, and a lot of people think he is dead, and then he comes back. He is the only person left alive in the entire planet. I thought it was an interesting story, and was a fun read, it had a good pace, and kept me interested. But it was also very predictable, and sad.

She told me it was because she was "too busy to have sex." She said she was so bored with sex that she didn't feel like it.  I was a good, hard-working boy at the time and I got it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book. This book is a complete failure, as far as I can tell, at trying to capture the real experience of a real war. I thought I would enjoy it because I had seen it described in books and on television but this is simply a total waste of time. It is a story of a couple who have a baby, get into an accident and lose the baby. The woman is in a coma and is only able to give birth by having a caesarian section. This is where the book starts. After the birth of their child the couple is told that they are to be discharged. They go back to their home town in France and are given a week off. The wife is devastated by this, she has no one to look after her, she is in an unhappy marriage and is just getting on in life. So when the husband comes back to France he is very depressed. When the husband returns he finds the baby gone. He decides to look for it and find out who stole it and what they were doing with it. He finds a man who has been living in a cottage on the outskirts of the town. The man has a young son with him and he is a very nice and loving father. He takes the husband on a trip around the village to find out what has happened to the baby and where the woman is. This trip is a disaster. The husband finds the woman with another man. The other man is in the house with the child. The first man is not a bad person, he just needs help. The second man does not help, he is just a complete bastard. The third man is the worst of all. He is just jealous of the man who took the baby away. When they return the woman gives birth to a baby girl. The two men get into a fight and the wife is hit by a truck. The baby girl is found the next day but the husband has been killed. When he is found he has been decapitated. The book ends with the wife being told that she is pregnant. The reader is left with no answers as to who did this or why. The author seems to have never heard of what a real battlefield was like. The only other thing I found bad about the book was that there was a lot of swearing. If I remember right it was about 2.5 pages. This doesn't seem like that bad a deal when compared to other books I have read. However, the

The main problem with this book is that the story is very predictable. The ending was very predictable as well. The story was really not worth the time I spent reading it.)

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a poor example of a literary fiction novel.  It's an obvious rip off of the Twilight series.      The writing style is just plain old cliched.    The plot is pretty much the same as the original Twilight series, only with less of a plot and a lot more sex.    I did not like the Twilight books at all.  I do not want to say anything bad about the author.  I liked him at first and was hoping that he could do something different.  But he is clearly just a copycat of Twilight and the only thing that makes this one worth reading is that the author is trying. This is a bad novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book, even though I had been promised a "very good read".  For me, this book was a disappointment not just because of the lack of characterization or any sort of character development.  This book is an attempt to be a "good" novel about the Holocaust, and unfortunately it falls short.  "I knew that the end of this world was near, and that I was about to die. I didn't know how I would die, but I knew it was coming. My final moments were as uncertain as the final moments of the greatest of all myths, the epic of Gilgamesh." I don't know if I'd call this a bad novel.    It's not.  The story itself is interesting and the characters are well done.  This is a story about the war, but it doesn't feel as if it's trying to be anything more than that.  It is a book about the end and it does a good job at that. This is the end for the end.  I don' t want to spoil anything, but if you have not read the book, then I suggest you stop reading now, and read the review and go buy the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is very poorly written, and contains a lot of bad information. The most disappointing part of this book was how they described the aliens. The only part of the book I found interesting was the book about the aliens that come into our world. I don't think I will ever understand the alien language, and the whole book has been boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. I really did not like this book. It is a very good example of a'self help' book, but not one I would recommend. I read it with a friend, who was not at all interested in learning how to "be happy" but just wanted to be happy, so this book was not very helpful to him. The main message is that we need to "change our thinking". This is a good message, but if we were to read it to our kids, we would read it as "You need to change your thinking." We would tell them, "Be a good person, because you are a bad person" and we would teach them to "just do it". We would teach kids to just be the best they can be, and to accept their failures and be grateful for their successes. This is what we would tell our kids. But, we do not do that. We do the opposite, and we tell our children that "You are not good enough" and that they need to be more like "the perfect person". We tell them to change themselves into a perfect person, and then we are happy when they do. It just doesn't work that way. It never will work that the way it does in the self help books. I am not a psychologist or a counselor, but I believe that when we tell kids to change their thinking, it is actually teaching them that they are not smart enough to be successful. It will never work. We need to encourage our kids to grow and develop, and that is something that cannot be done by teaching them to just do it. I think the main message in the book was that we should be happy with what we have, because if we aren't happy with ourselves, we don't have to worry about what we will get. This book was very interesting, but it was not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have enjoyed a lot of authors, but this book has been a disappointment. I have read many books that were supposed to be the last word in some field. The last book is what people were going to find in a collection of all-time classics. Well, I'm not so sure that the last book has everything to offer. There are many great books in this collection that have not been touched by this author. The writing style is very simple and repetitive. This book is so repetitive that I have lost interest. The story does not interest me, and the ending is not satisfying. The main characters were all very one-dimensional. The author has a tendency to write a story that has a plot but is so predictable that you could easily predict the conclusion. This is a book that will not be recommended to the general public.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was written in the 1930s but not in the sense that the author is an old pro, she doesn't have a clue about modern issues.  In the 1950s there were no laws on sexual harassment, which was a serious problem in the 70s, and now we have sexual harassment laws.  The author says that the law should be changed but she doesn' t give any examples why the current laws don't work, or why sexual harassment is a problem.  She also states that the solution to the problem is for the men to stop being so pervy and sexual.  This is a ridiculous suggestion and there is no evidence that this will happen.  We are already getting more women in leadership roles because the women have a strong preference for being leaders, that's why we have so many women in positions of power.  If we want women to be leaders then we need to make it so they can't be raped or molested.    The first paragraph in the book is a bit annoying because the author seems to think that we are living in the 1950's again.  It's almost as if the author wants the men who raped her to be considered a great hero, which is a laughable idea and the author would do well to check the facts about her own history.   She also states in the first chapter that women should be taught about their own sexual history and to be able to resist temptation but she ignores the fact that the most important part of any woman's sexual history is her virginity.  I'm glad that she mentions her own experience but she also makes a false statement.    In her book she also claims that her mother had to make her take a bath with a towel over her body and she also says that she had to wear a bathrobe when she was married.  Again, she ignores that her own mother was a very sexual woman.  In her chapter about sex she claims that men are obsessed with sex but she never mentions that she herself has had sex in the shower and on a bed.  Her claim that men can't resist temptation is also a ridiculous idea.  Women can also have a problem with sex, she mentions that her best friend had sex with a man and that it ruined her relationship with her husband.  Even though the husband didn't like it, she still says that it was a mistake.  When I was younger and having problems with my father I would have to try to control
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the story, the characters, and the world building, but the writing was awful. It was hard to follow because there was so much going on, and I couldn't get into the characters. It's a great concept, but I feel like it was a little rushed. I really wanted to like this book, but there were a few plot points that didn't seem to add up.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book, I felt like it was trying to make some point about women in general and it did it very badly. It did have a few good lines but most of it was about women and not about women who are being abused by men, just about how they are perceived by the people around them. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very poorly written. There are too many loose ends and inconsistencies in the story. The plot doesn't progress, it's almost as if they wrote the book to have a beginning, middle, and end. There's no mystery in this book, there's no suspense, no tension, nothing. It's just a book with very little story. I wish they would just stop writing this book. This book was a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why anyone would buy this book. This book was very bad. It's not a bad story in itself. It just doesn't follow through. There is nothing original about it. It is just a story of a man who has to deal with a horrible woman. He doesn't get to spend a lot of time with her because of the fact that he is a man. The rest of the book is just wasted on her and her bad behavior. It should have been a short novel but there was no way it could have been longer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to get into this book, but I was able to get past it, it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.

I can understand why people would think this way, but it wasn  I bought this book for my friend because she has depression. It's a book about people with depression. I think it was written by a therapist. She has a lot of sympathy for people with this disease and she's very open about her depression and her struggles with the disease. I thought the book was really good. There were a lot more characters than I thought. I liked the fact that there were a few people who were very close to the main characters and had to deal with them. I felt like the story was really emotional, I just didn't get all the twists and turns. I just wanted to know what happened next.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book is a horrible piece of trash, I was bored out of my mind throughout. This book is nothing more than a rehash of what's already been done. It's just so boring, I found myself turning it off after I was done. I can't stand the way it's written, it just has too many repetitions and stupid quotes and things I don't understand. I don 't want to go on this book, it's too bad because I would have liked to see how the author's thoughts would have turned out if he had the time to write this book. The author seems to have had too much time on his hands and I hope he's at least learned a little bit from his previous books to avoid the same mistakes again. If you read this book I hope you end up hating it as much as I did.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ I read this book for a summer camp assignment, and it's a complete disaster. The author is clearly not a very good writer, and while the theme is interesting, it's pretty weak. The characters are weak too, with the main character being the worst. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just a waste of time and effort. It's a bit confusing and has a few holes in it. The information on this website is great, but I just found this book very hard to understand. The author has a very strong sense of how the world works. He makes his own arguments, but they are usually not very convincing. The book is hard to follow at times and if you want a really good introduction to the world of Islam, you should read the books by Robert Spencer and Steven Emerson.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read.  It is a very poor novel that will leave you cold, but if you are looking for something good, this is a good choice.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited about this book, and I'm glad I bought it. I think the author has a very good grasp on his subject, and that he presents it well. I was expecting some deep insights on the nature of love and marriage, but the author was much more concerned with the dynamics of marriage. I feel like this book is not very good for a couple that's about to get married, as I don't think it was very interesting or helpful for me. I have a feeling the author is a good writer, but I was disappointed by this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ The only reason I bought this book was for the cover, and for the book's description. I don't care for books that are too wordy, and I usually don't read books that talk about the Bible all that much. I did enjoy this book, however. However, I was disappointed in the cover. The cover shows Jesus and Satan as two men fighting. The back of the book is about how Jesus was able to accomplish what he did, despite his lack of faith. However he did believe in God, but that's it. It's as if he's trying to prove a point. Jesus didn't do anything because he believed in God. The whole book is just about Jesus trying to convince people to accept him and follow him, even though he was rejected by everyone else. The "I am a sinner" part of the story is actually just a part of that "I have to save the world" story. I think he would have been much more convincing if he just just said, "I'm just a soteriose."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- 1) This book is NOT for me. My husband is not a fan of historical fiction. This book was about the Russian Civil War and the war in Afghanistan. I was hoping for a different kind of war book, but not this one. It was not bad, but it was very confusing. I think the author was trying to show us the chaos in both countries but the details were lost. I could have used more information and more insight on both sides. 2) I did like the characters. The way they interacted with each other and with other countries was very interesting. They did what they had to do, but I would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book made me feel like an idiot. I read this in one day and I can't believe that I did this book. I mean, how hard could it be to follow a good book and the end. I felt like I didn't know where to even start. I couldn't even get through the first book, so I had no idea what to expect. This is a book that's good for kids, but it's not for a kid who loves to read. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I felt it was a really hard read. ***********
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment.  It was about a character that I found interesting, but who felt like a cardboard cutout.    The main character was a bit flat and I found her characterization somewhat uninteresting.  She has an odd personality, but I'm not sure I was going to buy into her relationship with her mother.  Also, I feel like the author used a lot of the same tropes and cliches.  The story was well written, but the plot wasn't the reason to read this book.  I would read a different book about a mother and daughter instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I have read the reviews about the book, and so far, they are right. I would have rated this book much lower than it was. But it's just a short story, and I am a little disappointed with it. It is very long, and the story itself is interesting and is a nice change of pace from most of the other books in the genre. The author's style is a little dated, but I think that is just because it is not her first book. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel, "Prophecy" to see what the author has in store.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a decent read, but the ending is so weak.  I really wanted to like the book.   And I did, at least at the beginning.  It was a fast paced read that was a good story to tell.  But the story just ends and doesn't go in any other direction.  The ending just left me a bit disappointed.  But this is a quick read and I'll read more about the book in the future.  Overall, I give this book 3.5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an interesting story about the time that I was working as a secretary in the early 1990s in a small town. I remember being very nervous and uncomfortable in the office. The book has lots of examples that were funny, but I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud at a humor book. This book will keep you on your toes for a good 10 minutes or so, but it will not keep you laughing for very long.  It's the same story, but there are a lot more examples.   The only problem I had with the book is that it was written by a woman.  If you are a man, you will not enjoy this book.  This book does not take place in a world where men can be oppressed.  There are women in this book that were oppressed and the main character is one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a little short.   The writing style is good, but it's a bit dry and uninteresting. It's a good short read, but I'm not sure it's worth a lot of time or money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of books, but this one left me feeling frustrated and frustrated. I liked the premise, but that's it. The author seems to get a lot out of it, but the ending was so incredibly boring. I feel like I got to know this woman a little bit before the story actually got to her. It seemed like she was the focus of the story but it didn't make much sense to me. It's hard to imagine a real story about a girl who is the only child in a family that hates her, who is a good student but who has a bad attitude about everything. And how did she get the attention of this person? How did she manage to be invited to parties that she doesn't want to be at? How is she getting these things? I'm not sure what the point of the book was. The characters were too one dimensional. And the ending just left me thinking about the author a lot. I would've rather been somewhere else to read this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I've read and re-read this book a couple times. There are times when it is fun, but most of the time it is a dull, slow, dull read.   The characters are all completely uninteresting and unoriginal.  .  :)   My main issue with the book is the fact that I couldn't understand anything the characters were saying. I don't even understand the point of the book!   This book is great for the beginning reader, but not for the "introverted" reader. If you are one of those readers, I suggest to just skip this book. It is not that interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as a college student in college and was disappointed in the book. It was a very hard to read book.  It was very boring and had lots of grammar mistakes.  Read the full review at Bookworm Blues  "A book that is not for the faint of heart, and that leaves you wishing you had been more attentive in class.  I really enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it to a new reader.  This is a book about a girl that is obsessed with the books of the magical girl genre, and goes to a school that does not believe in these things.  But her school is also very religious, and she finds herself forced to choose between the two.  The author's writing style was very interesting and I enjoyed her stories.  For my money, this book is worth the money, but the book is very long, so it will not appeal to those who want to read it in a few days.  It is definitely a good book to read if you have a friend who is into the magical girls genre.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was recommended by a friend who had heard good things about it. It is an excellent book. The author was very knowledgeable about the subjects she was writing about. However, her writing style did not fit with the topics of the book.  She wrote very terse and it was hard to understand her. It made me wonder if the book was written for a non-native English speaker to read.  She is very good at describing the smells. However I am not sure why a dog should smell as good as an elephant.   I like this book and I would recommend it to people who love animals.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was looking for something to read that had the potential to entertain and be interesting. But this book was just dull. I could not read it." A great story, but... I loved this book, but it was very frustrating to see that it was going to be about an old woman who is trapped in the house she lives in and that the story was going take place over the course of the next few months, but nothing happened. I guess I was hoping for a very slow buildup of the story to the point where things happened and we were supposed to be rooting for the old woman to get out.  And then it turns out that the old lady is dead and her family is going to take her in, and that was a big disappointment to me, because I was very interested in learning more about the old ladies. I don't know if I can write another story about a story I really liked. I am hoping that in the next book, the old women gets out of the house. The writing is not bad, but the writing was so...so...so boring. I kept wanting to turn the page and go back and read it again. It was like I read this book and I knew what was going on and I had to turn it over and read again to figure out what happened, but this book really just bored me. I wanted to see what would happen next. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** This book is about a boy and his dog. The boy is the main character and the dog is the side character. There's nothing wrong with the book but the book itself was very uneventful. The author wrote this story as if the boy and the puppy were on a date. The only time the puppy is in the book is when the boy is talking to the boy's parents. The dog doesn't seem to want to be around the boy. I did not like the puppy and thought the boy was being too mean to the puppy. The puppy had to be in the picture in every chapter, which made it a little boring to read. The end of the book, which was just a filler story, was a bit disappointing. I would have liked to know what happened to the dog and why the boy doesn't want to see the puppy anymore.  I liked the dog but I didn't think the boy deserved him. The rest of the story is just a little too long to read, especially if you want to get a quick read. .

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********   I had to wait so long to read this book. I really wanted to get into it, but I have been trying to get a hold of the first book by this author for a while now and it is not coming in the mail. I have the first two books, but there is no way that I am going to get thru the third book. The last two books were too slow to be enjoyable and I really have to wait until the last book comes in to enjoy the first three. I hope it gets there, because I do like the characters in this book and I do hope that the author keeps up with the quality that the first 2 books have.   Now, I have read other reviews that said this book is a fantasy book with no characters that you feel the need to follow. I'm a sucker for books with great characters, so I did like this book a lot. However, I do think that the main character, Lyle, did get a bit annoying. I think he would have been better if he didn't have such a short fuse, but then again I think a short temper is a good trait in many people. I liked how the author tried to keep Lyle in his little corner of the world and that he is not a powerful wizard, but just a simple boy. I like that Lyle doesn't have to do all the magical things that a wizard needs to do, because he is just a boy. In fact, the magic in this world is so easy that L. T. Anderson even made it look easy for Lyle to do it. So, I did think that Lyl's magic was really just a part of the story and not a real magic that you need to know to read. The author said that Llyr has a long life ahead of him, so maybe he will be able to get his hands on some magical items. I guess that is the problem with all fantasy novels. Most of them are so easy to follow, but you have to pay to get the magic items and the characters to live to a good old age, because most of the books are not really about the characters and the story.   The other problem that I have with this book was that there were so many plot holes. There were several instances in the story where I did not believe that anything happened or what Lyle did. There was a chapter where Lyle is walking through the woods and he suddenly stops, and the next
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've ever read. The writing is terrible. The characters are completely boring. The plot is a complete mess. It's so bad that it makes me want to vomit when I read it. I was so disappointed in the characters. The main character is a stereotypical white boy who is very naive about race issues. He has a very bad mother who tries to use him to "save" the family. His brother is in the army and doesn't even know his father is dead, which leads to a lot of tension in the family because of how far they both have to go to find out about his father. The only reason I liked him is that he is a big stupid jerk. He acts like a big dumbass at times but he also seems to care a lot about his brother, which is more than I can say about most of the main characters. This is the first book I read by the author, but I'm not sure if this is his first book. I'm thinking this is the second book he's written, since the first was just about his family and the only thing I can think of that's similar to this book is the main character having a sister that he just can't help but love, even though he is afraid of her. I guess this book has more similarities to The Last Samurai than The Fault in Our Stars. The book is filled with stereotypes about black people. The first book was about white people, the second about white guys who can't be trusted. The third book has a white guy who is a very racist and ignorant person. The last book has the black guy who tries his best to be the best black person he can be, and he succeeds to a certain extent. I've read a lot, but this book just made me feel disgusted with the black characters. I hate how this book was so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ The only good thing about this book is that it contains some of the best "I don't want to be the only one" stories ever told, which make up for the fact that this book doesn't make much sense and is boring as fuck. You might want to read the synopsis before you read this book. I'm not kidding when I say that it is boring. This book is the result of a guy who wants to write a book about his girlfriend getting raped and decides to turn it into a novel. This is an example of "if you can't write a coherent story, don't try writing a novel". The characters are very one dimensional, the author is really bad at describing events and their surroundings and just leaves them up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The author also really has a hard time creating any sort of conflict. The first few chapters are basically "this happens and then this happens" and by the end of the book the author has to make a whole lot of things up to justify the book. It's a little frustrating but I didn't really care because I was so bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I did not enjoy this book at all. I do not know why I read it. It was not what I expected.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. I bought this book on a whim because of a recommendation from a friend and it was a pretty bad idea. It's a bad review of the book because I found the story itself to be quite good, it just wasn't that good. I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone. If you are looking for a really good read that is really short, but very good, then I'd recommend this. But if you are a serious reader, and want a serious read that isn't as bad as this, then you should probably pass on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "If you're a fan of The Last Unicorn, you're probably going to love this book." "The Last Unicorn is a very different book. It is an adventure, but a lot of it is set up to be the end of an epic fantasy saga. The Last unicorn was written by Terry Pratchett, the creator of Discworld, and is the sixth book in his series, The Carpet People. This book follows the adventures of a princess named Tamiel who is on a quest to find her missing father. She gets involved in an adventure that takes her into a fantasy world, but she is on her own and is not getting any help. As in the first book, this book has many different characters and it is a really fun adventure." 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I am so disappointed. My son had already bought this book and I was very interested. However, I can't help but think that the author made a very poor attempt at an historical fantasy and that she should stick to fantasy with her other books. The story is not original and the world building was so out of place that it made me cringe a bit. It is a very simple story, with very little thought put into the setting and story. I could feel the writer's excitement as she wrote this book, as she could feel my son's excitement. However I cannot feel the excitement as the story unfolds and as I watch the events of the book play out. The ending was so abrupt and it left a sour taste in my mouth. I will not be returning to this book as I can see the story unraveling and my son will get nothing out of this book.

It is a brilliant, fast paced, highly entertaining read and will keep you guessing until the end." -Kaitlyn L. "This book has it all. I loved it! I'm so glad I bought this book, I couldn't put it down. I'm going to buy the sequel now!" -Emily S. 1.5 Stars (out of 5) I'm not sure how this book got published in the first place, but I've been eagerly anticipating the second book in the trilogy. I just can't get enough of this story. I would have given this book five stars, but the plot felt rushed, and I found the characters to be quite bland. I had the opportunity to read the first book in this series, and found it to be a more enjoyable read. The writing is good, and the characters are well drawn. The plot is fun, and there are a few surprising twists. The characters are also interesting, and each one has their own motivations. There are many scenes that just feel like the author is trying to pull you in, but it doesn't quite work. The main problem is that the story doesn't have a clear ending. I was left wanting more, but ultimately I think it's better to leave this book on the shelf than to give it five stars. 3 Stars (Out of 5): This is a fun, fast-paced read. I liked the characters, and they had interesting motivations. I can't wait to read their sequel. 4 Stars (in the bag): A good read with a few minor problems. It's a fast-read, and it's fun to read. 5 Stars: This book is a fast read, and very good. The story is good. I don't mind reading about witches. This is the best book in a series I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. The characters are annoying, the story is a mess, and it was hard to read. I've already written one bad review about this book because of the first paragraph:  "A good story with a tragic ending.  So, the main character, Darrin, is a young, naive boy, but it is not his fault. He is a "baptized" orphan who was raised by a single mother who gave up her daughter to him. Darr was never told why she did that, but she had always had a strong will, and Darr's love for his mother was stronger than his will.  When his mother died from cancer, his parents couldn't take him in. They took him to a Christian orphanage, but he didn't fit in there, and eventually they gave him up.   So he grew up in the orphanage.  When he is a teenager he starts to have a crush on a girl named Julie, but his father says that the girl is too old to be interested in him, and he is forbidden to be friends with her.  But Darr is not so strong-willed that he can't get over his feelings, so he decides to become a thief.  It turns out that the orphan was a part of a cult that worships a demon that they believe to be the cause of all disease and evil in the world.  They kidnap Darr and bring him to the demon's realm, where he is forced to kill people and eat their organs.  Darr has to try to stop the cult from eating his mother, but when he does he accidentally eats Julie's heart, and his life is saved by Julie.  That was not a happy ending, because this book is not good at all. I think I'll stick to the other books by that author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a hard time getting into this book, I just kept thinking "I don't care for this, what's the point of this book?" It's not bad by any means but it doesn't seem to have any point at all. The writing style is just so repetitive that it's hard to take it seriously. This book feels like an attempt at trying to be edgy but it just ends up feeling silly and boring.  I read this book because I was curious about how a woman who is trying to live a life free from a patriarchal society might look like.  I had the chance to see a few scenes in the movie, but I didn't feel like I understood the character at all, and I didn 't care to.   The writing is just a very repetitive type of style that can make you feel like you're reading a very boring book that is trying hard to be interesting but never quite succeeding. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is just boring and tedious.  I did enjoy the first book, and thought the third one was good but the author was a little bit lazy with the writing and not doing enough with the setting.  I do like that the main character, the main protagonist is a woman and it's a woman trying to find out if her dead mother is alive.    The setting and story lines were interesting enough and the author did have a lot of fun with the characters and some of the side characters.  But the book just wasn't very exciting or fun to read, and just felt like a lot more work was needed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book and the story was interesting. The plot is interesting but I don't see how it will ever be able to make me interested in a sequel. I found the story to be a little predictable but I guess it is a good story that will have its fans. It is not a terrible book and it will be a good read. However, if you want something new, something new you will probably be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I'm not sure why I waited so long to read this. This book was written by a self-proclaimed 'feminist' who says it's all about the oppression of men, and a male character (I think he's a man, but he's not a guy, so it's hard to tell) who does a lot of bad things. I read this book for the character, but the writing itself was just so bad that it ruined it. I could not understand why the writer couldn't have just made the male character a female. Or at least just made him a man with a bad attitude. I really wanted to like the male protagonist, but it was really hard to do. I'm pretty sure I'm a pretty good judge of character. I thought the female protagonist was pretty bad too, but she's a character, not a person, so I'm really glad the author didn't go the whole way with her character. Anyway, the female character is a selfish and arrogant person. This is a bad thing to write about a woman, because we have all heard the saying "She can't help it, she's just born that way." So, this is bad. The male character is not only bad, but also, I believe, lazy. He does what he wants, and that's it. That's why the male lead is so stupid. I think the author could have written a better male character, because he was not that bad, in my opinion. But I could have done so much better, if the author had stuck with the female lead, I'm sure it would have made it better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I read this book for the first time and my reaction was that it's a book which I really like, but not much else. It's a good story but I found it hard to like. It took a long time for the plot to get going but it eventually does. It is told from the perspective of a man who lost his wife in a plane crash, which left him completely broke. He then decides to leave his wife's hometown and start a new life. He's a successful businessman who has made millions but has no desire to continue to do business in his hometown. He wants to travel to new places to see what else is out there, he has his own ideas about what to do in his new life and what he wants. This is the book where I really liked the most. It was the only book I've read where the character seems to have a personal vendetta against his family, I liked this because I wanted to see the man as a man and not a monster, but I was so disappointed with the ending.   One of the main problems I had with this book was the lack of action. I like to read books about adventure and thrill rides, but this book just wasn't that. It felt like there was no reason to be going anywhere. The plot was so slow, it just felt like the main character had no goals or motivation for doing anything. There was one scene where the guy went out to meet a girl and was told that her parents were at her sister's wedding, he went to meet her at the airport, waited a long while and then decided to go home. The guy didn't really seem to care about the girl at all, he was just there for a ride and he did not seem to be in the least bit interested in the woman he met.   "I've got my own ideas for my new life!" He tells her. She says that's fine but she'll be at the wedding and that's what matters. I didn't like this. There is something about this story that just didn't appeal to me.   for a book that is supposedly a book about a man leaving his wife behind he just seemed so disinterested. It seems like his plan was to go to some new place and find a new girl to marry. The girl he was with at the time of the crash was never mentioned again, and I didn  I just read this one because it's my favorite book by the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a joke! I found the plot to be completely nonsensical. It was a really boring story about two characters and their adventures in a post-apocalyptic world. The main character was the most boring and uninteresting. The villain was too cool to be evil, and the main character is too much likeable. I just did not like this book.  The book was published in 2011 and I read it in 2015, so this was a long time ago.  The plot of this book is:  The main characters are a girl and a boy, and they go into a post apocalyptic world where humans are on the verge of extinction, and all the food has been destroyed. The girl and boy are traveling through the wilderness, and eventually they meet a boy and girl who are also traveling in a boat.  The two kids fall in love, and their relationship is a constant source of comedy. The problem is, when the boy and the girl fall in to a relationship, they are separated by a long distance, and it is up to the main characters to go find the boy/girl. I have never heard of a story like this before. I'm not sure if it's a good idea for children, but it's very poorly written.  I thought it was just a really poor attempt to write a romance novel. The boy/ girl are never together, and when they are together, it is too often boring, and never ends up working out.  There are several other plot twists, and I was so bored by the whole thing. I didn't like the characters at all, and most of them were very uninteresting and unoriginal.  It is just so unoriginal that it makes me wonder why someone would waste time writing a romance. The story ends with the girl/ boy meeting again, but I just found it a very bad ending, and did not feel the love the characters had for each other.   There are a lot of people who have reviewed this book:

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. You don't know what you've got in that book. It's all over the place, and not very coherent. I wish I could have given it a better review, but I couldn't even make heads or tails of it."   This is an interesting book to read if you are interested in the history of the Chinese revolution, and also if you like a good story about the Chinese language. I like the story and I am interested to read the sequel (the book I am reading right now). It is not the kind of book I will read every day, but then again, it is not a book that I read that often either.   But the author does say that the book is not very well written and that the main character is very unchar  "A great example of the ability of the people of China to organize and execute a political revolution, especially in their own midst."  : I'm a fan of Chinese history and language. The book I'm reading right this moment is The History of the People of China. The title is written in both Chinese and English, which is a good thing for a book about the history, but a bad thing for any kind of translation. I prefer to read a book in the original language and then in the English translation. This book is very confusing, not in the sense that it is too hard to understand, but in the fact that it was written in an incomplete way. For example, when he discusses the origins of the communist movement, he gives only one source for it: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in 1966, when a group of students and workers in Peking University's student union staged a student-led protest against the suppression of their own rights, the oppression of women, and the degradation of the arts and literature." What is the Great Proletsk r, "the suppression of the workers' rights"? What is it about? This is a question which I would like to ask him when I get home.   the author also makes a great mistake: He is writing about the origin of the revolution. He should have written about the revolution in which Mao took power, the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, and so on. He could have written a good book about all the different things he is talking about in the book. The Chinese revolution is a complicated one and he makes mistakes when he writes about it.   The author talks about the Cultural revolution in a very

Overall:    I like this book, but not for the reasons people are raving about.  I would like to give this book 4 stars because I enjoyed the plot and the story was intriguing. I would give the book 4 out of 5 stars, but I have to give it 1 because the book is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________, you should go read a different book.  Read a positive review about an awesome book: "You will learn to love being in love again, and I will never go back to the old love."  What did you like best about this story?  I liked the way the two couples' stories were woven together. I also liked that it's not a "happy ending" but rather a "dying with dignity" kind of ending. I liked that the characters were really well developed. I like that the ending was a little different from the normal ending but still satisfying. , as a matter of fact, is the kind of book I read as a child. The first one I read was, as an adult, I loved it and still like it. I love that the narrator was a child, that there were a couple of love triangles and the book ended with a happy ending. The characters were a lot like the characters in, as well as, and. The narrator in, was a boy who loved his mother. The couple in, were two sisters, both of whom loved their father and were deeply in love with him. The two families lived in a rural village, but the village was very poor. When the narrator's father died, his mother remarried to a younger man. The father had always loved his sister. The new wife loved her mother and was always trying to get her mother to marry the younger man (because his older wife had remarries) but her mother would not listen. As a result, the narrator and his sister became very close. Their father and mother were married and living in a small town. The family lived in the same house but the new wife was very unhappy with her mother. Her mother's new husband did not show much interest in her and he was very demanding. The old woman always wanted to be in control. She would make the boys do her chores, but would not allow them to do hers. The older woman always thought that the new husband would never love her and when she learned that he did, she became furious and sent her daughter away from the house. The boys were very young and they could not understand what was going on. It was the old woman's way of telling them that it was not the way things were supposed to be. It reminded me a lot ofand the other books I've mentioned above.It's a good story, but it was very different from any of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished a very bad book about a woman who takes care of her ailing grandfather.  The author, who wrote the book about her own grandmother who was sick, is a good writer but the book was so bad that I couldn't get through it. I have never read a book so poorly written and so badly written in the same book.  This book is just not up to par.  It has a great premise that is about a grandmother who is sick.  Unfortunately, the book falls flat on its face.  This book is written by a very good writer and has a premise that could have been written well.  Instead, this book fails to deliver.  The plot was very predictable from the first paragraph to the last.  There was a ton of action going on that was completely unfulfilled by the end.  In my opinion, this is a book that should not have been published.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been reading this book for many years and I still can't get over the fact that this book was written by a white guy, and a white dude who has never written a book before. His characters have no depth, no intelligence and no real personality. I don't know about anyone else but I found it hard to follow the story as the author seemed to forget where he was in the story and start writing about what his character did in the past. In the end I got sick of the book and finished it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book, but it's hard to read because it's written in such a style that you can't take your eyes off of it, but you want to close the book and read it again. It's really bad. It has so many characters and characters that don't get enough screen time that it's really hard to like any of them. It feels like a story about a bunch of bad kids who have a lot of bad days. It would be nice if we got more of a feel of the family, like how in the real world, your parents would have an influence on your decisions and not just a bunch o' bullies. Also, the plot is so convoluted, you can get lost in it. There are so many things going on, but none of them make sense and most of the time it's just too hard to follow. It could have been a great book if it had just been a single chapter, but instead it feels like it was more of an epilogue. I know I'm supposed to be reviewing it for school, but I can't finish it because it was just so hard to understand and too much for me to take in. I can still get something from it, and I know that my review won't be helpful, but as a kid I used to like this one, but now I can barely take it. I hope you enjoy it, because if you don't like it, then there's not a whole lot else you can do.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I read this book because it was recommended to me and because it looked interesting to me. The book has a lot of good things, but not enough to keep me reading. In fact, the whole book is a bit too much for me. I am really glad I read it, though, because I was bored a lot. The pacing of the book is really good, though. There is a lot to digest and I found that the writing was a lot better than the cover suggests. The only negative thing I have to say about this book is the ending, which is just a cliffhanger, which I really enjoyed.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This is a good book, but I found a few problems with it. For starters, I found the characters' reactions to the plot to be very unrealistic and unrealistic. I found that all the characters were in a state of shock and disbelief, and all the other characters' attitudes to them were so much more realistic than the characters reactions.   I thought the writing style was great, and I was impressed by how well he handled some of the scenes in the book, such as the opening scenes. I did find the ending to be a bit abrupt, but maybe that's just because I've read some other people's opinions about it and some of them seemed a bit more dramatic than I did.   the only thing that really got me off was the story about the family cat. It was so cute and I loved the little comments about him and his personality.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should be called The Dark Side of The White House and not White House. I'm going to be honest and say I didn't read much of the book and found it very difficult to get into. The only thing I can relate to is that the first few chapters were interesting and then after a while the story turned into the usual White House gossip. I did not like the fact that they gave this book a title like that. It makes it sound like a real crime novel and I don't think it is. I don´t like to read a book like that because then it seems that the author is telling us what she thinks of the person. The book is only about the two main characters and a few supporting characters, not a novel about crime, or even a novel with a crime theme. The story is about two people, who are going to have a great time at a presidential party when they accidentally stumble into the middle of a crime. So, it was a little predictable. I was hoping that the book would be different and not a story of two people who have a big adventure. Overall, I don`t recommend this book because I think it was written by a person who wants to have his book published but he doesn´t know how. I would like to see a good novel by this author, who knows how to write a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is so bad, I am not sure if I have ever read anything so awful in my life. It is full of stupid and offensive jokes, bad grammar, and just plain dumb stuff. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and loved this book, but it was just too much of a bore for me. I had to put it down for a while after reading the first few chapters and had to start a new book. I hate that it is only 4 stars because I think it deserves more than that. I don't recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. I am a big fan of the Dresden Files books. I love how they tie everything together, the world building, the mystery, and the story. I loved that there is a real sense of danger. I was happy to find a story where the characters weren't just fighting monsters. There was a sense of a real threat that had to be dealt with.   However, this book doesn't live up to its predecessors. The first two books are fantastic, and if I had to give only two stars, I would give it a 3.  .   (I'm giving it 4 stars, but you get the picture.) The third book is the one that really disappointed me. The plot and character development just weren't as strong. I feel like the story has gotten so far ahead of itself that it's just beginning to get interesting again.  's plot gets so far out of hand, it almost seems like there's a plot twist or a twist that's just going to happen that will totally ruin the story for me. And I was really excited to find out what happened, and to see the world through a different perspective, and find out the true reason why all these villains are out to get Harry, but it turns out, that was all a lie.   I mean, come on! The world-building is incredible. The world is amazing, and I'm just so happy that the authors didn't stop there. I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to explore the world in this way.   of the characters is really annoying. We learn that the reason for all the bad guys, and for the evil wizards, and even for the entire situation, is because the author wanted to write a story about Harry and Draco. That was the whole purpose. They are the heroes. They're the reason the entire world is in a mess. We even learn that Hermione was involved with this, because Harry and Ron just assumed Hermione was there. (It's like they never learned that Hermione had her own reasons for joining the Death Eaters.) And it's all very obvious that it was the author's intent. It's like the author just wrote everything he wanted to see. (And I guess I get why the characters were like this.)   All in all, I'm glad I read the first two, because they were very good. The third, however, disappointed me so much. It was really just more of the same.

It's basically a set up to have an emotional rollercoaster. The writing was so predictable that I was laughing the entire time. There's a lot of pointless drama in this book. I think it's more like a soap opera, and all the characters were just stand-ins for one another. It wasn't very original. I'm not even sure I liked the ending, so it's not very good. I was also surprised that this book wasn't shorter. It was almost 50 pages long. It seemed like a lot for a book about a girl's struggle to understand her family's decision to sell her.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- **I wish I could give this book one star.** I'm going to come out and say it: I loved this book. There was no "hook" or "story" to this book other than the characters in the story.   It's a book about a family that has been separated for years, but then is brought together again by the mother's husband's new relationship. This is a good book, but I'm sorry to say it's a "bad" book. It has an ending that was pretty sweet, but it's the beginning and the end that leave a lot to be desired. There are many things that could be done to improve this book, and if they did it wouldn't change a thing.  -The family is just a mess. The father is so obsessed with his job, and the mother is so caught up in her own problems that the two of them are at odds.  .The family doesn't do any research on the situation, so when they come to the conclusion that the daughter is being taken advantage of by her boyfriend, they don't take action, because they don,t know any better.  : The story is about how a father comes to realize that his daughter is in trouble with the boy she's dating. The man does the only thing he can think of: he runs to the son's house, takes the girl back to his home, and tries to raise her as his own.    -As soon as the man realizes what is happening, the father is in charge, and is very strict with the son. This, of course, has the effect of keeping the son from ever considering running away.  In a way, this is a very good story, but the author could have done something to make the characters more believable, or to make things a little more exciting. The ending of the story was pretty cheesy, and I just wished the author had done more with it.   --------------- "I can't wait until the end of the book!" "What a horrible ending! What a waste of time!" "I love it!" "You just ruined it for me!" "A perfect ending!" "The story is perfect! A perfect ending!

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ is a very bad book. The first 3 chapters are not bad. The author goes into detail about a family with a special needs child and how difficult it was to care for. The last two chapters are horrible. The family lives in a rural area and the mother has a job in a factory and the father works as a janitor. One of the daughter's boyfriend's father dies in a motorcycle accident and the other daughter has a drug problem. They decide to move to a new neighborhood to be close to their families and get a job. The boyfriend's family, with the exception of his mother, are not sympathetic and are extremely judgmental. The son, who was abused as a child and now lives in the home of a woman who has been abusing him, is very unhappy with the mother and the family and the situation in the new neighborhood. The parents are constantly arguing, and the daughter becomes very depressed and very sad and withdrawn. I have read a lot of horrible books but I have never read a book that is so bad it makes me sick. The plot is very thin and the book is poorly written and there is very little in the way of character development. I did not find the author's opinions of the other parents in this book very positive and her descriptions of the boyfriend's mother were very harsh. The ending of the book was very disappointing. I will not be recommending this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just too short, with a lot of plot holes.  The story is not only nonsensical, it's downright absurd, as is the character development, which is all about how the author's character traits are reflected in the characters in the book.   This book was written by someone who knows how to write, but lacks the creativity to actually make a story.    The author's characters are flat and boring.  The plot is just too contrived.  I wish I could give this book a 1/10, but I'm sure that it's worth reading if you're into the type of literature I'm not into.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book a few months ago and it is not a good book. It is about an 18th century sailor who was sent to prison on a rape charge. He was the only sailor on his ship, and his ship was not even in the area. It was a British ship and the crew was mainly French. The British captain was angry at the French crew for not having the same food as the English crew, so the French had to do whatever was necessary to make sure the English did not starve. The French captain was not happy about this and when the French captain refused to go along with the plan to rape the American girl, the French officer tried to make the American sailor give her to him to be his mistress. He got so upset when he found out that the American didn't want anything to do with him that he killed her. This book was supposed to be about a guy who was sentenced to prison for a rape, but it is really not. I was not really interested in this story and found it boring. The story does not have any suspense or excitement to it. It really didn't give me any kind of sense of what happened. I didn't feel any real feelings towards the story. I'm not sure why I bought this, since I don't think it is worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a really good example of how the concept of the genre is used in order to create something that is completely flawed. It's one of those books that has the potential to be a really great book if it were just written well and presented in a way that made it seem like it had some sort of connection to the source material but it falls flat on its face as soon as you realize that this is just a fanfic written by a fanboy who wanted to make a good game with his beloved universe. This is the first book I've ever read that was so far removed from the source that I was confused as to what was even supposed to be happening. It makes the characters even more unlikable and the world more of a boring place to live.  I was really hoping for a good story that was well written but I was let down and disappointed by this book.

And then one day, I got the chance to read it in a big book store and it was a big disappointment. It was too long. I didn't like the character of the main character at all. I think he was supposed to be a hero, but he's actually a complete coward. It wasn't interesting. The plot was a total bore, and it's just like reading the same story over and over again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a book that I did not want to read. It was a story that was really boring. I think that is because it was about a boy and his cat who had a very interesting story and a very good ending, but it just ended in a way that made it a very uneventful book. The author was very nice and very descriptive, but the author didn't give enough explanation to the ending, which was kind of a shame, as I really wanted to know more about the end of the book. It also wasn't very funny. Overall, I gave it 4 stars. I really did enjoy reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************** My friend gave this book a very positive review on Goodreads. It is not a bad review, just one that lacks a few details and doesn't make sense. I do think it would be nice to know the names of the characters, and who was the one who actually wrote the book. I think it is a very good book, but I don't like the way it was written.   A friend of mine sent me a copy of the book and I really liked it. I was skeptical of it, and I was wrong. This book is a great read. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had no idea what to expect when I picked this book up at the library.  It wasn't that the book itself was bad, I liked the plot and the characters.  But it was that the writing style was extremely confusing, and in the end made me frustrated and angry.  The first sentence of the first chapter reads "A very strange and dangerous girl with a great passion for music."  What's this?   And the next sentence begins "In the music classroom of the local elementary school."  I think I got a hint of the mystery genre the author was going for when she mentioned that the girl "has a great interest in music" but I don't really understand what music is or what a music classroom is.   The next sentence doesn't help either, but that's just the way she wrote it.  "I was surprised by the fact that she is the only one who is interested in music." I just don't get it, I'm a music lover and a very serious one at that.  If this girl is so serious about music, why doesn't she have her own band?  Why doesn't the teacher play music?  And if she doesn't want her own music, then why doesn I feel like the author's writing style is just confusing.  She's trying to be subtle, but her way of writing doesn't work.  It's not that the prose is bad, it's just that she doesn' t seem to be taking into account the readers ability to follow her and understand the plot.  This isn't just me, I've read a lot of books in the genre and this one was a little on the confusing side. I did like the mystery, but this book was a real let down for me.  Overall: I would not recommend this book to anyone, if you have even a hint that you might like a mystery book then you probably shouldn't read this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad. It's not very good at all. The premise is just stupid. This book doesn't even try to be original. The story takes place in a fantasy world where all of the inhabitants are humans who are turned into monsters. And they all have this magical weapon that turns them into monsters as well. So the protagonist is this dude who uses this sword to turn people into monsters (which he calls a "bastard sword") and he kills all the other monsters. The only people he doesn't kill are the evil ones who have turned into evil monsters. They all have magical weapons. So basically the protagonist and his friends are fighting the bad guys with magical weapons because that's how you fight monsters. If that's your idea of a good story, then this book is not for you. It really just comes off as a bunch of bad writing, with a really stupid premise. I wouldn't waste your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a disappointment for me. The premise is cool, but the execution was flawed. There was too much character development and a lack of action in the first half of the book. This is not what a good story is all about, and the last half of this book is a drag. " I was going to call the police, but then I remembered that I have my gun at home and that I've been to prison before. It's a very good thing I didn't do that. This is not a bad novel, but it's not a good one either. It doesn't do what it sets out to do. I don't think I could recommend this book."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ It is a very poor book and it should be ignored by all those who have read it, but it is a popular book and as a good writer, it is very easy to read. The author is a well-known writer and her book is very popular and has been in the news a lot. I would recommend it for those who like historical fiction, but I would not recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction or fantasy, as it is not well written and the story is very weak. It is also very long and you need to keep reading to the end, because the story doesn't end when the last page is turned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character, the only person in the book with a proper name, is an annoying dork who thinks he is the world's greatest superhero. I am not going to give a detailed review because the book is just too long to do so in an essay, but there are several parts in the novel where the book goes to a place where it is clearly not the main character's fault that he is in a bad situation. At one point, his roommate is accused of having an affair, and the boyfriend is also accused. So in the first book, we see what a bad guy this roommate is and what a great villain the boyfriend could be, but in the second book we don't see them as villains.  Rating: 2/5.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be a bit slow to start and had to turn it off at the end.  The pacing is pretty slow and it seemed that there was no plan for the book to go anywhere.   It didn't make sense how the author ended up in this place.  The bad:    This is a fantasy book about a group of people who live in a village called the Wood of Laughter and are forced to fight each other and their king when a band of thieves breaks into the village and steals some money and jewelry.  This sounds like a really interesting concept, but the execution wasn't good at all.  It was very predictable and the pacing was really slow.  The book had no real resolution and the main characters, especially the male protagonist, were just there to act as a plot device.  I found it to be extremely boring and I really can't recommend this book at all to anyone who hasn't read any of the fantasy novels written by J.R.R Tolkien or Robert Jordan.  My only suggestion would be that if you are looking for a fantasy novel with a fast pace and lots of action, try something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I had a good read, but the story is just about a boy named Ben who dies when his grandfather dies. His family had to live with this tragic loss. I think the book would have been a lot more interesting if he was alive to tell his own story. The book doesn't tell his story, which makes me wonder why it wasn't written. I did not like this book at all. The author could have used some more stories to help the reader feel for Ben and his family. Overall, the book just didn't do it for me. I found it boring and didn't feel it was done well.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________ I had a chance to get a copy of this book at a Barnes & Noble and while the book itself was okay it had a few problems that I found unacceptable. The author makes an assumption that a person has a strong will to live which is a big problem. He goes on to say that all people are born good and they are born bad but that you can change yourself if you try. It's an important point that many people don't take to heart. Also, he says that you shouldn't give up on a person that is trying to be good, but in this case he fails to mention that in the case of many people in this book the author failed to mention. He then says that people who are born with a bad disposition are born that way but that a good person can overcome it. This is a pretty good point. However, what is not as good is the author's assumption that it's just a matter of willpower. In my experience, it's much more complex than that. Some people will be born with certain traits and the good news is that you don't have to be born that bad to overcome it, just try harder. Also the author fails to point out that the person might just be trying to get attention from others or the need for a higher status in life. It also doesn't help that this book was published in 1984 and the times have changed a lot since then.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I bought this book for a friend, who has an interest in writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love the concept, and I'm so excited to read the next one. The book is really well written and has a great twist at the end, but the ending is a bit rushed and anticlimactic.

I think the book is still really good, and the author is a great writer, so I still recommend this one!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad idea to listen to this book unless you have a great deal of knowledge of the original story.  I didn't even know who was who in the original.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "When you read the blurb and reviews for this book it is clear that the author was trying to write a romance novel about a young man who is gay and in love with a man. Instead he wrote a book about a lesbian and the love between a man and a woman. It is clear from the beginning that the lesbian is not interested in a man, she is attracted to a woman and in her mind she will never feel like a woman."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at a party where I happened to have an alcohol addiction.  The author makes no attempt to address any of the issues raised in the book.  I can't imagine any other book that will cause a group of people to make a bad choice about their drinking habits.  It's an incredibly long book, but it's a waste of time and energy.  If you want to read about a woman's battle with alcohol, there are plenty of good books on that subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand the reason for this book's existence.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a book that really needs to be read in one sitting. There are too many things that just don't work. I would have been much happier if the story had been a bit more focused and had been about a couple of guys that found themselves in a pretty bad situation. This was the kind of book where it would have made sense to go a bit slower with the main characters and let the supporting characters play a role in their own stories.  The story is a little slow and doesn't move quickly enough to make up for it. The author's writing style is pretty standard, but the characters are very bland and unlikable. I wouldn't have cared about them so much if it had been less about them and more about what happened to them after they left the city. The ending left me a bit confused, and I'm not sure if it will ever make any sense to me. This book was a big disappointment. I had hoped that the characters in the story would at least be a little interesting, but I'm left with a pretty bland and boring book. I'm very disappointed with this book and I wouldn a really really like to read another book by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a fun book to read, but it was extremely boring. I got a good story, but the story was so boring that it took me a long time to even get into the book. The story was about a group of people who go on a vacation and one of them gets kidnapped and the others must rescue him. The plot is good, but all the characters are so one dimensional that you don't really care about them. I'm not sure why there was such a huge rush to buy this book, as the book is not bad, but I didn't like it.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story, if you can call it that, was really good. It was very well written. The characters were very well developed. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, well-written science fiction book. The problem is that I don't think the author thought of a way to tell a good story. The story is told in a way that is a bit confusing, I had to keep re-reading it to really get the gist of what was happening. If I had just kept reading I think I would have gotten the story. But, I think it's because of the fact that the book is so long. There are a lot of plot holes, so it is hard to get the whole story. If the story was shorter, I probably would have liked it better. It is a good read, but I would not recommend it. I was able to get a good synopsis of the book here: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book was absolutely awful! It was written in a style that made it seem like the author had just stumbled across a great idea and decided to turn it into a book, but it was so obviously a horrible idea that I almost turned it off. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, and the author should be ashamed of herself.   First of all, the concept is a total and complete joke. It was supposed to be a book about a group of vampires and werewolves living in a town and how they deal with each other. The whole premise of it was just ridiculous, but then again I didn't have the slightest clue about the real world vampire/werewolf world. The book opens up with a few scenes of the author just giving the reader a glimpse into the world, and what is so weird about it is that she doesn't seem to know anything about it. It's like she didn't even try to research it, which would have been a little better than just giving a glimpse of the town she is supposed to write about. Then, she throws in a bunch of vampires who were once normal people and who now have been turned into vampires by a curse, and how that affects them. The author spends way too much time talking about these vampires, how they have been changed, and just how their lives have changed and changed again since becoming vampires. It took me about 4 chapters to realize that these vampires were not going to be an interesting character to care about at all, and that's not saying a lot. In fact, they were pretty boring. Their lives were pretty much the same as ever. They were in a tavern, and they had some adventures. They had the occasional fight, and when they got in fights, they ended up killing each other, so no matter how interesting these vampires might have been, it's not really worth spending a whole chapter on them.   to make matters worse, the author has the audacity to talk about the werewolves being the bad guys, but she has no idea what werewolves are like, or how they are supposed to behave in the real vampire world. She just tries to explain them as she does with the vampires, but this is just so confusing and wrong. At first, she is trying to make the vampires seem more dangerous and scary, but as I kept reading, I realized that this was never how they were supposed to act. The vampires were just as scary as the werewolf
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a hard time finding a good book to read last year. I just didn't get a good feel for the characters, or the world, or even the plot. I tried to read it again, but was so bored with it that I just decided to give up and give myself a few days off before I try to go back and finish it. This book was so much better than I thought it would be. The characters were much more interesting than in the first book, and I like the way the world is built up. I also liked how the author managed to write a book with a different style than a classic fantasy novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ The only way to find out what a bad read is is to read it. That is how you know you've read something bad. ___________________________  My son is now in college and is going through an awful lot of books. One that really bothered me was The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. This is the story of a little boy named Rapunzel who is trapped in the tower of her father who has become the king of a castle in the middle of a war. Rapunzelle escapes, only to find herself in a strange land of wizards, giants and princes. _______________________________________________________________________________ My son is very young, and I feel like I should let him decide for himself whether or not to read any of these books. I think it's important for a parent to give their kids the opportunity to make a choice. __________________________________________________  This is a good book for a young child. The art style is good, and the story is easy to understand. The plot is somewhat predictable, but that is a fine way to tell a good story.  __________________________________________________________ .  The Little Prince is a classic and a must read for all children and adults alike. The book is a wonderful, simple story with beautiful illustrations. The characters are just as important as the plot. I was amazed at the variety of characters in the story and how they all came together to help Rapun and her father in their escape.  The Little Princess is an amazing book that any child can enjoy. ___________________ The best part of the book is the characters. All of them are different and they all have their own individual personalities. They're all funny and they have some great moments.   Overall, this book is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so bad I have been avoiding it for over a year and I finally had to pick it up again. The author, a graduate student in English, has the most ridiculous and overwrought sense of self-importance. I found myself trying to keep up with his voice throughout the book and trying to understand what kind of a person he is. I'm not sure if it's because he's an English major or the author has a strange fixation on him or if it has something to do with the fact that he's a "white guy" writing about a white guy. But there are no characters of color in this book, at least none who have any sort of interesting or noteworthy qualities. There's no real emotion or real characterization to anyone in this novel. It's all just a monotone narration. It could be an audiobook, but that's a really high bar for a book. I read it in one sitting and finished it in a couple of hours. I can see why the author wanted to write a "classics" book for this year's Lit Jitsu. The only interesting thing about this book is the fact he has no idea how to write his own name and he tries to blame it on the author's name.  The author says that he "wrote this book with the same heart as when he was writing a paper on the best way to get drunk". I don't know how anyone could write a book about "the best way" to get drunken without actually being drunk. Maybe he has a problem. He doesn't have a problem with alcohol, but I'd love to hear him say how he got drunk without getting drunk. If this is how he gets drunk, I don' want to be his friend. He just writes a lot of blabber and never manages to tell a decent story. He does have a couple good bits like how the narrator is a guy who "can't even tell the difference between his own and other people's voices" and how he "wants to be the one to say it" but "he can't". That's it. That's the whole book. If you want to learn how to get hammered, this is the book for you. If the idea of you trying to get into an argument with a guy with a foreign accent is not interesting to you, then maybe you should read this book.  The narrator's voice and mannerisms were really grating and I found it hard

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. This is a book about a girl who is being raised by an abusive, incestuous, abusive father. Her father is also the leader of a cult. The whole book is basically a long description of her life in a cult-like setting, and it's about as boring as you'd expect it to be. The main plot involves her trying to get out of the cult. She is not a strong character, and the entire book is just this long, boring description of what she did to get herself out. The first part is a description of the life of the family. Then she gets involved with a cult member who's her father's best friend. I think there's a reason that people hate this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a very good book. The main character is a good, kind, caring person. He doesn't really have a problem with other people's problems or feelings, though he doesn't like to be seen as one. He's not really a bad guy, he just doesn't want to do things the way other people want them to be done. The book is set in an alternate history where slavery was abolished, but some people still have their property and rights as property. This leads to many different problems, and he gets caught up in them and has to find a way to escape or deal with them. The ending is very unsatisfying, but not bad enough to make me hate it. I'm very interested in seeing where this story goes.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but not the kind that is "just another" Stephen King book. This book was just awful. It was very short and had some great parts, but it wasn't a good book. The story was a typical King story. I liked the idea of "The Girl in the Red Truck", and the idea that King's "Fearful Symmetry" was a great book. I just didn't think it was all that good. The characters were very flat and it was hard to believe there was even a plot to the book. King, who is one of my favorite authors, is just terrible with writing. He does not have the talent to write a good short story. The only thing that I enjoyed about this book was that King was able to write about something other than his "fantasy" books.   I recommend this book only for fans of StephenKing or those who like StephenKing and his other works.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot:  I did not like this book at all.  The characters are all bad.  It's a collection of random stories about people who are going to hell.  Some people will say that's how religion works, but I'm just not into it.  I think that this book is the best example of how people who have made it to the highest levels of society do not really want to be there.  There are several stories of people who were once good people but got in over their heads.  The problem is that in all these stories people have died.  But this is all very uninteresting to me.  This is the same story that's been done before in the most entertaining and entertaining way.   I don't think I would enjoy reading this book.  Overall:    I was disappointed in this book!   Recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really enjoyed this book. It is well written and a lot of fun. However, the first 50 or so pages are confusing, to say the least. For example, the narrator says that she was told to write a letter for her friend who had been hit by a car. Then she starts to write about the car, but it was actually the other way around. I think that's because the narrator wrote the letter to her friend, but forgot to send it. But this didn't stop her from being a very good writer. The book ended up being really entertaining, and I can see why some people would like it. It's good for a good laugh. I just wish that the narrator would have been more specific about what happened, and not just "happens to me".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was surprised at how many good books are left out.  If you are a fan of historical fiction, I'm sure you will enjoy this book.    But, as a history book, it's very much lacking in depth.  1.5 Stars:  So, what is a book about the Great War without a little bit of drama?   I found myself wondering why I didn't enjoy this one as much as others.  I'll admit I didn the "historical fiction" genre for a while, but I was always disappointed by the historical accuracy.  However, this book is really interesting.    I'm a history buff and I was glad to have read a book that tells the story of what really happened in WWI.  As an adult, I can appreciate that this is a bit more than a simple historical fiction book. It's not a retelling of the story but rather a detailed look at the people, the things, and the feelings behind it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so boring. I've seen this book before, and this is the first book I've read by him, so I know he's a good writer, but this is one of the least interesting books I've ever read. I just read the first paragraph and was bored out of my skull.  Review for the book: "This book is written in the style of an autobiography and is a sort of autobiography in the sense that it tells the story of a man's life. It is not the story about his love affair with a woman but it is a tale of a boyhood in the 1930's. The book is about how a young boy is growing up in the Depression years. He is very much like his father. He has no job and a small income. He does not enjoy school and does not care to learn. He plays hide and seek with his friends but the others think he is weird. He becomes a little eccentric and a bit eccentric in the way he plays with the world and how he thinks. In this way, he comes to the attention of a very important man. This is his life, this is his world, this has been his experience."   The book has a very uninspired style of writing. I'm not sure I could even read this book by this author, as it is so uninspired. The writing is very poor and I have to give this a low rating. I think this book would be better as a novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was so bad. I could tell I was about to be pissed off but it's just so bad that it's not worth the time. I was so disappointed to get the first book because of how bad the second book was, so I guess I will keep my fingers crossed that the third book is better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ This book was an absolute waste of time. It is just so poorly written that I had to force myself to read it. I don't understand how someone with the ability to create something so beautiful could just write something so crappy. I was expecting something really amazing and so so much more. I'm not sure why this book was written at all, and I just don't know if it was worth the price I paid. I mean, this was a $9.99 paperback, and $9 is a lot for a book that is so bad. And, for what it's worth, I found a lot of the things in it to be hilarious. But, that's about it. This book sucks and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read two books that were on the same subject, but I have not enjoyed either book. I did like the author's writing style, and his descriptions of life on the ship were very interesting. I think the author did a great job in telling the story of the ship. The only issue I had with the book was the characters in the book were not as interesting as I would have liked. There were several characters I thought were just so-so and just didn't stand out. There was one that I really liked, but the rest I couldn't stand.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________ I got a copy of this book at a local store for a good price and I'm a huge fan of the movie, so when I saw this book was being re-released I picked it up. I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie was a direct adaptation of the book. The movie was okay, but didn't have anything memorable to me, and I was expecting more from the book that it actually had. The book is very interesting, and it would have been nice to see more of it, but this is only a minor disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I read an excerpt in a magazine article about a famous and well known author and her books.  She said that she found that her most difficult book was about a boy who grew up to be a successful and popular writer.  A woman named Lula who had no education, worked in a restaurant and was a woman of many loves was a victim of her own childhood.    When she was a young woman, Lula was a child prostitute.  After that she became a stripper and worked for a very wealthy man.  She was so rich she gave all of her money away.  One night in a bar, Lala is talking to her friend about how they are both having sex with a rich and famous guy.  Lala says that he is the most wonderful man that ever walked the earth.  When the bar owner, Mrs. Osmond sees this, she has to ask if it is a joke.  This is the second book by a woman who is not educated or wealthy.  The first book by that author was called  When You Are Gone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting something similar to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  (which I thought was a lot better), but this is just a bad story. It's just a poor attempt at a plot, and the only character that's memorable is the guy who steals the woman. I would have preferred more action, more tension, and more character development, but it's all just a little too much, and it ends up being a pretty big disappointment.  You could probably get the same amount of action in a lot less time and still have a good time, but this was just a huge let down.  I got it for $1.49. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a complete disappointment, I had no interest in the characters and it was an incredibly boring read. This book had a great premise but I found myself bored out of my mind with the characters. There were just so many different things that I just could not relate to and felt like I was just a spectator.   This book was so boring I can't even get excited about the characters!   I really don't think I want to read a book by her again...  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ This is the first book I've ever read where I was disappointed. The book is written in the style of a book about a college girl that is living with her father who is the head of a corporation. This is in addition to the college that the daughter attends. There are a few twists in the book and a twist ending. The twist ending is a complete joke. The plot is about the daughter who lives with her dad and her college life. The college girl, whose name I'm not going to mention, has to get the son of the company she works for to move out of the house because he is a terrible father. The daughter gets into a fight with her boyfriend and ends up breaking his nose, which leads to a fight between the boyfriend and her father. I was so disappointed in this book. The story seemed to go in a direction I was not expecting. I have read many good books in the past but this one left me with a sour taste in my mouth. This book is filled with the typical teenage angst and was not as good as it could have been.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________   I read this book for the first time a couple weeks ago and found it to be an amazing story about the early days of the internet and how it has grown to the size it is today. I found the story of the book very interesting and the characters interesting and all the action is great. I enjoyed the book a lot and I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the early internet. I am not a huge fan of romance but I enjoyed this book a great deal and I think that it would be a good story to read to a friend of mine who is a huge history fan. I will be reading this book again!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book. I didn't have a problem with the author's writing style, the setting, or the plot. However, the story itself was so confusing and frustrating. The story is about a couple (the lead character and the wife) who decide to leave the village, their jobs, and the village. They go to an isolated place called the "Mountain of Light." They live in an underground village, where they learn how to live and work as a couple, with the other people there. One day, their car breaks down and they have to drive back to the village to find a repairman. On the way back, they find a giant stone statue. It's the goddess of light (who is called Light, since she is light in color and is associated with the sun). She gives the couple a chance to "unlock the world of light" that she is trapped in. The couple decides to go back into the village and become the world's rulers. I really liked the idea, but the execution was just confusing. I couldn't really tell what the author was trying to do. For example, why didn't the characters go into the mountain of light at the beginning? And why was the story about a mountain of lights when it clearly wasn't about light? And then the author writes about the goddess, and then she's not supposed to be the goddess? And how did the protagonist and the goddess become friends? And where did the goddess's "world of light," which is supposed to have a mountain, come from? I just couldn't get a handle on the story, because the author made the entire thing up. I would have been better off with a book with a clear plot and a clear goal. It was a disappointing book that I wouldn't recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with this book. It is filled with bad grammar and bad spelling, and is filled to the brim with historical inaccuracies. This is especially disappointing since this book was supposed to be a history of the American Revolution. The book starts out by saying that it was "written" by a certain Thomas Jefferson. I knew this was not true because Jefferson never lived to write the book. I do believe that the book was written by a member of the family of Thomas Jefferson, but the book is still very bad and the author should be ashamed of himself. The writing is really bad and you are not going to be able to understand what is being said unless you have a good understanding of history. I have seen the video and I still have a hard time understanding what is going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry, but I didn't feel like reading this book. I know it's a long story and I've read a lot of these, but for a story that's this long, it's just not very interesting to me. I understand why a lot people like it, but to me it's not interesting and I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if I had read the synopsis. This is not to say that I don't like it; I think it's one of the better books I've ever read, and I'll probably reread it later on, but in terms of the story it's kind of a let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was an overblown, poorly written mess that is difficult to read for its length. It is an example of a poorly written book with an overabundance of details that add nothing but confusion. This book is a bit of a mess. This story was a total bummer, and even though it has its good points, I am still bitter that it is a book I will not read ever again.  I do not know if I am an overly dramatic person or a bitter person, but I really wanted this book to be good, and I was very disappointed. ____________________________________________________________ I think it is time that people stop being such idiots.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- 1) This is an interesting, but not very good, book. The writing style is a little bit rough. There is no humor in it, but there is no point to it either. The story is not interesting at all. 2) The setting is interesting and well developed. I was able to find it interesting and even somewhat appealing. 3) The characters were good, but too weak. There was too little development to be interesting. 4) There is a lot of violence in this book, and a lot in this review. However, it was not done very often. I'm sure that this is what the author intended. 5) The pacing was a bit too slow for me, but I can forgive that as it is not the main thing I am complaining about. 6) I have read this book in a few different formats (paperback, paperback, audiobook, and audiobook-only). It is a good read in each format. 7) I'm going to read a few other books by this author in the future, as they are well written and interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I hate this book. It was so bad that I have no idea what to say about it other than it is just plain awful. The story is not bad, it is simply bad. The characters are a mess, and the story itself is just bad.   This book is about a girl named Lucy. She is a very young girl with her dad being in a coma, she's being raised by her grandpa. Her grandpa is a nice guy, but Lucy hates him and doesn't like him. But Lucy is a tomboy, she likes boys, and she is a little bit smart. Lucy is always trying to find her dad, she wants him back, but she just doesn't know how. The thing is though, when Lucy's dad dies, she takes on the role of her dad. The problem is, she hates him. She wants to go back to her old life, but it seems like she doesn't have the right to go home and have a family.   The problem with Lucy is that she always feels like she is the one who's not good enough. She doesn't want to be in the boys club, she doesn�t want to wear boy clothes, she just wants to be like her mom. But then when she does something like dress up as a boy to go to a party, her mom is really pissed off and she yells at her for that. But she does it anyway. When Lucy doesn't get along with her mom, she gets very angry and says she will kill her. Lucy doesn�ts understand what is going on. Lucy thinks she is her mom�s favorite daughter, but her mom doesn�st know that Lucy wants her to be her own daughter.   the plot is bad because it is so hard to understand. I kept trying to figure out why Lucy would want to kill her mom when she is only 7, but I couldn�t figure it out. Lucy goes back and forth between being her dad and her mom and it seems to be a really hard task for her. I can understand why her mom wouldn�t like her, but what does Lucy have to gain by killing her mom? But Lucy keeps going back and back to the scene where she murdered her mom because she just can�t understand it. The ending was horrible because it was so hard for me to understand why she would do it. But it didn�t make sense to me.  ....   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think it is a great story. It has some of the best characters and the best dialogue I have read. I just wish it had a little more substance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a very boring read. I just wanted to read more of this book. I'm not a huge fan of vampires but I think this book was just too long. I really wish the author would make this book into a trilogy. I think that would make the book a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It was really frustrating, this book did not really have any depth or depth in the book. I don't mean to say this book was poorly written, the book is just that, bad. The story is really bad, and the characters were poorly developed. I had to keep re-reading the book to make sense of things, which is really a shame because the story was really good. I really liked the ending of the book, but that's about all I could really say about the book because I have no interest in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I got this book at the recommendation of my husband who loves historical fiction. This book was a great start. The book starts out by showing the beginnings of slavery in the British Isles, and then shows the history of the British Empire in India, Egypt, North Africa, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. There is a good amount of historical fact as well as a good bit of fantasy, but it was not a bad start. However, I was disappointed that it did not go into detail about the political situation in the United States during the Civil War. That is a little too small a thing to get the historical background across."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________.   "There is no place to hide."   There are many reasons why I did not like this book, and one of the most important reasons is that I was not interested in reading about how a person can survive in a culture that is dominated by sex. The first thing I noticed about the book is that it is full of sex, which is a shame because I was expecting more. I can understand the fact that the author has been writing novels about sex, but the book was just so sexual and full of dirty jokes and crude remarks, which I did NOT find interesting or funny. There were a few other things in the book that I thought were a little off-putting, and I didn't like them, but in the end, this is my only reason to not give the book a good review. The other reasons that I did dislike the book are that there are so many things that I don't like about it, that it really doesn't deserve a five star rating, and that the story is just plain silly and the characters are really not likeable. The main character is a very nice person, but she just doesn't seem to have any depth to her at all. Her life is a lot like the characters in the books I have read before. The book has a little more romance in it, but it is not really a part of the story that I liked or that I found interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I read this book and found it to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The author wrote the book in a way that is very hard to understand. I was reading the book and started getting excited and then the story turned and went downhill fast. It was confusing, and the writing was bad. I also don't think that there was much of a plot to the book. The book basically is a collection of short stories and no one in the story has any sense of how to get the story to continue. I didn't think it was a good story, but I am not a book reviewer so I am going to give it 3 stars because it is one of my favorites.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had absolutely no idea what to do with the protagonist, and there was zero characterization of her.  She is a character that is the product of a tragic relationship between her father and her mother, and the author has no clue how to bring that character to life.  The writing is so sloppy and clunky that I couldn't make out anything she was trying to say, so the whole story was a mess from start to finish.  There is a very important character, a family member, who is not given a chance to speak.  I was so disappointed in this book that I would have given it zero stars if the book hadn't been so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I didn't like this book very much at all. It's hard to explain but it was just so much nonsense that I had to put it down after a few chapters. It was hard to follow as the author went off on a tangent and then stopped. I didn the book in the beginning because I read the reviews on Goodreads and found it a good read. It wasn't until after the first chapter that I started to get irritated by the book. I ended up reading the whole thing and then deleted it. It just didn't seem worth it to me. I'll have to try it again on a Kindle but I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is so dull, it's like a good book is being put to waste. I can't help but feel sorry for the author, she's just so bad at writing a story. It's the worst I've read so far. I could tell the author didn't care about the story or the characters because it's so boring. If she were writing for kids she'd probably do a better job but the adults are just too annoying to be fun. It just seems like she put all her effort into the book and not into the characters. I didn't really care about any of them. The only character I really liked was the girl who died. She had a good heart and a lot of potential to grow. The other characters were just annoying and didn't do anything. I don't know why she was the only one that was given a chance. I wish she was in more books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********************I don't understand why anyone would buy this book. It is very poorly written. I think the author has no interest in writing a decent book. I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the stupidity and stupidity of his characters. It's hard to think of a worse person to have written a book about. It would be better if he had written a story about some really good characters, like an episode of The X-Files or an episode on The Sopranos, and made them seem like real people instead of a bunch of wacky characters. But he doesn't have the talent to do that. The book was boring and had very little substance. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very boring, as if it was written in a style that is meant to be a "quick read" but is actually very difficult to follow. The plot is extremely convoluted, with a lot of twists and turns. The only things that make sense are the first 3-4 chapters, and the plot is so unclear that it's very hard to get into. The author makes things seem easier to understand the later in the book, but at the end it's a mess. The characters are also very bland, with most of them being either a little too shallow or too "good looking." The only character who is interesting is a guy who is a little bit annoying, but he has his moments. I was disappointed that the author didn't really show much of the conflict in the world. I'd expect to see a lot more conflict in a sci-fi book, and I'd like to see the author's ideas explored more. The end is kind of disappointing as well, because it's almost like the author is trying to make me think it's all worth it, but in the end I don't really feel like it's worth it. The best thing about this book is the ending, but I wish it was better. If you want a quick read, this might be for you. If this is your first sci-fiction book, you'll probably be disappointed. If it's your second, you might enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful.  It took a very interesting topic (sex addiction) and turned it into an embarrassing, embarrassing, very sexual, very embarrassing book.  I read this book because it was in a book club and I wanted to get a new book.   It had the words "novel" in the title and I figured I would give it a shot.   I was so wrong.   This is not a novel.   No, this is a poorly written book that tries to cover the ground of sex addiction and it is so badly written that I will never read another book written by this person.    When you read the book, you have no idea that the author is so much more intelligent than you think she is.   The author has no clue about sex and doesn't know anything about it, so she makes things up.   For example, one of the main characters in this book is a woman who was in love with a man for a long time.  They broke up, and she was devastated.  When she tried to find him and get back in touch with him, she discovered that he was not who she thought he was.   He was a sexual deviant.   So she went back to him, and this is where the book takes a big turn.  After all that, they are back together.   You'd think she would have realized this guy was an asshole and leave him for good, right?  Nope.   She kept trying to get back together with him.   Eventually she decided she was sick of trying to find this asshole and she started to have sex with him instead.   Now she's not sure why she is doing this, but she is sure it is for him.  Then she learns he has cheated on her.   Oh, he has.    I don't know how the author came up with this idea.   What kind of sick woman would cheat on her man with another woman?   She is obviously a slut.   Then she has a sex change and starts living as a man again.  I'm sure the author thought this was a brilliant idea.  It is not.  This is an abomination of a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a wonderful time reading this book. It was fun and informative and made me feel better about my body. However, the authors make a big deal out of the number of "pink triangles" in your vagina. I mean, that's all it is, a pink triangle. There are no vaginal veins, no cervix, no vaginal walls, nothing. The whole point of a vagina is to get pregnant, and the idea of having a pink one, even in a woman who has never been pregnant, is really gross. It made me cringe. This book is for those who are interested in learning about the vulva and how it works, and want to get their information in a fun and interesting way. However... I do not want to be told that there are lots of pink triangles in my vagina, and that I must not worry about it. It is a book about sex and about how to have sex, not about how I should have sex. I recommend this book, but I would not buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ This is a very bad book. It has the same bad problems as other books in the series, and even worse. First of all, the story itself is really bad. The characters are boring and the plot is pretty bad too. In fact, the book is a little too long, as it feels like it was meant to be the middle book, but the author decided to cut it to the end. The ending is a complete mess and there is a lot of questions that I don't have answers for. For instance, what was the point of this whole mess? Why was the author going on about this guy? Why did they go to all that trouble to get this guy to meet them? And why did they have to do it at all? The author doesn't give the answer to these questions. All in all, this is just a bad middle book in the Dresden Files series, although it has its good parts. If you are a fan of the series and would like to continue reading this series, you will have to look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I found this book to be nothing more than a poorly written, amateurish attempt at being an action novel with a strong female lead.  She is not a strong character, nor is she developed to a high enough level to warrant this being a novel.   I don't understand why this is the case.  If the story were more interesting or if the characters had more personality, I would have been much more invested.  I would rather have read a more focused novel that focused more on the main characters.  " (2/10) "I'm not a big fan of action books.  The action scenes are very basic and generic.  Unfortunately, the only thing I enjoyed about this book was the ending." (3/10)" (from Amazon.com Review) What I liked: I liked the characters. It's hard to find a good female lead in an action book, but Ms. Hines pulls it off. She has a strong, confident personality that works for the story. I really like the way she is written. The action scenes were very well done. The main character fights some bad guys and is able to take down several of them. The scenes are intense and well paced.  I really liked the ending.  It was pretty good, too.  There's no real twist or anything that changes the main character's outlook on life, so I don`t think that it is a huge letdown.  (4/10") What i didnt like: "I am a big proponent of using characters as your basis for your plot.  But if you try to use these characters too early and too heavily in your plot, you risk leaving readers with the feeling that they don't know the main cast of characters and that you have something special in mind.  And that can be pretty bad.  So I really liked this novel, but I would suggest to read the first three chapters of it first.  That way, you can see if you are really going to be able to use characters well and if you want them to be fully fleshed out.  Then, if you feel like you are getting close, move on to the rest of the book.  Otherwise, you might find yourself frustrated by the lack of character development, and by the slow pacing of the novel. " (1/10" (from Amazon review) I found the plot to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have given this a 4.5 if I didn't think the first half of the book was completely useless. I mean, it's a story about a guy who has been turned into a vampire, but I don't think that's the most interesting part. This book is about the two main characters, a boy and a girl, and their struggles with the fact that they're vampires. The vampire thing is the interesting part, and it's not really what the book is actually about. It's about a boy who has to deal with the problems of being a vampire. There's no real conflict in the book. There are a few fights that get resolved, but nothing truly happens. The boy is just a main character. The girl has her own issues, and a lot of the focus is on her. She has her issues, too. The book could have been great if it had been about her, but it's only really about the boy. The whole book is just about the vampire boy and the girl. The only real conflict is when the boy and girl have to deal to make sure that they don't accidentally kill someone. That's about it. It would have been really good if the book had focused on the girl and how her character develops. If it had, it would have made this a 5 or a 6.   "What the hell happened to you?"  "I was just in love with the girl."  She said nothing. She didn't answer. "You know I loved you, right? You loved me, right?" She shook her head. "No, I didn?t." He said. "I didn't know you loved me. I thought you just wanted me to make you happy." He shook his head again. "It wasn't me, you know it wasn't you. It wasn't anything you did. It just wasn't. It was something in me."   [Note: I'm sorry about this one. It got mixed reviews from the time it was written, but my original copy didn't have the chapter titles listed in the bibliography. I guess I just got confused, so I didn,t really read through the book until about the third time I was reading it. That is, I was just reading through the chapters and the chapters started getting mixed up in my mind. I had no idea what I was doing. I didn t want to waste a lot more time
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The plot is a train wreck and the characters are a disaster. They are not to be trusted, they are all stupid and evil and the only one who really gets away with murder is the narrator. There is a really great scene at the end of the book where she tells us she just wants to be free of her stupid character, but the ending just makes me want to throw up in my mouth and go read something else. There was a huge part of me that was rooting for this character to get away with it and I just couldn't understand why the narrator did nothing about it."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. (If you're like me, the book sucked. I'm not saying this because I'm a bad person, I'm saying this out of spite because the book is bad. I wish the author would have just put up a positive review. It wouldn't have hurt.)   I had read a lot of good books before I started this one. The plot of this one is good, the characters are all interesting, the setting is great, and the ending was a nice little bow.   The only thing that bothered me was the beginning, where the characters try to find a place to live after being evicted. They are not given a chance to prove their worth. They go back to their apartment in a homeless camp, and they are just as miserable there as they were before. I think the author was trying to say that the situation is hopeless for these people. It's like she was saying that people with nowhere to go should just stay in their apartments forever.   of course this was my fault for being so impatient. It didn't take the author very long to figure out that I was impatient.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of your time.  It's so bad, you will probably never buy it again.  The book is called "Mystery" and is about a boy named David who discovers that he has a rare disease that can only be cured by the "mysterious" medicine of a young woman named Eve.   The first part of the book is about David and his mother, Alice, who are trying to help him, trying to keep him away from Eve.   David's father is a lawyer who is trying to get a divorce so that he can remarry Eve. Eve's father wants her to live in a house that is close to his, but she wants to go to live with David's mother. David is very confused about how to get Eve to live near him.  Eve's mother tells David that she is trying but it is going to be a hard road.  The part where David learns about the disease is really sad and you want David to find a cure but it all ends in a horrible way.  I have never read anything like this book.  After you finish this book, you are just sad for David.  You want to run to Eve and tell her that you love her.  This book is like the bad old days of science fiction and horror.  For all the good parts of the novel, the book's ending just does not work.  What a shame because I really like the first half of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think I was expecting a lot more from this book. The ending was a little predictable but I suppose the plot needed to be kept moving.  The book doesn't really tell a whole lot of information, and the characters don't get much depth.  Read the book on Amazon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read many good books, but none I've enjoyed as much as this one.  The author is a genius at what he does.  This book is so entertaining and thought provoking, you'll laugh out loud.  You'll have the heartbreak of a child being bullied by a parent, you will laugh at the author's brilliant humor and you will love the characters in the book, especially the girl.  4/5 stars for the story, 4.5 stars as a fun read
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a book that I really liked.  But it was a terrible book.   I just didn't enjoy reading it.  It was bad.  The main characters are so lame.  They're so much like the rest of the book that it was very annoying to me.  I really didn't like the characters.  As a matter of fact, I hate the main character.  My favorite character is the one in the background.  That's why I hate her so much.  She's just a stupid idiot.  It's all so dull and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've read in ages. I'm so glad that I've started reading a couple of new authors and picked up a couple from my local library, but this is the first time I've seen a book like this. This book is full of spelling errors, badly written dialogue, and no plot. If you are reading this book because you like Stephen King, then please stop reading. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, even though it is short enough to read in a few sittings. I was so annoyed with the ending that I actually took a few days to read it. I wish I had finished it, because I'm going to have a hard time giving this book any more of my money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a hard time giving these books a negative rating. They are just bad. They don't teach you anything. It's like a video game. They make it so difficult to figure out the puzzles that you might as well not have bought them. I hate how there are no answers in the back of the book. They should have a back of where you can get the answers.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- "I can't recommend this book to anyone because the story is lame and it is written in a style that I find distracting. I don't have a problem with the main character's sexuality, but I feel that the main story, the "hurt" of his family, and the "what ifs" are more important to the story than what he is actually doing in his bedroom."  I received the book in exchange for an honest review.   I was going to give this book three stars, but it was just so bland.   The main character was so annoying. He was just trying to make friends and not interested in anything in particular.  , even though the main focus of the story was on the father's relationship with his son. I can't believe it was not made into a movie.  .  , and there was just no story. It wasn't like there was a "What If" but it seemed that the father was a total dick. It was just such a bland book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the kind of book that, as I was reading it, I kept thinking, "Why are they using these words?" This book is full of them! There is a lot of hyperbole in this book. When it comes to the characters, they are all so unrealistic and unrealistic. And when they're not talking about themselves, I just can't relate to them. This book doesn't give you any reasons why you should like the characters. They don't tell you why they want to be the heroes, or why they are not going to be happy about it. There is no reason why you want to read this book, and it's not even that good of a book. It's like they thought it was going to appeal to me, and they really don't.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I just finished this book. I really liked it, but I am very disappointed by the ending. It was just so rushed, and the ending was a complete disappointment. I didn't feel like I had gotten anything out of the book, and I really didn't enjoy reading it. This book should have been better. The characters were interesting, and their feelings for each other were touching, but the ending just felt like a cop out. I don't feel that it should have ended like this. There was no way to finish the book other than reading the final chapter, which felt like an afterthought. I also think that it would have been easier to end the book on a better note than ending it like this, but it wasn't the end that I was looking for. --------------------------- Overall: --------------- 5 stars. This is a very good book that should be in every woman's collection. I am a woman that loves a good romance, and this book is the perfect book for me. I was a little disappointed that I did not feel like this was a great ending for the book (I liked the ending better when I read it), but I can't complain because it was a very well written book. The only thing I don.t like is the ending, but since the book ended very well, it didn't bother me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This book was written in the 60s when people were still in their teens and still living with their parents. This book contains a lot of the same old cliches that have always been used. It has all the usual suspects in it, like the love triangle, the girl that always wins the man, the love at first sight, the mother's advice to the girl and so on. But the writing itself is so bad. There are several occasions when it is hard to understand a word that is being said. I didn't find anything new, just recycled stuff. If you are looking for a good book to read, then this isn't it. I give it one star, because I am trying to find good books that are written well. This is just a waste of time and money.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I was not impressed with this book. I had a hard time with the book. The plot was not well developed. The characters seemed like stereotypes. The author did not make the plot clear. This is a book that you must be able to tell the reader "I do not know the ending of this book, and I do not want to know." You have to be able tell that the author has done a bad job, not a good one. I feel that this book is a waste of time.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- (I had to do this on another review because I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. ) I didn�t find this book that interesting. I thought the character development was interesting but the story itself wasn't. I read this because of the fact that it was being made into a movie. However, if I had known it was a film, I would have never bought the book. It was written as a novel and I didn`t really think it would make it into a film. I had to wait for it to be released in the theater. Overall, the movie is OK. If you�re a fan of the book, then it�s worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It has the feel of a children's book with a terrible plot.  The protagonist is a little boy who learns to swim by reading his favorite book.   It's not good, and I found it really difficult to get through the entire book, but the characters are really adorable.  I did have to look up "the boy with the duck's nose" in the book, and it wasn't until I did that I realized how much the author had ripped off a book called "H.M.S. Pinafore" (I'm looking at you, Barbara Walters!).   And this book has one of the worst endings I've ever read, and yet it didn't bother me enough to cancel my subscription.  6) "I'm a Bookworm, Not a Monster" by Jennifer Lee:   I have a book about a bookworm who discovers he's actually a monster who needs to be tamed, so he reads books to keep his sanity, but his favorite is a childrens' book about the creatures who live in a book. I liked the idea that the reader would learn about the "giant monster" that is trying to destroy the world from the book. But this book was so bad that I actually didn't even bother reading it.  It was terrible.  And I can't wait to be done with the series, because I can only imagine the terrible sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ My daughter and I loved this book. She thought it was a very entertaining story. But when she got it, she discovered that there was no story at all, just a story of a woman who is in a bad place. I would recommend this book to a child or young adult. It is not a good book but a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not for the faint of heart. It has a lot of gore and violence, and is definitely not for kids.   However, I do think that it is a good book to read to get a general idea of what it is like to be a woman in the Middle Ages.  The book is written in a very old fashioned style with a lot more "rude language" than in today's books. It is a very long book, but it is good that this author wrote a very big book to try to teach a lesson.  It is also a good way to learn the meaning of the words used in the book. I have to say that the book did not work on me as well as it should have. I was not very happy with the ending and the ending did not quite fit in with the book as a whole.   10 of 13 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. There was some good points and some bad points. There is a great story and a nice little ending. The characters were likeable. The writing is good. I didn't find this book too dark. There were some scary parts, but nothing too hard to handle. The story was just enough to keep my interest and interest stayed through the whole book. I was a little surprised that this book had a second half. Maybe I'm a sucker for books with cliffhangers.   Recommended to all the horror fans.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Last night I had a fantastic time reading The Girl in the Fireplace by Edith Wharton. I loved the setting and the characters, and I enjoyed the story. However, I had some trouble with the plot. I really enjoyed the first half of the book, where Edith and Edith's daughter have an adventure. However they have to leave the house after an argument because Edith believes that her husband is a jerk and that she is not happy in the marriage. She goes to Paris, and the story is told from Edith/Edith's point of view. The second half is told by the other characters, including Edith. I liked how Edith took a different viewpoint than the one Edith was taking at the beginning. However Edith does not feel like she is taken seriously, or that her character is important. She thinks she is "just one more little lady" and she doesn't have to think about things that might matter to her family. I did not like her attitude toward her husband, and it bothered me a lot. She is always trying to be independent, but I feel like there is an ulterior motive. She really wants to be liked and have a life of her own. She wants to move out, and she wants to leave her family behind. She never stops trying to get out, but she never manages to do so.I also did not find the ending satisfying, and didn't feel that it was the ending the author intended. It was too much of a happy ending and I felt that it would be better for the book to have ended on a more dramatic note. I'm still a fan of the series, but this book did not satisfy me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story and characters were so terrible and the plot so ridiculous that I felt like I was reading a badly written YA novel about the war in Iraq and a group of teenage girls in a military school. I was so bored by the characters that I had to put it down before it got too bad.  Also, the author is a liar.  A few things that bothered me about the book: The characters all had different names and they all had very different personalities.    The book was written in a way that I don't like when it is done by a female author.  They all were stupid.  I found it so frustrating when the author claimed that she never lied to the children but then she lied to them when she talked to them.  The only thing that made me feel sorry for the characters was when they were told that they were going to be sent to an army school.  Then all of a sudden they were sent to the army school and were told how much fun they were having there.  Also, the book was too long.  There was no way in the world that it was going to fit in a book that I could read in one sitting.  This book is so stupid that I didn't care what happened to the characters.  It was so stupid I could have never read a book like it.  So if you are a teen or adult and want to read a story about a group called the "Vet School" that has the best kids in the country, I suggest you stop reading it now.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I've read some good books but this one is the worst --------------- This book is so bad that I'm ashamed to say I bought it for free --------------- What a book! If you have ever had a bad experience with a doctor or a dentist it's this book --------------- You would think that a person in the 19th century would know better than to use a toothbrush, especially with the mess that they make. --------------- --------------- The book starts off by describing the invention of the modern toothbrush. I've never seen a better example of bad writing and bad science. The second half is a history of toothbrushes, followed by an example of a real toothbrush which I have never seen before in my life. The end is just a waste of time. The author says that there is a toothpaste that works well on the human mouth, but no one ever uses it. ------------- This is a book about a tooth brush that was invented in 1798 and that works on the mouth. It's basically like a big piece of plastic with bristles on it and a little hole in the top to get in and out of the mouth and rinse your mouth out. Now, it was supposed to work for that reason. ------------ This book doesn't tell you what the real thing is. You have to read the article to learn that it is not toothpaste. There is no information about how long the brush lasts or how it works. -------------- It's a good example of an unprofessional book that has no real idea of what it is talking about -------------- The book is not really bad, but it just doesn't really say anything. It is a very bad book. ------------------------- This book should be taken as a joke and not taken seriously. ********* I would not recommend this book to anyone ************* It's good for fun but not good for scientific research ********** This is not a book you want to read about toothbrushing, it's just a funny story and you don't need to know what a toothbrush is to get a good laugh *********** This book has very bad science and bad writing *********************
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a very big fan of Jodi Picoult's work. I love all of her books (and will continue to read them) but this book is a disappointment to me.  This is a bad story.  A good book: "A young woman is raped and murdered by her boyfriend while she is out with her boyfriend. The killer and victim were high school sweethearts. The victim was found dead in the woods and the killer was a troubled young man who had been recently released from prison. The boyfriend had been drinking and was involved in an affair at the time. When the police investigated the crime they found that the killer had been hiding his victim in the car all night, and that the victim was raped after he left her in the backseat of the car. When his girlfriend left for work at the local hospital, she saw the body of the victim and called police. The body was too badly decomposed to tell for sure who had killed the girl but the killer did leave behind a distinctive footprint and a blood-soaked sweater. The police also found that her boyfriend had used his cell phone to leave a cryptic message on his girlfriend's answering machine at the hospital. The message said, 'I killed her, not you. She is gone.' When the girlfriend went to the hospital to report the murder, she was shocked to see that the bloody sweater was still in the victim's car. A week later, the victim showed up in the emergency room of a nearby hospital with no memory of her life. She had also lost her purse and her cellphone was missing. The girlfriend went home and called the police. Two days later, when the boyfriend was arrested, he admitted to killing the victim. A few days later he was found hanged in his jail cell. When questioned, he said, "I killed the woman, not her. I was drunk at the bar, and she came home with me. We had sex. We both fell asleep. Then I woke up in my car and raped her. She was not dead. She woke up and saw me in the rearview mirror. She screamed for help. I drove away. I found her in a field. I dragged her to the car and killed her. Then my cell phone ran out of power and I could not contact the police." The story is really good and I enjoyed it.  It's an interesting story, and I am not sure how it ended up the way it did.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________  A good book on how to write a good book:  I've been writing since I was eight years old. The best part about writing is finding the stories you can tell and how to tell them well. The second best part is being able to share the stories with others.   But the third best part of writing is that I get to be a part of other people's stories. It's a rare and special feeling that is only possible when you have written a book.   the story was interesting, and it had some great characters. However, I thought the ending was a bit of a let down.   of course, it is the author's job to make the readers feel as if they were there, and that they really have been there. I think he did that. However my experience with the book was much different than what I expected. It didn't feel real to me.   (This is the second book I've bought on amazon from this author. The first one was The Last Bookstore. The only difference was the book store had a great selection and a very warm atmosphere. The book store was empty and cold. The last book store I have ever been to was in Los Angeles. They were all very busy and noisy, with people arguing and laughing. But I loved it! So, that's my experience from the last bookstore. Now on to my experience here.   The first sentence is interesting. The author tells the story from the point of view of the book, and we know that we are not in it with the characters. So, we get a lot of first person, and I really like that. The way the book is narrated is a little off. Sometimes he doesn't use the right words. The story could have been told a different way, and maybe the book could have gone on. But it's a good way to start.  That said, the book has some great moments. The descriptions of the buildings were very detailed, and there were many details about the places. The writing style is very good. He had a good grasp of grammar. The prose is very clear and concise. The sentences are not long, and the words do not get in the way of the story.  But the last part of the chapter, where the character is about to tell a story, is very long. I thought it could have just been a few paragraphs, and then the reader could get into the story
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last third of this book is about the same thing as the first three books in the series. This is a bit disappointing, as it's not just an extension of the previous books. The plot gets a bit more interesting here, with more character development and less generic adventure, but still not much. The main characters are still basically the same and the story has been pretty much the same since book one. This one is just a waste of time and a few pages to make you go "yeah, I guess we're done with this, but what a boring book!"
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all.  I have read several of these books by the same author, and I am not happy with any of them. Â The first one is about a man who loses his house, a job, and his girlfriend and moves to a small town.  He's a very likable guy, but his girlfriend is just plain annoying.  I understand that the author was trying to create a "mysterious" and "dark" atmosphere, but it just didn't work.   There are some good moments, but I can't recommend this book.  It was just bad.  The second book, "Wizard's Apprentice" is about an apprentice wizard who has to deal with an evil wizard who's trying to kidnap a princess.  The only problem is, the princess is not a princess at all, and the wizard is a bit too evil.  This book has some good ideas, but the story doesn't hold up.  You could say that the book is more of a psychological thriller.  There are some very good ideas in this book, but all of them are overshadowed by the author's tendency to overuse the word "goddamn".  And the third book,  "Wizards" is also about a wizard who must defeat an evil magician.  But this book is a very different story.  Instead of fighting the evil wizard, the wizard has to defeat a whole town full of evil wizards.  Again, the author is trying to portray a world that is a lot more dangerous than it actually is.  Unfortunately, the evil wizards in this story are just plain evil. I don't know how the author could have been so dumb as to not know that these are not real wizards. There is a certain point where I realized that the whole book is just a big joke, and that's when I knew I couldn't give this book a good review.  Overall, I think the author has a way with words and it shows in the stories he writes.  However, if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, or just fantasy in general, don't read these books.  They are just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book and I just didn't like it. It is very poorly written. The characters have little development, and the story is very predictable. I just wish it had been more interesting. I would have liked more action, more mystery and more action/fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "If you like a good book, you'll like this one. It is a book about the end of the world, and how humanity will be able to survive it. I would recommend it to anyone who's ever wanted to know what it would be like to live on a dying planet. It also has an awesome title!"  Review: "In this short, but sweet book, the author is trying to explain the end times of our world in a way that is accessible and easy to understand. There is a little bit of science here and there, but for the most part, it is more about the human race's spiritual and moral struggles and how we will survive this world, one that has gone from being the most beautiful and perfect world in the universe to a very sad place. If you are interested in this topic, and don't mind a short book, read this. I recommend this to anyone."  4 out of 5 stars Megan I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the lack of scientific jargon and the author's presentation. I have a hard time understanding the science of the book, though I'm glad she doesn't try to make it too complex. I found the book to be a little confusing at times, and I felt the author did a poor job of explaining what we can know and what we won't know. I'm sure I'll be able read more about this subject in other books in the future.  5 out of 6 stars T.W.I.N. I've read several books on the end time in our universe. In all cases the author has presented his/her ideas with a scientific approach, but this book is the first to me that actually gives a good description of the end-time. The author gives you enough to think about and give you a clear understanding of what we will all have to deal with in the near future. I really enjoyed this book. .  the book is really well written, and the science is explained very well. the author gives some good explanations for what we might have to expect in the next few centuries.  to me the science doesn't get in the way of the story. The book is very easy to read and doesn't require a degree in science to understand it. The book is well written and the book doesn't contain any religious material. I personally like the idea of the last few years. I think the author gave us enough warning so that we won
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are flat and uninteresting.  They seem like they're there to be used and discarded.  The book starts out with the protagonist, a young man named Alex, and his friend, a little girl named Anna, on their way to the beach.  It starts out great.   I love when a book starts off with a big picture or something, and then follows the main character as he gets into trouble.  I especially love that the book doesn't just have the main guy and the girl going to the ocean, it has the main girl and the boy going to a desert, and the main boy going off into the sunset to do some other shit, but at the end it is a desert.  The world they're in is like a desert and there's not much going on.  But the writing is just so good.  From the first sentence to the last.  There's a great amount of character development, and a lot of conflict between the characters.  If you read a book and it has a great start, then that's why you read it.  This book is a great way to learn about what you want to read, and if you want a good read, then you should give this book a try.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting look at the history of the New York Stock Exchange and it's dealings with a group of Wall Street traders known as the "Patsies". They are the people who put their own stock trades in the exchange for their own profit and got paid for it in the process. While I did find the book interesting, it could have been a bit better if the author had covered some of the more well known scandals in the stock exchange and the NYSE.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a bit disappointed in this one. I don't mind stories about magical children, but this book is so poorly written and paced.  It is just too slow. The story is told in chapters and is basically told in first person, but the whole story is very confusing and takes way too long to finish. The kids' adventures are pretty fun, but it is just so long that I feel like the whole thing could have been shorter. I feel that there is a lot more to this book that could have be explored. I would like to know more about the story and why it is so magical, or if the children are actually supposed to be that powerful or if there is some kind of curse. The ending is kind of anticlimactic and feels kind of rushed, so I'm really disappointed with this book. It is a good read, but not a great one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book was so bad that it ruined me. I bought it to read because I am a huge fan of J.K. Rowling, and I had heard good things about this series. It seemed to be a good series, but it didn't live up to the hype. I am not a fan of the Harry Potter series, and this book is so bad I almost skipped it. The characters are so poorly written that I almost wanted to throw them out the window. I found it extremely frustrating and the characters seemed to not care about anything other than what they were doing. It took me about 5 minutes to realize the plot wasn't going anywhere, and when I did, it ended abruptly. The entire book seemed to go in circles, with absolutely nothing really happening. The only real good thing about this book was that I found out a great deal more about the characters than I thought I would. I'm not sure what the real story is with this book, and there are some really disturbing things that happened to some of the characters, but this book doesn't deserve to be read by anyone who doesn't like a good good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A good book by a good author, but nothing special. The writing is ok but I feel there is a lot of repetition of the same story, which isn't very good. Also, a lot is missing from this book: There is no character development, no exploration of any plot or character. There are no characters who are not bad. The story is just about two young people who want to kill people, and are trying to convince other people to kill them." I loved this book, it was a good book but it had some plot holes and plot holes in the plot hole that I found interesting and interesting, which is not a bad thing but I would have preferred more of a story about the characters that I enjoyed. "If I had not seen a documentary about the Columbine shootings I would not have seen the connection. Columbine was about the same thing, but not the same type of people. I am a good person and am not violent, but I am not as good as you." It is about a girl and her boyfriend who are having a problem, one girl thinks she is in love with him and the other girl thinks he is a murderer and he is not very good at love and not good at having a relationship. It has a couple of different parts. The girl and the boyfriend are at a party and it turns out that he is going to be there the whole time. It starts off bad but gets better as the story goes on. There is a guy at a movie theater that is going out with the girlfriend of the girl and he doesn't know that the girl is cheating on him and that is why he has a hard time getting out of the house. I think it is a good story and there is not that many things that are wrong with it. I thought the book was good, it had a few flaws but it was still good. The one flaw that I noticed was that the author did not follow up with the characters. He did mention the two people he met that were in the school, but it did not seem like they were connected to each other. It is not too bad but I wish they had a little more about the people. If you like a good read and like to be surprised, you might enjoy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************"This is a book I can see me going back to. It has a story that's well told and an engaging plot that keeps you turning the pages.

But when she and her brother find a gold bracelet that could save their father's life, they find themselves thrust into a world of intrigue and danger. I don't know if I've ever seen a book this engaging or this well-written. I had to keep turning the page. It's definitely one of the best books I've read."   "I found myself looking forward to reading more. It is a well-told story that I hope to read more of. It also has a good cast of characters. There are the evil ones, the heroes, the villains, and the children that you love to hate. They are all well developed and have some nice moments. I think this book is the reason why I wanted to read the other books in the series."  , July 4, 2009"This book is definitely a good read, and I enjoyed it as a book."  . I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, as it really gave me hope for the story to continue and hopefully some of the characters to come back. It didn't let me down, and it definitely wasn't a book to be put down by. I enjoyed the story, the characters, and that the plot kept me turning the next page. This book was a really good one, and definitely a keeper."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute disaster. The plot is terrible and the characters are all cliche and annoying. The writing is horrible and the plot is awful. I have no idea what the point of this book was. I can't imagine how anyone could get any enjoyment from this book. I don't know who wrote this, but this book is a huge disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I received in the mail was really interesting. It was hard to read because the book is hard to understand. The author did not explain the basics of the book very well. It would be a good idea to have a teacher to help the readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   I don't know if I was just expecting too much from this book, or if I just didn't like this author, but either way this is not what I expected from a book on the history of the New Deal and the Great Society. The book is just too short. There's a chapter about how Franklin Delano Roosevelt had to convince the American people that they could take care of themselves and there were more important things than "stuff" and how that didn't make them think they had any reason to believe that FDR was actually a socialist, and how this is why we have a lot of the Great Depression stories that we do. Then there's a discussion of what Roosevelt did during the Depression to try to stop it, and then there's another chapter about what FDR did after the Depression. It's all very short, but it was the kind of short that leaves me feeling like I was getting a tiny little taste of something. It also makes me wonder about what the author really meant by the whole FDR/socialist thing.   My rating for the book: 4 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking it would be a good read.  It wasn't.   The writing is terrible, and there is so little to say about it that I can't think of anything to say at all.  Posted by Tasha at 10:58 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ I love this book and it was my first one to read. The characters were so well drawn, and the story was very good. It had some interesting concepts, but I found it to be slow at the beginning. I had to start it over several times. I also found the story boring. I couldn't get excited about anything. The story itself was good, but it wasn't all that exciting, and I didn't care that much about any of the characters. I would read the sequel, but not with any expectations, but more just for a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is full of bad ideas and bad advice. There is no discussion of the different kinds of self-care, and no discussion on how to be happy in a relationship. The book is filled with the author's self-serving ideas and opinions. She makes the claim that her relationship with her boyfriend is "normal," and I think the author needs to reevaluate her own relationships. This book is the most depressing thing I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I'm giving this book a B because it's just a bad, poorly written book. There is absolutely no tension and the story is boring. I liked the character's and the setting, but the story just didn't interest me at all. I know I'm supposed to like it and it's a good read, but it just wasn't that good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most disappointing book I have read so far. The book is about a man who is in a long term relationship with a woman and is unable to make her happy. The man is also a bit of a jerk and has a hard time with his feelings. The woman tries to help him out by trying to cheer him up and make him realize how good he is at what he does. This is all going along perfectly until the woman gets sick. The girl does what she can to help the man get over her and then dies. This book is the complete opposite of The Giver.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone, but it did leave me wanting something more, as the writing style is pretty light and you can see why this is a book about a teenager in high school. I was expecting more from a book written by someone my age (16).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the best book about being a female in a male dominated profession. There are very few books about the female experience that are so well researched and written. This is a great book for women who are thinking about being doctors or lawyers or teachers. I would have given it 5 stars if I could!   It's a well written story about a woman who gets into a career as a doctor because she is a woman and also because it is the only profession for women. It's not a "best of the year" or "must read" book, but it is an easy read, I recommend this book to women who like science fiction and want a good book to read about being female in male dominated professions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's boring. The author doesn't know what she's doing. The plot is boring. It's like watching an episode of a TV show that doesn't even make sense. If the main character was in a movie with a good plot it would have been much better. It could have been better if the characters had more development and the story had more character development. But it's a good book. If you want something to read that you don't care about but still get a good laugh then read this book. The story and characters are what I call 'gimmicky'. It's not original. It makes sense in a way but it doesn't feel like it. And it's funny! It's funny but not in a good way. The humor is a little too crude. It would have benefited from a little more thought put into the writing. I liked the concept. It was entertaining but the execution of the story was lackluster.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a man named Richard. He is a professor at a university. He has a wife and two children. He goes on a date with a girl named Laura. They end up going to a movie. They are both pretty drunk. He does the "I" word, but it's a pretty tame one, and I like it. It's pretty funny. After the movie, Richard goes home. When he gets home, he is surprised to see Laura at his door, and they have sex. It doesn't last long. They break up and they live happily ever after. Not the most interesting story I've read in a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The main character is so boring, it was like he was born with a heart of gold. If the characters had a better relationship, this would have been perfect.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   It was interesting to me to learn how the author came up with the idea of "the bad book" as a synonym for the most popular of the genres. In the book I mentioned above he uses "good books" as an example and talks about how they were always the "best" books to read. I think this idea of the "bad book" is a very important one in the field of "literature" and the authors that have used it so far have done a great job of communicating their ideas.  A negative review is an attempt to describe a book in a way that it is "not good." This kind of criticism, especially from the first person perspective, is often unfair.  (from the author's perspective) The book was boring. It was hard to follow. There were too many sentences that could have been condensed to fit the page. It lacked emotion. It's a shame that the author is trying to convince the world that he is a genius. , from the point of view of the narrator. I like that the book was hard and boring to read but that it was hard because it was so well written. I felt that the character's reactions were very good and I liked the way he described his life. I did not feel like the author was trying to make a point and that the story did not have enough drama. I thought that the narrative style of the book is too slow and it could have used more action. (from someone who doesn't read much fiction) The writing was very good. The pacing was perfect. It had a lot of emotion. The narration was well done. The characters felt very real. The plot was well thought out and believable. The ending was good and left me satisfied. I do think that the narrator could have made his point a little more clearly. (for someone who loves the literary genre) The narrative was really good but the characters felt a little flat. The main character didn't feel like a real person. The author seemed to be trying to explain himself as the narrator but it didn't work. There was no emotional connection with the characters. It seemed as if the author just wanted to say that he's a genius but not that he wrote a good book. (From someone who likes "literary" fiction) It was good. I liked it. I didn't enjoy it but I think it was very readable and enjoyable. The story was interesting. The world building was
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ The writing is poor. The story is horrible. The characters are unsympathetic. I found the story confusing and disjointed.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I was very disappointed in this book. It was not very good. I read it because of a suggestion in a book group and was hoping to be entertained by a good story. I was a bit disappointed. I didn't like the story very much. It seemed to be very long. I don't know how long it actually was but it seemed a little like a movie. The writing seemed very off. It reminded me of the "story-telling" of the books that I've read, but this one was a little different. I really didn't enjoy it. It's not bad, but it's not very memorable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book boring and repetitive and the characters boring. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of books by authors who write in a very traditional style. However, I'm not that familiar with his work and so was not as excited as I had hoped. It was pretty dry at times, the story was predictable, and there were a few problems in pacing. I think it was the pacing issues that caused me to be put off a bit, as it seemed like the author was trying to rush the story to get to the good part. I will definitely be keeping my eye out for his next work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book, but I felt that there were so many mistakes in this book that I would have to give it a 3 star rating. First of all, the story line was very good, I liked how it ended. There was one part where I thought the author might have used more than one person. I really wanted to know what happened to the missing child, but didn't get that much out of the book. I'm a bit disappointed that the character who was the bad guy had to be the baddie. I feel like he did not do that well, but still, I enjoyed the book a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I did not love this book. It's not a terrible book, but it's just not that good. It has a plot, and it's interesting, but the story doesn't work and the characters don't develop.The main character is pretty well developed. I like how he's a cop and he has a job, but he also has a crush on a cute girl and his job is to go after her. That's a very nice development and I really like that he does this to keep her safe. But he does not treat her well and the relationship doesn't go anywhere. But even though he doesn't treat her very well, she is pretty nice, so it's hard to get a negative out of this book, it's very good, but not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________. I had a hard time getting into this book, but I have to say that the story is very well done, with some really cool action scenes. The story is about a young man, Tom, who is raised in a rough neighborhood by a tough woman named Mary. Tom is a bit of a delinquent but is determined to live up to his family's legacy. The author writes the story in a very realistic manner. There is not a lot of gore or sex, but it is done in a believable way. There are also some characters that are very interesting. The only complaint I have is that there is very little in the way of romance in this book. The romance is a very minor plot line that takes a back seat to the story. I did enjoy reading this book because it is a well written and entertaining story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book has a lot of great ideas, but the story isn't there, and there is no story at all." "You want to see some action, and you get action. I'm glad to see there is a story, but not much." I think that's it. I really liked the story and it's one I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about the time before the war and before the Civil War. I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ The book is an interesting read. I enjoyed the story of the young boy who was raised in a military environment, but who had to flee to the suburbs. I think he was a bit of a failure at school because he did not learn to work, read, write, and socialize. I found the story interesting. I am looking forward to reading the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so boring I stopped reading the whole thing.  I read the first 5-6 pages but I had to get up and leave the house because I couldn't take any more.    I'm so disappointed, the plot and writing is just so boring.  I have to say this book made me sick.  The writing is horrible and there is nothing interesting to the story, it is so repetitive and stupid.    This book will just annoy me, I'm already reading the next book, and I'm sorry but this book was a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________I loved this book but the characters were all wrong and the writing was a total mess. I loved this author and loved her writing, but this book was the worst thing I've read this year. I mean, I'm a big fan of her writing and I loved her books but this was just horrible.I think this book has a very dark tone. The main character is a psychopath, and her sister is a murderer. It's kind of a sadistic story, but not in a good way. There's nothing funny about this book. The ending was kind of depressing too, I don't think I'm going to pick up anything by this author ever again.I'm sorry to see this book being so poorly reviewed, but I really liked this book and I just don't want to give this book a bad review because it was actually really good and I really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no idea what this book was about, except it seemed to be a mix between a fairy tale and a horror story. I have read some horror stories but this was very different. It was a very eerie feeling. The author doesn't say what the characters were afraid of, but they seemed very afraid. The only thing I found interesting was that the author had created a fantasy world which was almost like a parallel universe with some different creatures and people. The most interesting thing about this book were the scenes in the library. I guess I enjoyed the book more because I didn't know what it was about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for Christmas and I am very disappointed with it. I love all the books my brother and I read together. I thought this one would be just as good, but I was really let down. My favorite character, Mabel, was only one of the three main characters in the book. I feel that the others were so bland and unlikable. I would like to give this book a B- but for my money, this is not a book I would recommend to any one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, and I'm glad I didn't wait that long. The only thing that would have made this book better would be to include a bit more information on the characters and what their past's are like. Otherwise, it's just boring, as expected from a romance novel. I found it hard to connect with the characters, and it's really not like the author made any attempt at portraying a romantic relationship or what the characters had to go through to get together. It's like reading about a friend you know, but don't really know. The author is really just trying to have her fun, but it didn't come through in the story. There are some very interesting characters, but the story felt like it lacked substance. I really enjoyed the cover, but that's the only thing I liked about this book. It was a good read, but I found myself getting bored with it after about the first couple of chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to go back to the library and re-read this one twice to make sure I got the right one. I read it and I can't get over the fact that I never would have heard of the author, if not for this review.  If you don't mind the subject matter, this is a great story that's got lots of good characters.  My wife and I have been using this book as a bedtime story for the past two years and we love it!    I've been using it as a companion book to my other favorite story book - A Day At the Beach - for over 5 years now and it has been one of my favorite reads.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book is not worth it. It has an awesome premise: what if a man was a dog and his mother was a cat? Well that's not how it works, because in reality he's a human, and his parents are still alive. What's funny is that in the second chapter, the cat is in a lot of pain, and she's so depressed she doesn't even want to eat her food anymore. The story goes on and on like this, and the first half is very interesting, but then the author starts getting repetitive. He makes you feel so sorry for the cat that you just want to slap her and pull her ears, and that's a shame, because it's a very good story, but the author doesn't know how to make the story interesting, and it's boring as hell. He keeps repeating things over and over, so you can't get to know the characters, which are very annoying. So overall I would recommend the book, but you shouldn't read it if you want to feel sorry for a cat.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ A very well written book with a good amount of historical information. However, there are some factual errors and omissions, as well as a lack of historical context. I was interested in this book because it was one of the first books that was written about the American Civil War. The author does a great job in explaining what the war was like and what it was like to be in it. The book was well written and had a great deal of information. The only problem I have with the book is the lack of information about the Confederacy. I am not a historian so I am sure that the information would have been very helpful to me, but I was really looking forward to reading this book as a history buff. I ended up being disappointed because I think the author could have been a little more detailed with the information about what the Confederates really were. However the fact that he covered the history of the Confederacy and how the conflict began was very well done. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history or for anyone who wants to know more about the Civil War and the Confederate Army.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really loved the story but I was a bit disappointed in the characters. They were all different. I don't know why I loved them so much. The main character was my favorite, but I think the rest were also good. I was hoping for something more out of this book, but nothing too special. I do enjoy the book though. Overall:    I really enjoyed this book. I think it could have been a good story. The characters were very unique and interesting. The book had great action and plot twists. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who likes a good mystery.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was the first book I read by a female author. It was hard to get into and was pretty slow at the start. I was really looking forward to getting to the part where it turned into a romance and she had a boyfriend and stuff. But I ended up reading it after the first 3/4 of the book was over. The first two books I read were by men so I had a different perspective on things but the story was the same. It's still slow at first, but the last third is really good and the ending was perfect. The characters are all great and have different personalities. I'm a big fan of the author and it's a nice change of pace to read a book by a woman.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This book is very bad. I read this book after watching the movie. The book is like a sequel to the movie that's about the same guy. He is so over-the-top stupid and stupid to the point that he becomes a parody of himself. The movie is much better. If you are a fan of The Fast and the Furious then this is the book for you. If not, then just stick to the TV show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the story to be boring and slow. The story is about a young woman who was raised by wolves. She has learned to survive in the wild but finds herself lost when her pack is killed. She ends up in a village where she meets a wolf who will help her find her pack and try to find her lost loved ones. I don't like the way that the author uses the "wolf in the grass" as a metaphor for human's nature and their need to survive and adapt. The book was boring and very slow and did not have any plot development. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I felt that the plot was a little silly. I also felt that it was not a very interesting or well-written book, as there was very little mystery, and nothing really got to the point. There were only three main characters and one of them was the bad guy. The other characters were not very interesting, and not very likable. The writing was not very good. It was too fast-paced and had no depth or suspense. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Overall:  I would give this book a 2/5. I did enjoy the story, but not much else. The story was a bit too fast, and had nothing to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   1. It's not a good book.  2. It is very long.  and  3. It was hard to finish.    If you are looking for a quick, fun read, I would not recommend this book. The story is not particularly original and the writing is not of a high quality. The book is about a boy who can see ghosts, who has been plagued by an evil demon, who can only communicate with his pet monkey and who has a ghost-like girlfriend. I can only imagine how frustrating it is to read a book this long.   I do have to commend the author for trying to create a fun story. She has succeeded, but in doing so she has completely ruined the quality of the book. It becomes repetitive. There are a lot of repetitions and if you like the characters, you will love the repetitions.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to get an original thought out of a book that has a plot like this, and that's a big problem. I'm not sure if the author is trying to create a new style of story or if he just didn't have any ideas of his own. I feel like there was something going on in the book that was just not working. If you want to read something that is a real work of fiction then this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I liked this book a lot. It was fun, easy, and the stories are well written. The problem is that it is also very boring and repetitive. I was bored out of my mind and just wanted to get to the next chapter, so I stopped. I really don't recommend this book to anyone. The characters are uninteresting and they never develop any real backstories, so you know very little about the characters themselves, and their world is so small and simple that the stories about it all just become little more about themselves and their own desires than about anything else. If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, you might like this. If not, you may want to avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********The characters were so unrealistic. I really didn't care for the main character and was more interested in the girl he was with. I don't think she had any character, at least not enough for me to care about her. The story is boring and it just went on and on, it didn't develop anything at all. The last half of the book had nothing to do with the first half. I couldn't get into it and I couldn.t believe that there was another book out. This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I'm a sucker for books about vampires, but this is one bad vampire book.   Rating: **1/2 - I'd give it 1 star if it was free, but I have to pay $6.99 to get it.  The book is available on Amazon, but it's hard to find.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and was excited to hear that the second book was going to be released. It turns out that the sequel was really mediocre and I think the series is over. I enjoyed the first book but that was the only good thing about it. This book is nothing but boring and boring and even more boring is the fact that I was never really satisfied with what the author was trying to accomplish. I think that the author is still too young to write a book like this and that this series is probably finished.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not going to pretend I have read every book by Michael Chabon. He has an excellent style, a unique and original voice and an overall good idea about the modern American experience. I like his use of technology to tell the story of the 21st century (he was born in 1985, so I am not a millennial, but he has a good idea of what the internet was like back then). His narrator, Mr. Pint, is a middle-aged man in a hurry to be with his son, whom he has not seen in 20 years, who is now the father of a baby girl. His friend, Mr. Sartre, is the older, slightly eccentric guy who is not really sure what to do with his life after he is in his 60s. He can't seem to shake the idea that he is no longer the person he used to be, and as he is trying to figure this out, he starts to make more and more mistakes that bring him down. I love the fact that Mr. SartRe spends a lot of time talking about his past mistakes. He seems to think that this is the only way he can understand how to deal with the problems he has, and this book is a good way to illustrate this point. Mr. Chabonne is also able to do the same with his characters. Mr Pint is a very nice and likable guy who I could see myself liking, and Mr. Sprechenbacher is a bit of a genius who is really trying to understand the modern world, but is struggling to make sense of it. I am glad that the story was not about one man's problems, but about the many different problems that are all around us and that many people have to deal.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a poor excuse for a book, as a whole. It is really bad. It really needs to be taken down from the Amazon site. The story is very poorly written and the main character is a complete failure as a person. He is an idiot who makes bad decisions from the get go, with no redeeming qualities. He also has no interest in his girlfriend at all. The only time he shows any emotion is when he is making out with his best friend, who is a total douchebag. The ending is really anticlimactic, and the author just uses the stupid ending to give the reader a "happy ending." It is just not worth the money, and I will not be buying it again. I wish I had never read it!   "Him, I think, will have a better career in a time of great wealth, for he is a good worker and a good house-holder, and if he ever decides to marry, he will have many children to support."   Oh my god! Is that a compliment? He's married?! Is that an insult? It's so ridiculous! I just read a book about a boy who had to sell his virginity for money. That's not even an excuse for marriage! This book is like a parody of romance, with a bad ending that has nothing to do with the story. I don't think I'll be buying any more of this series, but I would never read anything by a guy named Paul.   The only thing that makes it worth reading is the romance.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have been reading this book for about a month now and it is so boring. The author seems to be an expert on this subject and her writing is good. The only problem is that the story seems to drag on for pages and pages because the plot is so thin. It seems to go on and on about something she knows nothing about. I can't understand how this book made it past the editing stage. I also wish there was a little more action and excitement. I have read other books about this subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I'm really glad I listened to this book, because I have been trying to get into the world of horror fiction for years. The story is great and it took me right into the heart of what makes horror fiction scary and also what makes it hard to put down. I can't wait for the next book! --Karen F., The Black Rock Desert, NV I really liked this book and I recommend it to all who love horror stories! --Jennifer R., Phoenix, AZ I love it. I've been reading horror for years and never knew what to expect, but this one is my new favorite. --Jessica S., Chicago, IL This is my first ever horror novel and I really enjoyed it. It was a bit slow at first, but it's well worth the wait. I think it will be a regular on my bookshelf for a while. I'm so glad I gave this a try. --Kristin M., Minneapolis, MN
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've always loved this series. It's one of the best science fiction novels I've ever read. The world building is well done, the characters are well drawn, and the story is very good. The problem is that the writing is awful. The writing is so bad that I don't even know where to begin. It reads like it was written by a five year old. The characters are all so poorly written that they have no character. They are one dimensional. They have no personalities, no interests. I have no idea why the author chose them for this story. They could have easily made them into zombies or aliens or whatever they were supposed to be. I really didn't enjoy this book. It was awful.  What did you like best about this story?  The story was very good and the characters were very well drawn. The story was interesting and it had a lot of interesting ideas. There were a lot more things I liked about this book than I did about the other books in the series. . -Maggie  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* I thought it was a great book about the great man, but not a great story. The whole book was very long and very boring. It didn't really have a beginning, middle, and end. I don't think the author thought it would be a good book and wanted to get her feet wet with a good idea, so she kept writing it until she got it. The story was boring and repetitive. I have never read a book so bad that I thought the author had no talent. The author seems to be trying too hard to be a writer and I don`t think it shows in the book.  I don`n think the book was written by a woman because the author's voice was a little annoying. She kept changing her tone throughout the book to get a different kind of book. It was almost like she was trying to make her story about Hitler look like something else. I think she should have stopped writing and just made a real novel. If you want a book about Hitler, go read one about the pope. ...  It is the greatest book of all time, but I thought that was the point. She had written a book to show her talent and it worked. However, she should've waited a year or two to write a book that would have been a little more successful. This book was not the great work she had in mind. , June 8, 2009
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ "A good book on the subject of being a mother, but the author misses a very important point: you can't raise a baby without a mother."  Review: The Best of Our Love by Susan Meehan. (2006, William Morrow, ISBN 978-0-393-11809-6)   "The Best of our Love is a book that is a very personal, very human account of what it's like to have a baby. There is nothing glamorous about this book, and it doesn't shy away from the difficult and sometimes terrifying aspects of parenting. Meehans writes about her experience as a mother and her relationship with her partner. Her writing is calm, easy to read, and compassionate. If you have a child, you will find this book very informative." --J.K. Rowling  "I can't believe it's taken me this long to read this book. It's a good read. It has a great heart and an honest and powerful perspective on parenting. There's a lot to love about the author's story, and I wish I'd read this as a kid." --Nancy S. from New York, NY  ______________________________  About the Author:  Susan Meehs is a professor of sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a research associate with the Social Science Research Network. She is the author of numerous books, including the best-selling The Mothering Book: A Love Story, published by the University Press of Mississippi in 2003. She lives in Chicago with her husband, who is an architect, and their daughter, who lives in Brooklyn, NY.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is a joke. It is filled with bad jokes. There is a good amount of humor in the book, but the joke is the author's and not the humor. It was a good idea to have a character who has a mental illness and has to deal with people who don't get it. The problem is that the author didn't take his own advice. He tries to make his story into a funny one and the result is something like a bad joke. This is my first negative review and it will be the last.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped that the second book in this series would be better. It certainly was, but I think that it was more because I had read the first book and was expecting the second one to be a bit better. The plot is very different. The story is told from the point of view of a former rebel named Zayne, a member of the resistance group that is trying to destroy the war machine of the Empire. The rebellion is going against the government that the Empire has created. The rebels are not as successful as they'd hoped, but that is to be expected, and they are not able to get their message across as easily as they would like. The book is written well and there are a few very memorable scenes in the beginning and middle parts of the book. I think I will be reading the third book in the series.  Rating: 3.75/5 1. The Fall of Zayne Carrick, Part 1: Zayne's life was always about trying to find out the truth about what happened to him and why. His journey into the rebellion, and how he was taken into custody, was one of the main plot lines in the first two books of the series, and was definitely the one that caught me off guard the most. It felt like I was reading a different book altogether from the first time through. He did not seem like a typical character, and there were times when I thought I was going to be in a very different story. I was surprised at how well the story was told, and the main characters, Carrick and his fellow rebels, were very well written. It wasn't just about Carrick; it was about his team. I enjoyed all the characters in the book, but Zayne was the one I really enjoyed reading about. 2. The Return of Zayn Carrick: Zayn was the leader of the rebel team. He is a member who the others looked up to, and he is the one who took Carrick in after he was captured. Zayne is also the one we are introduced to in the third and final book of the trilogy. He was the reason I started reading this series in the second place. The fact that the books are told in a series was a bit of a shock. 3. The Trial of Zain: This was the most exciting and thought provoking part of the whole book. Carrick was accused of being a traitor, and sentenced to death. He went through a trial,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was great until it turned into a mess. I found the author's style to be very pretentious and a bit awkward and the characters were not very interesting.  I found the story to be great until...  This book is the worst I've ever read. There is nothing good about it at all. I felt the author was trying too hard to be a good writer, which is a mistake, but I can't say I really care about the story. It's a story about an ex-fiancee who wants to get back together with her ex, who is a good person but who she still loves very much. It was a great idea and a great first novel. The story doesn't make sense. I mean, there are so many things that just don't make any sense at all in this book. The book is very long, so the beginning is really slow, but the end is a mess with the character's behavior, their motivations, their choices, and everything about them. I don't want to talk about it, because it's just a waste of time. I read this book and it was the worst book I've read in a long time. There's nothing good to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book ever written. This book was so bad it made me wonder if the authors knew it was bad or was just trying to get attention.  The writing is awful.  It's so bad that you feel like you're reading a terrible blog post written by an incompetent writer.  There's also a whole subplot about an author who is desperate to write a novel because he has a novel in mind.  He takes an old book and makes it worse by trying to make it more interesting by adding details that don't fit with the story.  When it comes down to it, the only thing that works about this book is that it was written by a person who has absolutely no clue what she's doing.  If you're a new author, read a book before you try your hand at writing.  This book is terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   When I first saw this book, I had high hopes. I have always wanted to read about a woman who took over a kingdom and turned it into a very modern, very modern type of country. I was excited by the idea.   However, when I finished the book, the book became a nightmare. I would recommend that if you want to read this book that you not only read it, but also take the time to research the people that lived in this time.   (In the book's introduction, the author says that "there was a lot of speculation about the people who lived in the area" in this book.)   There are many errors in the book. This is not the only time that a mistake was made in this type of book. I had a hard time understanding how a female would be able to take over a nation.   the first time I read this I was surprised to see that the queen wasn't a warrior, she was a nurse.  :sounds like she should be a soldier instead of a nurse :sounds good, but it's a little odd :sounded like she was just like a soldier :sound like she shouldn't have had a warrior's power :sounding like the queen should have been a warrior instead of an old lady :suspected she'd take over the world because she was beautiful :sucks :sideshows :she didn't look like a warrior like she's supposed to look :she could have been king like other queens did :she should have just been an old queen like other old queens did   If you want a modern, historical country that had a queen that could rule the country as a warrior queen, read this one. I really hope the author can get a job in the history department and get a better job at it than he did. I'd like to know how he got that title.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all in the plot and the character. The characters are not developed at all. They're all cardboard cutouts with no personality. The plot is very poor and the book reads like a first draft. The main character (the main antagonist) is only the beginning of the problem. The other characters have little development or development at all, the whole thing is extremely confusing and there are no interesting characters or themes. This is an excellent first book by a very promising author. It may seem like a good idea to publish a first book as a stand-alone but this one is much better and a great book to start the series with. Read it if you like dark fantasy, good characters and a good plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I am a long time book lover and I love books by well known authors, however, I was so disappointed in this book. I found this book to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I would not recommend this book if you like fantasy.   This book was really boring. I really wanted to know more about the characters and their lives but I couldn't really relate to any of the main characters. They were just flat.   (hide spoiler)   I found it very boring and a bore to read. This book is about a world where magic is a thing. I'm not too sure about the fantasy part but the world building is very weak. I also found it extremely hard to get into this book because I wasn't really interested in the story. I didn't care about the main character's life or what they do in the world. I just wanted to hear them talk. I felt like I wanted to read more but I just couldn't.  - I'm a long-time book lover. I read a lot of books but this is my least favorite book.I found this to be very boring.I really wanted a better story about the world and what is going on in the city.I would not read this book for a short book. The author had a great plot and I was hooked but the book just didn't flow the way it should have. I thought this book would be a good short read because I would like to read about characters that I love but I was really disappointed with this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read several of the old classics, so I knew what I was getting into with this one. But the main problem with this book was that it was poorly written. I found the first third of the book to be tedious, with a bunch of pointless, pointless scenes. The characters were boring, and I could not stand any of them. The last third was the best part of the whole book, but the ending sucked. Not that the story was bad, but I just could not get into the whole thing.   The story was interesting enough, but it seemed like a poor attempt to adapt a classic work into modern day. I understand that it is a fantasy story, but that is no excuse for the horrible writing and poor characterization.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been wanting to read this book for a long time, and I'm glad I finally did. I liked the premise, but the story and characters were just not very compelling for me.   The book is set in a dystopian near future where, as a result of an asteroid impact, the entire Earth is covered with a layer of hardened, corrosive, poison gas. The Earth's surface is a poisoned wasteland, and the majority of the human population have perished from the effects of the gas.   the Earth is a closed system, and people are kept in cages, or buried alive. The world is controlled by a small group of people known as the "Hazards", who have set up a "bunker" where the Earth's population can be protected.  .The Hazards have a number of rules that they try to enforce on the people living in their bunker. One of these rules is that you cannot leave the bunker for any reason. The "Hazard" leader has a secret that he is keeping from the Hazards, and he is trying to prevent that secret from being revealed to the people.   in order to do this, he is attempting to use his influence with the Hazard leaders to keep the world from dying out entirely. He believes that the world's population will not be able to survive if they all die off at once.  :   In the beginning of the book, there is an explosion that occurs in the bunker, and several people die from the gas gas that was used to seal the airtight, metal-like barriers around the Earth. After the explosion, the Hazord leader has an idea.   to use the remaining gas to seal off the outside of the Earth, and then to leave the Earth as a "giant corpse". He hopes that the Earth will be so poisoned that the people of the world will be unable to survive the harsh elements of the environment.  In the book's last chapters, there are two people in the world. One person is a Hazord who has been in the Earth for a few decades, and has a very good knowledge of the Hazords and how they work. The other person is another person who has never been to the Earth before, but has been sent to Earth to collect the necessary data for a project.   of course, the person who is being sent to the surface of the planet, and is being kept in the very small room, is completely unaware that they are
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in one sitting (a day before I had to give birth) and it took me forever to finish it. There were parts that made me laugh (as in, laugh-out-loud funny) and parts that I really wanted to know what happened next. But overall, this was a book that I would recommend to a friend who is just starting a journey of her own, or for anyone looking for a book to fill in the blank after reading the Harry Potter series. I'd say this is a good starting point for anyone who is a Harry Potter fan who wants to learn more about what happens to the people who love the boy who lived.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are a fan of the first few Star Trek films, and if you haven't seen the new one, then the new movie won't interest you, as it is very much a different kind of Star Trek. If you like Star Trek as it was, then you will like this movie, but I doubt that it is as good as the original. If I had to choose a good Star Trek film, then it would be the original series. If a new film can improve on that, then I'm glad it exists. If it doesn't, then there are other films that can be made that will satisfy the Trek fan.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ (you know the one). It's hard to say that this book isn't bad because it isn't all that great. It's just a book about what the future holds. The book has a lot of promise, but doesn't deliver. I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't love it. I'd recommend it for fans of sci-fi, but it doesn't really stand out as a good sci-fier.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a man who falls in love with a woman who is also a woman. They have the same physical attributes. They look exactly the same. The man has no interest in being with her but her mother is pressuring him to get a divorce from her. They live in a small town where most people are anti-LGBT and the main character is the first openly gay man in town. The book is an accurate portrayal of a small, homophobic community. I found this book to be a little hard to read. I was interested in the main male character and I could tell that he was falling for this woman. It was hard to keep from reading this book in a bookstore because of the negative reviews. However, the negative reviewers are wrong about this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in the store as a pre-order, but I couldn't get past the first chapter and never got around to reading the whole thing. The premise of the book is great, but the book just goes nowhere. The author really needs to stop being such a writer, and start writing actual fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a fair chance because it sounded so good. The first half of the book is the first time I've read the book. I was expecting a boring story about a girl who has to deal with a boy who can't do math. I thought maybe the book was about a boy whose father died. The second half of this book, I found to be the most boring book I have ever read. I know this is the opinion of a reader who hasn't read the entire book but it's hard to enjoy a book when you're so bored.   In the beginning of the story, the girl is a girl and she is a boy, but they're not together. The boy's father is a scientist who is experimenting on a plant, and the boy doesn't want to live with a scientist. So the boy's mother tells the boy to do the experiments with his father because the boy has to be strong for his father. The girl is told that the boy is going to do these experiments and she will die and that she has to die with him. This girl has to do what her father tells her to do, but it turns out that she doesn't really want to. When the girl asks her father why he's forcing her to go through with this experiment, he tells her that she is his daughter and he loves her and that it's the only way he can understand her. The problem with this book is that the girl doesn't know that she's not her father's daughter, she thinks she is. This book doesn't help the girl's feelings because it's very hard to feel sympathy for a person who is constantly forced to do things because they are the only thing they can understand. The main thing I learned from this book was that I shouldn't expect too much from my female characters. They're all very strong, smart, and talented but they just have to follow the rules and do what their man tells them. It's like a parent forcing their kid to do chores, they have to do it because their parent has told them to, even though it's a pain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought I liked this book a lot when I first read it, but the writing just got worse as the book went on, and I didn't think the author would ever get better. The only positive thing I can say is that I did enjoy the book as a whole, although the plot and the world building were a bit of a bore.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* This is a very enjoyable book but the ending just felt unfinished. It seemed like it was just getting started but didn't really get there. I also found that some of the characters didn't have much of a depth to them which was sad.   There is nothing wrong with this book and the author does a good job of telling a good story. It just felt like it didn't get there and then just kind of left it at that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry to say that my book was a complete disaster. The plot is a very poorly developed mess, the characters are cardboard, the writing is terrible, and the characters don't do anything in the book except talk.  There is no emotional or psychological depth, only boring, stereotypical "femme fatale" type of stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I purchased this book as a gift for my mother. I did not expect much, but I thought it would be a good addition to the collection of books I have accumulated over the years. I am pleased to say that it is a poor value for money. The author makes a great deal out of the "mature" nature of the book and the fact that it was written in the early days of the republic. But this is a novel, and it's hard to get much out of it. The writing is poor, the plot is poor and the plot twists and turns are all too frequent. The book is filled with plot holes and inconsistencies that detract from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are too many plot holes to list, but here are a few:1) The author does not tell the reader how many years it takes for the Civil War to start. He says the war started in 1861, but he only tells the reader that it started in 1862. This is not possible because the Union forces were not organized until the following year.2) The writer tells the story of the American Civil War as if the conflict was an all out war. He tells us that the Union had over 12,000,000 soldiers, but then later in the book he says that the Confederate Army had less than 500,000 men.3) The book says that "the South's armies were made up of 'hordes of men in blue.'" But the author never tells us how many troops were actually in each army, so how did the author know that the Confederates had more than 12,001,000 troops, when the Union army was only a mere 6,000-7,000 strong?4) The Union forces are depicted as having superior weaponry and armor. But then later on in the story the Union armies are described as being outgunned and outmanned.5) There is no mention of the many people who died in the Civil war, or who were wounded in the conflict.6) The war ended with no peace treaty being signed.7) The conflict has been depicted as a battle between good and evil, but the author fails to tell us that in fact it was not a war between good or evil, it was a war of greed and power, between the wealthy and the poor.8) The Civil War ended without a definitive victor, but instead ended in a draw.9) The American Civil war was a horrible experience that will
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a good book and I was very happy with it.  The characters were well-developed and the plot was intriguing. _________________________________________________________ Rating:  I read this book in a day.    I got this book from my library.  I like books with a plot and characters that are interesting and the story line is interesting.  The characters were interesting, the story was interesting and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to any one who is looking for a good read.  Rating Reviewed by  Diana in Florida I've only been reading for about 3 years but have a hard time not recommending this book.  In fact, if you are looking for something that has a little bit of everything and nothing of nothing, this is a good choice.  There are the usual elements to a paranormal or fantasy novel but there are a few things I particularly like about it.   One is the way that it doesn't just throw everything at the reader.  This book focuses on the characters and what makes them tick, and it does it in a way that isn't too preachy or overbearing.  It's very believable and the pacing is very good.  As well as that, the characters have some depth.  All the characters are well-rounded and each have their own quirks.  And finally, the author uses a mix of action, mystery, suspense and romance.  Some of the romance is very well done.  But what really made me like this book was the action.  After reading this book, I found that I had to pick it up every month or so because I couldn't put it down.  While the characters aren't perfect, they aren't unlikable either.  For me, that's what makes this a good story.  Thank you, Stephen King. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________   This book is bad, and it's bad because it's just not well written. I have read a lot of books, but I never had to read a book like this. The premise is interesting: a man goes to find his son, who has been kidnapped by a family of vampires. The vampires kill the man's family, and the man is forced to hunt them down to save his son. The problem is that there is no stakes; it's all a chase. The chase is not exciting, nor is it scary, nor does it make the book any better.   I think the book is really well-written because it is so easy to read, and I think the author did a great job of capturing the tension and excitement of the story. However, I do feel like the book should have been a lot longer, and this book would have been much better if it had been longer.   the pacing of the book was good. The book does take a long time to get going, but it does get moving pretty quickly. I am a big fan of this author, and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys vampire fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I'm a big fan of this author and her books. She's just a very talented and fun writer who does her research well. I just wish I hadn't read it as a child. It was very disappointing to find this book is just as bad as everyone said it was. It is a very boring book with nothing interesting happening in it, or at least that I could find. The characters are all stereotypical (like the little boy, the old man and the old woman) but it's really not the fault of the author, as the story itself is very shallow. There's not even a hint of a love story (well not a hint, but it was not enough to be believable). The story is about a boy named George, and his grandmother, who were living in a poor and run down house. One day, a woman arrives and asks to stay with them. George gets very excited when he sees her. He runs out and gets her to give him a hug. After the hug, he gets even more excited and runs back to the house. He then finds out that he can talk to animals. He tries to talk to a cow, but he just laughs and says "I'm afraid I can't talk to that cow, because I don't like cows." The cow doesn't like George either, and says, "I am afraid you are not a real cow." George is very upset by this and runs into the woods. When he gets back, his grandmother tells him to get out, as she has found a new house to live in. He goes back out into the field and finds the house, but the woman who has been staying there is gone. The next day, George sees a new woman who tells him she is a "big, beautiful horse". She tells George she can give him rides and help him with chores. The book then ends, but I was left with a really bad feeling. I can understand the author's desire to write a happy ending to her story, but to me, it didn't seem like the author did her research.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   This is the first book that i have read on this site. I did read a lot of books before i went into this one. But this book was just bad, not even good. I really wanted to like it but the ending was so bad. The way it ended was just stupid. I think if i was going to read a book it would be a re-read of the first 2 books.   One thing that is kind of sad is that there are many good books on here, like the second book by this author. Maybe it is just because i was reading a lot at the time but the books on this book really sucked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back in the early 2000s and it was a great book but unfortunately it fell flat. I remember thinking it was very well written and I was intrigued and would have loved to read more about it. This book was the reason why I stopped reading many fantasy books. I really liked it, but the writing style wasn't as good as the first book, and the story itself just wasn't all that compelling. This is a shame because the writing is excellent in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a number of bad books by this author and have found them to be poor, and often unreadable. I have the feeling that this book is the latter case. This book, as other reviewers have noted, is not a first novel, but rather a collection of novellas which is in some ways a good thing. I like a book that is easy to read and does not take a long time to read. But it doesn't have much to say. It does not give me a sense of what the characters are going through and what is going to happen next. The main character, Jack, is the narrator, and he gives a good synopsis of the book but there is very little character development. He has no idea who he is, what he wants, what is important to him and how he feels. This is a common problem with many first novel by a first time writer. I also found the characters to be flat. The narrator seems to want to be liked, but he doesn't act like it, and it makes me wonder if this is the main problem. If you are a first reader, I'd advise you to give this book a miss, but if you're a second reader, this may be a good book to read for the sheer enjoyment of the writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not read any of these books and can not make up my mind on them.  In the case of the first book I would not say I hated it but I did not care for it at all.  The main character is a high school girl who has to deal with a bunch of bullies that make her feel horrible.  The bullying is in the name of religion.  It seems like the bullying comes from some religion that is in opposition to her beliefs.  In a way it is a good book but it feels a little too preachy and the main character feels a bit like a victim of bullying.  As for the characters in the book, they are all really annoying and it seems like every time there is a fight between two characters the other one is on the losing side.  I wish I could say that the main characters were the most interesting part of the book but that is not the case at all.  I gave it 3.5 stars but it was so hard to decide if I liked this book or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would give this book a B- I loved the first one and this one is good as well, however, it is hard for me to review this book because it is very similar to the first. The story is very simple and straightforward. The main character, R.D. is an aspiring writer who is trying to get published. His best friend is a beautiful but very lazy girl, and his boss is a bitch. They all hate each other, but the main character wants to write a novel to prove to his boss that he is not a bitch and not a bad writer. It's a simple story but very well written and the ending was a bit disappointing. I'm not really sure how the book will end, but I'm guessing the main characters will be friends forever? I'm just hoping that R.A. gets a boyfriend or something! I really hope that I don't end up hating this book! 3 of 5 people found this review helpful

The first was that the narrator did a really bad job. She had a hard time saying her name and sounding human, and the dialogue in the book was terrible. Also, there was a lot of plot holes, which are explained in the second book, so I don't see why it was necessary to explain it all in this one. She also does a bad job with her descriptions of the people in the story, and it really detracts from the book. If you like fantasy and/or steampunk, I would recommend this book to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book.  It's basically just the story of the two guys on the road. Â Â They had been trying to sell an ancient map to the king of a place called Nueva York and were going to use the map to get back home.    The story was good.    Â I liked how they got to the map and how they ended up in Nuevo York.  I think this book will appeal to people who enjoy mysteries.  One thing I liked about this book was that it had a mystery feel to it.  The characters were interesting and the book had some really interesting twists.  I think people will enjoy this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book expecting to be entertained but it was nothing more than a poorly written and incoherent mess of a story that has no interest whatsoever. The plot is poorly told and has a horrible author voice. The characters are just one dimensional, and their actions and personalities are so bad that I couldn't believe they were even in the same story. I am going to assume that if I was in a situation like this I would do exactly the same thing. I'm not sure why this was published, since it is such a bad piece of work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought it was a little too on the nose. I don't know how else to say it. This book didn't seem to have a lot going on. I didn't care for it and I think the main character was a bit too flat. If you're looking for a story with action and adventure, look somewhere else. I guess it's good that it's in the works but this book doesn't do much to impress me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I read this book a few weeks ago. I am so sorry that I got into the book thinking it was a good story and a good read. It wasn't. The plot is bad, the characters are weak, the plot is boring and the characters don't get along with each other. We never got to know any of the characters, or even find out what the author's name was. The characters were boring, and I never found any of them interesting or relatable. I have been searching for a good novel about the Civil War and this is not it. The story is interesting but the characters were just a waste of time and money. It didn't have any of what I look for in a good book, so I am giving it a zero star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________This book is a total disappointment! The writing style is atrocious and the story is really weak. I found it very hard to take the characters seriously at times, because they just don't seem to have any character of their own. I have always been fascinated by vampires, but I don't know why anyone would want to read a book about them. I am sure I am not the only one.   I would like to see a sequel to this book! I will probably not read another one of his books because I really don't like this one!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is terrible and not worth the time. It's a bad example of a story told by a "book" and not by a true story. I thought the book was about a little girl who was a witch but she is not a good witch and she was never in the stories. There were some bad things in this book and if you read the book you'll know about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was a bit too much about sex and relationships. I thought that the main characters were way too immature. I didn't find the characters that interesting or believable. I would have liked more sex scenes and more character development.   So, what did I like about this book?   It had a good story, some characters that were not what I would call perfect, but still had a reason to be there and a way to get to know them better. I liked how the characters got more complicated over time, not as simple as a couple just having sex and having a good time. It also showed that people can fall in love and be with people they don't really like, even though they don´t feel the same way about them.    The ending was a nice touch. I don't think it was as shocking as it could have been but it still made me happy, and I liked that it wasn't a sad ending. I like to see that kind of happy ending in a book.          
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I've read some pretty good books. This one is really just an example of the average and uninspired writing in a book."  -Samantha A.  I don't know who this author is, but I'm a big fan of his first novel, The Book Thief, which I picked up at the library after reading a review by a fellow reviewer who was impressed by the book.   The Story:   This is a fairly standard YA story with a bit of fantasy thrown in for good measure.   (Aka: the author didn't really have a plan for the plot. He just threw in everything he had in his mind and had his character's life intersect with the world of the book.)   I think I like how the book has a very real sense of place and the characters that live in that area.   a lot of the setting is very believable and well done. The main character is a teenager that goes to the city to go on a date with his crush and is caught up in the mystery that is a group of people that are disappearing and what is causing it. I love the idea that people in the city are scared of the dark and their lives are being controlled by people who are trying to control the city. The characters feel real and have depth.     Some of the characters are a bit stereotypical. I didn't like the guy who is really into killing things. I thought he should have been an orphan that had a very hard life and had to work his way through school to find a job.  , but the rest of the cast are well written and well developed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment. I thought the book would be about a "war between the stars." But it was about a war between two different worlds, not just a war. The book is set in the future, which is a bit confusing as well. The future is ruled by a galactic council, who have all the power. They have a planet to rule over and all the planets are given their own "stars."   The characters in the book were so weak that I wanted to kill them off.   I was so bored with the book. I did not like this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a very tedious experience. The story seemed like a poorly thought out parody of science fiction with an obvious agenda. The science was often incorrect and the characters were often dull and stupid. It also seemed like there was no real plot and the author just tossed all the characters together and had them do their thing. There was a lot of repetition. I couldn't finish this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping for a more engaging novel about a high schooler who is bullied. What I got was a novel about bullying in high school. It was good. I did not expect to be engaged by the story, but I was.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I have read and heard so many things about this book, and I've heard so much about this author, that I was a bit skeptical. I read a lot of horror, and this was not my cup of tea. But I gave it a shot and I have to say that I don't think I could put it down. It's very, very good! It's really creepy, but I really loved it. I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in horror.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a very good introduction to the field of "transformation" but it is a tad too short to be of any practical use, and the chapter on the "transition" in the early church was very disappointing. This chapter should have been about the "structure" of the early Church, and not about the process of "totally transforming" the early Christians. The book is well written, but a little too short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's very boring. It's all just a lot of boring, predictable stuff, from the same people, same settings. And it's just kind of bad in general. The main character is not a very interesting character. The writing is all over the place. There are a lot less than I expected. There's just too many characters. It seems that they just didn't know how to write a story. It felt a bit disjointed and unfocused. I felt like the author did not care for his main characters. The ending felt a little bit rushed. I wasn't really surprised, but I was disappointed that it didn't feel like a real story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I don't know what I expected from this book. I expected to get a good look at what it was like to live in China during the Cultural Revolution. What I got was just a collection of stories from a small village in China where the people still have a sense of their Chinese heritage. They have many Chinese influences in their culture, and the main character, a boy, is an expert on it, but the book didn't go far enough to show the hardships he went through or the great changes he went though. The author did not give a good description of the culture and the people. The main character is very uneducated and it was really hard to relate to him because he was so distant. Also, there was no explanation about why the girl was so unhappy. I'm sorry to say that I gave it a 1 star instead of 5 because it was not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- **The only book I read for a long time. I tried to read a different book from the first. ** ***** It was a good idea to create a fantasy setting that doesn't look like medieval. The story and characters were enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful, the worst book I've ever read.  It was horrible and boring, it took away from the book's good parts and made it really bland.  I hate to say this, but the book is way too long to be enjoyable, the story is really rushed and not very interesting, the characters are very dull, I was bored throughout the whole book, it really was not a good book.   5/5 stars, i have read and reviewed a lot of books over the years, so I really didn't expect that book to be this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " This book is a complete disappointment. The prose is bad. There is no sense of character development. This book makes no sense. I will never buy a book from the authors again. I have to look for other books by the same authors, or read something else."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and the book is confusing. It is a very difficult book to read and to comprehend. The writing is very poor. The book is just not interesting to read. I would recommend this book to people who like the classic horror novels and books with paranormal elements.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I've been looking for a book for ages - not because I was unhappy with the previous books, but because the first was so good and the last book so boring...so, I figured, why not try this one?   Unfortunately, the story was awful. And not because the characters were all idiots. The characters were annoying. The narrator (the girl) was just as annoying as the characters. There were no memorable lines to speak of. And, I'm not sure how the plot even started, other than the main character has to go back in time to the 1800s to save her husband's life. I understand she has to do it, but that's a ridiculous excuse to go into a time period where people died of scurvy. Then there's the whole time traveling thing - which was really annoying because it took up half of the book.   This book also has a huge amount of religious symbolism. I'm guessing this was meant to make the reader think about the Bible, but, it was so obvious that it was a cheap way to write a book. It made the book look like the Christian version of The Godfather. And when the characters died - I really wanted to punch the author. They didn't even die like I thought they would die - I was just disappointed.   of the time traveling - it was just bad. The author did a good job of making the time travel seem plausible. However, it took away any suspense and made it feel like a dumbed down version of Back to the Future.   and the ending - I wasn't so sure it was the right ending. It didn't make any sense. But, it did give me a lot of hope that the next book will be better. I will be buying the next one, and it might just be a good book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A very sad and pointless story. It is as if the author is attempting to make a point by throwing in a few extra bits of drama in the last 20 pages but I just couldn't care less because I've already read the book. The ending made me want to throw the book on the floor."   The first thing I noticed when I picked up this book was that it was not very good. I read it because I heard that it had a pretty good ending and I wanted to see what it would be like if the ending were more dramatic. As I was reading it I realized that this book has a lot of potential but the story is not interesting enough for me to want to keep reading.   I think that this story could have been better if it was set in a different time and place. I think that in the 20th century the author could have made the story more interesting if he used a different character. In the end he is just another rich kid trying to get into the college. His story doesn't have enough to it.  's book is told from the perspective of the main character who was in high school in the early 90's. He was pretty much the only good guy in the school. He has a great job at a major corporation. His only problem was that he was so popular that girls wanted to date him and he couldn't get any girls to date. Then he got a bad case of acne and that lead to his acne being treated at a spa. His life was a nightmare for him. His parents were so worried about him that they didn't pay him enough attention so he went out to do stuff on his own. One night he decided to go to a nightclub with his best friend. They went to the club, got drunk, had sex and they didn' t really feel anything but then a girl showed up and he asked her out. After a few dates he realized that he really liked her and he started going out with her. He thought she was really pretty and after about a year and a half of dating they got married.  - I read a lot about this book. I loved that it took place in the 90's so I can see how the author was trying to make it feel like a teen book. That is what he did, but the writing isn't very good at all. I also think that the book could have had a different ending if the book was set later. It didn't have to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a good book, but it is not as good as it could be. It is very well written, and there are many different facets to the story. However, it is slow and repetitive, and the ending is unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad that I have an older brother who is very interested in reading. He started reading this book and thought it was terrible and didn't want to read the rest. He was also unhappy about the fact that there was no sex in this book, but that is his opinion. If you don't mind the sex:  This book is very different than what the blurb said. I'm not a huge fan of the characters but it's a good read if you're a fan of historical fiction. 6.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************** I had to read this book for school but the only reason I did was because it was a re-read. The author, a woman who I don't remember seeing on TV or in books, had me hooked in the first 10 pages. The rest of the book had me rolling on the floor, crying my eyes out, but I didn't want to read about that in the middle of my homework. My teacher loved this book, but not because it changed her life, but because she liked how the book challenged the teacher to read with more interest and interest in herself. I think that's a good thing. The book is a good read for anyone interested in the social side of the church. I'm a member and still am, and I really liked the book, even though I didn`t find myself laughing at many things. I`m looking forward to reading the next book by this author. I would love to read the rest of her books! ***************************  By: The Great Mother's House
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was really looking forward to this one. I've read some of the other books in the "Vampire" series and have really enjoyed them. I didn't really have high hopes for this one though. The premise sounded interesting, but it was not something that I had been looking forward too. I am not going to lie, I'm a fan of vampires in literature and TV. The books were good, but I just wasn't sure if this was going to be another "fantastic" book. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the end of this one!   The book begins with a bit of exposition about vampires. I felt that this was something that could have been done better. We are told that they were once humans, that they evolved into vampires and that they are the only vampires left. We get to meet a few vampires and it is very interesting to see how they have changed and become different. We see some of their more bizarre habits as well as their ability to do some of things they would never do on earth. The characters are very interesting. I liked some of them and some of my favorite ones were the vampires that are kind, caring, caring parents and that we can relate to. I was surprised at how well the main protagonist and the main character's mother did in the book. I can't say that I really liked the other vampires though.   I did not like the ending though. We were told at the beginning of the book that the book would end with the main vampire's death and we get to read the first chapter. It was very abrupt and I did not feel like that was the best way to end a book.  , but that is a very minor issue. I enjoyed the book! I do recommend it to those who like vampire books and vampire fiction!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it is a bad story and is filled with some horrible dialog, it also is filled wiht the "drama" from a lot of characters (but mostly from the guy who is being played by a white woman) but the whole story seems to be about the man who is a "big fish in a little pond" that is the author's personality and the woman he is with. The ending seems to leave the main character just about to drown, which I think is not fair to the main man (though he is very well written).  The ending is a bit odd to me but the "happy ending" was a bit too perfect to me.  I can't give it a full star because of the awful ending but the main story is just ok.  It is a good read though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written that it is painful to read. The writing is atrocious, and the author makes no effort to make his story interesting. He is constantly trying to make the reader hate a character, and it just doesn't work. This is the kind of book you might read to learn about the history of a certain region of the world, and I don't think it's worth your time. This book is a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not even sure I'm a fan of books that make you feel depressed about the world and try to make you think that there is a better way of life. But this is so bad, I really have to wonder why the publisher thought this book was a good idea for a YA market.   In the book, one of the main characters, Ben, is bullied at school. Ben's friends and peers have decided that the way to solve the problem is to give him an anonymous drug that is supposed to make him happy. However, after he uses it, he becomes a monster. The main character, Ben is a character who is bullied, but he has a friend who loves him unconditionally and gives him a chance. Ben, despite being an angry and angry person, is still a great friend to his friend. The book does not really tell us how Ben got his drug or why the drug works. What is clear, however, is that Ben does not believe that he is being bullied, and that he has become a monster for it. This is the point of the book. It is obvious that Ben is going to try and get his friend out of the situation he is in by taking his drug. This book is a horror story, which is the main plot point. The rest of the story is told by Ben's friend who is also trying to get Ben out of his situation.   The book is not a great story. The story of the friends trying to rescue their friend is pretty weak. It doesn't make me feel for Ben. There are no clear good or bad guys. It just makes you feel bad for the main character who, despite the abuse he is taking, is a great guy. The problem is, the main focus of the plot is about Ben, and his drug, rather than his friends.  : I'm not a fan when a book tries to make a reader think about other options than the one they are given. In this book, Ben was a monster, and we were supposed to think he had a drug that was going to make it all okay. However the drug never did make him better. The drug made him a monster and made him go out and hurt people, and make friends who were also monsters. The author had a chance to show how Ben became a monster by showing his actions, but she chose not to. The point of this book is Ben's struggle, and the reader is not shown how he got
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was trying to learn Japanese. It wasn't until I finished reading this book and felt like I just wasted my money. The only thing that makes the book enjoyable is the cute, quirky character that is introduced early on and continues throughout the story. It's a great story but the author really needs to focus on the characters. I didn't find any of them interesting enough. I would like to see more stories about children in the past and how they came to be in the present day. Also, I would have liked to see a more detailed description of the different cultures and religions.  4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been reading this book for over a year now and it is still not as good as the first one I read. It's like I'm reading the second book of a series that's been out for a while now, the first book is good, but this one is even worse.   The author is clearly not the best at writing, because it's not clear what is happening in the story, it's just a series of random events. I just wish there was a story to go with it, but there is no reason why I should not be reading it for my birthday!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________   The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm not sure I really understand the title of the book. It is about a guy that gets a little too excited and begins to believe he is God, then he gets angry at a group of people who want him to repent and stop doing what he has done.   I'm not even sure I understand the concept of god being the creator of the universe. Maybe he did, but there is no evidence for that in the Bible. The Bible talks about the creation of the heavens and the earth. The fact that they were made by God and they didn't need to be designed by man is just a strange concept to me.   to sum it up I don't really understand how someone could believe he's god.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to read for the fun of it. But when I got it I felt so confused by what I was reading. I mean it's a very old book. The writing is very dated, the book is filled with the most cliche characters, and the story is extremely poorly written. It's not like the author is trying to be innovative or anything. Just try and enjoy the story as a young adult book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** (5/10) ************************* (6/10)"I have to admit that the book's ending was a bit weak. It felt a bit like a cliffhanger or a series of vignettes that didn't quite end in a satisfying way. The book was more about the characters' growth and growth in relationships than it was about a resolution to the story, and I was left with a bit of a feeling of unease. I think this was a missed opportunity for the author. In addition, I felt that there was a lack of character development in the book, which, I admit, wasn't that surprising given the fact that I had read the book from the beginning. There was a little bit of romance between the characters, but the romantic feelings were somewhat generic and the sex scenes were not nearly as satisfying as I would have liked. So, overall, the book was a pretty good one, but I just felt a little let down by the ending. The only saving grace of the book (besides the fact it was written by a woman, and not by a male author) was that it ended on a very satisfying note.  Rating: ***** (out of 5)  Advertisements
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a really good book, and the book was good enough to sell millions. However, the book has a lot of issues with it. For example, the first chapter is about how a young man learns to be a woman and she is so fucking great at it.  This is very interesting, and is something I really liked. However in the second chapter he discovers he can only do it by changing his name to a female one.  It's also interesting to note that in the third chapter the narrator discovers his new name is a woman, because she's a man.  This was just too much.   Also the narrator is a young boy, so it's a bit off-putting that he can't grow out of it and he doesn't even know it. The final problem I have with the book is that it makes no sense. The narrator is so good at the whole changing into a woman thing, and then he can just change back into a man thing.  What the fuck.  That's why you don't do that shit.  If you want to be your old self, don't make a new body just because you've grown. That's a sign of mental illness.  And I can understand changing into something you don 't like because it's what you are, but to make it something you like to be, that's bullshit.  To me it seems like the author just wrote this book to be controversial.  But I have no problems with this book because it was very entertaining and I think it was written with a good amount of care.  Overall this book is a really interesting read, and I recommend it to people who like books that are different, and to those who like stories about a different world, but don't want to go out of their way to change.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have the time to read this book, you should be able to read about 2-3 more books in the series.   It's good, but it's too short.     I like the way it was written. I can relate to the character, I like the setting. I would have liked to see more of what happened after the last book.  , but the story was so short, I just skipped past it. It was a short book, but I didn't want to get to the end.   in the end I just didn't find it that good of a book. If I had more time, I'd definitely read more of the series, but in the short time I had, it didn't interest me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time. I am a teacher, and I can honestly say I am embarrassed by this book. It was terrible! I had no interest in it at all.   I know the author is an experienced author who has written several books. This book has to be the worst.  ... I gave it 4 stars because I have a feeling I am the only person who will enjoy it.   at least the author gave you the name of the author and the date it was published.   (but the date is wrong - it was printed on the title page)
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- This book was terrible! The story is absolutely awful and is completely uninteresting. I'm sure the author was trying to get me to read his other books but this one was a huge let down. I've read several other reviews about how they found it enjoyable but this is not the case for me. The story of the people that were captured and how they are treated in captivity is very interesting but the story of how they were captured is terrible. I will definitely be returning to this author's other books and I hope he doesn't continue writing about the same things. I read a lot of paranormal books but I've never read a book that made me feel so bad for the captors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping for more. I really wanted to like this book. I've never really enjoyed a mystery novel, and so this one intrigued me. I have a bit of a problem with the writing in this book; it was very clunky. The characters felt so contrived and uninteresting. It was very much the "I am going to kill the guy who killed my sister, but I'm so afraid of what I'll find out if I do!" kind of book. My main issue with the characters was the fact that the author had to tell us about their past lives and personalities. It seems like there's a little bit of exposition in every paragraph of every chapter. It made the book very long, and there were a couple of times I was confused about what I was reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book before Christmas as a gift for my husband and I loved it! I can't get enough of the character development. The book has a great beginning, middle and end. I loved the ending. It had the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, suspense and just enough action to keep you on your toes. I think the only thing that disappointed me was the ending of the book. It was too long and had too much conflict. I know that there is more to the story, but I was just disappointed in the way it ended. If you love a mystery, a good book and love a great character then you should give this book a try! 5 stars for story. I just finished this book! I have been reading books about witchcraft since I was a kid. I don't believe I am the only one who loved this book. I have read it several times. It is just that this book was perfect. It just kept me on the edge of my seat! I thought it was the best of the mystery series that I have ever read. I really loved how they made this book very suspenseful and yet so fast paced. I can see it becoming a classic in the future. I was surprised to find out that I really liked this book so much that I wanted to read it again! 1 star for characters. I did not enjoy the characters. The main character is an old witch and has a hard time with the way she is treated by her daughter. She is still a witch, but is not treated well by her family. It made it very hard to root for her. The little girl that she has been raising is her own child and is not a witch. It makes it hard for her to see the difference between her and her mother. It also made me think that the book would be better with more action and less dialogue. I do love a good story. This book was not. 3 stars for setting. I liked how the characters were put in the house with the curse that is being lifted. It felt like it had been around for a long time. I love how it was like a movie that had just been released. The setting was interesting. It could be a movie about a house that had been cursed. It's like a horror movie that was just released. 1 stars for plot. The plot was so confusing that I felt like I was trying to figure out what was happening to the characters! I kept flipping pages

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was too preachy.  It's like a little old lady trying to teach the children.  She talks about how a woman should dress and how to look sexy.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt like I was being lectured about how to dress and who to be.    The author spends a lot of time talking about how the clothes a woman wears are important because they can make a woman feel good or bad.  But she then goes on to talk about how some women don't dress in a way that shows their personality or their love for their husband.  In my opinion this book should be a book for the man to read and talk to his wife about what clothes to wear.  If the wife can't dress like the man she's with it is probably because she's not happy with him or doesn't understand the marriage.  What she needs to do is try to get over it and look good and be happy in her own skin.  So if your wife doesn't want to wear the same clothes as you then you should just walk away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book.  This book is a sequel to a book I loved a few years ago, but never read.  This book takes place a few months after the events of the first book. The first book is set in the year 2162, and we meet an AI named T.A.L.I.A., the first human-like machine.   The story begins when a computer program called a 'S' enters the world of the 'B' computer and the humans, called the 'W' and the 'H' (humanity), as they prepare to take the fight to the machines.  The S is a female android, built to be the ultimate warrior.  She is sent on a mission to destroy the W's and the H's, but finds that it is more difficult than she expected.  In the second book, I really enjoyed the book. I don't think there are any spoilers for the first one, so I won't say much.  I would say that it had a lot more plot twists than the first, and some really interesting characters to keep you on your toes. I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ was a complete disappointment. It was a good story, but not the book I thought it was. It had a great story, however, the author did a poor job of telling the story. There were things in this book that could have been cut. And it was just a bad story. The ending was a bit strange. It felt like the author wasn't happy with the ending. I think I might have just been too invested in the story to read anything else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I read this book and found it to be a boring, poorly written, and terribly written book. The main character, a female character, is so uninteresting that I couldn't care about anything she was doing. I would have liked to know more about her family, her life in the United States, and why she has decided to move to Canada. I found her character to be the most boring one I've ever read." "The main character is just too boring to be interesting." -I'm sure it's all true, but I thought this was an excellent book that was fun to read and very well written. -Not the most entertaining book I've read, but still a very good book. "I enjoyed it but I did not feel like I was really connected to the main character." So, is there any more to say? Is there any reason to pick this book up? I think this is an excellent choice to read for anyone who wants a good laugh, and a story with a twist at the end!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a very difficult book to read, especially with the very bad grammar and bad spelling. I found the characters to be extremely flat and one dimensional. The story has some great ideas but is completely lacking in substance. I can see why people like it but I think I would find it difficult to follow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It's a bad read, I had a terrible time with this book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit I was really interested in this book. I've been a big fan of the Dune universe since I read the original books. I was interested to see what would happen in the post-Dune universe and I think I found a book that really does it justice. I have to say I am surprised this was so poorly written. This book was full of inconsistencies and inconsistencies that really threw me off. It was like the writer was writing an episode of a TV show that was never actually filmed. This is a book where it is clear that it is being written for a different book, not for a prequel. I do not think that there will ever be a prequels to this book as it was too contrived.   My biggest complaint is that the author doesn't seem to really care about anything that happens in the book. She is clearly interested in showing a lot of Dune and her characters, but she has absolutely no real love for anything that happened in this story. There is one character that I really liked and he gets a lot more focus than I think he deserves. He was a very complex character who had a very interesting arc that I did enjoy seeing. I just wish he had more to him. The other characters are pretty much just one note villains.   the only good thing about this book is that it was really good at depicting Dune. The artwork is beautiful, the story is good, and the characters are really well drawn. I would definitely read this book again if the author decides to write another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________"   I gave this book two stars because it is not very good. I do not think it is a very good story. The character of the boy is pretty good but I am not sure about the boy and the girls. The way the girl gets raped in the second book is so graphic and over the top that it was disturbing to me. I am hoping this is a different book but I would not recommend this book to anyone.   5 stars because of the way the book ends: _____________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is really good and there is a lot of character development, but it has a lot more holes than it fills. The main character is really annoying, I have a hard time believing she is not a drug addict, she has no real problems or problems that the other characters have to deal with, it's a shame because the other main characters are really nice.  I really like the characters in this book, but the author didn't really get them down enough.  The book is pretty short, but is written very well and there's lots of humor and a lot to think about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is just a bad story.  I don't like to see characters like this.    This is a book about a boy who is very religious, but he has no friends, has no feelings for girls, and he has a bad childhood.  I can see why a guy like this would be drawn to these stories.  This guy is very sad and depressed.  The story of the boy is about him having no friends and not feeling the feelings of girls.  It makes no sense why he would feel the way he feels about girls.  I think it would have been better if the story had ended a little bit sooner and explained what was going on with the boy.  The way the story was written was a little confusing.  Overall I would say this is a pretty average book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************************   I really liked this book, but it's just really bad. It was not a bad read. I just didn't like the whole concept of it. The main character, Mr. Brown is so dumb. He just keeps making stupid mistakes. Like when he tries to fix the air conditioner that won't work. Then when he finds out that his friend, Ms. Kavala is not the girl he's looking for. He gets all flustered. So the girl is not a girl. Oh, Mr Brown, you're a good person. You're a really nice person. I'm just really disappointed in you.   The plot is pretty good. The two main characters, Mr & Ms Brown, have a falling out and they go to a party. The thing is that there is a girl that is there that Mr. Kavaalahala doesn't want to be seen with. So he goes around and tries to get her attention, even though he knows that she's not interested. The plot is not really all that bad. The author had a lot of fun writing it. I didn't find it all that entertaining. I was disappointed with it.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is terrible and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is a poorly written book and not worth reading. The author makes a number of claims in this book, but does not give examples or provide sources to back up his claims. It appears that he is attempting to present himself as a good writer but does a poor job of it. The fact that the author is a teacher is unfortunate, but there is nothing wrong with writing a book that you intend to read and then having a friend do the same. He should have written a book about a school, not a book on how to teach. There are too many things in this chapter that don't make sense. He claims that a child has a need for control and that a teacher's job is to create the "right" environment for the child. However, he doesn't provide a single example of a teacher controlling a child in this way. In fact, in this section he claims that teachers create a "right environment" by having the student sit quietly during the lesson and having the teacher speak loudly and often. He states that this is "what teachers should do". But this is not what teachers are supposed to do. A teacher is supposed to teach a student how to learn and the student is supposed be in control of the learning process. The teacher should not be controlling a student in this manner. There is an awful lot of information in this one chapter that the reader is never told that he or she is not supposed to know. I did not find the book interesting. There were too many details that were too confusing for me to follow. The only thing that the book has going for it is the author's self-proclaimed good writing skills. I would recommend that the teacher read this book before he or She starts writing a classroom textbook.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- * * * This book is a complete waste of your time. * * I am not surprised that a book with this title has been published. * The author claims he is a historian but is so bad that he doesn't even know the names of most of the major players in the early Soviet space program. * He also seems to have invented a bunch of things and left out things that didn't happen, such as a successful flight of a Soyuz. * If this was the only book you read about this subject, then by all means, by all rights you should skip it. * But, if you want to learn about this very important time period, you would be better off getting a better book. * --------------- I was intrigued to read about a history of Soviet space exploration, but as a historical layman I was unable to follow the story, and the author is an amateur at best.

It took me a while to get used to the different writing styles and how different characters would talk about each other and what they wanted. It was difficult to understand the plot but it still wasn't too difficult. "The characters are well-developed, the plot is intriguing and well-paced, the writing is smooth and the story is well-thought-out. I can't say enough about this book. It is a great read."

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I found this book boring. This book is an account of a couple of people's marriage that ended in divorce because of an affair that was carried out by the wife, who did not know she was being unfaithful. It's not so much that the wife was unfaithfull as she was unfriendly to her husband. Her husband's life was ruined because of his wife. The book was too long and it didn't give any reason why the husband and wife were unhappy. They just went their separate ways and married again. This is not a good book for a couple.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ The only thing I can say about this book is: the author, for whatever reason, doesn't seem to have a clue about how to write a decent story.   I can't tell you why this book bothered me so much, but I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you: I love the characters in this book. They are unique, well developed, and likeable. This is a fantasy world with dragons and magic, and the characters are very well written and do not fall into the trap of making you hate them because they are evil or something. I think that the author really knows how to present these characters, so if you like fantasy and fantasy based fantasy books, I think you would like this book a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I really enjoyed this book. I had read a couple of these that had been good, but nothing really stood out as much as this one. The characters were all interesting and well-developed, the setting was well-thought out and interesting, and the story was really fun to read. It's a bit too long to read in one sitting, but it's definitely worth a read if you have a few minutes to spare. I'm glad that it's been reprinted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit, the writing was very good, though I'm not sure that it was the best way to go about it.  This was the story of a woman who has to make the ultimate sacrifice to save her life.  I felt that I could connect to the main character because she was an intelligent and strong woman.  The characters in the story were also very well developed.   I enjoyed the book because the plot was good and it's good to read a good story.  What I learned:   It's hard to find a book that has the same feel as my first book, but I think that there are many things that can be taken from it to use in my next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I felt the author was out of her league when she tried to write a book about an ordinary, everyday, everyday woman. I just did not understand why she had to write about a guy with a beard, and then go and write a very short book about a woman who wore make-up." - Niamh McAleer "The main problem with the book is that it is a work of fiction, with a few facts about its fictional setting (like the fact that the author is from Wales) thrown in for good measure." - Book Lovers' Review "A very strong story, and the author really knows what she's talking about." - The Bookworm's Review "... the writing is very good... I enjoyed the book... it is not a very deep book but it is very interesting and fun to read." - bookloverreviews.blogspot.co.uk
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to read this book, but I was really disappointed.  This book is just a list of books that I had read, with no explanation of why I would be interested in the ones I had not read, or how they differed.  The reason I would like a book I have not read is because it seems like a great story.  I was looking forward to a book that has a character that I could connect with.  Unfortunately, I just felt like I was reading a list.     "I have written three books, and I have written the worst one.  It is not because the character is a dork; it is because she has no sense of humor.   She is so boring, it's not even funny." - A review by a fellow author.  ( http://www.foolingaroundwithbooks.com/2013/01/28/james-grahams-little-tiger-book-review-a-good-reader-of-books.html )   I had a similar experience when I first read the story of the Little Tiger.  Even though the story is very funny, I still found myself reading the same story over and over again, hoping to find something new.  When I got to the part about the "bad" book, I was surprised.  In this case, the book is not the reason why the characters are dorks, it is the fact that the characters do not have a sense of humour, as well as not having a sense for what it means to be funny.  In addition, it has an unbelievable plot, with ridiculous characters and nonsensical situations.  While this book is fun to read, it doesn't really work as a story, as it lacks character development.  Overall:   If you like funny books and/or movies, then this is a good book to read.  If you don't like jokes, and/ or if you just don't have the time to read a book, then I would suggest avoiding this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************** I did not enjoy this book very much. It took me two reads to get to the point of the book, because there was so much back story to get across, and the book is so long that the first few chapters could have been skipped. This is a long book, but it would be better as a series, and with a better ending. It starts off very good with the protagonist's life, then turns into a mess, then back to good again, and then back into a good again. The plot was predictable and predictable at the same time, and this was made worse by the lack of plot twists. The book ended, like a bad TV series, by telling us that the bad guy was killed by a good guy, and that we should be happy because the bad guys were killed. So, what's the point in reading this book? This book has no point, it is just another retelling of a story, and a very long retelling. The characters in this book were boring and the writing is bad, the story was predictable, and I have no interest in reading more of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I didn't know what to think when I opened this. The first thing that came to mind was that it was hard to put down." -A.T.   My Rating: _________________  My wife and I love a good zombie story. This is no exception. It's an exciting, action-packed story that has you on the edge of your seat. There are a lot of zombies, so you'll need to put on a lot more than a casual pair of gloves to survive. It starts out slow and steady and you'll be ready for a few fights. There is a great villain, but his motivations are a little unclear and his motivations don't seem to be all that well defined. I found myself wondering how much of this story was based on a true story, and if so, why was it not told as a true account? If I was a zombie, I'd probably be just as good as this author. I don't think I'd recommend this book to everyone, but if you like zombies, or like zombies who aren't too smart, or have a good villain, this is a fun read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of effort was put into this book and it was a very good effort but it fell short. The author tries to explain the mechanics of what makes a good story but it doesn't quite stick. The book does not have any characters that you care about. I have a hard time believing that a book about a girl with a bad case of autism would be any good.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  A good book:  I really liked this book. I liked the story. I enjoyed the characters. The characters were well developed. The author was a good writer. This book was well written. The story was interesting. The setting was well done. The plot was well executed. The ending was good. I found this book to be a good read.  But there are several things I really don't like about this book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The first chapter starts off promisingly enough. After a brief intro, the author begins to describe a man's attempt to kill his father, but this is a book for those who don't have a lot of patience for long stories and stories about the struggle between family and self-interest."   So there you have it. If you're looking for something to read in a hurry, this is it. It's a little short for me, so the first half is a bit of a slog.   The plot is decent and the characters are interesting. It seems that the author was influenced by a few historical novels he read as a child, so it has a lot in common with the great works of Jane Austen. It may not be an Austen-inspired book, but it has some of her characteristics.   the only thing I didn't like about the story is the ending. It comes out a bit too "happy". I know this is the point, but the ending just didn't feel like the author felt it was the right way to go. The book could have ended on a good note, but I felt it could have been a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good story, and I enjoyed it, but I can't get into the writing style. There's just not much going on in the writing.  You have the story of a man trying to find his way home, and it's good enough that I can suspend my disbelief.  The problem I have with this book is the writing is so stiff and hard to read that the characters are barely present.  The story doesn't flow, there's not enough happening to get excited about, the characters just aren't interesting.   I'm giving this book a 3 because it's still a good book but I'm disappointed with the writing of the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "If you're in the mood for a fun read, this is it. The book is really fun and entertaining. I like the premise, and I like that there are different levels of characters to follow. However, I don't think the book really takes off as a good read. I think the author overuses a lot of the same elements over and over again. I'm not saying the author isn't clever, but it seems to be a bit much."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- -------------------------- "The only thing that really bothered me about this book is the fact that this was written as an anthology. The stories are all written in a way that the author wants them to be told, but most of the time it felt like the author was reading a page of a book he wanted to have written himself and he just didn't have the time. There were so many things I liked about the book that I just want to read more from the author, but I think it will be a lot of work for him to do so."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book because of the reviews, but it was just a boring book. There were some good ideas, and some bad ideas. It's basically the story of a girl who goes to the country and gets lost, but never finds the girl she's looking for, and it's really not a good story, especially because the ending doesn't make any sense. I guess it could have been better if the book was a bit shorter, but that's the only negative thing I can say about this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a collection of short stories written by the author. The stories were well written and the author made them very short. I really enjoyed the short stories but the overall book was poorly written. I am not a fan of short fiction or short stories with no character development. The short stories were interesting but not memorable or worth my time. If you enjoy short stories that don't have a story to tell, this is the book for you. If this is your kind of book, you will not be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I were to tell you the one book that has made me realize that there is nothing more boring than reading a book, it would be this book. It's about a guy who, while visiting a friend in town, gets caught up in a murder case, and it's about the people who surround the case, the police, the prosecutor, the judge, and the whole trial thing. There's really nothing more to the story than that, and that's the worst part, as the author seems to be writing for a very specific audience. I think I read this book in high school, and although the book does have a lot of plot, it's still not very interesting or memorable. It is a bit of a cliché, in a way, with the "snowflake" main character. The other characters don't even seem to have much personality, which makes the book a bit difficult to read. The only good thing I can say about the book is that the narrator, who is pretty great, is a girl. This was a pretty big turnoff for me, as it's a very male oriented book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not the worst book I've ever read but it's the worst I've read for any genre.  The writing style is atrocious, the plot and characters are awful and the plot is a complete and utter joke.  The book's main plot line involves a group of people trying to stop a terrorist group from detonating a dirty bomb in the US.   The terrorist group is comprised of a group called the "The Club," an organization that is made up of people that have done wrong.  It is also made up entirely of psychopathic individuals that are willing to do anything to accomplish their goals.  One of the club members is a man named "John."  John is the leader of the group and has the ability to make people do things that they would normally not do.  John also has a "stache" (his nickname for the fact that he has one).  John wants to be the best at whatever he does and is willing to use whatever means he needs to get that.  However, John's plan involves his friend, a woman named Sarah, becoming the leader and John being made to take a drug that is supposed to make him a good leader.  When John takes the drug, he is able to command his team of people to do things in a way that they never normally would.  Unfortunately for John, it also makes him uncontrollably sad and that is when he falls in love with Sarah.  The entire book follows John's struggle to overcome his addiction and his attempts to overcome Sarah's personality.  In the end, John gets his life back and is able take care of his friends and family.  Sadly, this was the only good thing I could say about this book.  There was absolutely nothing good about it.  I also noticed that the "Club" had a huge amount of fan support and I didn't know any of them personally but I just didn't get how anyone could write a book like this.  If you're looking for a book that is full of plot holes and the main character doing things that he would normally never do, look no further than "The Dirty Bomb."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of the book is a really good one about the effects of the Holocaust on the Polish people, the Jews, and the Russian people. But in the last half of this book, the author attempts to make the story about a German Jew. I think it was probably the best book he ever wrote. It is really a very nice book and it should be read by everyone who wants to know more about the Jews and the Holocaust.  It is a bit long, but I don't think that will make any difference to anyone who reads this book.  This book should be compulsory reading for every child who wants a better understanding of the Jews.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit of a disappointment. This is a good book, but the book as a whole is not a good one. The character is the worst thing about this book. There are some really good ideas in the book, and some interesting things to learn about religion. However, the character is a little too much of a cliche for me. The author could have done something a little more interesting with him. The plot of the book is rather predictable. I had a feeling that the author would make this story a bit more interesting by changing things up. But, that didn't happen, so the book ended up being just that. It's a little disappointing because I really liked the ideas and some of the ideas about the history of Christianity. But for some reason the author decided to make him this stupid character. The only thing that is good about the book (aside from the ending) is the illustrations. It is a really nice art style.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not been able to put this book down, it has been a very good read so far.   However, I have two major problems with this book:   1) The "hanging" part of the book is a bit too contrived. I don't know how a story like this can be made so dramatic without actually hanging the characters off a cliff and then jumping off. I also thought it was a bit silly that she tried to show this in the first chapter, and then she immediately dropped it when she wanted to show it again in the last chapter. It felt like a waste of time and effort.  , I don`t think the book could have been written any better. It is an exciting story that moves quickly. The characters are great, and the plot is gripping and keeps you hooked. It has all the hallmarks of a great story, and yet it feels like it could have benefited from a few more twists and turns and a few fewer character deaths. This book was good, but I`m not sure it would have been as good as it is without the hanging. The book is great, but a bit long for a first book, especially for a young adult novel.I have read several books by the author, but this is by far my favorite so far! She wrote a fantastic story, she just needed a few extra twists and twists.The main character of the story is Anna, who is very young, and her brother. They are both very bright and have good parents. One day, when Anna is about eight, she is playing with her brother and he falls into a hole and they both die. Anna is then taken in by the mysterious Mr. K. He has promised to protect her from the world and keep her away from her brother, and she is going to do just that. But, she doesn`t realize that the world around her is a dangerous place, and that she has been chosen to be a vessel for the One. When she realizes her destiny, she has to decide what she wants to become, but she doesn't know where to start. I like that the author is making this story a mystery and not just a typical YA book, and I love the world she created.The book is divided into four parts:Anna has to make a decision, the one she has not yet realized, and is also very scared. I really liked how Anna tried to keep her feelings to herself,

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is good, but it has a very bad ending. The whole book was so boring and predictable that it was hard to enjoy. It was just so predictable that I started reading it to see how the author could write a good ending to the story. I was so annoyed with how bad it was. It took me a week to finish the book, and I couldn't finish it.  I don't know what the author had in mind when he wrote the book. I'm not even going to start the book to see what happens next. It's just a bad story that doesn't make sense.  I just finished the book: I read it and was so disappointed. The book was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to love the story, but I just didn't. I hate how the story was so predictable and boring.   I'm sorry for all the bad reviews about this book, but the story is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has a history of plagiarism. He even plagiarized a book he was a reviewer for, and that is really bad. The author even copied a book that was a best seller in the field and it was not only plagiarized but there was not a single word original in it.   He also plagiarized his book from another author's book, and he also plagiarizes from his own books. This makes me really mad.   The writing style of this book is very amateur and he seems to have a really bad memory and does not have a clue about the genre he writes in. There are a lot of typos, the author also writes some very long sentences, and this book seems to be a very difficult read to read.  , which was an actual best seller. This book is also not original, and is not very good at describing the subject matter.   in my opinion this book should have been reviewed under the title: "My Wife is a Whore" and not under the book title of "My Best Friend's Wife is an Abuser" because this book had a better plot, it was more interesting, it had a stronger plot, and it didn't have a plot that was just "I hate my wife and she is a whore"   This book is a horrible book that should have never been published.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ This book is a piece of shit. It is boring, predictable, and has a terrible premise. It has a couple of decent scenes but the whole book is just one long train wreck. I'm going to keep this book on my shelf because I already own many of the other books by this author and I'm looking forward to the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- 1.0 I had a good time, but I was bored a bit, and I would rather have read about a more interesting character, such as a vampire. If you are a fan of horror, this is a good book, but if you are not, then not. There are several different things going on in the book, and it makes you think. 1 star
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had this book as a free download but couldn't put it down. I love this kind of story with a good hero.  A real story with action and adventure, and a great romance!  The characters are interesting, the action is good, and the story is enjoyable.   2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________. The author did a very poor job of describing her story. The story is just about the main character (she was an abused girl in an abusive family). The main character had a brother who is not the victim in the book. She also had a sister who was abused in the same way but didn't do so badly as she did. I am not sure what the author is trying to say here. I think this is the first book I have read where the abuse did not go to the main characters. The abuse was going to their mother but they still did not do badly enough. The author made this more about her brother. There is one other book that had the same problem. It was more about the mother and her relationship with the husband. This book did not have that problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is just too unbelievable. The characters are just too unrealistic. The writing style is so awkward, it's hard to even get through the book.  I have never seen so many contradictions in a book so early in the series. There's one scene in the last chapter where the bad guy says he's "getting away with it", but he just escaped from a prison.  He was sentenced to death, so he escaped and then he just ran away.  I would never recommend this book.  This is one of those books that I wish I could read for the first time to find out what happened.  I didn't even realize the author had written the first book until I saw the first chapter.  The characters and story don't add up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book.  And I liked it.  The main problem with this book is that it has no plot or setting.   The story is told from the point of view of the main character,   and the plot is mostly told through dialogue.  The dialogue is pretty lame and repetitive, and even though the plot progresses quite well it's really a bit cliched.  I'm not a fan of books where the plot mostly revolves around one character's internal monologue.  One thing that did improve this book, however, was the use of the narrator, which made the book much more enjoyable to read.  It made the story more accessible to the general reader.   Overall:  I have a soft spot for fantasy.  This book has a very interesting premise and it was well written.  There is not a ton of plot to be found, but the plot does progress quite well and the character development is pretty good.  But, unfortunately, the ending is just a bit too predictable and doesn't really leave the reader satisfied.  Overall, I give this a 4.0 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  I like my books as little as possible. I think it's a shame to have a good book, then be put off by a bad one. I have read this book many times before, and had it as a gift from my friend and I still haven't gotten over the fact that this is the first time I have felt anything but disgusted. The story is not very good. I've read many books in the series, but none of them have been as horrible as this. I will never be able to read this series again. I was expecting a lot from this book, and I didn't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "My review: I was looking forward to this book and then I read it and was not so happy. It has been a while since I read a book that I did not like and I don't usually like a book in which I don�t like the protagonist or some of the things he does. I do enjoy the book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different, and that's all I can say."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and I felt the author failed to tell the story well. I don't know why he didn't write a story that had more impact and was more dramatic, but he didn's he didn' t. I would have liked to have seen more of a connection between the two main characters and their respective situations.   The plot was a bit dull and the author really didn't seem to want to write a plot that involved the two characters. This wasn't a major issue for me, but I really wish he had written something that made the reader think more about their situation. There is a lot going on in this book, but there is no real reason for the characters to be involved in it and this lack of development of the characters really got to me.   I wish the author had put more focus on the characters instead of the plot.   for the author's other books, check out:  The Man With the Plan - This book takes place in a small town, and I was really glad that it was small because I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It's about a man who has a plan to bring his brother back from the dead, but it's not that clear cut. There's some confusion with his plan and it doesn't seem as though he's really making a big difference. I felt like he was just being dragged along, not really taking charge of the situation and not being that clear about his intentions.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narrator's voice is so annoying. He does not read his words right, and so when the narrator says something he actually says out loud, he sounds so fake. I can understand the narrator was struggling to find a voice to match his personality, but if the narrator does not write his words well, how is it he is able to write this book so well? The book is a lot of fun. I hope the narrator can learn to write well in the future. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a mess. The writing was a nightmare. I couldn't even make sense of what I read. I have read many books by Ms. Lacy. I can't think of any of them that are as badly written as this. I'm very disappointed in this book. It should have been a no. I don't think that she will write another book. I am going to give her a 1 star rating because she is very good at what she does. I have read a lot of reviews and the ones that are positive are the ones with lots of positive comments about the story and how it was written. I was really excited about this book, but it ended up being a complete disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. I've always been a fan of Harry Potter and I've been looking forward to this book for a while. I found that the book wasn't very good. The main character was just an annoying dork, the author was over the top with his characters, the plot wasn't good, the writing was bad, the characters were boring, and the characters didn't change. I would not recommend this book to anyone. 5 stars for this review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was interesting, but the stories weren't particularly gripping.   It was hard to tell what was true and what was fictional, as there was no actual investigation to go on.   The book was well researched.  I found it interesting that the book was written by a woman who has a daughter who was diagnosed with autism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have a hard time putting this book down, don't bother. It is one of the most bizarre and disturbing books I have ever read. I don't even know what to say. It was very hard to read. It's an amazing story, but it's just very disturbing and strange. The book is called "The Great One" and it's about a man named Jack who gets an email from a woman in Italy. She says that he should come and live with her because she has the most beautiful body he has ever seen and she is a "superman" (she's described as having long blonde hair and a perfect body. I've seen photos of her and she looks amazing. Jack goes to Italy and meets this woman, who is apparently an "agent" for the mafia, and he takes the job. Jack says that the woman is a whore and he goes and sleeps with her and he has a great time. And he meets a girl who has the same body and he starts to fall in love with her. After they have sex a couple of times, they have an affair and they have three kids together. It all seems good on the surface, but then the next morning Jack gets a phone call from the woman who he's been with. The woman wants him to come to her house because her boyfriend is waiting for her at the airport. Jack finds out that he's not a superman. He is actually a woman. He has to choose between the two women. And if he doesn't choose, the mafia will kill him. I'm not sure if I've ever read a book that had so much sex in it. It gets really bizarre, but I couldn't stop reading it. The writing is great. I think the author did a great job of writing a good story, and the author could have done a better job at writing the sex. The author did an amazing job of describing sex, but the sex scenes were very, very slow paced. It made me wonder why the author had such slow paced sex scenes in a book called "Love and Lies" because the sex scene in this book is almost too fast paced. I was also worried about how it would affect the readers' sex lives. I mean, I have read some books about the dangers of love, but this is a whole new level of love. This is just not something you would ever want to read about, but if you are a sex freak and have a strong sex

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book because it's the first book by a woman on how to have a baby. I read the blurb, read the book and then read the reviews on Goodreads to see what people thought of it. I thought that this book is the wrong choice. Not only did the book get me through the first few months (a month with the first baby and the next month with my second baby), but the book was really good. It showed that it's not easy to have babies and that having a baby isn't a guaranteed way of a happy life. But that's not what this book taught me. The book showed that you should look at your lifestyle before having a child. I looked at my lifestyle before I had a child, and I found out that I wasn't living my best life. I felt bad about not being able to have my own home and my own money. I found myself thinking that having children was a burden on my life and my husband. I was looking at my marriage and I was realizing that the one thing I should be doing is finding a new partner, which I never really thought about before I became pregnant. It was a lot to think about but it was still a good read. I loved how the author talked about everything from having a healthy lifestyle, to getting out of debt, to not taking on debt, and she even talked about having a good work life balance. This book is good, but I think it's important to read all the books before you have a child to see if you want to have kids. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book on how not to have children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total waste of time. This book is really good at teaching you how to do an overhand grip on a bar. However, it doesn't explain how to grip the bar correctly. The author gives a lot of detail and explanations, but it all comes across as very dry and useless. I'm not sure if it's just a matter of me not being good at this type of thing, but I didn't get it. It is very repetitive, boring, and pointless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but if you're interested in grip strength and have some spare time on your hands, then it's worth the time. If you have any interest at all in grip training, I highly recommend that you skip this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say I did not enjoy this book. It's a good story, but the characters were not developed. There was no emotional attachment to the characters and I found myself bored with the story. I found the writing boring and had to stop several times. It was hard to read and felt like a "what have you done for me lately" book. I'm sure the author wrote the book in hopes of being a hit on Amazon. I really hope she did not take the same approach.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring to me. I found the concept interesting, but I just couldn't get into the story. I liked the characters, but it seemed like the author didn't know how to get across what she wanted to say. The book was also repetitive, I didn't think it made a difference how often the characters say the same thing. I have read many fantasy books and this is the first time I read one about magic. I think the main characters would have been more interesting if they were human, but then again, so would most of the main cast in most fantasy books. I like magic, but not in this book. I wish I would have known how to make the book better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I read a lot of bad books. This one, however, was really bad. I've read the other two (the first one was excellent, though), but I never really felt like I was able to relate to the characters. I mean, the plot was just so bad, I just didn't feel like I'd be able to follow along with the story. This book is just a complete waste of your time.   5 stars for the plot, I think. I would recommend it if you can't get through it, or if you don't like people who are mean to each other.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author did a good job with the plot, but the prose and style of writing made it difficult to understand. This is one of those books that is so easy to read, you could be doing it all day. The characters are interesting and the plot makes sense but it just doesn't have a lot of depth to it. There is a lot that is going on but the main character has so many side characters that don't get much screentime. This makes the book boring to read. I know there are a lot more great science fiction books out there, but this one just didn't do it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucks!  It's not that I don't like the book, but it's just a waste of time.  I would have given it a 4.5/5 if it was just a good book, not a book that took me over 2 hours to finish.  "The most dangerous time to be a woman is when you're young and beautiful." I don't know how many times I have read this sentence in the book.   The woman in the story doesn't seem to have any kind of experience with her life or anyone else's life other than herself.  She's pretty much in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the woods and trees.  And she's pretty sure that her husband is cheating on her.  When she's asked if she's sure he's not cheating on the way home from the bar, she responds with a pretty standard "No.  Why would he cheat on me?  He loves me!"  Then when her husband comes home and tries to explain to her that they've been together for 2 years, and he has a real job, and that she's his wife and he wants to spend time with her and their son, she's completely stumped.  What's wrong with her?  How can she be so sure that she knows so much about what's going on?  The book then moves on from that, and I didn't see her as anything other than a clueless and helpless girl, who's going to be screwed over by the guys in her life.  I guess that's the message.  The author then says that this book is "the story of a woman's journey from a young, naive and clueless girl to a powerful, confident woman who stands up to her husband and the world around her."  But in reality, the book is just a long, boring chapter on how to survive in a world of men who don't understand women.  It also has a lot of sex.  This isn't a book for the faint of heart.  Even the most optimistic of women can't read this book and not be depressed.  There's so much information, so many clichés and cliches.  At the end of the book she says that the book will help her to grow.  Then, in the next sentence, she says "but in all honesty, I don,t think it'll help me grow as a person."  Why didn
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book as a Christmas gift from my mother. It's supposed to be a romance but it's not. I don't think that's a bad thing because it is well written but it doesn't give me any hope. I like a lot of the characters and there is a romance going on but it feels rushed and there isn't enough development. It just feels like the author is trying to write a romance and I don 't think that's a good idea. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of time. It's an example of a writer writing for a niche market and not understanding the market. It is an exercise in writing a book on how to write a book. I think it's a waste and a waste to have a book that is basically a collection of lists with no purpose except to list lists. I don't have time to read a book like this unless I'm doing it for work. It was a waste for me to have spent time on it. It had a nice feel to it, but it didn't have anything special. The only thing that was interesting was that it had all the things I would find useful on google. There's a lot of bad information in the book too. For example, one of the examples is to get rid of the "pimp" and "panther" word. There is nothing wrong with the word "pimper", but "pamp" is a more polite word. I'm not sure how they came up with "pamper" as a term. Recommendation:    Not Recommended.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book! I am a new mom and I have a baby girl in a few months. This book was great for me because it was all about breastfeeding! I also love how it shows what the baby does while they are nursing. This is so important for all new mothers to know! My daughter is doing just fine but I am happy to have a book that shows her what she is doing! This book is a good read for anyone who is new to breastfeeding or breastfeeding mothers!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last page of this book is about a woman who thinks she's found the perfect woman for her husband. Then she discovers that this woman is a lesbian, and the woman she thought she loved is actually a lesbian.  What a waste of time. This book was poorly written.  It was tedious and boring, as if the author wanted to prove a point by having a lesbian woman in the lead role.  I don't know what to think about the writer of this.  How could this book be anything other than a waste?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful. The prose is just not there. I would never buy this book. The story is a complete waste of time. It's a horrible waste of money. I don't recommend this book to anybody. 2.5 Stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book. I loved the book by Rene Girard, and this one was a disappointment. It was just too long. I was hoping that it would be a short one-shot but that wasn't the case. The story is very well done, but there are a lot of scenes that took me out of the story. This is just one of those books that you don't really want to keep reading, but it did get a very high rating on Goodreads so I guess I have to give it a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________" I was really disappointed with this book. It seemed like I read it and I didn't like it. It was a really boring and uneventful book. I felt that the author was trying too hard to explain the various types of human sexuality, and while there was some good material, I found the entire book to be dull and boring.   My favorite part of the book was the discussion on the sexual politics of the time. I always find this fascinating, so I was a little disappointed with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I was a little wary about reading this, but it turned out to be a really, really good book. I had the opportunity to read this on my Kindle Fire, which is really nice for reading a book that I can keep in my pocket. I was expecting to read more about the characters and their struggles, but I wasn't too impressed. I don't know why they would spend the time to write a novel when they could just use the internet to write their stories, but at least the book was entertaining enough to keep me going through it. I found that this book was really easy to read, and the characters were well written. I just wish that I could have seen the book a little earlier to see how this could have turned out better. Overall, a great book!
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********I gave this book 2 stars because I'm not very familiar with the genre and didn't have any problems with it at all. I'm very disappointed in the writing and the characters. It's too bad because this is a book that I would've given 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that the author had to get in a lot of trouble for it. I would give a 4-star review, but I'm forced to give it a 2 because of the author's actions. It makes me want to get off of this book. It would be nice if the author would write more of a story about what happens to him. It doesn't help that the first book ends with the main character going back to jail and the next book is a series of "flash-forwards" about his life and what he was doing before he got in trouble. The story is too good to be that way. I found the story a bit weak and the character development a little weak, but the plot was interesting. The last 3 books were better. There are a lot more of the "flash forward" type of books that I wish to read. However, I have to say that I'll still read the rest of the series.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book, but it really sucked me in to the book and then just stopped. The characters were so likeable but I think they were so poorly written that it made the whole thing pointless. The plot and the writing in general were really good but I just really didn't feel invested in it. I was like "oh, so that's how she's gonna get out of this one" and then all the other things that she did didn't make much sense, and then it's like oh, yeah. She's gonna die, but she's got a magic sword that'll let her live. But I think it was more to do with the fact that it was written so poorly that I was just so bored with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________I was never a big fan of the Star Wars movies, but this book did something amazing: it brought me back to the movie! I liked the plot but was not too fond of the characters. I found the characters annoying and the plot was not as interesting as I thought it would be. I was so confused by how a simple and cheap plot that was really hard to follow, got me so into the book. I will definitely read it again but I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I can't wait to see the movie and read the book to get to know the characters!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************** I was not impressed with this book. The book is written in a way that you can feel the author's personal opinions and feelings about the topic in question, but it is not a way to inform the reader about what the subject is about. The main theme of the book is about how people will feel bad if they are not "right." It seems to be a very "conservative" approach to the subject, and while I would agree with some of the points made about the "right" people (I am in the liberal half of the spectrum), I find it to be rather naive. It is very easy to see that the right wing will not have this book published because they will see this as the book trying to demonize liberals, or at least, liberal people. While this book is not meant to be about liberalism, it has its place and I will definitely read another book about the subject. But I don't think this is one. ***
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a joke!  You read a lot of "how to" type books that have no information on what is happening to the book.  If you have a good understanding of how a book works, you would have to be a fool to buy this book. A book about a woman who is not allowed to leave the house:    I don't understand how a woman could be "allowed" to go outside the house?   Why does this woman have to have a servant?  How can she be a widow?  The book is written in a sarcastic way that makes you think that this book is really serious, but in the end it is not a good book. The book has very little information about the book and you have to think to yourself "Why did this author write this??"   The author does not give the correct information that you would get if you read the book from beginning to end.   You get the information that she is a widow from the beginning of the book but you have no idea why she is so angry about being a widow.  There is not enough information about how a widow must live. There are no other reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning I was really excited to read this book. I knew it was going to be a good one but after a few pages, I realized the author had done a poor job of capturing the story and was writing too much of a character.   The story is about a young woman who is in love with her boss at work. She's in a relationship with him and is really good at what she does, but she's a little bit in love. She wants to be with him but she has this fear that she can't handle the responsibilities that a relationship brings. She just wants to go home and sleep, but the fear that makes her so uncomfortable keeps her from letting him get to know her. She is afraid to let him go so she keeps on with the relationship and ends up in trouble with the boss, the boss's brother and the police because of it.   and the ending just left me so disappointed. I have to admit that the ending was not as happy as I wanted it to be. I would have liked for it to have been more of a happy ending because I really did feel like the character had more potential but it just didn't feel like she got what she wanted. I don't know if it's because the author doesn't know how to write a character well, but I felt like she was being a little too emotional and I'm just not a fan of that. I was so sad after I finished this book, and it just doesn't really fit with my favorite books of the past.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for a book club, and my friends and I laughed through it, and laughed out loud, and then it was over.   The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the narrator was the narrator's wife. The whole story was about her getting annoyed with him and he being angry at her. And the ending was just plain stupid.   in short, a good read for the book club!   8.5 stars  I think this book could have been better had the narrator been a man. I mean, I understand it's a book about a woman, but her husband being a man would have made it more of a real story. It was a little like the woman in the book is really married to her husband and has a kid, but really it's the husband who has to take care of the kid and is the only one who really knows her. I felt that it was the same story told differently. The story was ok, but the voice was a bit annoying and the ending kind of stupid.Overall, this is a good story about a couple getting back together. If the narrator had been a woman (which, by the way, I think this author could have done better with), this book would have been a 6 star book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ (I just want to start by saying that I am an avid reader. I'm usually a big fan of first person and historical fiction but this book, to me, didn't do it for me. I just didn't find it interesting or well written. The writing is a bit clumsy at times and there are some really poor characterizations. Also, I really had a hard time following the plot. I was just really confused as to how the book ended. I know that the book is only 80 pages long, but I just couldn't get a hold of the story or the characters. Overall, I wasn't a fan of this book.)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst.     I have heard many good things about this book but this book is just awful.    The book starts off strong but the author doesn't give the reader enough to think about.  The book starts out with a girl going through a breakup, her best friend leaving her, and then she gets the news that her mother is having a stroke.  In the first few pages, the author makes the readers want to cry but then, once the main character realizes that she's in over her head, she has nothing else to think but the worst possible thing.  I feel like the author didn't really care about the characters and the story they are telling.  She made the characters into objects to be looked at and it just made me want to hit the book so hard.  This is just a book about a girl in her thirties who doesn't know what to do in her life and her best friends have just left her.  And to make matters worse, her father is in the hospital and she can't do anything to help him.  The only reason the book is so bad is because the author never gives the reader anything to think or feel about the character other than she is stupid and sad and she doesn't care about anything but herself and her problems.  It's just so frustrating to read a book that is so shallow and uninteresting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure if the book is bad because of the cover (which is quite bad in my opinion) or if the cover is bad, but I'll probably never read another book by this author. The book is about a young woman who has a secret family who does strange things to her (such as have her watch her mother do sexual things with other men) and she's also secretly in love with her dad's friend. Her secret is discovered, and she is expelled from school. The father is a good man who does good things for his family, but the mother and her friends are all evil. The mother is a witch, the sister is a cannibal, and the brother is a monster. This is the first book I've ever read that made me want to get rid of my computer because the writing was so bad. If you're looking for a book that will give you a laugh, then look no further. This book may not be the best, but it is one of the funniest.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  The story was boring. It was like you could tell the author didn't care to write anything but a book about a group of people who are all rich. It's like the author just wanted to make a quick buck, but in the end, the characters are shallow and just make for a boring read.   It was just a collection of stories, but I had to stop it at three or four because I really wanted to know what happened next. The author is just too lazy to do anything with this series, it's just boring and dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible, and I bought it from amazon because I thought it was an important book for the genre. But I wasn't impressed. It was a very simple story with a lot of cliches and cliched characters. I can't say that it was interesting at all. I'm not sure why this book was even published, it was a big waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most terrible thing ever written.  You will be bored to tears by the time you're done with it.    The writing is awful and every chapter is full of the worst jokes ever.  If you hate the author, then this is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book so many times. The stories are very good, but it is a shame that there are so many errors in the writing. It is hard to understand the stories, and there is so much repetition. There are many typos, and some of the sentences are difficult to understand. This book is a very good book to learn about the history of the First World War, but there are too many mistakes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping for something different and thought this would be a good book to try. But it is not. This book is very dry and I have a hard time taking the story seriously. The characters seem like they were made to make a point and this is the only way it works. I did enjoy the ending but I do not understand why it was needed. I found myself wanting to see what happened to the characters after the story ended. Overall a bad read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the worst book I have ever read. The plot was predictable. The main characters were boring. The villains were a bit boring. There were no twists and turns at all. It was all too predictable. If you want a book that tells you how a great story starts, read this book. If not, don't waste your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about a young man and his girlfriend and the things that happen in their relationship. The book has a lot of funny moments and it was fun to read. The main character is quite an idiot at times but he doesn't take the situation too seriously. The characters are well-developed and the story is entertaining. The ending was a bit too fast and I was surprised.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book at all. The author is very opinionated and her ideas are a little over the top. I felt she was going over the same ground that I have written about before.   One thing I would like to say is that this book is an excellent book to use as a primer in how to use the Google search engine. The book has some good tips about the different Google features and how to best use them.   The only problem is the fact that the book is not formatted for a textbook. I don't know if that was a good decision or a bad one, but the book feels a little unprofessional.   is a very good book for beginners. I think that the author will have no trouble teaching most beginners to use Google.is very opinionating and her opinions are a bit over the line. I feel that she is going over a lot of ground that has already been covered before.One thing that I would not have liked is that the information she presented in the book was pretty general. It is more of a guide to using Google than a textbook style book.The book was well written, but I don' think it is a good introduction to Google.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, while entertaining, is a pretty sad read. The characters are a bit dull. There are no real villains. I do not want to be like that person. The plot is weak and the characters are too similar. I want to see more of this world. I hope they don't kill off all of the characters, but I'm not going to be a fan. The story was great.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- It was not a book I had high hopes for, it was not worth the price I paid. The story line had no real plot to it. The writing was bad and I was not interested in it. I found it very annoying. There were no memorable characters. It was just boring. It just dragged on and on. I had a hard time taking the book seriously. I just wish I had not paid so much for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book sucks.  The main character has a "cute" sister, but the sister is a spoiled, selfish, bitch who makes the boy's life a living hell.  The "cutesy" sister is really a horrible character, but her parents are also bad people and she is a little spoiled and selfish.  She gets in over her head in the middle of the book and then doesn't do anything to help the boy and then leaves him.  It's kind of like a "he's bad, she's good" kind of story, but this is one that is more "I hate her and I don't want to have to read anymore about her."  I don�t know if it's the author's fault or not, but I hate this book.   I am a little disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book, but there are no positives.  There are no good things about this book and nothing bad.  The main character is a bit of a jerk and it's a pretty one-sided relationship, but then again, she is also a horrible sister who doesn't help her brother in any way and just treats him like shit.  I'm not sure if the book is a good read because I don´t like the author or because the book sucks, but either way, this book is not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first few pages are all about a bunch of crazy guys who decide to go on a world tour. There is no story, just a bunch more crazy guys doing more crazy things.  This is a book about people doing stupid things, and if you were one of the people who read this book and thought it was awesome, you're an idiot.  You might be better off reading a book by Paul Feig, which is about a guy who is a little bit more sane. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book but it was too long for me to finish it in one sitting. There were so many scenes I could not get into it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I am going to review a book that I don't like as much as I thought I would and will say I don´t regret it."  A terrible book that will do more harm than good for people who don't have a strong sense of self-worth. It is filled with self-hatred.  You get to the end of the book and it is already obvious that this book is going to do nothing for the woman. The narrator does her best to convince the reader that she is not bad, that she isn't bad. She is strong, intelligent, hard working, smart, caring, funny, good-looking, strong, but she is selfish. Â She is selfish in her actions and in her thoughts.  The woman has her own problems with herself. She doesn't know her own mind, and she is very unhappy.   This book will do nothing but hurt her.  She wants a relationship with her husband and wants him to love her, but in the end she doesn't want to have a relationship.  It is hard to love someone who is so self-centered.  If you're going to write a self-help book, make sure you know what you are talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this one.  The synopsis says that this is a "prologue" and it sounds promising, but it is not.   It starts off with the character getting a new roommate.    She was a nice girl at first, but when she came in she looked at everything with a suspicious eye.  she would get up at all hours of the night to read her books, even when she was not in bed.  And when she finally slept she had nightmares about her ex-boyfriend.  Then she started getting her hair done.  She did not have a problem with the hair but the whole outfit was a total disaster.  I was really looking forward to the story and I had high expectations.  But this book was a complete failure.  It was boring.  The characters were not believable.  My heart sunk when I realized the story was about the boyfriend, not the main character.  Even the narrator (who has a very good voice for a child) said he had no idea what was going on.  He would not say that to my face but I could tell it was a joke.  What a waste of a book.  In the end I had to put it down after about 60 pages.  This book is only good for the short story collections.  If you want to read something that is more entertaining, read a novel like The Princess Bride or A Wrinkle in Time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- A poor attempt at a book about the effects of radiation on humans and their descendants.

There is a good reason for radiation, but not a good excuse for not discussing it in more detail.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just a waste of time. There was nothing in it to interest me or make me want to read more.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I loved this book, and it was the only book I picked up for myself this year. I didn't like it as much as I would have liked, but it was good enough that I didn�t want to give it up. It was a little boring to read. I don�t think there was a whole lot going on, but I enjoyed it. The characters were all believable, and they had good chemistry with each other.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I have been reading for years and am a fairly experienced bookworm. I am a fan of fantasy/sci-fi/westerns and have read most of the books in the series. The characters are very likeable and the plot is interesting. I liked the romance but I did not find it very exciting. There is some sexual innuendo, but I didn't find it to be as graphic as some other reviews state. Overall, this was a good read. I would recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I gave this book a 4 star rating because the story is entertaining and engaging. However, the characters were so stupid that I had to put it down after the third chapter because the stupidity got to me. The plot was a waste of time. The main character (the narrator) was annoying and the other characters were not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character, Rumpelstiltskin is a terrible writer. The author gives him the impression that he is a good writer, but the writer is an imbecile.  I don't think I've ever read anything by Rumple that made me want to read the book over and over again.    I have never read anything from him that made the hairs on my neck stand up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it was really fun until the last half of the book, and then the book just became annoying, and not interesting at all, except for the fact that it's just a bad plot and boring characters, but the characters are very well written and I was laughing the entire time. The ending was so stupid, but it was good at the beginning and the end. I got so bored by it, and I hate it because of how bad it was, and because of the fact I am so bored all the time, and how badly written it is. I just read it, I got it for free online, and it was so bad that I could not even get through it, it was like the last 2 chapters were written by someone else. I do not recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book 3 times already. I would like to say that this book has some good points: the fact that the main character is a girl (and she doesn't fall for any guy's shit like other characters do) is great, the fact the main characters are all different and interesting is also great. I have also read the book 4 times and it is still the same. The book's plot is interesting, the characters are interesting but they don't add anything to the plot. The main character, Kaitlyn is a bit annoying, her friends are annoying and there are a lot of annoying things that are happening in the book. I think the only thing that makes the book worth reading is that it has the character development of the main girl in this book. There is a main character that is annoying and annoying, then there is a character that isn't annoying but she is just there and she is also just there. It's like there is just no character development for the main guy and the girls are not interesting, so the main dude has to be the only interesting character in the entire book. Overall the book is not bad but I would have liked to have seen a better plot and characters because there is so many irritating things that happen.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------   It was my first read through this book and it really started off on a negative note for me. I was expecting a more "funny" story but found it to be pretty dry. It had no real characters that I felt I really connected with and it felt to me like a parody of a horror story. It was very dark, with a few laughs, but I can't say I was laughing at all.   I'm not sure if this book was intended to be a comedy or a horror. It definitely got the comedy and that is what it is about. I would've loved to have seen the characters interact and have some kind of relationship. It didn't feel like it had any life at all, which is a shame since this book really should have been a comedy.  , so I'm not really sure why I am giving this one a 3.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book did not live up to its hype. It is a very dry read with a very dull plot and a very poor writing style.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read about this book, I thought that it would be a good book. I didn't care much for the first book and I was really disappointed with the second one. I thought the characters were really well developed. The only problem I had with this book is that the characters are not believable. They all have their reasons to do what they do. The characters don't change their mind on the story after they have read it and then decide to keep on reading. There are also many characters that are not as well developed as the others.   I really enjoyed this book and would like to read more about the people that are in the book. It is a good read that is a little different from your average vampire book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I just finished the first book in the D'Andrai trilogy, and I couldn't stop reading. The characters are well written, and the prose is fast and exciting, but the book is a bit long, and it's kind of hard to keep track of what happens. The ending was not quite satisfying, and that is what I expected from a book about a young lady who gets abducted by aliens, but still had a hard time accepting that it was over. The next book is definitely worth reading, but if you've read the first one and it wasn't enough, you might want to start over."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________   I'm really not sure why I read this book, or why I gave it 4 stars, because I wasn't impressed by the book. I can't say that I was bored. The pacing was fine. I don't recall the last time that I read a book that had so much action and so little thought put into it. I do remember reading a book a couple years ago that had all the action and thought put in, but was not so well written that I couldn't imagine how someone could put it all together and make it work. I know that it is not a good book, but I had to give it a chance because I am on a bit of a book kick, and I'm going to try and read more this week, so I'm giving it a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting this book to be a fun ride and I was surprised to find it was dull, boring, and hard to get into.  There are lots of characters, and I loved the romance and the way the story turned out, but I just didn't love the writing. Â I found myself wishing there were more twists and turns in the story.  Read it if you like:   This is a nice, light-hearted romance, and it has some twists and twists to it, but it doesn't seem to be much of a plot.   The Bottom Line:  The Romance was okay, but not really that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a book that was "so good I can't believe they made it!"   This was not the case. The story was well told, but the characters were completely useless.  They didn't have a single meaningful interaction, and they were really uninteresting to begin with. Â The plot wasn't very original, either, but that's not a big deal since it's not the main focus of the story. ______________________________ This book was so confusing that I didn't know what to do with myself. ________________________________________________ I had to go through a couple of books before I realized what I had to do.   I was supposed to like this book, but I really didn't.  I would have rather spent the money on something that was better.  I think I will have to skip this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I have not yet read the sequel (that I ordered a month ago), but I am looking forward to reading it. I think this is a good, fun book, even though I do wish the author had used a little more effort in writing some of the characters. I also wish that the author was a little better at explaining how he/she developed the characters, as sometimes the author has some really hard-to-understand statements about the characters' motivations that he/ she just repeats ad nauseum. As it is, I think I enjoyed this one just as much as I did the first. I will probably be reading this series again, especially because of the wonderful, funny, and clever ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It is a very good story, however, it suffers from poor writing and poor characters. The ending is terrible and it really ruins the story. There is no need to be killing a woman for revenge, or to find out who is the real murderer. Just don't let it ruin the story for you. The last third of the book is the best part and it is very good, but the first third is just a bit boring and not that great. This is a book to be read and not to be reread. I am giving this book a 3 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm not sure if this book is a good book at all.  It's a quick read, so I didn't think it would be anything special.  There is a scene in the beginning where a character in a comic book tells the reader that he's not going to read this book because it's too bad and boring.  I've read a number of books that have a scene like this, where the author (or the creator) wants the reader to stop reading so that he can get on with writing.  It's a good thing, as it lets the author talk about something he is excited about and he can then work on making it better, instead of having it be a dull, repetitive experience.  The only problem I have with this is that it seems that the author is trying to do too much in a short amount of time.   The characters and story don't seem to be fleshed out as much as they should be.  In fact, I felt that they were all very shallow, with very little personality to them.  They are all just there to make the reader "feel something" for the hero and the reader.  There's nothing interesting about them. I did not find it interesting to read the story at all and didn't feel anything towards it.  To me, the story was too much about the hero.  When I think of a good story, I think about the protagonist who is trying so hard to change himself, yet he can't.  He's weak, he doesn't want to try new things, he just wants to be happy and is not even willing to look at a book for the first time. So in this book, the author tries to make a hero out of a character who was just a guy.  However, the reader never sees that the hero has a dark side, and even though he tries to keep it hidden from the reader, the darkness is still there.  This leads to the author feeling that the reader has to have the hero as a victim.  And yet the hero tries so hard not to let it show, but still, it does.  After this story was over, I was a little depressed because I really did not like this character, and the story just seemed like a slog.  Instead of writing a story that is interesting and interesting, the authors decided to have a hero who just wants
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I was looking for a good book on the topic of asexuality, but I'm very disappointed. I expected more. I read the first chapter about 10 pages in, and I thought it was a good beginning. The author is writing about a young girl who comes out as asexual. She has no interest in sex and does not feel attraction to people. I think that the author is doing a great job with this premise. Unfortunately, the book turns into an attack on all asexuals, including the asexual girl herself. This is a very bad start, and it leaves me very confused. The main reason why I did not like this book is that it is too focused on the aseptic. The asexual protagonist, who was clearly inspired by myself, is the main villain of the story. There is not enough time spent on the other characters. The book could have been a great read if it had been about any of the other people who have asexual experiences. I am a huge fan of sci-fi/fantasy and it was good that this book dealt with an alien setting. The setting itself is cool, and there were some great ideas. I just wanted to read more about the characters, and the author left me very unsatisfied.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the concept of the story and the characters. However, this story is completely and utterly unrealistic. The characters don't have anything resembling real emotions. I think they were written as a bunch of stereotypes (although there are some stereotypes in this book) so the book really doesn't have a point. It was an enjoyable read though. My rating:   3/5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed the first book in the series, The Windup Girl. It was good, and well-written. I thought the characters were well developed, and the book didn't take a long time to read. I liked the setting, and I loved the book's ending. The second book in The Wind Up Girl series, A Storm of Swords, was a little disappointing, especially considering how good the first installment was. It took a little longer to read, but I felt like the plot was a lot less developed than the first. The characters, though, were much less developed, since they were all stuck in the same town. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's a little frustrating that the two books have the same basic plot. I would definitely recommend the first Wind Up girl book to anyone who likes fantasy books, and would love to read the next one. I know that I will, and will be very pleased.

"The main problem is that the characters don't know they are in a bad story." - K.M.  , October 22, 2013I don the first book in this series and it's great. The characters are well drawn, and the story is interesting. The only problem is the plot. There's nothing in the book that really makes me want to keep reading. The story is set in a small town, and it seems to be about the local schoolteacher. I would have liked a little more background on the town, the teachers, and a little bit more information on the students. The setting and the characters are very well done, and I'd like to see more.

(Read the book, read the review, then read the book again) The book was ok. The writing was OK. The concept was not great.

I can only recommend this book if you are looking for a fun, light, funny read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "There's a reason the Bible was written." - Dr. John A. Tvedtnes
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book. It was horrible from start to finish.  I don't care that it was a self-published book, because I don't know how many hours I wasted trying to understand what was going on.  I'm disappointed in the publisher for such a terrible book.   The book is all about a girl, and she goes to see the doctor because she can't get her boyfriend to fuck her.  She's really a girl that thinks it's okay to just fuck whoever is around her and that's okay.  In this book, she fucks a girl and then has to tell her about it.  Then, the next chapter is about her meeting a boy.  The girl doesn't seem to be in love with him, but the book continues with them fucking and then the girl decides that she doesn't like this boy anymore and wants him to fuck other girls.  This is what I mean about how bad the book is.    It was not written with the intention of it being an edgy book that is controversial.  It was written in a way that just seems like a girl has been fucked by a guy, and then she's going to tell the guy how he fucked her, so then he has to fuck a new girl.  And that's all it was, it was all about fucking.  I don t know what the fuck is going on in this book.    Overall:  This book was a complete and utter failure, and I'm surprised that there was even a self published version.  Even if it was self published, it should have been edited and written by someone who actually knows what the hell they are doing.  If this book was ever going to be published, I am going to have to be the first to tell people about it because it is so horrible and has such a bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have been wanting to read a book by John McPhee for years. I have always liked his works, but I had never been able to read any of them. I am glad that I finally have. It took me forever to finish it, but it was worth it. The story is interesting, and the ending is amazing. I would recommend this book to any fan of John Mcphee's work. ---------------------------  The author has stated that this was not an original idea; it was more of a new concept. I think it was original in that the story revolves around a man who is able to remember a great number of different people and events, as well as their physical appearance. This, I believe, is a very new concept and it's a refreshing idea to read about. The author also has a point to make in the book, which is that all the characters are "bizarre" in some way and are "out of character". In this sense, I really enjoyed reading about these characters. The character of Michael was a good example of this, as he was very interesting to read, but not in a funny way. His story was quite complex and there was a point where I was wondering what he was trying to achieve. I enjoyed the book and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes books like "A Wrinkle in Time", "The Time Machine", and "The Three-Body Problem".
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   This book was a disappointment, even though I knew it would be, in that it tried too hard to be "literary" and did not live up to the book's claims. The book is basically a collection of short stories, in which each character gets to tell a story, and a lot of the stories have an interesting twist or subplot, but there is nothing really in them that makes me think that they would be anything more than short stories. There are some clever sentences, but they are so brief that I did not notice them at all. I can see the point of this book (I was going to give it three stars but decided to give two stars because it was an interesting book and was worth reading for those who enjoy short stories and want to get a taste of what is possible with short stories). But the book, the collection of stories, is not the book I was expecting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a good book, and it was fun to read. The stories in the book were fun and enjoyable, and the characters were well developed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I had high hopes for this book but the first half was awful.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does a terrible job of presenting itself as a novel that will help the reader understand the basics of the Bible.  It is not.  Instead, it is a very sloppy, poorly written, uninspired work that makes you wonder how a book that pretends to teach about the history of Christianity can be called a "work" at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a good story, but I wish the author had given a little more background to the characters and plot. I think that was one of the things that disappointed me the most about this book. I really liked the way she set up the plot. The book is about two characters. One is a boy named Harry who is very smart. He likes science and math, and he's very interested in learning how the universe works. He gets involved with a girl named Megan who's the same age, and they get involved in a group of girls who are trying to figure out how the world works. The girls are trying really hard to get to know one another, but it's clear that they have very little in common. Harry's parents are divorced, and she and her sister are living with her mom, who is a very traditional and very religious woman. Harry is going through a lot of growing pains. He's a young boy who is learning to be a man, and the girl he likes doesn't have any of his feelings for him. They become close friends, but there are things between them that can never be resolved. They just seem to have a hard time getting along. I liked that the book wasn't afraid to make these girls very attractive, and that they were a very diverse group. One of the best things about the book is the way the author portrayed Harry's friend Sarah, who was one-fourth Latina. I thought that the author really captured the character of Megan. I would have liked a little bit more of a background to her. The author's use of her character was very well done. I found it hard to keep track of all the things she was doing. I guess it's good that she's so smart, but the book would have been much more interesting if there had been a little less focus on her and more on the other girls. One of the reasons I liked this book so much is because it was one I hadn't read before. I've always been interested in reading about a group like this. I read a book about the same group a couple years ago called "Predictably Irrational" by a guy named Michael Shermer. This is a great book about this group of women, but this book is written by a woman. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, because I always think it's going to be the book that gets me off to a bad start. It's not. It actually
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really, really hated this book. It was poorly written, the author does a poor job at telling the story and doesn't know what to do with it. The ending is horrible and the ending to the whole story is just sad. If you want to read a book about a man trying to find a woman who loves him for himself, you are better off looking somewhere else. It's a waste of time. I will never read a self-help book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I was hoping to enjoy the book but I had a really hard time. I didn't like the characters. They didn't seem like they were made to be a romantic story. The story was a bit boring and there wasn't any action. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 1 star was the ending. The last few pages were just a bit too abrupt. I wanted more. I would have read the book in a bookstore if it had been offered in paperback.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a bad author, I would not recommend this to anyone, if you're looking for a good story with great writing this is a waste of time.  I think it was just a bad project for a bad writer, I'm going to read a good one now.  4 stars is just a little bit too low - - - - Recommend this book to a friend - - I can't recommend this book enough, the story is well written and the character development is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad I can't believe anyone read it. There were two main things that were wrong with this book. The first was the cover. It was a bit too big. The book was written in a very sloppy manner. There was no consistency in how characters were written. Sometimes it was very obvious that some of the information had been plagiarized. I am pretty sure it is because of a lack of experience writing fiction, but it really annoyed me. The second thing I was not too pleased about was the way the book was presented. It really dragged on and on. There really wasn't any sense of pacing, and it really dragged the book out. I could tell that the author did not want to get to the good parts and just kept going. The last thing was the characters. I don't like to use the word "cripples" when referring to people, but in this book they seemed to be all cripples. They were just so dull that it was hard to care about them. I will give the author some credit though. She did a good job of putting in a lot of detail in the world of the book. It is not the sort of world where you could just walk in and have any one of the characters immediately show up and help you. They did make some attempts to flesh out the world and the characters, but I think that the world was a little too big and the details were not well developed. It all just made it seem so much like a generic fantasy world that I just did not care for it. The only thing I liked about this book was the ending. I do not really have anything negative to say about the book, but the ending was really good. I think it would have been better if the author would have just stayed on a road in the book instead of going back to the first book to finish it off. I really liked the character of Lyla and I think she was a very interesting character to have written into the book and I would have liked to have seen her more in the second book. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. The cover was terrible, the writing was horrible, the characters were just dull and there was not enough of a world in the first part of the novel to keep you engaged. The characters and world were too big for the author to be able to get any sort of sense of flow going.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ My daughter's new favourite book! It is very well written and funny, and has a great storyline and characters. It was a real struggle to get through it, and I had to do a lot of digging to find some of the characters, but the story is great. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who likes books about animals and stories with a little bit of action. I would also recommend reading the other reviews of it to get a feel for how the author is able to create believable characters and make you care about their fates. (The first chapter is particularly well written).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book, but I thought the pacing was off a bit. There are several different plot threads, some of which seem very important, but then there are a couple of chapters where the plot is kind of dragged out. I'm a big fan of how the author takes the concept of an evil mastermind and makes it into something much more personal. The writing is great, the art is gorgeous and the story is a good one. I did get a bit lost at one point, but it didn't ruin the book for me. If you like horror, especially when it's dark, this is a must read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know that I can recommend this book.  The story and setting is interesting, but the characters were all stereotypes and there was little in the way of plot development or character development.  The author does a decent job describing the time period and the culture but the story doesn't go anywhere.  The characters are boring, the plot is boring and the setting is boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you don't like the characters, the plot, the world building or the overall pacing, you'll hate this book.  The characters are flat and bland.    There are too many plot holes, not enough character development, and not enough development of the world and the characters.  The story was a bit slow for my taste.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The book is full of "it all happens" details about a group of people who are trying to create a new life, but they have little idea how to go about it. The first chapter starts off very well with a couple of great details about their home, their friends, and the people in their circle of friends. The next couple of chapters start to go downhill, but the ending is really interesting. The characters do not have a lot of depth, but it is possible to sympathize with them, and I would have liked to see more from them in the book. Overall, this book is very good, but not great. I would recommend this to people who have read one of the previous books in the series, as I was quite impressed by the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, but I just can't get into this book. I had a lot of fun with it, but then I thought about it for a while and realized it wasn't for me. The plot was fun and the writing was great, but for me, the characters just weren't all that compelling. I thought the author was a bit too dramatic about the whole thing, and I can't see how she'd have the time or energy to write a novel about a girl who is just a little more confident and independent than she was when I was a little girl. I guess I just wasn't a girl like that in the 1950's, so maybe I just don't have the same need for a woman to be strong and independent that I do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those "my wife read this book in college and she loved it, so I should read it too" books. It's not bad, it's not good, it just doesn't do anything. It is a book about a very special friendship, but the relationship is not really that special and they are pretty much just talking about their lives, the book is not a book to read. It isn't even a book that will make you feel a bit better about the world, the world is pretty bleak and a lot of the books written in this genre seem to feel the same. 7 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I've read several reviews of this book and I have to agree that they are mostly inaccurate. The book doesn't start with a good story, but rather with a very lame and annoying plot that only gets worse as the book goes on. It seems that the author, as the author is the main protagonist, has little talent in writing (or even reading). The story is so stupid that it's hard to take it seriously, but the author makes it so that you don't really have a choice. He even makes you laugh at the main character, even though the main story is supposed to be about the main plot and not the main characters. The story goes in circles and there is nothing to connect the main cast. The only thing that I liked in the book was the part where the main villain, who is a crazy man with a gun, kills the main male protagonist. I also liked the part when the protagonist tries to run from the main antagonist. However, all the other parts are so lame and so uninspired that I didn't even like it. I really want to read a good, realistic thriller about a terrorist, and a female protagonist who is smart, tough and smart enough to handle herself and take care of the protagonist. However I couldn't care less about this book, I really didn't enjoy reading it and I really would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I was looking for a book on the Holocaust to read during my first semester in grad school and I found a copy of this on the second page. I was a little hesitant to buy it, I knew I was going to hate it. Then I picked it up and read it and found it hard to hate. It is very well written, and the way it describes how the Nazis came to power is very accurate. I found that it also describes the process of genocide in a way that is understandable. I read this book in about a week. I am looking forward to reading more by this author. I can't say enough good things about this book. It was an excellent choice for a second book on my first day of grad school.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This is not a great book. I loved the idea of a story that was told by someone who was "the other" - a girl in the male dominated military who was not very happy about it and who was very much aware of the gender inequality in the army. However, it wasn't really the story that I enjoyed most about the book, it was the characters.   First of all, the protagonist, Mary, was a really annoying character, I found her very annoying, I mean that I really didn't want her to succeed, it just wasn't believable that she could be a soldier and still have a love life. Her father, who is supposed to be the "hero", was very "weak" - his love life was just as weak and he didn't really get along with her, and the guy that she was with at the beginning was just a "bad guy" and she was a very good soldier, and even though her parents tried to give her a good father, they were always in conflict.  , and while she was being a good soldier she was also being an "evil" soldier. She was "sneaky" and not very kind - she wanted the best for the other guys (who are supposed to support her in the unit) and if they didn't do it, she'd try to do it herself. She also had a "gift" that made her look different from the other women - she has very feminine features and her voice is higher and her legs are long - but it was a huge turn off to me, since I'm a female and I have long legs and feminine features too, and I found this "gifts" extremely sexist.   a good example of her "gifted"ness: at the end of the book Mary tells her friends about a story about a "female hero", who saves a boy by throwing a rock at him. I didn't know what a "male hero" was supposed to do, but Mary did it, and her friend asks her "how did you do that?". Mary replies: "I know the way, because I have a gift that I was born with." And this "girl" is supposed a "hero" and is supposed be able to "save" other people. I think the author wanted to write a "guy" who saved a boy, but she missed the mark completely, because a "girl hero" is still a "woman hero", and it's
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It was a very interesting story, and I enjoyed reading it. However, I would have liked more detail about the people and the places the book was set in. It seemed that the author had a lot of information, but chose to write it all out for us, and for no reason. We're given a lot about the history of the land and people in the book, but it seemed like the author just threw everything in there, and we were left with the impression that he had seen the world before and could write about it. The story was interesting, and the ending was very good, but I wouldn't have liked the book any more if I didn't like the book's title.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  Baldur's Gate (1999)  The Black Cauldron (2004) 's "Black Cauldron" was a disappointment. The writing is stiff, the writing is repetitive, and the story's themes are so muddled that it's hard to tell if they even belong to a single world. There's no real character development in the book, either. I didn't like this book.I have to wonder if I'll ever be able to read another fantasy book that doesn't have its roots in Tolkien. I love fantasy books, and this one was a good one, but I just don't know if I'm ever going to be able get past it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with mistakes and errors and no real story.  There are too many mistakes to even list them all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took a long time to get around to reading this book. It took me a long while to realize that this book wasn't good and it wasn't interesting. The premise is a bit silly. I mean, the characters are super strong and super dumb. That is the premise of the book. There are a lot of good things about this book though. The book itself is well written and there are some fun and interesting twists. I did like how the character relationships played out and how the main character was very smart about his choices. The only issue I had was the characters' motivations. I'm not sure I understand why this guy is so interested in a girl that he has never even met before. There is a lot that is unexplained in this book that doesn't make a lot sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the perfect example of how to make a horrible novel sound enjoyable. I have read several reviews on Amazon and read that this book was a total disaster. Well I didn't know it was a disaster until I read it. I think it's really unfortunate that this author decided to take the easy way out and just go with a more generic approach. The writing is just so poorly written. I am sure that if she were to just make it up as she went along, it would be a great book. However, she took the easy route and just made the characters into nothing but the stereotypical "villains" she had in mind. I really hate the word "villain". I don't really like it when I hear it because it sounds so clichéd and it just seems so stupid. This book was really bad. The only good thing I can say about this book is that the first two chapters are really good. The first two chapter is what really made me feel like the book was going to be a success. It had this great little mystery that was really well done and then the characters were really great. Unfortunately the story just went downhill from there. I can't imagine how many other authors are going to make the same mistake as this author and try to write a book that has nothing to do with the main character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is just okay. The first half of the book is good, and the second half of it is just bad. It is just a lot of stuff to cover in the first half, and in the second the author tries to go too far and ends up going off on a tangent. This book is a bit of a train wreck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to start this book and I am very disappointed by the end of it.  The main character (I am not sure if he is male or female) is the least believable of all the characters in this book.  I am surprised that this author wrote this book but he did.  He has no experience writing anything other than science fiction.  I am not really surprised that he is writing a book about space exploration and I would not have minded if he had written about another subject.  This book should have been called "space exploration and space travel" and not "The Space Exploration and Space Travel" book.   The main character, who is an explorer, is a space explorer in space.    I feel that there was no need to spend so much time on his space mission.  It seems to me that his only motivation in space exploration is for the money, and he is very poor.  So I feel like he is going to die a very bad death.  What makes him think that he will make it back to Earth and not die?   He goes to an island, and I feel the author just put a bunch of animals on the island, just for the sake of being there.  After he goes to the island he goes on an expedition to the end where he is supposed to find the source of the energy.  The only thing that I really liked about the book was that there is a little humor in it, especially in the first part of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " The ending was awful. " -I was excited to read this book. I loved the premise of this book, and the idea of having a group of people who have very different personalities who must work together to fight the evil that is trying to destroy them. I was disappointed that the author didn't really deliver on the premise, though. The characters are so different from each other that it was hard to care about any of them. The only one who seemed to really care about her sister was the main character. The one character who was kind and compassionate, however, was the sister. I think that this was the only real character that I really cared about. I did like the idea that the sister and the boy were from different countries, but I felt that the book was ruined by the author's tendency to introduce all these characters in order to set up the twist. The twist could have been handled so much better. The other characters were also not that interesting. I found the characters to be very stereotypical, and I didn't feel much empathy for them. For example, one character is a vampire who only wants to feed on humans, while another character is the leader of a group that wants to help humans. The way the characters interacted with each other was also not very interesting. When the characters did interact with each another, it was always in a very superficial way. For the most part, the characters seemed to only care about themselves and not the other characters. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but if you are looking for a good vampire story, this book is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of the book was the final chapter.  It was awesome. ____________________________________________ I have read this book twice.    I think I will not buy the third time around.  I don't understand the reason for the title.  Why would anyone want to read this and NOT read the previous books?   The writing style is really uninspired.  The character development is poor.  It just doesn't feel like there was enough to do with all of the characters.  I am hoping that in the third book (if it ever comes out) they will develop the plot more.  They should make this a trilogy and the third will be much better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was an interesting story that I enjoyed but the ending left me a bit disappointed. The ending left many questions that were left unanswered.

It wasn't a bad read, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a good amount of patience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The narrator is a good narrator, but his narration does not match the writing of the book.  The writing is poor and there is little variety in the voice of the main character.    This book is about an orphan who wants to be a doctor.  He is a child genius but is a terrible child at school and is not very bright.  His best friend, a boy who is a little bit older than him and who is also autistic, has a crush on him and is a genius in his own right.  Their lives are at odds with each other and when the narrator realizes the boy and his friend are more interested in a game of "hide and seek" than in helping the boy find his family, he becomes very angry at them.  The narrator is very clever and good at making a point, but he does not seem to be able to be convincing in the way he makes a point in this book.   I also have trouble understanding the character who is supposed to be the narrator.  It seems that the narrator is supposed make this story interesting for the reader, but it is so bad that I can't imagine it being any good.  I read this book in my college library, but I do not know if this is an older copy or not.   The narrator also does not sound very good in this.  This is a great book for kids, but if you have an older child who likes to read, this is not a good book for them. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book but didn't find it as exciting as the original.

I don't know if I can recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping that the plot and characters would make it worth my time. I was wrong. The story is confusing and the characters are flat and not memorable. The author was not able to write a compelling book with her plot lines, so she resorted to writing her own characters to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. The ending was too abrupt and didn't tie up the plot properly. The world building was bad and the science behind the story was laughable. It is not a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not surprised that the book was a flop. I've heard good things about the author and her writing ability but the book just did not work for me. The premise is that a person is trying to find the person who raped her and was going to kill her but he was caught and killed. The main character is a female doctor who is in love with the main character. The book has a strong sexual theme. There are several incidents in the book where the male characters are sexually aroused and the female characters are in shock. The male characters also make sexual innuendos to the female character. This is a book that I'm sure will be highly criticized by many people and I think that it should have never been published.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________I read this book on my Kindle. I've been trying to read it for years. I loved it at first and then I started to hate it. It took me forever to finish it. The plot line was just boring, there were no twists, there was no surprise at the end and there were so many characters, they were all so similar. It was just too boring. I also hate the author's tone. I think he's trying to be funny and then it becomes a bore. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to read another book with this annoying tone.The writing is bad. It's so bad, that it's hard to read. I just want to get out of the book and never look back. I hope the author gets a real job.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************************This is a terrible book. I got this for my daughter and I was not expecting it to be any better than her average books. I really thought it would be a good book for her but it is so bad. The plot is the only thing that I liked about this book. There was a little bit of romance but that was not enough for me. The book starts off with the story about a young girl who finds a magic mirror. She has a dream about a princess and she goes to find her. But what she gets is the story of a poor woman who gets into a terrible situation. I thought this was a good plot for the beginning of the book but after that it was just not good. The main character, Mavis, is so annoying and there was just too much of her. She is always whining about something. She had to get a job, she needed a job and she got her job and it was a part time job. I mean, how could she get a part-time job? The ending is so stupid. After the story was over the main character just went to her home to rest. I think this was the only time I could even believe that it is supposed to be a fairy tale book. The whole book was just so bad that I cannot even say that I enjoyed it. It was just like a bad fairy tale that was written by someone who has never heard of a fairy-tale and doesn't know how to write a good one. I hope that there are better books out there that have more good things about them. If there are any out there let me know and I will read them.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I was skeptical at first, because I read a lot of science fiction. I had a hard time getting into The Left Hand of Darkness, but I ended up liking it. It was dark and depressing, but at the same time, there was a lot to like about it. The main character, John Henry, is a great protagonist, as he's trying to get over a very bad experience he had with his family when he was a child.   As I read on, I realized that the story was not only well done, but that there were some interesting ideas about what makes a person happy. It's a very bleak story, but there is a very upbeat ending that shows John Henry overcoming his problems and making some great new friends.   and, of course, it was really dark. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, who cares if you're a bad person? It's all about the experience.   to make a good book, you have to make it very dark, and it has to make you feel bad. That's how I feel about it: it's very depressing. It really hurts. But it's a pretty interesting story.   I liked the ending of it. I wish it had gone on a bit longer.     A good book for adults: __________________  I like it when there is an element of mystery, and I like when the author uses the word "fascinating" a lot.   a very depressing book, but also a pretty good one: _______   The best thing about this book is the ending. I am sad that I have to finish it, but the ending is so good that I will be glad to finish this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The most disappointing thing about this book is the ending, and I hope that it doesn't happen again."  - The Librarian
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this in one sitting because I had to and I couldn't stop.  The only negative thing about this book is that the author has a poor grasp on reality and she gives us an example of how stupid people can be and what is truly stupid.  I would say that if you can put up with this book and the stupid ideas it contains that you would be happy to read it again.   However, if you're looking for a good read that is a little more complex, I'd recommend that you go with "The Secret Life of Bees" by  A. E. van Vogt  instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I've just started reading a book called The Book Thief, and I'm really excited about it! The book is written by a man named Brian Keene (who, by the way, is a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings) and has some amazing things to say about the world and the characters. However, the thing that got me to read the book in the first place is that the main character is a thief. There's no doubt about that. I had to stop the book because I found it incredibly boring. I couldn't help but think that the book was written by someone who wasn't very bright, or had a very low tolerance for boring books. Anyway, I thought I'd take a few moments to write a little review about this book. The book follows a young man named Sam who steals a book and has to figure out why he was caught. The main problem I had with this book was that the story had to be told in a very linear way. This is, in my opinion, a very important aspect of a book. In my opinion the best kind of books are those that have a beginning, middle and end. The beginning is when you meet the characters, the middle is when things start to get interesting, and the end is where everything turns out to be pretty much as it should be. Unfortunately, the story in The Book of the Thief was just too short and too linear. The ending was not satisfying either. The plot was pretty much the same as the beginning, and so was the main cast. This book was not very good, but it was entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a horrible read. It was slow, boring and had some horrible scenes and events. The book is really about a group of people that is trying to find a way to help their friend who is a mutant. I know it's a bad ending but I don't think it needed to be written that way. I think they should have saved this for the movie.   I have to give it 2 stars because I really enjoyed it. I have to say I am very disappointed that this book was never made into a movie. It's a shame, I have been wanting to read a book about mutant children since I was a child. I do think the ending is kind of bad, but overall this book is a good read and I think you should at least give it a try if you're interested in the subject.   a very long time ago in a galaxy far far away, a young woman named Rani is on the run from the Galactic Empire. She has found a group that believes that she can be cured and that the cure is the use of the Force. They are the Order of the Light. Their leader is a powerful Jedi, Jedi Knight named Anakin Skywalker. His uncle is Jedi Knight and the father of his lover, Princess Padme Amidala. While on the planet of Serenno, Rani meets Jedi Master Mace Windu, who is searching for the missing Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He is captured by the Imperial Security Bureau. Windu leads Rani to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where she meets Anakin for the first time. But when she discovers that she is not the only Jedi, she decides to join the order, becoming a Jedi.   and there was a time when this was the story:   When I was little, I loved Star Wars. When I was about 8 or 9 years old, I had to read The Phantom Menace for the very first time, and it was like a breath of fresh air to me. I was completely enthralled with the Jedi, the Sith, and their power. I would spend all of my allowance on the books.  - I was really drawn to the idea of a group trying to do good in the world. I really liked the idea that they would get there with a lot of hard work, but also that the Jedi would eventually come to realize that their way was wrong and they needed to change. I thought that was the right way
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was okay for me, but I just wasn't able to get the point. I was just looking for some insight into what it was like to be in a polyamorous relationship, and that didn't get delivered to me. The stories were all about the people involved. They were about how they worked through it and how they felt about it. It's like the story of a woman who marries a man and then marries another man, only they're both in the same city, so that story doesn't really matter.  It was the same for me in that I didn't feel like I was able to make a connection to the stories about my partner, who I felt was very loving, and then how he and I were able to work through our differences.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was an enjoyable read. I found the writing to be a little dry and a bit simplistic, but the book's plot was quite engaging.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to my daughter and she was hooked and I read the entire thing in one day. My only complaint is that it is a bit of a slog.  It is an interesting topic, but it would be much better to just read it as a novel instead of a book club.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half of the book was good. It had a good plot, and it was engaging. The second half of this book was a big bore, filled with boring descriptions and character development. The author was not funny, nor did she have any interest in the characters. I was disappointed that the author decided to include a romance in this book. It did not help that the romance was poorly written, and didn't really go anywhere. There were so many different plot lines and characters that it was hard to keep track of what was happening and why.  In short, this book is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book. I'm a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, so I figured it was only natural that I would love this book as well. I don't really know if I did or not, but I have a strong feeling that this was not the case. I'll give the book two stars because it was a nice book. It's a vampire novel, and there's nothing wrong with that, so it was enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed with how this book ended. There was so much I was wanting to know about the story that it took me about 50 pages to realize that I had been set up. The main character was a huge jerk. I mean, a huge one. He was a vampire and a murderer, and he murdered a bunch of people. I didn't like him very much, but that's not a bad thing. I have to say that I'm surprised that the author has the balls to be so nasty to the main character. I felt like she was really getting under his skin in order to build a relationship with him. But, you know, she doesn't do that to me. I always feel that the main characters are the ones that have the most emotional growth in this book, and this was no exception. I just think that the writers of this book need to make it clear to the reader that they are in charge of their characters and how they're being portrayed. I know it's not their fault, but it's just a little annoying to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible!   I got this book because I heard that it is the most popular book by C.S. Lewis. I thought that this was a book I'd love to read, and was very surprised to find that it wasn't. This book has no real plot, and is just a series of bizarre vignettes, with no clear meaning. I have read Lewis' books many times, and this is by far the worst of them. I'm glad I haven't had to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's bad. It's boring, and you're never going to like it. It has no twists, no good/bad choices, no surprises, no moral or emotional complexity, no character development, no sense of humor. It does have good story, but not really good story. There's nothing in this book that makes you say "wow, this is a great book". It's just another book about a guy in a world that isn't that interesting, and he's not the best character. I guess I just wish I'd read another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________ I had high hopes for this book and it failed me completely.   The book begins with the following:   "A few days after I had returned from a tour of duty in Vietnam, I read a review of my book, Vietnam, which was published the previous summer. It was the first time I'd seen a book with such an obviously false, misleading, or misleading review. It made me angry. I started writing a rebuttal, but I kept thinking about the way people had written about the book."   And the rest of the book is a rehash of the same claims. That is not my opinion.   "But the most important lesson was this: The more we learned about the war and the less we felt about it, the more we felt we were doing something wrong."   The lesson was, that the military and the politicians lied, manipulated, and misused our tax money, while they had their way.   the best part is: "The war had turned into a huge failure, and our politicians and generals were not only lying about what they were doing, but they were also making it up. They were not telling us the truth. And if you can't trust a war to tell the truth, what is the use of having a war at all?"   But, that's not what it said in the review.   to be fair, I found the review useful, and it provided a lot of context for my opinion: "In Vietnam, she writes, 'we were the good guys.'"   What the review didn't tell you was that the author wrote, "The military and politicians were not just lying about it. They also made it up."  , she says, "the military and their politicians were making it all up." She didn't mention how the military was involved in the "make it all happen" deception of the war.  -she also says that the U.S. military had been involved in a disinformation campaign to deceive the American people into thinking that the war was justified and that we were in a real war against a real enemy.   for those who have never read the book, this is important. What the author is saying is that we the people were lied to by our politicians. The author also mentions how the government had "created a climate of fear" and was spreading misinformation about the true nature of the Viet Nam conflict. She claims that the government was using our tax dollars to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was very poorly written. It had a boring plot, bad characters, bad dialog, and the book was just a mess. I'm sorry, but this book is not worth your time. It is a poorly written book that has no point and does not make sense.  This review is for the paperback edition.   Review:  The author is a prolific writer. The story he tells in this book seems like it could have been written by someone who has never read a novel before. I was also not surprised by his writing style. It was very clunky, clunky at times, and sometimes it made the writing difficult to follow. I found myself questioning how someone with such an enormous amount of writing experience could make something so sloppy. The writing is very uneven and it is hard to find a solid theme. It really lacks a solid plotline. I feel like the story is just a mish-mash of ideas. In many ways, it is a story about a man who goes through the motions and ends up going home at the end. I did enjoy the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I don't like books that make you think. I don't read stories about people that have problems with their relationships with people. This book is one of those that does it. It is a story about a woman that goes on a date with a man she likes and ends up breaking up with him because she can't handle his obsession with her. She goes on another date with another man that she likes. This time the man doesn't have problems and she is in love with him.   This book does a great job of explaining how to handle yourself when you are in a relationship with a person you love. It does this by showing how you have to be aware of the person's behavior and how it might change. It also gives examples of situations where you need to stand your ground and make the right choice. I was impressed with how well this book explained things. I found myself reading it over and over again.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm really sorry to say that I'm going to have to give this book a zero star rating.  For starters, the main character is just a boring, stereotypical female who has a history of being a little bitchy. She's the only one of the four girls who's never had any good things happen to her, and she's the one who is always the most self-centered and obnoxious. She also has a very shallow personality and is completely clueless about what's going on in the world around her. She is the only person who seems to have any life outside of her stupid, immature, and obnoxious behavior. There's nothing wrong with being a brat, but when you have the attitude of an angry teenage girl, you really don't have anything going for you. I can understand her having a bad history with a few of the boys, but she's never really developed anything other than that. Her best friend is a rich, annoying, bitchy girl, and I really hope she isn't in love with her because I don't think she could take the two together. They don't seem to really like each other, and when the other two girls start getting a little jealous, they try to get her to leave them. When she does, they get together, but they aren't able to deal with the jealousy and insecurity. I really donned I have no clue what kind of story this is supposed to be. It's really a shallow, self-involved story of a girl who's a bit of a bitch who doesn't know her own worth, so she gets her revenge on the guys who mistreated her and who she doesn't even like. I'm sorry, but it's not going to win any awards. It seems like a really shallow story about a girl and her friends, but that's really it. I don,t like this book and would rather watch a TV show about a bunch of teen girls who are really obnoxious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It has some good ideas but there's so much more that could have been done with it. I have read some other reviews that complain about the characters being stereotypical. I can't say I think that's a bad thing but there are too many characters that don't really make sense or are just one dimensional. I'm also not a fan of how the plot is dragged out. I think the author did a good job with the first two books and then this one felt like it needed to be stretched out."  –Kelsey This is a really good book. The story is well paced and the characters were very well done. The setting is a bit dry and the prose is really nice. The only thing that really bugs me is the fact that the book has a lot of "dramatic twists" that seem to just happen at random. If you like fantasy with a little bit of romance thrown in, this one's a keeper.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********************I have read this book. It was an amazing book that left me in awe of the talent that wrote it. But the writing was very sloppy, and I don't think it's a mistake that the author uses the word "bitch" in such a manner. This book made me feel that the book was a piece of trash. It is about a young girl named Lucy who has just moved from Brooklyn to an upscale neighborhood. The book focuses on her life and the many trials and tribulations she has to face. Lucy is the perfect embodiment of the New York Girl, she has her head on straight, she doesn't give a fuck about how people see her, she is intelligent and well spoken, and has a great sense of humor. She is also very beautiful, she just happens to be a "b*tch" like everyone else, but she just doesn't care. At the end of the book, Lucy is in a great relationship with an even more gorgeous girl who she doesn�t care about her past relationships or how her appearance is affecting her life. Lucy's boyfriend doesn�T care about the girl she has an attraction to. She doesn�TSHAT, she does! But she just has a "B*tch like personality" and is selfish. I think the book could have been made a lot better if it had been edited more carefully and if the author had given more attention to the character's thoughts and thoughts on life. It could have saved the book.I just found this book to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It has such a boring, dull plot and so many cliches and stereotypes that it was hard to keep reading. The author could have edited this book a lot to make it better. But that doesn�SNTHAT the point of a story! The point of it is to tell a story, and not have a bunch of characters in it that are all "BITCH". It�S NOT LIKE A STORY ABOUT BITCHES, but it was written like that, and the characters were just so generic, it really felt like they were just a bunch that was there to make the plot come out right. The last part of the novel was a great bit of writing, but the story was just so boring, and made me hate Lucy and her boyfriend. I also didn�TSHE POINT OF THE BOOK WAS TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE IN THE WRONG PL
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I'm a writer. I have never read a book that was so boring. I mean this book is so boring that it makes me want to go to sleep. The story is just boring and I can't stand the characters at all. It doesn't make me want a drink or to watch a movie or anything, but I don't want to read more about it. I just want a book where I don' read. I was so disappointed. --------------------------- 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this book for a class, and my students loved it. It was good, not great. But, I do recommend it to any of my friends who like fiction and non-fiction, especially if they like fantasy. I will definitely be buying the next book in the series.  3 out of 3 people found this review helpful.  the main character is very bland. he's also a little stupid. I don`t really care for the book at all because i couldn`t care less about the characters. I like the setting, but the book wasn`t anything to write home about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was awful! The writing is very unoriginal and the main characters are not interesting. I really thought this was going to be an interesting story about the history of the Russian revolution, but instead it was about a Russian woman who wanted to marry a Jewish man. I don't know if the author is Jewish or not, but it seems that her husband was not that into the woman. She had been a Russian soldier in WWI, but she was not very talented in the military and was only there for the money. The author tries to portray her as a heroine, but I didn't care about her at all. Her husband is just a spoiled, lazy, spoiled man who wanted a woman just for the sex. I didn the author really tries to paint this as an anti-Semitic book, but the only reason why the Jewish characters were portrayed that way was to make it seem like the Jews were responsible for the Russian Revolution. The book was supposed to be about Russian women and Jewish men, but as soon as I read about the Russian women I just wanted to punch the author in the face.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________, and the book sucks.   It's so easy to put down books you don't like, but if I had to take a chance on reading a book and I didn't like it, I wouldn't. That's the problem with a lot of books on this list. I enjoyed a lot, but I also felt that I got what I paid for, which is always a bummer. I had read a lot about this genre before reading this book, but nothing has ever given me the feeling that I'm going to love a book that badly.   and the bad part is that I would have liked to see more of the world of this book. I wanted to see where this book took the characters, where this world was going, but all I got was this. It's the book's biggest flaw.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ _________________  I read this book in a week because the author made a point of it. It is a story of two people who meet on the beach and end up having a passionate and loving relationship.   The first person is very young. He is extremely beautiful. He wants to be a great artist. He does not realize that he has a very strong ego. He has no idea that he is the object of the other person's affections. The first person does not even know that the other has a strong personality. The second person does understand and does realize that the first person's ego is powerful. They are both drawn to each other. It's hard for them to separate their feelings.  ,   It was the most beautiful experience I have ever had. It was the kind of experience that made you feel like you can make it and you can do anything. It made me want to cry, but not in a sad way. It didn't hurt that much because it was so natural. I felt like I had been born again. I can't put into words how perfect this book was. I was amazed by the author's ability to write about love and sex and life and beauty. It really was a breath of fresh air and a revelation of what life is all about. It changed me for the better and I am going to read the sequel as soon as it comes out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete train wreck.  The book is full of errors.  "The only time I have ever seen this in a story is when the author is trying to make the characters speak with a British accent." -The Review of Contemporary Fiction, Vol. 12 (Winter, 1999) "This book reads like a cross between a children's storybook and a poorly written porn movie." --The Book Review, April, 2005 "Bizarrely, I think I'm in love with the hero of this book.  I am not sure what to think of the story, but I am in love.   I would love to see what would happen if I ever met him."  --Bustle.com, April 19, 2005
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********   I have to admit that I was very excited when I opened this book and found that it contained a lot of information about the life of Christ and the early church. It's just that I never liked any of the books I've read by Christian authors who try to teach us about Christianity or Christianity's origins, because I never understood how such a man as Christ could have taught people so much. I am convinced that most of these books are written by people who have no idea what Christianity is all about. I just wish there was more information about it and less of these Christians who have nothing else to teach the world but their own religious beliefs.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a really terrible book that is just plain wrong. It has absolutely no place in the history of science and is an insult to the intelligence of the reader. I would have given this book 5 stars if I didn't think it was so bad.  5 stars for the author:   I was very surprised when I finished this book. I have always wanted to learn about the history and development of the modern scientific method, but it is not in the curriculum in my high school, so this was a great gift. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the development of science.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time. It is a typical non-fiction account of an individual who is very successful and a woman who is not.  This is a man who is a very successful business man who has done well in his business life and who is now a successful father, a good husband and a very good person. He has many great accomplishments in his life. He is a highly educated man, a lawyer, a doctor, a successful businessman, a man of integrity and is a wonderful father.  His wife is not very successful but is a loving and kind woman. She is the most wonderful woman that I have ever known and I have been married to her for ten years now. The book starts off with him at his peak in business, he is on top of the world and has achieved his goals. He loves his family, he has a lot of money and his business is doing very well. It ends on his wedding day, his wife and family and he is going to start a new life.  He goes on to describe his business and how it has changed over the years and how the business has grown and changed over time. He describes how the company has gone through a series of mergers and acquisitions and now it is a conglomerate company with a major focus on technology and information and he has started his own company and he thinks he has made the right decision.  In the last section of the book he discusses what he thinks is going wrong in the company and what he would do differently.  The book ends with him being optimistic about the future of the company.   I found this book very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "the author of the book is a moron who has no idea how to write a believable novel.  The characters are either dumb and not interesting enough or they are dumb and too interesting."  I don't know what that says about the book or the author but I think that's an accurate summary of the first two chapters of the novel. I'll just give you a quick rundown of the main characters and then get into the good stuff.  Astrid is a teenager from the south of France and she's also a student at the elite school, the Eau Claire.   She's also an avid reader of mystery and thrillers, which is a big part of her social life and why she is interested in solving a murder.  The murder is a case of mistaken identity that involves the death of an elderly woman.  Astrid thinks the victim is the suspect and when her roommate's boyfriend goes missing, she tries to prove it by taking a look at the old photo of the old woman and finding out where she died.  When she gets to the murder scene, she discovers that the victim was her father.  Unfortunately, her father's body is missing, but she still suspects her roommate.  It turns out that her roommate was the victim's boyfriend's lover, which was why she killed her father and tried to frame Astrids father.   The novel gets pretty good when we get to the end.  I would say that the book was good, but I'm not sure what makes it good.  There are a few things that I like about it, such as the plot, but most of the other things I just didn't like about the novel, such an the writing style and the characters.  This is not a novel that I would recommend, but if you're interested in a book that has a mystery and a thriller feel to it, it's definitely worth a read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a little clunky and boring. I had to read it twice to make sure I was getting the point of the book. What did you like best about this story?  A good premise and a lot of action scenes. Why is this book a Goodreads Pick?  Well written and entertaining. I'm sure this would be a good book to read at a coffee shop, but not if you're looking for something more complex.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really enjoyed this book, but I think that it's a bit too long. If you are in for an epic fantasy, you might as well read The Way of Kings and go on. I would give it a 3 star if I could. I think it's worth reading though, even if you are not a fan of epic fantasy. I hope that this series is going to get finished and I hope the next book will be more epic.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The story was not good. The story was a good idea, but it was poorly executed. There was no emotion, no heart, no emotion at all. I felt sorry for the main character, I didn't want him to get hurt, I wanted to be happy for him. I think the author should have just put a happy ending on the story and never bothered to explain the main antagonist. The way the main protagonist was portrayed was not realistic, he was a little arrogant and seemed a little bit uneducated. He was a bad character, but there are many other characters in this book that were bad characters. The ending was not happy, it was sad and depressing. I don't know what the author was trying to achieve with this book, but the end did not work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ The story is well told. But the ending is a complete joke. I was going to say this is a really good book but I don't think it is, because the ending of the book was so weak. There are two things that really annoyed me in this book. One, the protagonist is a character that I never liked. He is so stupid and he always talks like a teenager. I know, I know he's supposed to be an adult but I think he should have just stayed in his room. It's a really weak ending to the story, which is really unfortunate. The second thing is the bad ending to this book is the worst, not the main story, but the fact that the bad guy never gets punished, he just gets killed off, which made me so angry. I really wanted to like this book, but I just don't like this kind of story. __________________________  A very strange, if not totally unexpected, read that I couldn't stop reading. I had to put this book down several times, but my curiosity kept me going. I loved the story of this book so much, but there are some aspects I didn't like. I think this book has a great premise, but some aspects were very strange to me. The characters are all different, but it doesn't make sense. They are so strange that you can't really connect with them, and they are all very different. It was hard to find one character I really liked, though. The author did a good job of writing some weird and strange creatures that are very strange and creepy. It also makes it hard to read the story because you don't know what is going on, especially the first part of the story. The first part is very confusing, and you are never sure what is real and what isn't. It took me a few reads to get used to the strange story and to get to know the characters. It is a good book, just not my favorite. ____________
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________  I read this book when I was a child and loved it to pieces. I loved it so much that I reread it a few years later as an adult and still loved it. It's a beautiful story with a lovely twist. The story of how a small town in Oregon turned into a giant war zone is gripping, and the way that the children in the town are coping is so realistic and touching. The narrator's speech about the true meaning of war is haunting. The ending was a nice touch.   The problem with this book is that the ending is not a twist. You could have easily had it turn out in a totally different way.   a bad review: _______________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book is filled with the typical clichés of the paranormal. You read this book and are left with the feeling that the author is trying to prove a point. This is probably the weakest book I have ever read by the author. If you want to learn about the paranormal, read this one instead. You won't learn anything. This book does not help you learn."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narrator, James M. Cain, doesn't have the voice of a character you're interested in, and I couldn't care less what happens to him. He sounds like he was given a voice coach and then let out of a practice book. He has no range of emotion. I just don't get him. His dialogue is uninspired and is filled with "I'm going to tell you why, but I don't care about the details. I only care about your heart". I mean, come on. I'm sure it's good for the soul.  He sounds like a character from a horror movie.   No. I don' t.  He's a terrible narrator.  He was a great character in The Dark Night.  I think this book is better than that one.  It's just not as good.  This book had a great cast, but they were so far removed from the characters they portrayed. The voice actors are fine, but the way they did this book was terrible.  They just made it seem like the author was writing for himself.  You can't help but feel bad for them.  Cain is supposed to be the "bad guy" who's been locked up for his crimes. But he's a total douche, just like the character of Mr. Mackey. Cain is also very bad at describing the dark and mysterious nature of the forest.  In my opinion, it should have been called the "Hairy Forest".  It had the same effect.  So, how did this one do?  I thought it was a bit overrated.  The book is not very scary, but it has it's moments.  Overall, I liked it, but if you want a creepy novel, go with a book like Night of the Living Dead, or even the book I'm writing about right now.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This book is very poorly written and the book is just a collection of short stories. There are no plots, characters or any sense of pacing. The story is just about the characters. I don't even want to get into the writing style of the book. The main characters are terrible. The one thing that is worse than the characters is the writing of the story. It is terrible and makes me want to vomit. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really liked this book. The characters are well drawn, the plot is very interesting and I love the world the author created. However, I really disliked the ending. The story was great but I just didn't get the ending or the ending was the last in the book and the last chapter is the best. I would have loved if the author would have given the ending to the book more attention. I will give the book a 3 because the ending wasn't bad but it could have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be incredibly boring. I found the characters to be extremely stereotypical and not even the most interesting parts of them were. The main character is pretty annoying, and the narrator kept repeating himself throughout the book. I think that if I had read this book in school, I would have skipped it. This is one of those books that you need to be a good reader to even understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* "This book has many faults. The narrative is confusing. The writing is mediocre. The book doesn't provide enough information for the reader. The plot is weak. The character development is poor. The characters are not believable. The dialogue is boring. The story is repetitive. The conclusion is poorly constructed." This is the third book in the series by C.S. Friedman. The first two were all over the place. This one follows a character named J.L. who is the new kid at a prestigious college. She is good at her studies but doesn't like school, is very good looking and is smart. The narrator is a friend of J. L.'s and the author does not really know J. A little while into the book the author seems to have realized that J. was never going to get anywhere in her life. J. is always late. The author wants to show how smart J. can be but then in the very last chapter she just kind of gives up. The other characters are a lot better than J. I enjoyed the characters in this book a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********  I bought this book as part of the "All the Best" series and I was not disappointed. It was written by a very well known author. I'm a big fan of his work, and it was a good read. The writing style was different from his usual style. I did not like it. The book was written very fast. The chapters did not flow well. I felt that it was hard to follow because it was so fast paced. There were a few things that I did think were funny, but I felt the humor was too late in the book. I thought the ending was a bit rushed. I wish it was longer.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I have a copy of this book and I was extremely disappointed in it. I love the concept, the writing, the concept. However, the ending was so disappointing. I thought the premise was really great, but the ending left me feeling very disappointed. The whole book is very slow. You really feel that they were trying to build to the big ending. However when the end did come, it came out so late and it was kind of a letdown. I was expecting to get a huge conclusion, but it just felt like it was rushed. I also hated that there were two different endings. They could have given us both endings in the same book and not have it be two different stories. I really liked the concept and the story. It's very slow paced, but at least the ending is great. However the ending did leave me feeling really unfulfilled.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not worth the money it costs. I was so desperate to read this book I picked it up for free on my Kindle and ended up putting it back. I will never ever read a book this stupid. This book was so poorly written, I could have read a different book that wasn't about being a gay man in his late 20's. I also could have done without the boring romance that had me wanting to go out and buy more books in the series but I won't.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I loved this book and have read it 3 times already. It's got great descriptions and characters, a good ending, and is good to read in a bedtime or just after a long day. But it has a couple of flaws. I know the first book is written by a woman, but I still don't get the fact that she has a male character. I mean, it's obvious that he is not the main character. That's how you know he is in the story, he is the only character. And the female characters are not as interesting as the male ones. It is a good book, but not the best. And, I would suggest that you read the other books before you read this one.

It's too basic." "It's a good primer on basic weightlifting technique. The book is written in a way that makes it easy to follow, and there is enough of a 'hands-on' approach to the book that you won't be lost or frustrated trying to implement the principles it teaches."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I found this book to be a bit disappointing. The book is about the death of a child (at the time the book was written) who is also a victim of child abuse. However, it does not follow the typical pattern of the story where the victim is a child of a wealthy family, and the abuser is a rich man who has sex with the child's mother. Instead, it was very hard to connect the victim to the abuse because it seems like the abuse happened in a different environment. For instance, the book is set in a small town, and there is no mention of the rich man having sex with any of the girls in the town (other than the daughter, of course). I feel like the book should have followed the pattern of "well, the poor kid gets raped and the rich guy has sex" rather than "well the poor guy gets raped, and his mom gives him an abortion and the richer guy has kids." It seems that this author just didn't have much of a imagination or ability to put a good story together. I didn't really enjoy reading this book, but the story was still entertaining enough to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to read this book because of my daughter's birthday, but was so disappointed I ended up reading a book that was far worse. The book is about a boy named Chris, who is so into video games that he is obsessed with being in a video game with a girl named Emily. When he doesn't get the girl in his game he gets so depressed that he ends up killing himself. After I finished this book I was really disappointed, but also a little sad because I thought it was going to be a really good story. I was expecting a really deep story that would make me care about the characters. Instead I got an excuse to laugh at the main character, and the fact that he kills himself after he gets rejected from the game. He also goes on a rant about the fact he hates women because he doesn`t want to spend the rest of his life with a woman who isn`t attractive. I don`t know why I didn`t get more out of this book, but I can`t help but feel that I will have to waste my time reading more of it because it is so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I loved this book, but it has some serious problems, both in the plot and the characters.   This book follows the exploits of two "friends" in a "real world" who are on a mission to kill a villain named The Butcher. Their mission goes awry when the Butcher's forces turn on them, forcing the two friends to work together to survive. I really enjoyed the concept and plot of the story, but unfortunately the characters don't seem to fit very well into it.   and now, the plot:   I liked the idea of a world in which a villain like The Butcher is so powerful that he is able to manipulate everyone, including people in a parallel world that is a bit more advanced than our own. I liked that it was implied that the parallel world's people were so advanced that they actually made the Butcher look like a child, though I still thought that a lot of the details that they kept coming up with made little sense. I also liked that the main character, the young man named John, was trying to find his friends in the parallel universe, but he kept having trouble getting there and finding them.  , though it was a bit confusing at times. I can understand the idea, but I also think that it is a little hard to understand why the main characters in the story are so obsessed with the Butcher. I thought that the plot was pretty well-paced, though, and it didn't seem like it was dragged out, like some of the books I've read about the Butcher and the other evil heroes.   was a good character, but she felt a bit too one-dimensional for me. I think that this is because of her age (she's just 16) and her lack of any real emotional depth. I would have liked to see her develop more as the story went on, though. She was pretty good in the last half of the book, though...I didn't understand why she did what she did at the end, but that might have been because she was still confused and didn't have much of a grasp on what she was doing.     was another character that was pretty great. He was a little too idealistic and selfless at times, but still, he was a pretty cool guy.   the only other characters that I didn't really care about were the other characters in their parallel world, who were pretty generic and I felt that they were there more as a plot device than anything

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- 1) The character, Sam, is the worst. His motivations and the way he carries himself make no sense. He doesn't even try to be a hero, but instead acts like a jerk and is a terrible father. The ending of the book left me in a dark place. 2) I didn't like the author's writing style at all. He seemed to be using a lot of adverbs and superlatives when describing things. 3) I don't know how to rate this book, since I can't really say if the book is good or bad. I just read this book and I don  [The story starts off about the character Sam, who is about to start a new job at a new school, where the principal is very strict about what students do on the weekends, and she doesn't like it when people go out. So, Sam and his friends decide to go to a club that is about the size of a football field with a bar down the middle and a big stage with some stage lights. It's called the Fondue Club, and it is a place where they have fun. And that's about it. The plot follows Sam, and his friend, David, as they go to the club to try to get a good time. The book is pretty simple, as it follows the duo from one party to the next, and has Sam and David be the main characters. This is probably a good thing, because it's very short and there are only about 15 chapters. This book was also published in 1992, so there is a lot to compare to. But, that's not really a good reason to avoid reading it. I'll give this book a 5/5 because it was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ ___________________________  I love the premise of the story, but the ending left me in tears. I can't put it down, but I don't think I will ever finish it.   My only real complaint is that the author, who is a professional writer, did not know how to make a suspenseful read. The ending left you with so many questions and it would have been easier to give the characters a chance to explain the events. The pacing was horrible, and the ending was a little too obvious.  :D  The Book:  This is a fun story about a teenager who decides to try and save a friend's life. Unfortunately, the friend, a guy named John, is a drug dealer. The story is written in the third person, but if you're not familiar with third person narrative, I wouldn't recommend it. The author does an excellent job with describing what the characters are feeling, even if it's difficult to tell.   a very fun read  My thoughts: :D

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed. I thought this book was a little boring. The only thing that I really liked was the writing style.  It was easy to read and very well written. The characters were very interesting.

There were a lot of good things, but the story felt so-So.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad. It is the product of a writer who doesn't understand the difference between a plot and a story, and who makes a mess of the latter by giving the main character a love interest who is a complete ditz. The story takes place in the late 1940s, and is set in a small town in rural Pennsylvania. We are introduced to a new girl named Lizzie, who was born into the poor white family of the town's doctor. As she grows up she is the victim of many indignities at the hands of her white classmates and her mother, who has the misfortune of being a woman of means. At the end of the book she is a grown woman, a single mother of three and a lawyer, but in a way that is just as bad as she used to be.   The author doesn't really know how to write a story; I don't blame her though, because she had no idea how to start. She starts off with the basic story of a poor white girl and her struggles with her family, but by the time she is done with the story the reader has already lost interest and it is no longer the main focus.   a very slow start, with very little to interest the reader. I also feel like the author doesn`t know how much detail she should put into her story. It took me a long time to figure out what happened to Lizzies father. At one point she gives us a brief description of him that makes him seem like a man, but she does not explain who he was or what he did in the war. The author should have written a note at the beginning of the story about the fact that she was not familiar with the author's previous works and that she wasn`t sure about her plot, but then she would have been more than happy to read a critique.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book has been a total disappointment! This is a very poor example of how to write a horror book. The book starts out strong, with a creepy but enjoyable mystery, but that all changes as soon as the plot moves to the "real" world. I am not sure why the author wanted to create a "mystery" book at all. The story is pretty much a plot of the "bad guys" who do horrible things to the good guys who try to save them. I really don't know what the author hoped to accomplish with this book, other than to have a good plot. It does not work. There are some good bits of humor, but it's all over the place and not really a funny book. If you like the "classic" horror, then this is a good start, but not a great one. The ending leaves you feeling pretty empty, and it's hard to see where the story will go from here."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book to read for a friend's book club and it's really bad.  It was terrible, the first half is just an excuse for her to get in character as a girl.  Then halfway through, the author jumps into her "main" character's point of view, and the rest of the book is just another excuse for the girl to get into her own character.   The last three or four chapters are just the girl being mean to herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ (This review was collected as an email to a friend who had given this book a great review.) I found this book to be boring and repetitive. I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this book was nothing more than a rehash of what I already know from reading other books. I've read this same plot line so many times, and it never got any better than this.   I found the characters to be annoying and unlikable. It's really no surprise that a book set in the future would be full of characters who are boring, self-centered, and selfish. The only thing I did like about the characters was that they didn't act like characters I'd like to hang out with in real life. The story was repetitive as well. The main character is constantly fighting against other characters who seem to be trying to get what they want.   the main villain is the only interesting character in the whole book. I didn't even feel like I knew who he was. He didn't have any back story. It wasn't until the last third that I realized he was really the hero of the book.   for all the things I hate about this book, it had a few good things as well, namely the ending and the plot. If you want a book about a dystopian future where everyone is a criminal and the government is the evil, go read a good book about that. But this book is just a rehashed version of the same plot that's been done for hundreds of books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is an interesting read. I found the characters and the story interesting, but the author just threw too much at the reader.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________, it's the best novel I've ever read. This is not a book that I'll recommend to a friend, and it will probably get a negative rating from a lot of people. The story is a classic tale of a hero who must be stopped, but it is not just a good story. It is a good book. It may not be what you expected, but if you like stories that are well written and compelling, you will enjoy this book. The characters are the only thing I found wanting. I do not know if the author thought he was writing a detective novel, but this book just doesn't work as a book about a detective. I don't know if it is the way the author wrote it, or the way I read it, but the story just does not make any sense to me. I was so confused about what was going on. This could have been a good novel if it was a good detective novel. The narrator sounds like a person who just found out they have cancer, and was going to have to undergo a lot more chemo.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total disappointment.  It's so hard to imagine that the author is so ignorant about science that he thinks that "the universe" is just a big soup of electrons and that it's "only a few billion years old" or that he believes that the universe was created just last week.  And even if he does believe that, he clearly doesn't know what he is talking about.   He says that the Earth is 4.5 billion years young (he knows the Earth's age from the measurements of the CMB)  but then he says that he was unable to detect any "signs of life" on the planet during that time (not that the "sign" of life would be detectable anyway)  And when I say "sign of life", I mean the evidence of chemical evolution.  He has the "evidence" of a few bits of organic matter, but not the big bang.  The only "evidence of life on Earth" is the presence of a tiny fraction of "primordial organic matter" which is so insignificant that it cannot even be called a "sign".  The author also says that "life is so difficult to detect" and that "if the universe is a billion years or less old, then we can only infer the presence or absence of life from the chemistry of the air we breathe."   I don't see how "detecting life" is "so difficult to infer".   The most elementary tests of life require only a small amount of "life-like molecules"  to produce a detectable result.     This is why scientists use the "gold standard" test of "the chemical reactions that occur in the absence of energy".  If there is no "life" on Earth, then the test of the "chemical reactions that take place in the presence" of energy is useless because it cannot detect the existence of life.  I could show you a hundred other tests which could be used to detect "life".  But that would only prove that I don't understand the science.  If you really want to prove the existence or non-existence of life, then you have to use a "more powerful" test that can detect the presence/absence of life by the reactions which take place without energy.  This test is known as the "Biosignature" test, and it is one of the most important tools of science today.  But I am

The female character is too nice and too passive. The other three are pretty much the same.   The plot is very simple.

Write a negative review about a bad book: **************************** I just got through this book. It was a big disappointment. I really wanted to like it because it was very well written. The author wrote a novel about a very old man with an extraordinary imagination. I think it's a shame that the book has been written to be a children's story because I really loved it. I loved the characters and the humor. I had to put it down after the first half of the book because I didn't like it. The characters were the weakest part of the story. It didn't feel like a very original novel and the author had to resort to a lot of flashbacks in order to make up for it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ This is a good book about how the modern world works. The author is very clear about his intentions and he makes some interesting points. The only problem I have with this book is that he says a lot about the need for "social justice" and "diversity" and all that. He doesn't give the reader much of an idea as to why this is a problem. The book is more about how society changes than it is about how a society changes. Also, some of his ideas about race are not very good. He says that there is no race and that races can't be separated. He then gives a list of people who have some racial characteristics, which are not race, but he fails to explain how the differences are meaningful. I think that his ideas of "diversification" and the need to have "social responsibility" are fine, but the ideas of race are just plain wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________"My daughter's teacher recommended this book as a good resource to learn how to make a good argument.

It does not address the real issue at hand - why do people believe in things that don't make any sense?"  "I was looking for a book about "the real truth" but the book that I found has too many problems to recommend."  "... the author is trying to do his/her best to "explain" everything in the world as they see it, and that's a very difficult thing to do. I can't recommend this book to anyone at all."  (review of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)  I have been searching for something to get me out of the house and into the world. It was like the time when I used to go to the library with a copy of The Godfather, hoping to find an explanation to the meaning of life and my place in the universe. I tried a couple of books like that, but nothing worked. So, I finally bought the book "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly" by Cormac McCarthy. It gave me hope. This book is an explanation of life in a world full of problems and contradictions. You have a society in turmoil where people are so obsessed with the wrong things that they lose sight of the truth. People will do anything to find some meaning. In this book, you will find a very honest account of the life of one man, Joe Colombo, a real life hero. He is described as "a man with a big heart, a heart of gold, a great sense of humor, a gentle soul, and a generous heart." This book will change the way you look at the world forever. I hope you will enjoy it. "  Read an honest review of the book by a woman: _________________"I have no idea what to say about this book other than I really wanted to like it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book written in English about a language (not a dialect) is always a good book! I have learned so much about the language and language learning!   I would like to see a few more of the stories, but overall the book is well written and enjoyable. I like the story of the teacher and his wife. The characters in this book are likable. I wish there were more stories to be told, but as it is the author has the advantage of writing in a very easy to understand way.   This book is a great introduction to a new language and I look forward to reading more from the author.   the book would be a good choice for a language learning class.  .  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

I was laughing out loud at all the parts where they say "Oh my God" or "OH MY GOD" or whatever. I know the author said she would do better but I don't think she even has the ability to do so.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not liked this book very much.  The plot is very simplistic.  It is like watching a child play a video game and not understanding what is happening.   The characters are very wooden and have no depth to them.  It is like the characters are a part of the game and just exist to be part of a game.  They are nothing more than cardboard cut outs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a good book, but there are a lot of inconsistencies in it that I have never seen in any other books, especially not ones that have been published on the market since 1990.  For instance, in one of the book's most important chapters, a man named William Wilson (whom I don't recall the name of) is quoted as saying that the most important thing for a boy is "being able to take care of himself", while a woman named Mary, who is mentioned, said something very similar.     I know that a lot has changed since 1990 (especially with the introduction of the Internet), but there seems to be a big difference between a boy and a woman.    I have no idea why, and am not sure whether or not the author would be willing to say anything about it, but I don 't think that I 'd be able to believe that Mary (who I've never seen as a character before in any book I've ever read) is in any way like William Wilson, and I think that she may be quoting the wrong person.  For more about the author:   She's one of those authors who doesn 't seem to have any real world experience (although she does write in the first person), and so she's written with a kind of dry wit that just makes it difficult to take seriously.  It's very hard to get attached to her characters.  I haven't been able to read any of her books, but the reviews on this site have always been very positive, so I'm probably not the only one who thinks that this is a good, albeit a rather dry, read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  A great book, but I wish it were a little shorter and a bit more descriptive. This is a very well written, very well researched book about a very interesting and important person.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I bought this book because I thought it would be a good read, and it is not. The book is about a girl who has a crush on a boy who is a big fat nerd. He is always in his room reading and talking about movies, and she never seems to notice. She even finds out he is in a relationship with a girl she does not like. I am so sorry that this book is so bad. The characters are horrible. The story is really lame, the dialog is annoying, the plot is lame and just the way the story is written makes me feel very bad for the characters. I don't think the book should be read by anyone because I just don't like the book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   I'm afraid to say that I've read the book and it's an absolutely awful experience.   The author's thesis is that all the bad things about a certain kind of people, such as the "elitists", "intellectuals", "elites" (who in their opinion are not "real" people), and "idiots" (whose only contribution to society is being the kind of person who is stupid and selfish) are somehow caused by an "agenda" to which the author has been a victim for years.   (A conspiracy theory for those of you who don't know what a conspiracy theory is, and a bunch of crap for those who do).   This book is very poorly written.  , the author's book about the evil elitists is so bad that I had to stop reading the book. The whole thing is a load of complete bullshit. The only people who believe in the agenda the author is describing are people who are so full of themselves and egocentric that they think they have to shout it out loud every single day. The elitist is the person who does not care about the poor and needy, the person that does not give a damn about what others think, the people who have a bad attitude towards the other humans on the planet and the people that have no real purpose in life. The author is basically just saying that all these people are bad, so all they have ever wanted is to make a point. The fact that this point is so badly written is a great example of how much the author could have done to make it better.  . The way the author treats the people he is trying to convince is even worse. The poor people are told that they're stupid, that they don't understand what it's like to be poor, that it's the other people's fault, that if they could just do as they're told they would be happy, etc. The rich people are given a similar message. The point is to get the rich to be better people so they won't do what the poor people do. The people in between are told to become better people as well. It's a very depressing message. It is all very well to say "well if the poor do what they're supposed to do and the rich don't then we'll be all happy", but it's not a very good way to go about it. It would have been better if he had said "
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   I have not read the original trilogy, and I've only read the 2-part finale. I had read the other two books in the series, and the first one in particular. I thought it was an excellent read. I like it, I do. It was well written and it had some good twists. It's not the best book in the trilogy, but it is a good read. If you want to see the story played out in a movie, go read the movie, it is better than the book. If not, I don't know what you can say about this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. _________  This book is a great read. The author's style is very clear, easy to read and to understand. I love the idea of using animals in educational programs, and this book is full of them!   One of the biggest problems I have with this book are the lack of animals in the zoo. You will find out in the beginning of the book that animals are very expensive and they are very rare. But this does not stop the author from using animals all over the place and even to show how animals use trees and trees use animals!  , but the animals are all very young and are often seen in the wild, not in captivity. The animals in this book could all be very healthy and in good condition, but they are still living in a zoo.   I was very disappointed with this one.   of the things I disliked about this book:  1) The author does not mention the problems of captivity. I know that there is not enough funding to have an educational program with these animals, but there is so much to learn from them. I have been reading about these animals in zoo and educational books for many years and this is the first time I have seen the problems.   The animals are too cute and their behaviour is so cute. The way the author shows them is so unrealistic.   the author did not use animals in her program, but she uses them in her book.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has an interesting premise, but it suffers from a lack of characterization, a lack in character depth, and a lot of boring exposition. The character development is also pretty lackluster. The book starts off with a girl named Sarah who has a very unusual and rather odd way of relating to others. She is a very sensitive and emotional girl, and yet she has a kind of "cool" personality, which I think is a bit overused in fantasy books. Her personality seems to be a mix between the "dark" and "weird" in the first half of the book. Her relationship with her best friend, her love interest, and even her teacher and her boyfriend all seem to be on a spectrum between normal and bizarre. There is a lot going on here, but I found myself a little uninterested in it. I found Sarah's main character flaws to be: being overly sensitive, having an overbearing mother, and being somewhat of a slacker. In addition, Sarah also has a really bizarre sense of humor and seems to think she is a psychic. She also seems to have a huge crush on her teacher, and her teacher is really into her. That's about all I can say about Sarah's character. I would have liked to see more character development in her, but the book did go to some very odd places. I have no idea how Sarah would have reacted if she had known the kind of problems she had, but that's really a problem with the author's writing. The story also doesn't seem to have any clear direction. Sarah's friends are constantly changing their minds about what they want, and when they say what they mean. They also seem to make very bizarre decisions that don't seem like they have any real reason behind them. In the beginning of the story, Sarah decides to leave her best friends for a guy, but later, after being caught up in a huge event, she decides she wants to stay. Then, Sarah gets a new best friend who seems to understand her better than anyone else, and is a great help to her in the story. But at the same time, the new best friends seem to act very weird and weirdly, and they seem to think Sarah is some kind of crazy psychic. Then there's the issue with the teachers. Sarah gets into a lot trouble because of her teacher's behavior, and the teacher and Sarah's friend seem to go out of their way to make things worse. I don't think they
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best thing about this book is the writing. The writing is so good that I couldn't stop reading. It's also a bit of a love letter to the books I used to read and loved when I was a kid. However, the book is also a very boring and shallow book. The story follows the story of a boy named Harry who is on his way to see his grandmother. He is on a mission to find the best in the world. When he arrives at the house he finds it's been taken over by the evil and evil looking evil witch who has taken over the house and all the servants. They have taken all the magic out of it. Harry wants to get the magic back so he can stop the evil witch. However there's one problem with this book. There are no real characters. The author has created Harry, the evil wizard and the evil sorceress but they're not people that I would want to hang out with. The other characters are very forgettable. They don't even have names. Harry is Harry and he's good. He wants to do the right thing. He's a good boy. He does good. The sorceress is the evil sorcerer and she is also good. She doesn't do evil things but she doesn't care for anyone and she's just a horrible person. However the author is very good at describing the world and the magic but it's very much a world of her own making. The book is very dull and boring. I could easily imagine it being one of those books where you just turn the pages because you're really interested in the characters. I just wasn't able to care about anything. This book is one of the worst I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worldbuilding is fantastic, and the magic system is unique, but the book is filled with unnecessary detail that doesn't help the story.  1. The Shadow Campaigns  by R.A. Salvatore In the first book in the Shadow Campaign series, R. A. Salvatiore creates a compelling and intriguing world with a compelling premise. He doesn't waste any time getting the reader invested in the world he's created. His writing is fast and energetic, and his description of the world is excellent. He does a great job describing the setting. I especially liked how he gave the cities a unique name. He has a great sense of humor, and he also has an eye for detail. I particularly liked how his worldbuilding was presented in a way that wasn't confusing. It's almost like he used the magic in the game to describe the history and culture of his world.  He doesn-t spend a lot of time explaining the history of the Darkside world, but this is understandable. If you don't know the history, it's hard to understand why there are such a large population of the same race. I think the D'ni are still the dominant force, but I'm curious to see what happens to the rest of the species in the series.  As a side note, I think that R. Salvatoore is a great author. His books are full of magic, intrigue, and action. I hope that his next book in this series will be even better.  In all honesty, the book was pretty good, but it was over long before I really got into it. It also suffers from the same problem as my previous review, and it's that the book spends way too much time with character introductions. I also have to complain about the ending. There's a very short epilogue that was supposed to be part of the main story, but was completely out of place. The story wasn't finished at all, and I'm wondering if the author will continue this series in the future.  I give The Shadow C- M  an 8 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ I was very excited to get this book, as it's my favorite of the collection. However, the book is a complete disappointment. It was a great idea, but I had a hard time getting through it. The characters were a little flat. The romance was very superficial. I'm sorry to say that the author hasn't improved since the first book. He's been given a good amount of free time, but hasn't done anything with it. I was going to give this book two stars, but then I started to feel sorry for the author and thought better of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book as much as I expected to. It's just not the type of book I enjoy. I like a book that is a little darker, and a little slower, and that doesn't have a lot of action, but I didn't find this to be any of these things. It was more of a story of growing up, of not knowing what to do with your life, of finding out what you really want. I liked it a lot. I enjoyed it more than I expected I would, and I will admit it made me feel a little less alone. I'll still read the other books in the series, but it's unlikely I'll finish them. One of my favorite fantasy authors is R.A. Salvatore. I loved his first book, The Raven Queen, but I also really liked his sequel, The Thorn of Emberlain, which was published in 2003. It tells the story of a young man who is a wizard, but is also very lonely, and goes off on a journey to find out what he wants to do.  His search takes him to the lands of the Farseers, a group of young people who are searching for a place in the world, but in the end find themselves lost and confused. I thought The Thorn was a good book, but the second book in the Raven Queen series, The Dragon's Path, was much better.  "I have been in this world, and it is not my home. It is a world of men and women of all colors and creeds, where we are all a bit lost. I have not the faintest idea what I want to be when I grow up. It doesn't matter. What matters is what happens to me."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book is a waste of time. It's not a fun read, and not very good, either. It doesn't really have any point or purpose, so it just kind of drags on. It is a very boring and repetitive book, but it's still better than the rest of the "mature" books I've been reading lately. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a train wreck. The characters were annoying, the plot was confusing and I couldn't get past the characters and their behavior. I just couldn't stand to read it. I wanted to jump out of the book and never come back. This book was awful and I would never recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best thing about this book is that it's written by a man, so it's not filled with the stereotypical, stereotypically male, stereotypally white, stereotypical male-dominated, stereotypical female-dominated dialogue and dialog, so that I can have more than a "boy meets girl, boy has feelings, boy falls in love" plotline, and I have no idea what's going to happen with that plotline. It is not a romance, but I like the premise, and the characters in it. I will have to keep an eye out for the next book in this series, and see what happens. Overall:    5 stars Summary:    When an angel offers to save the life of a man named Robert, Robert agrees, because he has never wanted anything more than to be alive. The angel then reveals that she is in fact a man; she is actually the angel who created the man, and that she has been trapped in a human body for a long time.  This book is filled with humor and a lot of heart.   Although this book does have a few parts that make you want to throw the book across the room, it does a great job of keeping the story from getting too ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good story, it's not a very good book.  It was fun for a while, but after a while it was a chore to read.  I will say that this is a very dark book. I was so sad when I finished this book, but it made me think about something I didn't know before I started reading this book. This book made me angry.   This story was about a man that was the "hero" of the book. He had a job, he had a family, he was a good person.  In the end, he is a dead man walking.  This is not what you want to read when you are reading a book about a hero.  The book's description for this man made him seem like a god.  It didn't take long for me to realize that the author made a mistake in describing the man.  He was not a god, and he didn't want to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  A terrible book. I'm sure this is the last book I'll ever read, and I'm already dreading the day I read a book again that I hated so much.   I'm an avid reader, I've read all the books in the Harry Potter series, I read the first three books of the Star Wars series and I just finished the first two books in a series I've been reading since middle school, but the first time I read this book, I was so disappointed.     This book is a mess. The pacing is way off. The book is broken up into a few chapters, and each chapter feels like it's about five to six pages. Each chapter takes place in a different place and has a different plot, but it's all very, very vague. The story is about Harry's struggle to get the information he needs from Dumbledore about a prophecy, and it's almost non-existent. It's only really about a year old at the end, and that's not much to talk about, and then it suddenly jumps to seven years old and suddenly we're talking about a "dark lord." I understand that the book was published in the 80's, but in today's world, the prophecy is written down and anyone can verify it. You could probably find out the prophecy in a few hours. It should have just said something about an "unbreakable vow" and then been out of the way, but no, the authors wanted to put the prophecy right in front of our eyes, which is just silly.   the characters are also kind of flat and one-dimensional, with not much development in any one character. There is some character development in the beginning, but then you have to slog through pages and pages to get to the good stuff. It is hard to relate to any of the characters. It seems like the authors just wanted to write about Harry and Hermione for once, but that's just it, they were trying to write an adventure story about Harry. So, if you're an adventure writer, you have some problems.   in short, a horrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The only bad thing I found about this book is that there is no information on how to use this book to create a "breathing" sound. I found that the book did not explain how to create the sound of breathing and I found it hard to create. The book doesn't seem to mention anything about the other types of sounds you can make with this book or how to make the other sounds. I would have liked to have seen a page of instructions about the various sounds and the steps to make them. Also, the booklet has some spelling errors. So I wouldn't recommend it as a first book on making sounds for kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to see what all the hype was about. I loved the title, the description, the characters. I couldn't stop reading. But the writing was terrible. It was like the author wanted to make his character as attractive as possible, but couldn't manage it. The story itself is boring and predictable. There is a point where I think the author was bored, and decided to do something out of his comfort zone. But in the end, he failed. I think I will not buy this book again. I feel I was cheated out of my money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is interesting, but the characters and their motivations don't make it memorable. It's too much focus on a single character, and his motivations are so weak. It was a good first book, but not as good as The Shadow War.   4 stars: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ was a great book about a boy who had a terrible life, but managed to make the best out of it. I enjoyed reading this book as it had a very interesting story. The characters are a bit unlikeable, but the story is well told. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this one in college and hated it. I had an awesome experience with a friend, but I couldn't stop thinking about this book, and the author. I wish I had known about it sooner.  The book is about a guy who is the "first" guy in a long line of guys that she wants to sleep with. He's so hot, he's the first guy that she sees that makes her heart skip a beat. So, she's ready to sleep around, but her friends don't think she'll go through with it. But, they are so jealous of her that they're willing to do whatever they can to make her stop. I mean, I think she's a very intelligent girl, so I don't see why she would go for someone so "simple." The book ends with a cliffhanger that I couldn`t wait to read again to find out what happens next. The book is only about 250 pages, but the plot is so complex and so much to think about. I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I knew it was the first of a series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have the time to read the book, you will not find anything good in it. The writing is too formal. I do not understand the use of grammar and spelling mistakes in the book. I also do not see any real action in the story. The main character is very boring and I think she is a character only in her name. I wish I could tell you that she is actually a real character, but she just is a pretty face. The story does not interest me in the least. The ending is very unsatisfying and I will not reread this book in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________ This book is one of the worst I have ever read. It took me over five minutes to read the first few pages and was only able to finish it because I have a severe headache and it gave me a very unpleasant headache. The story was so boring and predictable that I could see the author taking an hour or so to write it. If you want to read something bad, you should read something that is better than this book. I would give this book two stars because I did enjoy the characters, but this book is a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible, and I expected nothing less from the author of the series that it follows. The characters were all completely different, and the story wasn't really that good. The only thing I found entertaining was the author's sense of humor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book had no characters in it. It had no plot, no ideas, no story. I have a bad feeling about this book.  This book was the worst book I have ever read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a ton of friends who love the book. The plot is simple, and the characters are interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I really like the premise of this book. The premise is intriguing and the story is well done and told, but the characters aren't very well written. There is no one in particular that I think is a "bad guy" and everyone is just "bad" in their own way. The one that I thought was the most intriguing was the leader. He is the leader and has no real moral code and is willing to do anything for the greater good. He's a very likable character and the plot keeps me interested in it, but I can't help but wish he was a little more evil and "evil" is a hard word to come up with when it comes to people."   I liked the story and thought the premise was good. The characters didn't really make me interested and there weren't really any "bad guys". I thought there was a plot that kept me interested but the character development was lackluster. I liked the premise but would have liked to see a little better character development and a little less "evil".   Overall: 7.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------  I really liked this book but my favorite was not included. I like the idea that people have their own opinions about a subject. In this book they try to be nice to the aliens, but they don't like the aliens at all. It was just a waste of time. I don't know what I would have done with this book if I had read it first.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book at all. I'm not sure what I expected. I thought it would be about a girl who was abused by her mother, so when I read about a boy being abused by his father I thought, "Oh, she's a good example of how to be a good parent." Instead, it turned into a really boring story about a character I could care less about, a character who didn't seem to have any personality or redeeming qualities, and the author, who seemed to have no talent for writing, just couldn't come up with anything better to write about. It was a story that I just couldn the author write to a higher standard and this book is the product of a person who just doesn't know what to do with a good plot. There were a lot of problems with this book that just aren't worth reading: The fact that the author is using a male lead who is very abusive and neglectful in this book and that is why the parents are so unhappy. The fact the author doesn't give the readers a chance to empathize with the parents, or see the child as a real person. The way the author portrays the parents as having a child who has mental problems, who just needs a strong father to make him grow up and become a person. And the fact that there is no explanation of what the child does in the background, because the book is about the parents and nothing else. And there is just nothing positive in this story at all!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is too long. The pacing is a little slow. The plot is a bit too complicated. The character development is a tiny bit too much. There are too many characters. The ending is a very disappointing one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's the kind of thing that's so poorly written that I could barely get through the whole thing. The story is about a group of children from the future who are stuck in the past. There is a lot of action, but the main character is a complete jerk.  This is a pretty standard sci-fi book in that you're introduced to the concept and have a lot to do in the first half.  But then, halfway through, the story is dropped and you have to wait for the next book.   The ending is not well done either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ It is a sad day when a book makes you think, "why the hell am I reading this". This is a book about a very sad character. The author uses him as a foil and tries to make him likable but it is so far from that. He is not even likable. His personality is very sad and his past and the fact that he can't accept his own mistakes makes him unlikable. I just could not read this book. I have no idea what this man was thinking. The whole story about his father is so boring and boring and I found it so depressing that it made me want to read some other book about him, not this. I am a little disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book but it did not.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  I'm an avid reader of fantasy novels and this book was not as enjoyable as I'd hoped. The story is very slow-paced and boring. There are a lot of things that were missed. The main character is not a good protagonist and the writing style is very strange.   There are so many people in the world that are not as "magical" as the main character. Some of them were annoying. The book didn't feel very epic, or even close to epic, so it wasn't really interesting.  .  There were a lot more things that could have been done in this book, but I'm afraid I was spoiled by the "magic" part of the plot. I think the magic is overused. There were a few instances where it was very overused (and it really got to me), but I think that's a problem with the books as a whole, not just this book.   the main problem I have with this book is that it was too long and I just didn't like the pacing and the character development. There's also a lot to be said about the book's world building and I'm not quite sure what I think about it. Overall, this was a good fantasy novel, but it did not feel as epic as I had hoped.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book is a horrible waste of time. It's not a book that is going to keep you awake at night or that will keep you thinking, it's a book to be used as a jumping off point for some cheap thrills or to read while waiting in line at the post office. This book is not the kind of book I'm going to be recommending to anyone, not even a close friend. It is very poorly written, and I'm sure it is very hard to sell because it is not a good book. I'm just glad I didn't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful, so much so that it was difficult to believe that this was written by a graduate student in linguistics at a prestigious university. I was disappointed to learn that the book is actually a textbook on grammar, and not an actual work of linguistics. However, the book's title is misleading. It's not about grammar, it's about a certain kind of grammar. This is a textbook that is written for students who have just finished a grammar class and want to be able to teach this kind of material to their peers. The writing is pretty bad. There's a lack of understanding of how to actually structure sentences and a lackadaisical attitude towards the topic at hand. I understand that grammar is an important part of any language, but this is a book that doesn't really give a good overview of grammar, but rather tries to cram in a lot of grammar from different sources. It does not give any examples of the most important grammar rules, nor does it discuss the difference between the different grammatical structures. For example, the author talks about how the "subject-object-verb" system is a good way to describe how a sentence works. However in actual practice, I have not seen this system in use anywhere in the English language. I also have no idea how this author has arrived at the conclusions he has. For some reason, the "object-predicate-object" system seems to work really well. It has nothing to do with object-verb agreement, and nothing to with the rules of sentence structure. It just seems that the author wanted to use a system that was different from the common one. Overall, I thought this was a terrible book that is very hard to understand.   If you are looking for a grammar book, then this is probably not for you. I am not a native speaker, but even I couldn't understand much of the book. However if you are interested in studying grammar, I would recommend this book, as it does provide a good introduction to the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I was not expecting a deep psychological study. This is more like a psychological horror story. I think that the author was just trying to get readers interested, and didn't want to disappoint. However, the book didn't really live up to the hype. It was very short, and I had to stop reading because I was too tired. It didn't feel like I was actually reading a novel. This book had some good points, but overall it didn't work for me. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard about this book for a while before I actually got it, and had heard good things about it, but after reading the book, I just couldn't bring myself to read it. I didn't think it was bad, it just was a bad idea. I've read a lot of books by a lot different authors, and all the books I've been given were pretty good, but this one, it was just, ugh.  The whole thing just didn't click with me, it seemed like it was trying to be too many things all at once.   The whole thing seemed to just be a story of a guy and a girl who have an affair with each other and all kinds of other shenanigans and stuff that just doesn't work. I don't know, I thought it was a lot more fun to just read about the two of them, and then after the third or fourth chapter, I'd forgotten about it. It just wasn't my cup of tea.  So what is your favorite sex book?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to read by a friend of mine who has a large collection of horror stories.  The stories are very good and some of them are even scary.    I would have liked to have had a few more chapters in the middle where she got a bit more involved.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best book I've read in ages! The only downside is that I am having a hard time getting over the fact that this book came out in 2006 and it's been a while since I've been able to get my hands on a decent book in my local library.  I will definitely buy a copy for my collection!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very impressed with the quality of the book. The writing is clear, the images are beautiful, the details are vivid and I like the story.   It was an interesting, and very well written novel.  The only thing that bugs me is that they have given the characters in this book super powers that are very useful in the story, but they never use them.  They are a bit annoying at times, but I would have liked to see them use their power a bit more.  Overall, I would recommend this book to any fan of the Harry Potter series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________I like this book. I am not a huge fan of fantasy but I do enjoy them. This book is not fantasy but it has a good flow to it. It is a very good and well written book. The book is really interesting. I loved the characters. I was looking forward to what happens to them and they got it. The ending was a bit abrupt but I understood it was the ending they wanted. I did not enjoy the sex scenes but that could be my bias.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's a decent book, with some good ideas and great character development.  I found myself liking a couple of the characters, and I found the worldbuilding interesting.  It is a bit long and drawn out, but there's some nice, emotional moments in it that are worth the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I'd read this book earlier, I could have enjoyed it a lot more. I had expected to be blown away by the book and not really care for the plot.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as it could have been.  "A bad book is a good book.   The characters were interesting and the writing was good." The writing is interesting, but there were some glaring problems: 1)  There were times when I just stopped reading because I couldn't figure out what was going on.  It's a very long book, so the book has to make sense.  The author has an interesting idea for a world, but the book is so over-long that it's hard to follow along. 2)   I think the author just didn't think about how to write a book this long.  For a book that's so long, it feels a bit rushed.  I think a lot of the book could have had been cut out.  There's just so much to be said, but not all of it is said. 3)  There are a lot different POV characters, but I found it a bit confusing because I didn't feel connected to most of them.  Some of the POV characters are really compelling.  Other POV characters just felt really unconnected.  Also, some of the characters seemed really annoying.  In some ways, it felt like there were just too many characters, too many POV characters.  All of the women are just so irritating and uninteresting.  One of the main characters is a lesbian.  She just seems so whiny and self-righteous, and the way she acts in the book was really annoying and uninspired.  Her character seems to have the most development, but she is also the most irritating. 4)  This book is very slow paced.  A lot of things happen at once, and it felt very slow.  Most of the action scenes were in the first third of the story, and most of the character development happened in the second half of the novel.  At the very least, it would have been nice to see some of that character development earlier in the novel, instead of it being pushed to the end. "It's a good story, but a slow, ponderous one." 1.5 Stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********I bought this book based on the recommendation of a friend and the reviews were good. However, after reading this book I have to say that this book is horrible. I was so excited to read this book because I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work. I have read many of his books, including "Firefly" and "Serenity" and I loved them all. However this book was just horrible. The book starts off with a very short introduction where we see the characters talking about how it is good to be back on Earth and we also see a little snippet of what the next story is about. We also see the character of Angel who is one of the main characters and is also an author who lives in a very small house. He is also a really good guy who is the only one who knows what is going on in the house and why the characters are so messed up. The characters start out very well and have their good points and bad points but they do not get that much development and they really never learn much about what is happening in the story. I felt like the main character was so bland that you want to smack him to make him feel better. The other main characters are also very bland. Buffy is a very pretty girl who is kind of a little too cute. She is a bit of a tomboy and a bit reckless. She has a very sweet and shy side and she really loves reading. The rest of the characters all seem to have a pretty bad past and have a lot of problems in their life and their relationships. One character has a really big secret that she does not want anyone to know about but the others seem to be able to guess what it is. The only real character I like is Xander, but I think he is just there to make Angel look good.The book also has a lot to do with magic. I never understood why magic would be that big of a deal in a fantasy world, especially one that doesn't seem to really have much of one. The whole thing is just a bunch of plot holes and I just felt like I was reading something that I had seen somewhere else before.The characters are really boring. I don't think I have ever read a book with so few interesting characters. Every character is just so one dimensional that you really can't tell if they are good or bad. It also seems like the author had a lot going on that he couldn't put into this book so it all
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  I didn't really enjoy this book. I'm sure it's a good read for some people, but it's just not for me. I couldn't finish it. I kept having to put it down because I just didn't like it. The only good thing I can say about this book is the author's writing. The characters were so bland and I was just bored the whole time.   This book was boring, and boring is not a good thing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is bad. The characters are dumb. The writing is dumb. I didn't understand the point. I had to look up every line of dialog to figure out who did what. There were several parts that didn't make sense and that made me angry. I just felt like the author didn't care enough to really try and make the story work. Why was it written?  I don't know, I guess I could be accused of reading into it, but I just don't see how this story was anything but an attempt to get the author a book deal. This is an attempt at getting someone to publish a book.  A terrible book. I don't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ is not the book I was expecting from the description. _____________ was a great read but the characters in this book were all completely unlikeable and I felt like the book was written on a whim. ______________________________________________________________  I have read this book, and it was not a great book. I am a fan of the Dresden Files series, and I like the characters well enough, but this book was not the Dresden I had been expecting. The main character is an arrogant arrogant idiot with a big ego, who has a terrible relationship with his parents, and is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is. There was some interesting ideas in this, but the execution of them was terrible.   There was one scene that made me cry, and that was when one of the characters (who is a minor character, not a main one) was trying to find a cure for a cancer that his parents had. This was an incredibly important moment for the character, and the execution was so bad that it really made me think that he was an idiot. The character, while a bit sympathetic, is just an idiot who doesn't deserve to be in the story at all.   a negative thing that I would like to point out about this book is that I had to stop at about half the way into the book. It was just too much for me to handle. I was so sick of this book by then that I just wanted to stop.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ _______________ ______________ _________ ____________ The writing is terrible, I felt like a kid reading it again and again, it is like a bunch of kids in a basement. The ending is a sad joke, I'm sorry but the whole book was so bad, the author must have some mental problems or something, because it was so depressing and boring. I hope he never makes a book like this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, and it's been on my radar since I was a little kid. I've read other reviews with similar complaints about it, but I'm not sure I can make them any more valid than that. The author uses a lot of clichés and cliches in the first third of the book. However, after that it gets better, and really does make the book stand out, which is what the title and the description are trying to say. The characters are interesting. The story is good, but the ending was rushed and made me feel cheated. I'd recommend it to people who are interested in dystopian science fiction. Overall:  5.5 stars. If you're a fan of science fiction and think you might like this book I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did. I give it 4.5/5 stars, which I feel is fair. If you're not a fan, but still want to read it, I would recommend not going to the beginning, because it is so repetitive. Also, if you think that a book is too long, I think it's because it's about 10,000 pages long. "My father has been a student of the world's religions and philosophies, and is not averse to reading about the latest in the science of the mind. He says the more you know, the more possibilities you can envision. I suppose that's what science fiction is all about. The world is full of possibilities, but you don't know what you'll be able to do until you try." -R. Buckminster Fuller "The most exciting thing about the universe is that it has no beginning or end." -"H. G. Wells "It is only when the mind has accepted that there is no such thing as fate, and no such things as good or evil, and that all men are equal in the eyes of the law, that it is free to pursue any kind of enjoyment." –Ayn Rand "Man is an accidental creator, the only being in the universe who has ever created anything. But that is no reason to allow him to make things out of nothing, or to condemn him to misery and starvation." "There is no law which forbids us from being human beings. It is our duty to learn to be human." This is a review of a book. I'm a fan.  I hope this book has
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the Holocaust. This book is filled with horrible propaganda about the Nazis. The book states that the Germans were innocent and were fighting the war for the Jews. The author states that he has never been anti-semitic and that he only wrote a book about his experience. I don't understand how he could write a book with lies and propaganda about what the Germans did to the Jews and the Holocaust if he was a "Holocaust denier". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad I listened to this book. It was a long time coming, and it's an interesting read. The first half was a little confusing. I had trouble figuring out what happened in the second half of the book, but then it all made sense. I think the ending was really good. I was really sad when I finished this book because I was sad for the characters. I would love to read more of this series. I know it's a long wait, but I think it'll be worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ __________________________ _________________________ ___________________________  "One of the best books I have read since I read about the early life of Jesus. There is much in this book about the ways of the Jews, the ways that God works in the world, and the ways God has worked in the past. I was surprised that this book was written in the middle of the 20th century, since that is when I first began reading about the life of Christ. This book is a very good one and I recommend it to everyone who has any interest in this subject."   ____________________________ ____________________________  Review by: EJ S   I'm a huge fan of the Gospels and I've read many books on the Gostophagi and the Life of Christ in general. This was the first time I read this kind of history in the original language. I loved it, and I am very glad to see a publisher publishing this book.   It's a great read!   _________________________________________________________________  Reviewer: D   One of those "how did it get this bad" stories.  The first paragraph says it all: "In the year 35 A.D., the city of Jerusalem was in turmoil, with a general uprising by the Jews against Roman rule. The Jews had been a highly organized people for generations, but a revolt against Rome was not just an ordinary affair. For decades the Jewish population had been kept under constant siege, and when the city fell to the Romans in 69 A. D., a great many of the Jewish survivors fled the country to the east and the west. For the next 1,000 years, the Jews lived under the yoke of the Roman Empire, often in a state of virtual servitude."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good book, but it suffers from the "bad book syndrome" that is all too common. The author seems to have a very strong belief that people need to be given a free hand in how to read the text and that is a big reason why it has been difficult for me to get through the book. In addition, the author seems prone to making things sound simple when they are anything but. For example, when the author tells us that the Bible is "an amazing and miraculous record of God's dealings with humanity," he then immediately says, "The Bible does not tell us anything we don't know already." I would be willing to bet that there is nothing in the Bible that we don the reader that the author does not know already. However, the Bible does tell us a great deal about God's people, who are called "The Church of Christ," as well as the church at large, the Church of the Nazarene, the Roman Catholic Church, and even other religions, such as Buddhism and Islam.  It tells us about God as He is manifested in the world through the people who are His Church. Â It also tells us, through the actions of Jesus, the person and work of God, and the Bible tells us what the ultimate goals and end for the people of God are. What I am saying is that the idea that the authors of this book have, is that it is a book about the "history" of the "Church of Christ" is not very accurate.  What it really is about is a collection of stories and stories that they believe were "historically accurate" but which did not have a historical basis, at least not historically speaking.   I found the idea of the authors having a "history book" to be very disheartening.  To be fair, I did not come across many of the historical facts that the book claimed it had, but then again, I didn't really have to.  I found the narrative to be a little shallow, at times.  However, this is not really a problem because there are some interesting stories that are told in this book, especially about people and events that I had never heard of before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a long time fan of this series, and finally I finished this book, though it was very much worth the wait.   This is the first in the series that I haven't enjoyed, and I'm not sure I want to continue on in the rest of them.  I will say that I did really like the artwork.  It was well done, and not a huge problem for me, but I felt the plot was just a bit too slow to me.  The characters are well written, and the romance in this book was well written.  There's a reason this book got a 5/5 rating, because it's a good book, but there are things in it that make it a little less enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I can't stand the concept of reading about a world that is completely fictionalized. The whole idea of a world based on a real place is a good one, but in a book like this one I just can't believe there's a real-world location called the Dark Continent. I mean, come on! The entire plot, from the introduction to the end, was a complete and utter waste of time." What a complete waste of my time! And the ending was a total letdown, so I'm giving it 2 stars. So, I'm going to keep this short because I'm only one chapter short, so please review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a good book. It's just bad. I'm just not a fan of the style of writing or the characters. I don't know how this book got published. It doesn't seem like a real book, so I guess this is how they sell it. It is a collection of short stories, but most of them don't have a story to them, but rather a one-liner. And, the characters are just so...stupid. They are really boring, and I don´t really care for them. The story was so bad that I don`t know how I could ever read it. I wouldn't recommend this book, even to a friend. Rating: 1/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The story is good but the character development is awful." I don't know how else to say it. She's a good girl who wants to be a good detective. And, for some reason, she's just never found the courage to do that. I liked her as a character, but I'm not sure she's ever developed as a heroine in the books I've read. I like her as an innocent girl, but she's never come to terms with her past, her fear of being judged. I think her relationship with her father is one of the most interesting ones, and the author really nails the tension that develops between them. It's a short book and I don 't think it would make much sense for a long series. If you want to read a good book about a girl with a dark past, give it a try. "This is a very entertaining and well-written book. It is a little short but that is due to the fact that it's really good."  This is one book I've had on my "to read" list for quite a while. It was recommended to me by a friend, so I took a chance. This book is very dark and violent. I don' t think there's anything subtle about the book. The language is graphic, the violence is brutal, and it's a thriller. The characters are just plain awesome and the world building is amazing. I'm going to keep reading because I really do like it, but for now, I'll pass it up. The world building in this book is just amazing. The world is huge and the characters have been given enough depth that I'm willing to overlook the story's flaws. This one is definitely one I'll be reading for a while, especially the second book in the series. It's hard to get an accurate picture of a book's quality until it's been read. It can be a little tricky to figure out if a book is good or not, because, sometimes, even though it's good, you just can't put your finger on it. So, when I say this book was good, I really mean good. The story was good. And the characters were good. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dark, violent, mystery, and suspense, especially since it's not the longest book I' ve read in a long time. I recommend it to everyone, even if you're a fan of the dark
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ (If the book was bad enough, then the author was too.)  "I read a lot of books, but only because I'm lazy and want to pass time on the weekends. I can't remember the last time I finished a book. Maybe a good book is a bad thing."   This book has an interesting premise. A guy has to go on a journey to recover from a horrible accident. However, he is being followed. The main character is a bit of a loner, but he gets a lot out of his adventure. It has an intriguing plot and good characters. The writing is not perfect, but the writing is good enough for the story.   The bad things:  The main character. His past and his behavior are confusing at first, but it doesn't take too long to get used to. His lack of motivation is one of the most common problems with the main character, but this is something that is not as easy to fix as you think.  : I'm not sure how to summarize a novel about a loners with a strong point of view, so I'm just going to try to sum it up in a few words:The main plot is about a guy, who has been in a terrible car accident. He has a few hours to live and wants to get out of the hospital. So he takes off in a motor scooter and goes around the world, and discovers the world is a lot different than he imagined. He meets a lot people, has a lot to think about, and is in danger of being left behind, because he's the only one that has the ability to travel through time. He finds a group of people that have the ability (and are willing to pay the price), and he finds out how important time really is. The book has a good balance of comedy and drama, and a lot goes on. The characters are interesting, the story is engaging, and there are some really cool locations.The characters are a mixed bag. The loner is interesting because he is the one who discovers the true meaning of the word 'loner' and what it means to be alone. I thought it was a little hard to understand, but I'm pretty sure that he would have been much more understandable if he had been a bit more fleshed out. He is a good character, though. I think he could have been a little more flamboyant. The group of l

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This is the kind of book where you get a vague sense of a story or theme, and then you find yourself bored. But that's not a bad thing because this isn't a book for people who like to read. It's a book that needs to be read on the train ride home, or maybe just before bed. A great book, though."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to believe a book with such an incredible story could be so awful. The author's use of the word "rape" was used for a sexual crime. The book was a work of fiction and it did not take a great deal of imagination to see the protagonist being raped. I think the author thought she was writing a realistic, non-fiction book. It turned out to be a work with no plot, just the rape. 3. The Good Soldier:    A very good book. The writer has a lot of ideas about military service, about the dangers of the job, and about the values of a man in uniform. I liked the main character very much.  I didn't see any real harm done to the protagonist.  4. The Unseen World:    This book is about a woman who has lost her mind. She sees what is going on in the world, but cannot believe it. It's a book about how the world can be a horrible place, but the people who live in it can be very good people. I didn't know how to like this book.   5. The Shadow's Daughter:  It's been years since I've read a book. But I remember reading about this book at the time, which was called The Shadow. I found it to be very interesting, but also a little confusing. The plot was not very good. It was a very short book. I can't remember much about it, but I'm thinking it might be a sequel to The Shadow, which I have yet to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I have been reading this book since I first got my hands on it. The writing is very good. The narrator does an excellent job. There is nothing that is terribly wrong with the story. The only thing that was a bit off about the story was the ending. The ending was very abrupt, and made the entire book a little bit dull. I wish there had been a little more explanation for what happened. The plot is interesting, and will keep you on the edge of your seat." -Kathryn D, NY "I'm in love with this book, the characters are real and the story is moving, the action scenes are intense, and there is just so much going on that it keeps you reading for days on end." -Kristin C, TX
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Last year, I had the pleasure of attending the "A Celebration of the English Language: A Celebration of Shakespeare's Plays" at the American Theater in St. Louis. There was one Shakespeare play that I wanted to see in particular, but it was the production of "King Lear" that drew me in the most. As the title implies, Lear is the most famous play in English literature, and the reason it is so popular is the simplicity and brilliance of the storytelling. Lear's most tragic moment comes in his final scene, when he is forced to accept his death. I was fascinated by the fact that the show went with the Shakespearean tragedy, with its tragic heroes and tragic villains, in favor of a comedy. The show was amazing. The characters were so complex and developed, but the story was so simple. It is so easy to tell a story, but to do so in the form of a play is an art. It was a wonderful experience to watch the show, and I'm glad that I went to the show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's a great story and a good story and it's also a great mystery. However, I can't really say it's a good read for a young adult. The plot is a little vague and not particularly well-written, and it feels like the author is trying to be "adult" and it doesn't quite work. There are some really great moments but a lot of the writing is a bit awkward. I'm pretty sure I got the impression that the book would be a good book for a younger audience.  It's hard to say whether the author tried to be adult but it's just not a good experience. I would recommend this to any young adult and to any people who have read a good mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "It's a matter of perspective. We are all born in a world that is at once our own and that of our ancestors, but at the same time it is an alien and hostile world, with all the horror of a nuclear winter on one hand and the violence and corruption of a war zone on the other. We need a way of seeing this alien world as a source of inspiration and of wonder and inspiration. And the answer is to discover, in some form or another, the story of our own world, which is both an alien, hostile, and a story worth telling."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book, it was a poor translation of the original Chinese. The grammar was sloppy and awkward, the sentence structure was weird, the tone was forced and the characters were flat. There are a lot of typos in this book. The translation itself was quite good though. The plot is boring and unoriginal and the only thing it did was to make me think I was reading a Chinese novel, but I can't believe I actually liked it, but it was the translation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a well-written book, and very easy to understand. The author does a nice job of explaining things without being too verbose. The book also makes some very good points about the use of statistics, the power of a good story, and the importance of taking responsibility for your actions. However, as a whole, I found this book a little lacking. The problem is that there were a lot of questions that I just couldn't get an answer to. The story seemed to go on forever. For example, I wanted to know what happened to the old lady who wrote the letter and why it never got published. Was she crazy? Did she make a big mistake? I just didn't get it. I think the author could have been a little more descriptive about the various things she described.   Also, the story is very slow-moving, and I don't think I can recommend this book to people who have already read the books by Paul Ferris.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was a little disappointing. The ending was predictable, and there were a lot of unanswered questions in the ending. The characters didn't grow in the way I'd like them to grow. The romance was not that interesting, and the book was not funny, at least for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********************   The plot was really a bore to me. I am really a sucker for the love triangle aspect of romance and it was nice to see it being used to bring some light and drama to the story. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of either. It was very predictable that things would end up like this. I didn't care about the love triangles but I think that they were kind of a distraction to the plot.   Characters: The characters are kind of one dimensional. I really thought the characters were just there to provide drama. I liked how they were portrayed though.   a few things I would change:  1) I liked the fact that it seemed to be going into a bit of a darker place, however, I feel like it could have been more intense. It kind of felt like we were just getting a little more of what was going to be happening.  2) I think there was some bad language used.  a few more things I really liked:  in a book where you get to see a lot of different people, I liked seeing some of the character's quirks.   The plot: I thought this book did a good job at showing a lot about the world and characters. The ending was pretty satisfying.  : The plot was very linear. There wasn't really a lot happening. I feel that if the plot wasn't so very predictable, it would have been better. The only character I really didn't like was the one who had a bad habit of calling people by their first name. I just don't understand why she does it. She just seemed a little out of place in the book. Also, I really enjoyed seeing all of the characters, especially the ones that are introduced and then leave. The characters in this book were interesting and I wish they would have stayed in the story more. I like the romance aspect of this book. There is a lot going on in this one and I liked that it was really going to give us a deeper look into the world. The book was also very well written. I also like that there were many different genres that were explored. The fact that you don't really get a ton of information about the plot makes this a great read for those who want a little something different. I think the only thing that I don't like about this book is the fact it was very short. It should have been at least twice as long.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a terrible book, and I hate to admit it, but that's exactly how it feels to me. It's a terrible story that just doesn't make any sense and doesn't give any satisfaction to the reader. I don't know if it's a writer's block, or if it was a poor decision on the author's part, but I can't see myself finishing it, especially when I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have always enjoyed reading science fiction.  This book had me really interested and wanted to know more about the story.  Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to finish it.  The story is good, but the author should have focused more on developing the characters.  This was my first book by Robert J. Sawyer and I think I enjoyed it more than my first read of the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book by Sawyer.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that this book sucked. I read it because I was bored, and that was the end of that.  It's a little too short to be really enjoyable. The only reason I still read this book is because I'm trying to get my hands on the other two books in the series: "The Lost Empire" and "The Broken Empire".  The third book is about the time when the Starks are going to be reunited, so it's a good jumping off point, but "A Storm of Swords" is the worst book in the entire series, and I've read way better books than that one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not going to lie, I was a bit annoyed with this book. This is one of those books where I feel I got what I paid for. It's really a nice read, but there are some things I couldn't get over. First off, there are so many times that I found myself getting lost. It felt as though I was in a different book and not the one I'm in right now. I know it was meant to be a mystery, but the lack of a map/map-descriptions really threw me off. Another thing is that it's a bit unclear how much of the plot is based on real-life events and how much is fictional. I felt as if the story was based on a true story and I didn't understand why it was fictional. In addition, there is a lot of sex. I mean, really. This book isn't bad, it's just...I don't know. I don't think I've read a book where there is so much sex. It would have been nice if it was less in-your-face, but it's there. I just don't feel like it's appropriate in this type of book. In short, it felt like I was reading a book that was meant for younger kids, but I wasn't sure about the story. I can't say it's the worst mystery ever, but if you're expecting a good read, this book may not be for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in two sittings. I found the story interesting and the writing enjoyable. The story is well told, however, the ending left me disappointed and the ending was not a surprise. I really enjoyed the characters and the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a really good read, but not as good as it should be. The writing is really good, the plot is good, but it's so cliche that it's a bit boring. The story is about a group of college students who are going to a secret party that the group knows about. The party is held in a private residence and everyone but the group is invited. They go, and they meet a couple of different couples that have an argument at the party. They also meet the mother of the couple that had the argument. It's a typical college story, where there's an odd group of people and it's about them getting together and having an interesting party. The only thing I would change is that the two characters that were supposed to be a couple were never given any development whatsoever. They never had a scene together and then they just disappear. It would have been nice if the story was more about the actual party. Other than that, it's an enjoyable read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't stand this book. It's about a child who has to leave his orphanage and become a street urchin to survive. The story is interesting and has a plot line that keeps me interested. But the writing is terrible.    It's hard to get past the first few pages because they are so poorly written. It doesn't help that the book was written in the 1950's and has been out of print for years.  This book was published in the 1960's and it's hard for me to believe that a child in the 50's could be so terrible.  The book was also published in a small number of hardcover and paperback editions. I have the hardcover edition and it is much nicer than the paperback.   The book has been reprinted several times, I believe the last time was in 2007.  I just finished reading the sequel "The Longest Journey". It's another fun book about a boy with special needs who lives in a special school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is very clear in his message and I agree with his advice. This book can be helpful to those of us with a high IQ who feel as though we are not very bright and need to be smarter. But it can be a disappointment to the less intellectually capable. The author seems to be telling them that they are not really as smart as they think they are. I found this book to be very difficult to follow. I feel as if I could have done a better job of explaining my reasoning and my understanding of the concepts. If you feel that you are not smart enough to understand these concepts, you will likely find this book useless. I am also a skeptic and I would recommend this book for that. But for those of you who are more intellectually capable and are able to comprehend these concepts without a lot of confusion and confusion, this book is definitely worth reading.  9 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry, but this book is horrible. This book is filled with poorly written nonsense that has nothing to do with the topic of the book. I can see why this book was so popular, but if you're expecting a story of the future, this is not it. The main character is a genius with a talent for computers and an extremely high IQ. In the first chapter, we meet her at a dinner party, where she tells a story about how she came up with a method to use computers to read her mind. The book's theme is based on a technology called "Brain-Computer Interface", and the story seems to be based on the concept of brain-computer interface. This is what I'm looking for. I have no idea what is going on in this book. It was a very fun read but the writing was terrible. I couldn't even keep up with the story. I'm going to give this book 2 stars because I liked the concept and it had a good premise. But the writing is terrible and it ruined the book for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but it was just too long and boring for me. I felt like it could have been shorter. The characters are too similar to each other and none of them seem very unique. I think it would be more interesting if the characters were all of a certain age, and a new girl comes into the school.   The plot was also pretty lame, but I think the book was meant to be a one-shot. I was really looking forward to seeing the new girl's reaction to the boys in the school, but nothing ever happens. This book should have ended with a cliffhanger.   of course, this book is not perfect. I am sure there will be more books where this book takes place, and maybe I'll like them better than this one. However, I was disappointed by this book and I would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is a bit thin, and the characters are boring and not that interesting, except for the main character, who is a total psychopath. I liked the book the first time I read it, but the sequel made it much worse. The main character is supposed to be a good person, but it's so obvious that he is a psychopath that I don't even know why I am reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as an introduction to the world of a new religion called Numerology.  What I got instead was a bunch of nonsense with no depth, no logical argumentation, and no real sense.  I had to stop and re-read the first chapter of the book three times to be sure I was reading it correctly.   The first chapter begins with an introduction of a bunch  of characters who are described as "The Sixteen," each of whom was given a unique numerical value based on the number of angels surrounding their body (1 through 12).   This number system is supposed to correspond to a person's birth, as well as the number that appears on a person in the Book of Life.  I was told that the Sixteen were chosen by a special God called "The Angel of the Lord."    It should be obvious that a religious organization would want to be as close to God as possible.  In addition to a bunch of people who have a specific numerical value, the book tells you how each number corresponds to the next in a series.  This is all well and good, but when it comes to actual numbers, you don't know what you're getting.  There are multiple examples where numbers are explained in terms of the numerical value of their letters.  For example, the first page states that there are "Two Numerical Equations, each corresponding to one of the angels.  [1]  Each equation has a value that corresponds to a letter.  One equation is called the number equation for the letter A, the other the number for the number 6."  The whole thing is a mess.  The author spends a lot of time describing the "Numerology" of each number and then never actually explains what the numbers mean.  It's almost like they were trying to make the whole thing sound more scientific and rational.  All this was a major distraction from what the actual book was about.  And the most confusing thing was that the author had to go out of his way to say that there was no actual science in the whole book, but he also had to make it seem like there was.  At one point he says, "Numeric numbers are used to organize a person into a certain group."  But, as I already explained, there's no such thing as a person.  To use a number to "organize a person" is completely arbitrary and has

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I have not finished reading this book. *********** This book is soooooo boring, I can't wait for it to end.  The characters are so stereotypical.    I mean, look at all of the boring stereotypes they come up with:  the smart, ambitious girl who gets in trouble at school because she's so smart;  who is so self-reliant she gets a job working at a gas station because she is so smart and independent;   who is so intelligent she's in her class all by herself at school and doesn't need anyone to help her because she has no friends;  The author is also so boring:   He's a good looking young man, but his writing style is so boring and not interesting.  I'm just a huge fan of sci-fi and read this book because I'm really interested in the author's other books.  He has a few good stories but this book is just boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all: it's a tale about two girls, two girls who can't seem to get a man to notice them. I'd like to say it's about the difficulties of being a teenager, but really it's just about two sisters who are too nice to get into fights and too dumb to actually talk to anyone. It's a really long book, about 150 pages.  I can't recommend it, because it's really not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a terrible book. I'm sure if you can read it in a week, it would be good. I was a huge fan of the books in the series, so I was excited to read this one. I had no idea how much the characters would be changed. The main character, Tom, is so boring, his family is the worst and I really did not care about them. His family is very annoying and I hated the fact that the author has to introduce all of them before I really got to know them. I did find it interesting that there was no explanation for the disappearance of Tom's mother and father and why they were suddenly gone. It was very confusing to me. I really hated Tom's parents. I wish the series was about a boy who was bullied, was the victim of a murder and was in love with a girl who was the love of his life. I thought the book was terrible. I don't know why I kept reading, but I just couldn't stand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most boring thing I've read all year. I got a free copy through a giveaway on Goodreads, and I had to wait until after I read it before I could actually tell it was bad.  I have to give the author props though, for making this a mystery.  It's a mystery, but it's a poor mystery. This is the first book in the series that has anything to do with the murder mystery genre.  There's a bit of a mystery element, but the author spends most of the book trying to explain it away.    It's not just the writing that's a problem.  It really bothers me that the author's only real love is sex and the way she talks about sex is so disgusting.  When she talks, it comes across as so much sleazy.  One of my favorites was when she talked about how she "had a hot date" with a guy and wanted to be a model.  I laughed so hard I cried.  That's the way it's written.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read in the last few years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book was a complete waste of time. The book is written in the first person from the perspective of a teenager in a small town in South Dakota. The story starts out about how his family was killed when he was a kid, and how he became a police officer. It then starts out on how he and his brother became famous as bounty hunters, but then the story gets a little too far into the details of who actually killed who, and why, and that is when it became a really boring story. The writing is really boring, and the ending was pretty lame, and just left me feeling disappointed." "This book has more to offer than a book from the 1800s." Rating: 1.5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ This book, however, was just a waste of time. It is nothing but a "wasteful book" with no real content, or really even plot at all. I was so angry I wanted to just stop reading after I finished it. The characters were bland and uninteresting, the story itself was just too generic, and the author has a terrible writing style. I will not be recommending this book to anyone.   5 of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have been a fan of Janny Wurts since I first read her The Mists of Avalon in college.

The author is trying to make the main character a heroine, but she is a complete bitch. I wish I had never read this book.

I'm glad that I read it, but I don's t think I will buy the book or listen to the audio book.  13 of 15 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "There are a lot of books on the market about life and love and success and romance. The thing is, the book never really delivered on any of these promises.

As she approaches her, she turns around and starts kissing her. The woman is taken aback and says something like, 'It's not like that,' but the girl says 'No, it is. I'm sorry. I just want you to know I love you.' And she kisses her again. It's a very sweet moment, but it's also an extremely awkward moment." 5.

There are several books about her, many movies, lots of merchandise, and the internet is abuzz with discussions of whether she's really a hero or a villain.  "This is a book of mystery, of secrets, of lies and lies and more lies, of the fact that the girl is a secret, and that's part of her appeal. She's an incredible girl. She has no one else, so she's in a position where you can't know everything about her. She doesn't really like being known." 8. A Game of Thrones by George R.R.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book! I read it a few months back, when it came out in paperback. I have always loved the stories of the men and women who were involved in the battle of Waterloo, and this book was just as much a history of that battle as it was of the war itself.  It's written very well, very interesting history, and the author did an excellent job. ________________________________________ If you haven't read the story of the Battle of Waterloo yet, I highly recommend that you read it.  The Battle of Napoleon's Death    It is said that one of the greatest and most feared generals of the time, Napoleon Bonaparte, was assassinated by a young man who was angry with the way the Emperor was treating his brother Joseph.   It's hard to say if this story is true, but it's interesting, nonetheless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this book on a long weekend trip. I don't have any complaints about the book, it was just a bit confusing and I wasn't totally in the mood for the romance plot. I also have a small gripe with the plot as I thought there was a bit of a disconnect between the main character, a girl named Chloe and her best friend. However, I am a bit skeptical of the romance aspect, but I guess if I had read this in a different format I may not have had such an issue. It's a short read so I can't really give a really good review about it. However it's a fun read and I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. This book is full of cliches. It has nothing to say and it lacks a story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the first half of this book hoping that it would give me some insight into my own life. The second half, however, is a nightmare. The character I care about is dead, her daughter has to cope with her mother's actions, her husband is abusive, and there is no resolution. I have no interest in reading another book by this author, she's a good writer but this book was an exercise in wasted potential.  It was not a good ending to a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  This book is a mess. The author, Robert Littell, takes an unoriginal approach to the issue of race relations. The book is full of bad history and poorly reasoned statements. It is not an easy read to read. The whole thing is a waste of your time. I would recommend the book only to a person who does not have a background in the topic, who has no interest in the subject, and who wants to hear what others have to say about the topic.   Readers of this book should avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a decent story with a good premise, but it never really gets going. I have read about three or four other people's reactions to the book (including one that had a great review), and they all have a similar theme. It's a book that takes a long time to get going. The first time I read it, it seemed like it would take me about half an hour, and then it would be all about the characters and the plot. It took me three and a half hours. And that was on the hardest difficulty setting. And there were some sections where it was so slow I got antsy. I'm also not really a fan of fantasy. I really just don't like fantasy. But this book, for me, is so good. It is so well done, and so thought out. I can see myself reading this over and over again, and it's got everything I want in a book, but I just can't seem to put it down. I'll definitely pick it up again. It may be the best fantasy book I've read so far this year. I don't know what I'd do without it. 9/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those books that is so poorly written and poorly edited that I found myself wanting to tear it apart and start all over again.  I was so bored by it I thought I would just read another book that is better, so I purchased the Kindle version instead.  The story revolves around a man who is being tormented by a ghost and the ghost wants him to kill himself so he can go back to the past.  This story has nothing to do with the original story and is just an excuse to get the author more money.  I found the book to be a poorly written, boring, poorly edited, poorly plotted book with little to no plot.   I was really hoping this book would be better.  The author is clearly a bad writer and has no idea how to tell a story.  It's like he is trying to be George R. R. Martin, but all he wants is money. I am going to give this book two stars because I do like the original book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- (It's not good) I liked this book because it's about the book of the same name, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the book is really just not good. The book is not well written, the story is not very interesting, the characters are boring and the plot is just confusing. The ending was really strange and it left me confused. The only thing good about the story are the parts of it I like: The ending, the first book, the main character's growth, the "bad guy" (I mean really bad), and the way the story was described in the book. I'm sure there are better books out there but if you like the books of the Harry Potter series, you will love this book.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a book that has no merit. This book is not about what happens to a body when one dies, but rather how one can use death to benefit oneself. The author writes about "the true death", which is the real death and the true resurrection, which is what happens after death, as if it is an illusion. What is a "real death"? The author says that "a real death is a complete death" (p. 8). He explains how to achieve this by using the four methods of meditation. First he explains that the practice of "attaining true death" is based on the practice, or the "path" or the path of "the way of death". It involves the four practices: meditation, walking meditation, the method of counting and the "eightfold path" (which he also explains, but I will not go into detail here). After that, he explains how this process can lead one to the "true resurrection", which he says involves the "realization" (page 9). In his words: "When we realize the true death we have reached the real resurrection." The real death involves death, but the true revival is not death but a new life, which he describes as "real resurrection". There is a lot of bad writing and bad ideas here, but that is what I found in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book is that it's not a good book. This is a book about a young woman who wants to go to the mountains and become a ranger but her father wants her to become a priest. She can't figure out what he means and when he's talking about the gods she thinks "well that's fine, but he didn't tell me about the spirits". I think the author is trying to make her into a good girl who wants the world to be like the one in her books. I'm not sure if I liked this book or not, but I was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was hard to put this book down. I was not in love with the story but I did like the character of the boy who is obsessed with the book and who thinks that he is a real person. The plot was pretty predictable and not that original, but the characters were very charming and the characters in the book had real lives that they had to deal with. The story was not a bad read but it was hard for me to put down. 4.5 out of 5 stars   This book is so good and so fun to read. This is a book that you will want to read over and over again and again. The main character is the main character. He is a lovable and kind hearted boy who loves to read and to be around his family. I loved how he was able to talk to his mom and dad about the book that he had read. It was fun to see how he dealt with the situation and the things that happened. As a side note, I was surprised to find out that this book was made into a movie. I really liked the movie and it is a fun movie to watch, but it is still a bit different than the book. I thought the film was great though. I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a good read. I do recommend that you do not get this book if you are not a fan of books. I had no problems with the writing but the book was definitely different than what the book is supposed to be. 5 out 4 stars  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  My last book purchase:  - This was my first book purchase and I must say that I'm not a huge fan of audiobooks, so the audiobook version of this book was a bit disappointing for me. But I'm sure that's just a matter of personal taste. I think the narrator did a great job in bringing out the atmosphere of the book, but I can't say I liked any of the characters that I encountered in the book. I thought that the narrator could have been a bit more subtle in bringing those characters to life, but then again, it's the narrator's job to bring out the book's atmosphere, so I'm ok with that. I will say that the book is not a bad read, I found it to be a fun read and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of a good mystery.

I liked the ending, but I still feel like this is a mediocre book. Overall: ------------- 5.5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most boring book I have ever read!  There are too many plot holes and just way too many problems with the plot.  This book is basically a collection of ideas, a bunch of random ideas thrown together in a random way.    The only interesting part of this book is that they try to have a "science" aspect to the book but it is so stupid and unnecessary.    It has to be a science book because it talks about some new technology but then it just ignores it all.  They do an excellent job at setting up the book and explaining what is going on in it but the way they do it is just so bad it just doesn't make sense.  In the end, it just seems like they tried to put in some new idea but they just had way too much going on and then just ended up going "oh well".
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It was boring. I liked the book a lot but I had no interest in the characters and didn't care about the story. I had to stop reading about 10 minutes into the book because I felt like I was being kept in suspense. The characters were all just flat and boring. The author had a very bad way of writing. There were no characters that really made me think, feel or care about what they were doing. The writing is pretty much flat and predictable. If you like books with a good plot and a good storyline, this book is worth reading. If not, you're better off skipping it and going to your local library.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I don't like reading bad books. I know this is supposed to be the worst book in the world, but this is a terrible book. It has no plot, no characters, and no reason to exist. There is a woman in a wheelchair who doesn't want to die. She can hear, but can't speak, so her brother gives her an electronic hearing aid. It is a great idea, but she doesn't use it. She just says what she needs to say, and that's it. When she is on her deathbed, she tells the brother she loves him, but it's all in her head. She's still a bad person, and her brother is a jerk. This book is bad.  The Good: The brother and sister who have to get the boy and get him back to the house. The two best characters: the woman in the wheelchair and the boy. I loved the story. The only thing I don  My parents gave me this book because I loved it in middle school. I was only reading it because my mother was going through the same thing. I didn't think it was bad. It wasn't bad, it was just...I don't know what to say. I thought it was kind of a good book. I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was kindof hard to put down. It took me longer to finish than I thought. It had good writing. The story was really great. I felt a little bit bad because my parents were going through a similar thing. But, this is not a bad read at all.   I have read about a million reviews on this book, and every time I read the review I get a little teary. I don' t read reviews very often, so I'm not sure if it's my mom or if I'm just not that good of a reader. I have to say that I am not very good of reading reviews.   to start out the book, we have our main characters, Sam and Susan. Sam is the brother. He is 14 years old. Susan is the mother. She is 21 years old, and she is the best daughter a brother could ever have. Sam goes to school and is really good at his homework. His grades are really good, he does well in school. He's the leader of the team in school, and his dad, Sam's uncle, has been teaching him about life
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say this book was a disappointment. I was so excited to read this one because I've been waiting for a long time for the next book in the series. The book is about a guy named Harry, who was born with two different sets of abilities. He is the 'normal' one, and has the power to teleport. He doesn't do much except talk about his abilities, but he seems to be able to do some pretty cool stuff. He meets a girl named Amy and they end up in a magical relationship. The other part of his powers is that he can be invisible. He has to use the other half of his ability to be invisible, but it's not very good. Amy can't see him, and the book seems to make that clear from the beginning. This book is very much like the first book, with the same type of character and setting, except that it's much less exciting. It's hard to care about Harry and Amy because the story is very dull and not really that interesting. I don't know what it is about the series that I like. I just don't. I like books with good writing, but this one just doesn't hold up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so disappointed in this book. I would have given it 2 stars if I could. The only reason why I gave it only 2 stars is that it's not that great. I expected more from it. There's not a whole lot of information on this book so I had to look up the basics to get a little more understanding. The book seems to be about the history of the war in Vietnam but you would think that it would have been more about the impact of the Vietnamese and their resistance to the American war effort. Also, I was so confused by the end of the book because it seemed to be a history of how the Vietnamese lost the war, but then I started thinking about how much the Vietcong were aided by the Americans in fighting the Americans. It just seemed that the author was only telling a side of the story. Overall, I thought the book was a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************************This is a fun read, if you want a little light-hearted fun read. But, as I read it, I kept thinking, "Why are there no dogs in this book?" So, I asked a good friend of mine who is a dog lover if she thought she could bring a dog to this book. She said "No way!" and then added, "I don't think there are any dogs in the book." So, if that is the case, then, this book is a bad idea. If you do decide to read this book, you might as well read a funny book like "The Great Gatsby." It is a good book. I think this book will appeal to the kids, but, for the rest of us, this is just not the right book for you.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  "It's one of the worst books I've ever read. I have a problem with this kind of story."  -B. D.  It was one of those books you read, loved it, and put it back on the shelf, but then you wanted to read it again and again and time passed. You can't help but think about it. There are so many parts to the story that I found so fascinating and fascinatingly terrible. The main character, T.J., has this friend named D.A. who is a brilliant doctor, but a poor communicator. T. J. finds out that D. A. has a daughter who is severely mentally retarded and T. S. is the sole caretaker. I really wish the book had been more like the movie "Good Will Hunting" where the two main characters actually got along and made a lot of progress with their friendship and D. I think the story would have made a much better movie. I can't imagine D. having to deal with his daughter's life and all the problems she had with the school system. It was a very frustrating book, and I would not recommend it to a family with young children.   I'm a big fan of suspense and thriller books, and this one has got a good twist. There were a lot more twists than I remember reading about in other books that I've read, and it made the book more interesting.  , but I'm not sure I can recommend it. The plot is so complicated and the ending is so unsatisfying, I didn't finish the book and I felt like it was over too quickly. It had some interesting parts, but most of the book I couldn't really get into. It has a lot to offer as a good mystery or suspense novel, but for me it fell flat and I don't recommend it unless you want to read a suspense novel that has a good ending and suspenseful moments. I found the ending very unsatisfying and disappointing, and for some reason it didn't seem to be a story I would enjoy for more than the first couple of chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I will admit that I've been wanting a book on the "how to" side of the book-writing equation for some time, but this book was just too much. It was written by a teacher who is a very good writer, but I think the book could have been better written by an actual author. The whole concept of writing is very important, but what he does is not the way to go about it. He just goes in and tries to tell you how to write a book. It's just boring, and doesn't help anyone. I mean, how can you expect the writer of a book to have any real insight into how to go through the writing process if he's not a writer? " --Anonymous   "What I want from a book is something that will take me someplace that I'll remember for a long time and that will teach me a skill that I need in my work and life. This book is no more than a boring lecture about the process of writing a book." --John   Reviews  Review by: T.J. Walker on Dec. 22, 2013 :  This book has a lot of good advice. It has also some very bad advice. The book does have some useful suggestions that might help some of you with your work, but if you take these suggestions as gospel and follow them to their logical conclusions, you will end up with a mediocre book. For example, when the author suggests that you write your first draft on a typewriter and then turn it into a book by using a computer, he assumes that the reader will just accept the information without asking any questions. I am not a typist, so I don't know how much I could learn from this book, but it certainly does not seem like it would be helpful. Another thing that annoyed me was the author's assumption that you need a good editor to make your book look good. This is not true, and I'm sure it is not helpful. I'm not sure if it's just me, but there is just something about the style of writing that I just don't like. I think it's a very dry, academic tone. The first chapter is a good example of this. Another big problem is the author doesn't explain what exactly he is doing. He does some very basic research, and it seems like a lot, but he never really explains why he thinks he is so good at this. The main idea of the entire
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I read this book for a history project, and my professor asked me to read it and write a review for the class. It was hard. I was confused and frustrated with how she presented the history of religion in the book. It really feels like she was trying to make a point about how we need to be critical of religion but not to the point that I felt like it was taking away from the actual lesson she was teaching. I have a hard time with that. She could have made her point better by including the fact that, yes, religion has had a huge impact on society but that we still have much to learn from our past. I would give this book a C, but only for the fact it's a history book and I'm just not into reading about people who have never experienced a religion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very short book.  It is full of bad writing and bad grammar.  I am very disappointed with this book. I really wanted to like this book, I really did.  The main characters were interesting and it was a fun read.    The problem is that I am extremely disappointed by the book. My first thought when I saw the cover was that this is the book where a girl and her dog go to the forest and see the bear and the bear tries to eat the girl.  This is not true at all.  In fact the girl has a pet turtle and the animal is so small that it takes the girl a lot of time to feed it and even then it seems like it is not getting enough.  I'm very disappointed by this book and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________My boyfriend was not into fantasy and I wanted a story to read. He had not been interested in fantasy before so I thought I could at least give him a book about a young boy who gets caught up in a war between orcs and elves. I got hooked and found the story interesting. I was hoping for a fantasy adventure but I think I got a more realistic story.The main character is a boy and a girl and the story is about a war that is being fought between the two races. The story is a bit too long to read, especially if you are not interested in this genre of fantasy. I think this story was more about the main characters and their relationships than it was about a fantasy world. The ending was a bit abrupt and I am disappointed with it.The writing was good, but the story was a lot better. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a short story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so disappointing, I have to admit. It's been a while since I read anything by this author. But, I picked up this book from the library because it was recommended to me by my husband, a big fan of this author's work. I have a strong affinity for him and always find a book that he likes. I was expecting to get a book I would like, but this book was a disappointment. It was so bad, I would not recommend it to anyone, not even to a fellow fan of his work. The story was terrible. There was no sense of any story at all, and most of the time there wasn't even a sense of characters. It seemed like the author didn't even know who the characters were, and that is so disheartening. The main character, John is so one-dimensional, and so dull. He has the typical "perfect" family, but the rest of the characters, all the ones that had any sort of character, were so lifeless. The only one I actually found interesting was the daughter. Her character was the most complex, and I loved how the author described her. But it was still a disappointment to me. The book was also so bad that I found it hard to even finish it.   The plot:  John's mother, Lillian, died while he was away at college. He left home to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but was caught up in the riots that occurred during the Civil Rights Movement. He had to leave the university, but ended up living at a friend's house until the riots died down. After that, John and his friends found themselves in the middle of the Civil War. This book is set during the last year of the war, and we follow John and other soldiers as they make their way through the trenches in France. The plot is not interesting at all. It doesn't make sense to me at all because of how it's all set up, and how little we really get to know the characters. The author never explains anything about the war or about the characters because it just doesn't feel like there is a purpose behind it all. The characters just kind of hang out, talk, and get into ridiculous situations. The conflict between John and the other soldiers, especially the other black soldiers, is so ridiculous that I really wish they were all killed off. The worst part about the conflict was the fact that the author never made
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book does not give you the information to make good decisions, and makes you a passive and helpless victim of a bad situation.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most recent book I read by this author is The Bitch Who Wasn't  and, while I was entertained by it, I can't say I was impressed by the content.  I am not sure if it is because of the poor quality of the writing or if it just was not what I was expecting.  In short, it's not a bad story, but it's nothing special.  This book does not provide much information about the world or characters, it is a fantasy story with a dark side to it, and it doesn't really tell a story, it tells you a story.  I'm sure it's a good story, I just don't feel like I got any more out of it than I already did.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book is terrible. It's a horrible story that never had a chance to develop any sort of plot or character. It is about two kids who go to a big party to meet some famous people. The story starts off well enough, but it is really bad. It has a boring story and a boring author. There's nothing interesting to say about this story. The characters are so boring. I can't imagine how a writer can get away with making a story like this. This is an extremely bad book. The only thing that makes it worth reading is that it was made into a movie, but that's a bad way to spend a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not like this book. I was expecting some kind of fantasy about an ancient alien race that lived on a planet that is now destroyed by a meteorite. I got the idea that they have advanced technology, and I also thought that the planet had been destroyed by meteorite, but it is actually a planet full of dinosaurs. The dinosaurs had evolved from a single animal, the triceratops, and they were really ugly, ugly. There is no evidence that they had a civilization or had any kind of advanced technology. I found the book hard to follow. They had a lot of interesting ideas, but I just don't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   I'm going to start by saying I'm very impressed with the story. There is a reason this is considered a classic and is a major inspiration to modern sci-fi and fantasy writers. The premise is brilliant and the execution is perfect.   The book starts out very slow, but as the story progresses it picks up. The story of The Last Days is a dark one with a dark plot, and the character development is excellent. There are two main characters who will be the focus of the story, and it's great to see how their paths will cross. The author doesn't give us a lot of background on the characters, but this doesn't bother me. I don't want to know the inner lives of the main characters, I want to see the action. It's the only way I can enjoy a book as much as I have with this one.  - The Last Hours   This is the most dramatic moment in the story so far. The action starts in the last moments before the sun will set, and takes us to a dark and desolate planet, filled with nothing but chaos and destruction.   a man named Jaxon is on his way to a nearby planet to deliver a shipment of a vital ingredient to a small mining colony. The colony's inhabitants have built a small settlement, and have built their own society. They have built some form of government, but the colony has become a hub for illegal trading and trafficking of various goods.   (They are also responsible for many crimes on the planet, which Jaxin finds out when the people in the colony are arrested for some very serious crimes.)   One of the colony's colonists is a woman named Lila. Her husband has gone missing and she has been desperate to find him. Lila is a beautiful woman, but she is a cold and heartless one. Jax has been looking for her all day, and after some strange happenings at the colony, she has decided to take a ride on his ship.   the rest of the book follows Jax, and Lila, as they explore the planet and make their way through the dark and dangerous streets. There were several twists in the plot that I didn't see coming, and I'm still trying to figure out what they are. It was so dark and depressing at times, that I just wanted to curl up and cry. It has some really powerful moments in it, but not every chapter was as good as
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is the most horrible thing I have ever read in my life.  I read it because it's a YA book, but I don't know what kind of a person I am.  I don't even know what to say about this book, except it's just awful.    It's a story about two kids and the horrible things they do to each other.  The first one I didn't mind, the other I did, but the worst part is when it got to the "fistfight".   I have no idea what the "fuck" was about.  My kids and I have been friends for about 3 years now, so I know the rules.  When we have a fight, we don't fight with each other, we have fistfights, right?  Well, when I read this book my kids and my friends were fighting, I didn the fuck out of it.  This book makes me sick.  I don' t know how they can publish this book.  If you don't like it, please don't buy it. 9/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a shame that this book didn't have more depth or characterization. The worldbuilding is well done, but the characters are not developed well enough to give them real depth. The author is trying to do a post-apocalyptic tale, but there are too many details that aren't explained, and the characters seem to exist more to support the plot. The main character is boring and has little characterization. There are too few side characters, and there is no clear story arc for the main character. Overall, it's a fun read, but not worth the time investment.

But this is the first Korean book I've read that I enjoyed so much that I wanted to read it again. 4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book's protagonist was a very strange and odd woman. She is a little bit of a mystery, because she was an expert at killing people and was very good at it. I don't know if it was because of a genetic predisposition to violence, but she was quite good at killing. She was also pretty much a psychopath and a killer. She killed a lot of people, mostly women, and was also quite good with the torture. It seemed like she had a compulsion to kill and torture people, but didn't know why. There was a part where she told a man she was "so busy being happy that I've never had time to think about what a dick I'm being." The thing that stuck with me the most was the fact that she was a psychopath. I thought that was really interesting, because psychopaths are generally portrayed as being evil, sadistic people who are out for the blood and misery of others. The book's not as good as I'd hoped, but the story's interesting enough to keep you reading and I do really like the character.   I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to a first time reader. It is very different than the other books I've read by Robert B. Parker, but still manages to be interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy this book much, but I do understand why it's so popular. I had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable read, but the story doesn't hold up and it feels like it has been cut from the same cloth as a lot of other books written by authors who don't really know how to tell a story well. The author tries to do a lot with a very little, and there's a lot more that could have been done with this book, but if you don't want to read a story about a young woman's love life with a guy who is really into the opposite sex and who thinks it's all his fault, you should pass on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for the story. The story is good. However, I feel that it is not realistic. The main character has a crush on a girl that she likes very much. Her father is not a very kind man, so she has a difficult time dealing with him and also with her family. She has to move out of her parents house to a house that her mother does not like and is very strict on. The author makes up a lot of stories in this book. One day, her boyfriend, the boy that she really wants to be with, decides to move to another town to pursue his dream. His friends are jealous of him because they think he is going to get with the girl that he really wants. He tries to explain that he is not ready to date the girl, but her friends are not interested in him either. The book ended in a way that I could never get it to make any sense. I feel like this book was written by a 14 year old boy who does not know how to be mature and realistic. This book was not worth my time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read a book in high school about a couple of kids who decide to go and do a film about a town called Mowbray. I think it was pretty good. The one thing I didn't like was the fact that the two kids have a dog. I know they can't have a real dog, so the dog was pretty much just an after thought. I didn�t really care for the story though. It just seemed a little corny to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had a lot of great things going for it, but was also very inconsistent and confusing. There were several scenes in the book that were poorly written, and the characters felt very flat, very boring. I couldn't tell what was going on, and it wasn't the most compelling story. The ending was also a little unsatisfying. I would like to see a sequel, but I would also like to read something else by him. If you are looking for a good thriller, and want to see some great action, and a solid mystery, this book is for you. However, if you don't like fast paced, action filled books, or like a character that isn't very interesting, I would not recommend this book. It is very hard to find a good mystery book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was boring and not well written.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is the worst book I have ever read and I hate to say it. I don't mean to bash this book because I really really liked the author. It was a good read. It took me about 5 days to finish the book. The book is not a good book at all.   This book is about a girl that was born with a disease called a dwarfism. She's been told by her doctor that she can't have children. This is a common thing that happens in most of the book and it's sad that it happens to so many people in this book. It's not a horrible thing to be born with and it doesn't mean that you can't love your children and give them everything you can. I just felt bad for this girl and all the people around her. The girl in this story also gets some bad luck with love, not to mention her father who is an alcoholic and neglectful. This book just makes me sad. It doesn't do anything good for this story to be told.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really thought this book was going to be great. The book is a true account of a woman who was involved in a violent incident and was later charged with a murder. There is some amazing details about how the case unfolded and some fascinating observations about her husband.  Unfortunately, there is a problem with the book.  It is too long.   It takes too long to tell the story and the narration isn't really that good.  It was a nice story and I liked it, but the length was just too much for me.  I would have loved to have seen it read by a more well-versed narrator (like maybe someone who knows about the case), but I don't know if that's really possible for a first person account.   Overall, I would recommend this book, but I really think I'd be better off just reading the book on its own.   Review:   A woman, who was very involved in the life of the family that was the subject of the book, was involved the murder of her husband's girlfriend. The woman had gotten very involved with the victim and was in fact the actual murderer.  She was charged with the murder, but later dropped the charges.  The main story line of the novel is her story, but it doesn't go all that well, because of the length and narration problems.  My husband and I both read it with our eyes open, just so we could understand what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________   I was very skeptical about this book. The first thing that struck me about it was the title. The title is really off putting. The whole thing just feels wrong. I know that I am supposed to be reading a book about something else but that just didn't feel right to me.   The author tries to explain a few things in the beginning of the book but just fails to do so. I was expecting more from a book title like "Mental Health". The first half of the chapter was about a patient who was struggling with his PTSD. It was ok but the next half of chapter was just confusing. The patient was talking about his thoughts and the author kept saying "I don't think I understand" etc. I really don't know what to think about that. I mean I am sure that the author is a really smart guy but I was still not getting the meaning of what he was talking. I would have liked to have been told more about his situation because it seemed to me that there was a lot of things that he was not getting or he just wasn't understanding that there were a lot more things going on than just his PTSD and I thought that was very unfortunate.  , The story starts off ok. It starts out with a guy that is trying to get a job and getting in to a lot trouble with his ex girlfriend. His girlfriend starts to really get mad at him and he doesn't know why. The story ends on a good note with the girl finally getting back with him and the guy finally getting a job.   and the rest of the story was confusing. I found myself looking for more information but there just wasn�t it. I am not really sure how I felt about this story and if I should have even read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high expectations for this book. I was excited for the first time I read a book by a female author and it didn't disappoint. She was a talented writer with great plot twists. Unfortunately I had low expectations. I thought this book would be a good mix of adventure and romance. What I got was a lot of romance but a lot less action than I had hoped. The romance didn't really show up until about the halfway point. This book was fun to read and I loved how she added so much depth to the characters and plot. I can't wait for her next book!

I highly recommend this book.  Sue, UK   I think it is one the most important books about transsexualism ever written. I read the first book in the series, but the second book is probably even better. I loved it.  is about a woman named T, who was born a boy. She is now a woman, but still feels like a boy and wants to be a man. The story follows T's struggle to find the right word for herself. I was moved by T's pain and her attempts to make sense of her identity.  , I've never been very impressed by books that focus on the transsexual experience. There are many who have lived this life, and yet feel that they are not really transgender. This is a book about the experience of a person that feels as though they have been born in the wrong body, but they have a desire to be who they were meant to be. The book focuses on T's attempts to find a way to describe herself that feels authentic. The main character, T, is a brilliant writer. She knows exactly what she wants to say, and how she wants it to sound. The novel has a lot of humour, and some great character development. It is a very unique book. I will be reading the next book in this series.   to the book:   This is a really excellent book, but it's not necessarily about transsexuality. T is a girl that has always felt like a man, but she is a woman. T wants to identify
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I just didn't get what I was looking for.  It was not a bad read, but it wasn't very good either.    I did like the characters in this book though.  "We've all had the experience of a close friend going through a rough patch.  "When I first read about this book I thought that I would be a bit disappointed in the way it was written, but the characters were all so real and well written that I didn't have that feeling.  I'm glad that this is one of the books that I can recommend to people who want to read something that doesn't have a happy ending." -Sydney's Book Blog "A real roller coaster ride.  This book is not for everyone, but for people who like to be entertained I'd say it's definitely worth a read." -A Review of the Book
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ It was a little confusing. It is all about the characters, but there is no story and the characters are all one-note. I found it difficult to care about them. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a book this much, so it is hard to explain my reasons. It's really not a story but a collection of short stories that all tell the same story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ A terrible book.  I found it boring and repetitive.    This is a book written by a man who is not an accomplished writer, who is obviously a fan of the series, and who does not understand how to write an intelligent and well-paced book. The character development is shallow, and the plot is a bore.  A very low mark for the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The story is told by an orphan who is taken in by a kindly old couple, and his father's love of his father is evident from the beginning. The book is a mixture of good and bad. The bad parts are the ending, and the ending is an unnecessary slap in the face to all readers who have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not a bad novel, but it is not what it claims to be either.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book in the Harry Potter series and I really enjoyed it. The plot was interesting and the character development was good. However, the author's style is very uninspired and the plot is extremely boring and repetitive. I was really disappointed with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first half is very much a story of the struggles and triumphs of the protagonist, who is a young man who discovers his true love when his life is thrown into a tailspin by a tragic accident. The second half is about a woman who finds a mysterious book in a basement and uses its powers to help others. I didn't find either story particularly compelling, and it was a shame that the ending didn't add any more to the overall story. I can't help but think that the protagonist is the only one who was disappointed by the book.  A book about a girl who discovers a magical book in her attic that allows her to change the world for the better? Why not?  That would have been interesting, but it didn't feel particularly original.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited about this book when I first saw it. I had read many other works by this author but I thought this one was really good. It's really dark but it's not dark like a lot of the other dark fantasy books I've read. It was more dark than I thought it was. It did make me think about what would have happened if the main character had a similar life to that of a vampire, but he didn't have the power. It made me think of the main characters life when he had the power, and how much he missed it. It also made me want to read the next book in the series. It has a really good plot but the main bad guy had me a bit disappointed. He didn't make any sense. The only reason I can see for his character was to make the book seem more like a horror book. That may have worked but it didn't really make it into the book. Overall, it was a good book and I'm looking forward to the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a long book.  This book was very, very slow.   It was very boring.  I just read a lot of reviews on Amazon and I feel like it's very, VERY easy to make a living writing.  I mean, the idea that you can make money from writing is a myth.  There's a lot you have to do, you have a lot more work, you can only have so many hours in the day.  It's just not a good idea to get too excited about that.  If you're not going to be working on this for a living, don't expect to make anything off it.  A lot of the advice is good.  But, there's not enough time in the book to cover it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it took me so long to finish this. The first half was interesting and the last half was dull. I don't know why the author thought this would be an interesting read but I guess he didn't think through his ideas. It's boring. I thought I would have liked it better if he had just stopped.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was so interested in the history of the US government and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The book is pretty good at that, and if you are interested in that, it will be a good read. However, I found the book, for the most part, boring. It is really about two politicians who are very different, and I found it difficult to connect with either one of them. They seemed to have no interest in what happened, and it just seemed like there was no real purpose to their lives, beyond "getting ahead". I really don't know if they even had a purpose, since the two of them were basically just playing politics to get what they wanted. This was my only major disappointment in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is so far the worst of the bunch. The main characters are boring, the story is just bad and the ending is really dumb. This is a book for kids who love reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a bit slow and not very exciting for a story about two characters who spend a lot of time together. The book could have been a lot longer. I also had a hard time with how the story was structured, as there is not really a plot and there are only 2 characters involved at the end. I think the book would have been better if there were a little more information about how the characters were connected. I would have liked to see more about how they met or if they were friends before it all went south. It would have made the book more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I don't know why I bother with this book. It's just a bad story about an annoying, selfish woman who is not a great person.   I know I just rated it three stars, but if you have not read the book, then you can get a great idea of how this is a bad girl, but not a good one.   is about a woman who has a problem with people who get involved in a case she is involved in. She feels that the people who are involved in this case are just not taking responsibility for their actions, and so she sets out to show them what it's like to be an involved in such a case. I did not enjoy the book at all. The author tries to portray her as a very caring, caring person, but it just does not seem to work for me. I know that she tries to show that she is not just a woman in a bad relationship, but that does not work for my liking at all because I just don't feel like a good person is someone who is just looking for attention or sympathy, especially when you're in a situation that requires a lot of people's time and effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is terrible. The author is a good writer, but this book is a train wreck. It's basically a collection of horrible people trying to be evil and having bad things happen to them. You think it's bad when you read the books, but when you actually listen to it, it's horrible. It should be called The Worst Book Ever. I hope the author doesn't do another book like this because I will not be buying another book from her.   The story: I loved the first book in the series, and this one, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the level of the first one. The main character is a nice person who is being stalked by a bad guy, and as a consequence of this, she starts to hate herself. The bad guy is an evil person who has been manipulating the bad guy for a long time, and he's about to kill the good guy. She wants to stop him, but the bad guys just keep on coming. It just gets worse and worse, until the good guys are all dead.   of the main characters: this one is the only one who's really evil. All the others are evil and are being controlled by this bad guy. They're all a bit like a bunch of kids that's been playing with fire, and now the fire has gone out, and they're about to burn up. There's not much else to say about the main character. She's just like the other bad guys in the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** ***************************** I was disappointed in this book. I read this book to learn how to create my own artwork, and I was hoping it would give me a good idea on how to do it. I was wrong. It is boring. I am a professional artist and I can do it all with a pencil. This book doesn't give me anything. I'm not even sure I would know what to do with my time. It was a waste of my time, as it was boring and I just couldn't follow it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I've read a lot of books on this topic. It took a lot to get me to go to this one. It wasn't a fun read, it didn't seem like I was enjoying myself. I don't think the author was a very good teacher, she made it difficult to figure out what the book was trying to say. The author also made some comments about how this book was "anti-American" and it was a "hit piece". I don;t think that is true. It was about some people in a small town in the US who have the same kind of issues as people in some other countries. It didn't go into the specifics of what the problems were, I just don;'t see how the author could possibly have come to the conclusion that she did. I think I'll give this book a pass, because it was too long for me to finish.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** ********* I love this book, but it took me awhile to get into it. The first 10 pages or so were so intense that I was scared of it. Then I remembered the good parts, and I was hooked. This book has great writing and has been a huge help to me. My son who is very religious, will now read this book to him every night. I'm so glad I gave this book a chance. The only negative that I have is that I feel that the author didn't give enough credit to the person who invented the concept of "The Book of Mormon."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read all of the Harry Potter books and I loved them. I was going to give them to my son but my husband has a heart condition and we had to let him go to the ER because he was getting weak.   The books were very good and the stories of the characters were enjoyable. The only problem I had was that I liked the first book better than the second book. The first book had more action and the second was much more character driven.  The book is good, but it's not perfect:  A couple of the stories I thought were good but the plot got a little out of hand. The Harry Potter series was the first thing that I ever read when I was a kid. I loved the characters and the adventures. I think I may have read about the Wizarding World in a book somewhere but I never got around to it. I enjoyed the books and have read them many times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only bad thing about this book is that it is so full of self-aggrandizement and is so badly written that it's really a slog to read. The characters are so poorly developed that it makes reading a slog. If you are into books that make you think and ponder on issues of life and identity, then this is a good read. If not, you are better off reading a different book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I'm going to give this book 4 stars for a few reasons:  1. I really enjoyed this book, especially if you like romance/romance fiction. I don't know if it was because I was reading it in a foreign language or not, but it was a good book. I can't say I would like a good story with romance/charm more, but I thought it was still a good read.  2. It's funny. It has jokes, it's silly, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's fun to read. That said, I can see how some people might not like this book because the romance is a little too much at times. I think some people would not enjoy this book if they have a weak stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I was so excited to finally get my hands on this book. I bought it off of the website because I've never heard of this author before and wanted to try her out. I have to say, this is the worst book I've ever read. The only thing I can compare it to is The Catcher in the Rye. Both are excellent books but this is a really bad book. It's very pretentious and the writing is very hard to read. There are so many words, I don't even know where to begin. It was a real struggle to get through this book because I was just so disappointed by it. If you're thinking of buying this book, do not buy it. I'm glad I didn't buy it but I'm still not happy with the writing. I am not looking forward to reading her next book but I will probably pick up the sequel to this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only unreadable, but it also contains some of the most offensive words I have ever seen. It has nothing to do with a book's quality or its message; it is just the fact that there are so many hateful, sexist, and racist words in this book. Even more offensive than that, there are the parts where he uses those words as a way to attack feminists and black people.  What does he have against feminists, anyway? I have read a lot of books, and I can say that this is not one of them. It is a disgusting, hateful, offensive book, and the people who wrote it should be ashamed of themselves.    I don't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's terrible!  The main character, who I think is supposed to be the good guy, is basically a coward and is a huge bully, so I can only imagine the poor girl he has to deal with in high school.  She's too young to understand what is happening to her, and the author has no way to give her any advice because it is written from a girl's point of view.    The only good thing is that I can understand why this book has been banned from school libraries and banned from libraries all over the country.  I will never read a book by a girl, ever.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   I've never been a fan of YA. I read a few, but nothing that caught my attention. Then I got a copy of the latest book in the series and I was hooked. My sister and I both read this one, and while she is still going through it, I am just starting the next book in my own series. I think my favorite characters are the same as the first, but the action is more intense and there is more character development, which I love. I'm sure this book won't be the best thing ever written in the genre, but if you're a fan you will love it, even if you don't like fantasy at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** "One of the most disgusting pieces of writing I've read in a long time. The protagonist's mother is a woman who is in her 40's and is trying to keep her family intact while still working to help those in need. The mother is married to another woman and has a son of her own, but she is working long hours and caring for her sick husband and her three children. The woman also works as a housekeeper and is struggling to provide for her family as well. However, the mother's life becomes complicated when she and her husband get into a fight over the use of a computer in the house. The husband goes to a computer store, and he buys a used laptop and a copy of a book. The book in question is "The End of Men." The father doesn't like this because he finds it offensive and misogynistic. His wife also doesn't appreciate this because she finds it insulting to men, which makes the father's actions even worse. She tells her husband he's never going to see his family again and he goes and buys the book, and then the father comes home to find his wife and kids gone, and his computer with the book still on it, but no sign of his wife. What a nightmare. I think this was a mistake on the author's part." -Ginger   "I think it's an interesting story. The author does a good job describing the problems women are facing in the 21st century. She does a very good job showing how the women are losing their sense of self and identity in this modern society. She also describes the problems that this can cause for men as well as the women. In some ways, I like this story. I don't know how it was done, but I like the way the woman and the father were portrayed in this story, which is not common in most books on this subject. I am not a man or a woman, but my impression is that it's a very sad story. It's a sad story about a man who doesn't get his wife back, a woman with no sense of identity, a man with no way of finding his wife, and a woman living in fear of her husband. I'm glad that the author made a very bad mistake and realized her mistake, and I wish her well." -Cindy   ******************   Book Description:   In the 1990s, a study of a few hundred people found that the most
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book.  It is a bad introduction to the subject and it doesn't even come close to presenting the evidence or the reasoning behind why I think the evidence is so weak.  The title should be: "Why are so many people still wrong about the dangers of vaccines?" It is also a shame that the authors chose to use this as an introduction, as I have been working on this for over ten years. I was fortunate to get an excellent introduction from the authors at the end of my book. I hope they will change the title in response to the criticism that they have received.

It goes nowhere.  It has absolutely nothing to do with real-life.  It's about a woman and her friend who decide to run away to Mexico.  It has absolutely absolutely nothing do with reality. The plot is really boring and repetitive, and the main characters are not interesting at all.   I really wanted to hate this book.  It was very confusing to me. The author made me feel like I wasn't paying attention in class.  And the book is very short at only 100 pages.   This book was like a horrible and pointless experience that I wish I had never read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just bad. The author clearly has not read the source material. It's all about the protagonist and there's not much else.

I have had this book in my collection since it was first published in the 90s and have always had a good time reading it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************   I read this book because it was the only book I had left of the author's series. I wanted to be able to read more of the series because the first book was just great. But the author, I was disappointed in. I found the author to be really boring and uninteresting.   The characters:  We get a couple of main characters. The first is the author. He is the main character. He loves his daughter. He cares about her. The author does not really do anything with his daughter except she is always in trouble. His main problem is that he is too tired to care about her or do anything.  , but the author was a lot more interesting than his daughter and I felt I was the one who was getting bored with him. He always gets into trouble and it never got any better. He was just so boring that I felt he didn't need to be in this book.   is the other main character in the book. She was the daughter of the woman that the main characters are in love with. The story starts when she is about 11 years old and the main author is still in love. She has been away from him for 6 years and I thought that she was just there to act out a father figure for the main male character.   It took the author and the woman a long time to even be in love because the main man was never interested in her. This really bothered me because it really made it seem like he never wanted her.   in the end the main female character leaves and the author goes back to his daughter but she was a horrible person to him.  . She wanted to get him attention and do things his way so he would care about and love her. But she never really cared about him. She just wanted to make him happy. But I just thought it was a bad way to write a main character and I didn't like her character. She always wanted to do things the author wanted her to do.  I also thought that there were not many things that she did that she should be proud of because she always did them the author way. For example she wanted to learn the violin but he was always telling her to play piano. But he was never the one that told her to learn piano.    The story was so boring and there were so many things I did not like about it.  The ending: I am sorry but it was just a horrible ending. The

I'm going to go ahead and recommend it to my friends and loved ones who are interested in fantasy, history, and a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're looking for something different and different sounding than the standard fantasy fare that's been offered to me since I was a kid, then this book is worth checking out.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I had to read this book to prepare for my job interview. It's not a bad story. But the characters are awful. And the narrator was terrible. It was very hard to get through this book because I couldn't stand the characters. I think the writer could have written a better book if he didn't try to write a story about people who have problems and then make them more complicated than they really are. And when they aren't trying to be complicated, they are often annoying and annoying and obnoxious. And it took me a long time to get past the first 15 or so pages. This book took me to a place where I thought I was in a bad movie, like a bad bad movie. I thought about it a lot in the car and in bed, because I really had to. It is really frustrating to have to read a book and find out that it is bad, especially if you think the book is good. I'm not going to recommend this book, I think it's a waste of your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ If you like a book but don't like the author or just don't understand it, don't read it. ________________________________________________ For the past 20 years I have been studying Buddhism and I am very interested in the teachings of Buddha, but I am a person who is not a very religious person.    I am sure you have heard of the Buddha's teachings but are you aware that it is not just a religion?   In Buddhism there are many ways of life that are not necessarily religious in nature, but still a lot of people, especially those who live in modern societies, tend to lump all religions together.  The way we live our lives is different from the way Buddha's life was lived.  You see that is the key difference.  What is Buddhism? Buddhism is a way of life and the Buddha was a very enlightened person. The Buddha's Dharma or way of living is very different from what you find in the world today.  It is a very special way of doing things and is not the same as what you would find in a book or on a website.  You can find all sorts of teachings but it is important to note that Buddha lived his life by his own set of rules and didn't use anything that wasn't in line with his own way of thinking.  There are some things in his teachings that may seem to be contradictory but he did not have the power to change his own mind, he only had the power of teaching others.  When you study Buddhism you will be studying a very specific way of understanding the world, but it should not be confused with religion, which is a different subject entirely.    The other point that I would like to make is that we must remember that Buddha was the greatest man in human history. He had a very good life and died for what he believed in.  His teachings can be found in the suttas of the Pali canon.  Buddhism is not only a religion, it is also a way or a way to live. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A mediocre book, I was not really interested in reading it. I mean, it was just another romance but I felt there were more things wrong with it. First, there was nothing good about it. It was just an average book that got boring, I guess, after some time. The characters were pretty bad too. There was not a single person who was good. They all just were either annoying, stupid, or plain. The book is pretty much just about the guy, the girl, and some friends and things. But, the writing and story was so bad, that I can't really enjoy the book at all. I will not recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "My mother has the book and I would hate to buy another book from her. " -Brent This book is about an ex-wife who's been in a bad relationship for a while and is now back with a new man. Her new boyfriend's wife is very jealous. The book starts with the wife having a nightmare where she's trying to kill her ex-husband. The new boyfriend comes over and she's talking about how much she misses her ex. The woman is a bit off and her new boyfriend leaves. When the new boyfriend and the wife are alone, the woman starts to cry and talk about how sad she feels. After this point, the book really starts to focus on the new guy and his wife. The husband's name is Tim and he's a middle aged man who's never had a woman. The wife is named Laura and she is a woman in her late twenties who was divorced but is in a new relationship. Laura doesn't feel like she is loved and feels she's a burden to her husband. Laura has a new boyfriend named Brad. Brad is a little older and a bit older than Laura. He's been divorced and his ex- wife's son is now dating Laura's daughter. The relationship between Laura and Brad is interesting because Laura feels like Brad is an older version of Brad, but she feels like she's not really attracted to Brad. The first part of the book is Laura and her relationship with Brad. In the second part of this book, Laura and the new man start to become closer. I enjoyed this book a lot. The main thing that stood out to me was Laura's relationship with her ex husband. I liked the relationship with Laura and how she feels about him. She's the main character and her life is turned upside down.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't like this book. It was boring, it was hard to read, and it took me so long to finish.  I was looking forward to reading about a guy who's trying to figure out his sexuality and how he got there, but I just didn't get it.  The writing was really bad, the story line was completely uninteresting, and the story ended way too abruptly.  This book was a big letdown.  It was a book I expected to like, but the book didn't live up to the hype.  The Good: I like this character, even though she's not as well developed as I would like.  She's a very open minded girl who is trying to get into a good college and has the typical teenager issues (like having to get a boyfriend) and is going to have to learn to work with the people she meets in college.  Also, there are a lot of fun and funny characters, like the weird girl who wants to be a girl who looks like a boy and the guy who just wanted to have sex with a girl, even if it's with a man.  And I really liked that there were so many sexual situations in the book.  There's a lot more about the way people are and how they interact than there is about the actual sex. The Bad: This book is boring, I just don't get the point.  A guy who is having sex with his girlfriend is basically a good guy.  He's trying really hard to figure things out and figure out what's going on with him, but he just can't seem to figure it out.  His parents just don`t seem to know what's happening and his girlfriend just can`t deal with the fact that she doesn`t want to be with him anymore.  But then there's the fact he has a lot to figure in to, and his parents are really controlling, and they never let him try to talk about what's wrong.  They just say what they want to say, which just makes him feel worse.  As I said, it doesn't make sense to me, and there are so many scenes that make me feel like the characters are making up the sex.  Then there's all the sex that happens, but they just make it seem so random that I don't know if it`s even happening.  Plus, there's so much talking and not much sex.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the books in this series, but this one was a let down. The main problem I had was that it took a while for the main story to progress. The story is very fast-paced, but the pacing was so slow and there were too many plot threads that it made me feel as if I was reading a book that would take a very long time to complete. In the end I didn't get the payoff I expected. I also felt as if this was a book I would have to re-read again in a couple years to see what happened.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting book, but I'm not sure it's going to change my thinking.    Review: The Great Work of Mercy:  The Catholic Way of Salvation, by St. Vincent de Paul (St. Vincent Press, 2013)  The Catholic Way is a Christian term that can be applied to all people in all places who have embraced the faith. There are many aspects to the Christian life that are universal and that have been practiced by Christians for centuries. But what is unique about the Catholic Way and the Gospel is that it is a new way.  In a world that has become increasingly materialistic, the Catholic way of life has provided many people with a way to live a life that is not only moral but also spiritually rewarding.  St. Paul himself had a unique way of living that is reflected in the writings of the New Testament.  St. Paul said that the Christian Life is based on the teachings of the Apostles and the Fathers, but it is his own way that is unique.  The Catholic way, then, is a way of faith and a way for Christians to live out their faith.  It is based in the teachings that Jesus himself taught us in his Sermon on the Mount.  What is unique to the Catholic faith is the way that St. Peter taught that is based upon the Gospels, the Book of Acts and the writings and sayings of the Church Fathers.    The Gospel is an essential part of the Catholic life.  In the first few chapters of The Great Way, St. John of the Cross, St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Joseph of Cupertino explain what the Catholic Church is and what it is about.  While this book is not intended to be a full-fledged book on the subject, it is an introduction to the Church and the Church's life. The author makes a point of explaining how the Church is not simply a community of people who pray, but rather a community that has a very specific mission.  As one reads this book, it becomes clear that the Catholic teaching on salvation is a vital part of who we are and how we should live our lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book from a local library and was not disappointed. It's not a perfect book, but I think I would've liked it more if it was longer. I think this is a good introduction to the work of Robert Bly, and I'm looking forward to reading other books by him.    This is a great introduction to Robert Blyn's work! It is well written, and easy to read. I'm a huge fan of his work. He is one of the most talented and prolific writers working in today's fiction scene. This is a must read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The writing is awful, and the plot is terrible." - The Literary Mercenary (review by R.L. Wilson) I think the writing is terrible and the book is terrible, because it was just a disaster from the beginning. The protagonist, who I won't name because she has a very obvious crush on the main character, is an incredibly annoying character. Her personality is all over the place, she's a "sassy girl who doesn't give a shit" type, but when she's alone she's an absolute jerk. She is a very strong, smart and capable woman, but her personality constantly makes her come off as an annoying idiot. She's so uninteresting, it's really quite disgusting, and her entire character is the worst part. Her relationship with the main protagonist is not well developed either, and I don't know how a relationship between two characters like that would work at all. I don?t even want to read another book from her. The main character also seems like an extremely annoying character as well. He is so much like a typical male protagonist: He is arrogant, brash and has no problem with his own sexuality. The way he acts is so unrealistic, it makes it hard to take him seriously at times. At first, I really enjoyed reading his side stories, but I just became annoyed by how the author is constantly giving him these stupid and ridiculous side stories. I can't really tell if it's the writer or the author?s characters that makes them so annoying, but at times they're just plain stupid. The story doesn?t go anywhere, and after it?s over, it just kind of feels like a waste of time. It feels like this book was written to make money, and if it was, the writer is really, really bad at writing and I think this book would have been better if it wasn?t written by a guy. This book also made me sad.  The main character is a girl who loves cats.  This is such a beautiful book.  It reminds me of the feeling I get when I read a book by my favorite author, and this book has all of my favorite things: It has great writing, and is very funny.  And the characters are all so unique and interesting.   The way this book is written makes me feel like I am in the story, which I think is a wonderful feeling, especially when you are reading a book that is
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The story is great. I did enjoy it though. I love it when a book gets you thinking and pondering. It is not a complex story or anything. I enjoyed it just fine, but it doesn't grab my attention for a long time. If I have to write a negative, it's because the book did not really interest me. I really can't say it's worth reading, but if you like science fiction, or even fantasy, I would say this is a good read.  9 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I bought this book expecting to learn more about how the Illuminati and Freemasons operate and what they do behind the scenes, but it turned out to be more of a "who, what, when, where, why" type of book. I learned a lot about the Illuminati, but I did not really learn much about the "who's behind the curtain" of the Freemasons. -------------------------  "The Masons, and their many branches, are a shadowy organization, which was first created in England, but has spread to many other countries, especially in France, and the United States. It is a secret society which seeks to control and exploit the world's resources, particularly by taking the wealth of the nation and turning it into a secret treasury....The Masonic Order is organized and run from a place called "The Temple", which is also known as The Mansion, The Palace, The Temple, The Mansion House or The Mansion.... It is believed that the Masonic Temple, with its numerous lodges, is the heart of the organization, and is the secret headquarters for all the lodges in the world. This Masonic Temple is believed to be the location where the secrets of the Order are kept and kept safe. The Temple also serves as the central location for all Masonic functions and ceremonies, such as initiation, initiation ceremonies, marriage ceremonies, and all other Masonic ceremonies and rituals.... The Masons of the world are led by a Grand Master, who in turn is led by two Grand Secretaries who are also Grand Masters. The Grand Secretary in the Masonic order is also called a "Pioneer", and the Grand Master is known as a "High Priest".... The most common and common form of Masonic ceremony is known by the Masonic term "Worship". This is a symbolic ceremony which symbolizes the worship of God as the highest Masonic ritual is believed in. The Freemasons believe that the Freemasonic ritual is an important tool to help people worship God in their lives.... Freemasonry's most important ritual is the "Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist" which is a symbol of the union of Jesus Christ with the bread and wine in the communion table.... According to the Masonic creed, the most important task of the Grand Lodge is the worship and service of God." (p. 1)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is not worth the time or money.   There are other books that are not worth reading either. They don't even pretend to be anything else but the same old, same old. The writing is bad, the grammar is bad. The plot is a train wreck, the characters are stupid, the world building is nonexistent. The book starts out with a good premise, a good story, and then goes downhill from there. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter books then you will love this book. I wasn't a fan when I first read it. I loved the Harry and Ron books but this one just didn't have the same magic that Harry had.  ....   Overall: __________________  I have to say I don't have a whole lot of respect for this author. She claims to be a professional writer. She has a website but it is not up and running. I don´t know what kind of writing practice this person has going on. I am surprised that she hasn´t gotten in trouble for plagiarism. There are many similarities in the story between the books. I do not like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book sucks. The first few chapters are really interesting, but I don't really care about anything that happens in them. I feel like the characters, even the main character, are way too one-dimensional. The ending is predictable and poorly written, and it was all too obvious from the beginning that the author just wanted to be a good writer and didn't care about the characters. I mean, I'm glad he did, because he's a good author. I just don't think he has any talent for writing, or writing well, really. He's a very talented storyteller with a nice plot and a nice twist at the end, but he's way too stuck in his own ways to pull it off. I'm just not a fan of his writing, it's just not as good as it could be. 1.0 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is a mess. I've had the book for over a month now and I'm only halfway through it. I am not sure what is worse: the book itself or the people who are reading it. There's no way to avoid the fact that the characters are unoriginal. There is a lot of the same thing written over and over. This book is like watching a movie that's over 4 hours long. The only interesting thing about this book is that the main character has some sort of mental disorder. I don't know what this is but I can't take it seriously. The ending is terrible and the ending is the ending. I really wanted to like this book but the only thing that keeps me from giving this book an A is the fact I'm really not a fan of the way that this book tries to do a modern twist on a traditional romance. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. Recommendation:    Do not read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book and am disappointed with its lack of quality. I think it was written by a freshman college student, and I guess he had a lot to learn. It was a hard read, and the story is just plain wrong. There is a whole section of the book where there is a scene where the girl was forced to eat a bag of dog feces, and she just couldn't take it. There were some graphic descriptions of how the dog was used to kill, but nothing like what happened in the book. This is the most graphic part of the entire book, which is really a shame because the rest of the pages were just really bad. It is just really hard to take seriously someone who writes a book about cannibalism. I really didn't think the author was very good at his job, but if you are into this kind of thing, this is a good read. I just wish the author would have gone a different route with the story and maybe not have all the dog gore.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   The only book I would recommend to anybody who wants to learn something about astronomy, but doesn't care about astronomy. If you're a fan of science fiction, you'll love this book, but don't expect a technical explanation of everything. I'm not a big fan of "scientism", but this book has some good explanations of the various ideas that astronomers have about the stars and the universe.   But, for me, it was too long and the writing was kind of sloppy.   for all the information they give, it's hard to follow what they say. The only thing I learned was the definition of the word "cubic", but I guess it's the only thing the author said. It would have been nice to learn more about star formation.   and yes, I was very disappointed in the book.     Read a different book about astronomy if you want to learn about it, like the new book by the same author, called "Space in the Sky". It has the best descriptions, and it also explains what the author thinks about a lot of the questions.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book. It had everything a good fantasy novel should have, but it was the first time in a long time that I couldn't get a decent book into my hands. I am a HUGE fan of Terry Goodkind, and this is another example of his writing. I had high hopes for this one. I just don't understand how it turned out. I understand how this book can be very good, but I just couldn't see it as a book I would read. It seemed like I was reading the prequel to The Dark Tower, which I don't think this is. The story takes place in the same world as The Dark tower, which is awesome, but the book itself didn't feel like it fit in with that world. I think that the book could have been better. It was good, I just think that it didn't live up to the hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has very little in the way of plot, plot twists are rare and when they do happen the plot fails to keep pace with the twists. I found myself wondering what would happen next. I don't even remember what the plot was about, I just know I don  The Last Warlord of Mars is the last book in the original trilogy of The Wheel of Time. The Wheel Of Time is a series of novels set in a fantasy universe in which there is a constant struggle between good and evil and a conflict between the Light and the Dark. The Last Warlords of Mars takes place on Mars in 2E 433. A war has broken out between the forces of Light and Dark that has the inhabitants of Mars at the brink of extinction. The war is the result of a dispute between the ruling house of the House of Lords of the East, and a rival house of House of the West. The conflict is over the control of Mars and the Light side has been victorious but now they need the help of the other House of Light to get back in the game. This is where we get the plot of the book.  I found this book to be a lot of the same things I found in the first book, the characters were all over the place and I felt that the story wasn't very interesting. It wasn't as epic as I was expecting it to be and the ending felt very anticlimactic. I guess the plot itself was a little predictable because I was just like, "ok, I'll see where this is going." There were a few things I really enjoyed though, the magic system was interesting and I liked the characters.  in terms of plot it was pretty standard for the genre. The plot wasn't anything interesting. I did like that it didn't take a very long time to get there. I also really liked the new magic system that they came up with. It had a lot to do with the war. I didn't know much about the Wheel of time and how the various factions would have to interact with each other. The magic system itself was very unique and had a different feel to it than anything I had read in the genre before. The way it worked out was that it gave people abilities based on the colors of the three primary elements, fire, air and earth. The powers could be used to accomplish tasks and they were all very cool. It also added a lot more character to the characters which I really liked. I like how
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* * ********* ******** * This book is the worst book I have ever read. I am an average reader and the majority of the time I did not like the books I was reading. The first couple chapters were very confusing for me. I was unsure what I was doing or what was happening and this is what got me thinking. I started reading again and I just wanted to put it down. I had to stop reading and reread it three times. I have never had a bad experience reading a book but this is definitely not worth it. The author has a terrible plot. I don't know if the author is a terrible person, a terrible writer or something else but the characters are so poorly written and I had no connection to them whatsoever. I just can't stand to read about these characters anymore. I will be very surprised if the book is ever published and I will not waste any more time on this book. I can't recommend this book at all. It is awful. I gave it 3 stars because I don 't have any positive experiences reading this type of book.  10 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first impression was that it was a very dry and predictable story, a sort of "what happens when a boy goes to a girl's school" scenario. It's a very predictable story. But, it was enjoyable and had some interesting and quirky moments. If you like stories about people in their mid-teens getting to know each other better than they expected to, and if you like a good mystery or something that's a little more unusual, I would recommend it. It doesn't really stand out in any other way. But for me, it just wasn't what I was expecting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very boring book. It is boring because it tells us little about what is going on. What we learn about what happened in this book are things we already know, and those things are already known to us. The plot is the story of two men who work for the same company that's a big deal in the world of nuclear energy. They have a great deal of respect for each other, and their relationship is very interesting. But the book is about nothing but them trying to get what they want and doing so through means that are not really that interesting. I just wish that they'd come up with something more interesting. Also, the story is pretty much completely predictable. It's just a series of events. One of the main characters, who doesn't even get a name, does a thing in the first chapter, then the plot develops from that to this other thing in chapter four and we never see it again. I could have easily read this book for fun. But I read it for my job, and it's not fun to read a book where I don't learn anything new.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** The story is fine, the writing is good but the main characters are a pain in the ass.   I read the first 4 or 5 pages and thought, "Ok, it's a great start", but then it goes off the deep end, gets completely lost, and doesn't even come close to resolving anything.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A wonderful book. I was very impressed with the fact that it had the author's name on the cover. I also appreciated that he did not have the book illustrated, and the only illustrations were of a human and a dog, which were very well done. I found the story intriguing. The author is not very well known, but this book was very good. The book was a very well-written story that I enjoyed. The narration was very well performed by the narrator.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************This book is boring. It's like a good book you read once and then never read again.

It starts off strong and then you get so bored by the end that you can't take it any longer.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The book was written as a book about an ex-con who goes to live with his daughter, a girl he had just raped, in a very poor neighborhood. The book is about how the ex-convicts are treated by their daughter, and about how she is an easy target because she has been sexually abused by her father. The author is not well versed in the local criminal justice system, and the book is very much focused on the ex's abuse of the daughter, the ex, and her daughter. The ending was just bad. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** This is a really good book, and has made me a better writer. The characters are very well developed and there are many laughs along the way. However, if you want a good story and don't mind some dark humor, I would not recommend this book. It's a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a serious story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I don't usually rate books in the 5 star range. I am a big fan of George R.R. Martin, and his work is usually high quality, but this book was nothing but a pile of crap. I read this book on a loooong flight (it was a very hot day, so I was able to finish it in 2 hours, and was already tired at the time), and I had to be in the airport at 6 am to catch the next flight. The book was boring, and the characters were nothing but stereotypes. The setting was bland, the action was just a blur, and there was absolutely nothing to interest me in the whole book. I got bored. I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it in the morning, not in the afternoon. I was going to give it 3 stars, but the author had to post a review saying that the author "wishes to thank all of the readers who supported her" and that "it was an absolute pleasure to write for you all". I have a feeling that her book was actually better than the book she wrote for her publisher. It is sad that the authors are not allowed to make a living writing their own work, and that people like me and some others don't have a voice to speak out. I wish that she and her publisher would make more money from this book. (I'm thinking about cancelling my subscription to her site and buying her books on Amazon instead. ) So I will not be buying another book from her, and I'm not even going to mention this book to my husband.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ I have read this book many times before. I think I may have read it once when I was a child. The stories were interesting. The illustrations were nice and the characters were well drawn. The story was the main attraction. The characters were a little stereotypical. I have a feeling that it is supposed to be a fairy tale type of story but the main character is the evil step-mother. That made it hard for me to enjoy the story. There are some really bad things that happen to the step-father. I was really disappointed in the author and the illustrator for not doing more to make the characters look like a more diverse group. The last story in the book is the worst of the bunch. The author could have at least made the characters more believable. I'm sure that a lot of the characters would have enjoyed this book and been able to relate to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was a train wreck, not only for the story but for the characters. The story has a very interesting plot line with some twists and turns, but the characters were completely uninteresting. The main character is a very shallow character and she is constantly changing and trying to get what she wants. At the same time she is completely selfish and has no qualms about destroying the lives of those around her. The other characters are extremely shallow and have no character. I could not stand them. The writing was also extremely bad. I was annoyed and annoyed at times. The narrator kept trying to explain something I was already aware of. This made it difficult to listen to and was distracting from the main point of the story. I felt like the author was trying to tell a story that would be interesting but I just felt like it was boring.

If you want a happy story about a little girl who's afraid of spiders, this is the book for you.  The ending is very sad, and I'm not sure how much it will affect the readers.  It's too bad that she's a girl, because I love a good girl with a good heart.  This is a good story, but don't be surprised if you don't finish it because you can't make yourself put it down.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   This book is about the worst way to start a story. In my opinion, it is the wrong way to begin a story, it doesn't even have a plot. There is a beginning, and it is about a boy named Jake, he gets picked up by his cousin, a girl named Anna, and the two of them end up in a small town in the woods.   I'm a sucker for a good mystery. So, when I saw this story, I was pretty excited. I wanted to see what was going to happen next. I was hoping that the mystery would solve itself and I'd be left with a great story. I got a really boring mystery. I don't know if it was because I was expecting too much, or if the author is just not a good writer. But it is very hard to get a good story from this book. I think that there is too much of a plot and not enough of a story to tell. I guess that is the same for a lot of stories in this genre.   the story has a good setup but it gets derailed and doesn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book at my sister's house and it was horrible. The characters were really boring and the plot was not interesting.  It was also extremely short.  I read the book before it was published and it did not get good reviews.  I have to agree with the reviewer who said it was like a cross between a Disney movie and a story from an episode of Seinfeld.  It also did not help that I had to listen to it twice, the first time I listened on my iPod and then again in the car.  The story is also about a girl who was in a relationship with a boy who was really creepy.  She has this book from which she is writing a novel, and it is about a boy named Peter who is in love with her, but is being blackmailed by his brother.  At first I loved the story and liked that it was about a real relationship.  But the plot just got too boring and I just had to put it down.  If you are looking for a book about a love story with creepy characters and is really short, I would not recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was absolutely terrible, and the story is incredibly bad. I'm a big fan of the series, but this book was so terrible, that I really hope I don't have to read anything else from this author. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. 3 out of 5 stars I love the series so far. The first book had a great plot, but the second book was just a waste of time. The author is too lazy to write a plot, and makes all the characters act the same. They are the same characters in both books, and it's a very boring book. I don't understand why anyone would buy this book, unless they already liked the series and had a hard time finishing it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the worst thing I've ever read.  It had horrible grammar and the story was so boring.  The book has the most boring opening chapter I've read. The narrator starts off by describing a boring boring world. Then the narrator goes on to describe how everyone has been changed by some event, like the war or some plague. This doesn't make any sense to me.  The world is described as boring and boring. Then, after a while, we get a world that is boring and dull.  This is the story.  I'm not sure what the author wants us to get out of it.  It's an excuse to have a female lead who doesn't talk and doesn't have much to do, and we get this story so that we can get to the "real" world.  There's nothing interesting or worthwhile about this world or its people. The only interesting characters are the villains and there's a lot of them.  They don't have any real motivation, just to do bad things.    There are a lot more characters than the three main ones.  Some of the characters are very stereotypical like a "bad girl" who kills to get back at the bad guy, and a good girl who tries to save her friend from the bad guys.  Even though the book was so dull, I still had to keep rereading it to get the next chapter.  When it finally ends I don't even remember anything about it. It doesn't matter how many times I read it, I'm still disappointed with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a great book but the characters are all whiny brats.  I would have liked to see more of the family, more of them in general, and more of what happened in the last three books.  Read on, there's more.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The book is written with such a slavish love for Tolkien that it comes across as more of a fan's interpretation than a real academic account. However, in terms of academic accuracy, it is a failure. In fact, if you do not believe in the validity of Tolkien's mythology, it could be used as an excellent explanation for the creation of the modern world. It is based on a study of ancient Greek and Roman mythology which, while flawed in many ways, has a lot of validity. It has a couple of very important aspects which are completely ignored in the book, the main one being the existence of other continents such as Atlantis and Lemuria which were supposedly under the control of the elves of Middle Earth. I have a problem with this book, and I have given it 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It was a very enjoyable and interesting read but I can see why people might not like it.  It has a lot of material that can be very boring or repetitive.   The characters and the events in the book are all over the place and the story doesn't really progress as much as I would have liked.  I also found that there was some spelling mistakes throughout the book.   In short, this book is a bit hard to get through.  However, I have to give it a solid 5 stars because it is just a good read.  This book was recommended to me by a friend and I can definitely see why. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was disappointed in the story line and characters. This book does not provide the story that I would have liked. It is a good read, but I was looking for something more, and the story did not give it to me. I also found the characters very weak and not believable. This is a book I would not recommend, but if you like the story of the book, then this is a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the series and I bought it just to read it as a fan. I'm sorry, but this book was not at all worth it. It was hard to read, very slow, and too boring to enjoy. I don't know if I would read the next book, but I won't buy this one again.   In a nutshell, the story follows the protagonist, a girl who is trying to escape the clutches of the evil witch queen. She escapes and returns to the world of the dead and is given the task to find the prince she saw on the battlefield. The book's plot is quite confusing as it doesn't seem to be set in the same world as the books before it. The plot seems to be moving at a slow pace, not a lot happening, and it just feels like a waste of the author's time. The characters are very forgettable, and the plot is weak. The whole book seems to just be building to the final battle and ending in a disappointing way. There are many inconsistencies, including a lot of changes to the setting that didn't make sense, such as the fact that the prince was not the same as the boy from the beginning of the book. I didn't like the characters at all, and I really wanted to like the heroines. The ending is too ambiguous, as there is a lot more that happens than I think it should. I had high hopes for this book, and that's all I have to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really, really wish this book was more like the movie. The film has no sense of humor.  The movie's a little more serious, and they are more believable, and the movie has a more solid plot.  The movie takes a little longer to get going, and I don't know if it's because it's longer than the book.   I'm not going to lie:  I found it a little difficult to follow the book (which was not so hard for me, as it was a great read).    However, I loved it, and it's definitely worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good book but I can't stand the ending.  In the end the main character's parents just disappear.    I know the character's name is the main one and I know what his situation is.  The book is full of conflict and the characters are trying to find the way out of the situation.  I know it's a teen book but the ending just kills the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very well written. It's very interesting and well-written, but there are some bad writing choices in this book. The story is good but there is a lot of wasted space, especially in the middle. I think the author should have cut some chapters that were unnecessary to the plot. I don't know why he didn't do that. The book has a lot going on and I didn't understand much of it, which was a bit frustrating. If I had to guess, I would say that the author was struggling with his writing style and had to work on his voice, but that's all I have to say about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's just a bad story with a poorly written plot, bad characters, and bad writing. There are too many things to be said about it, but here are a few things: 1. The characters are flat. It's as if they were not made to be a romantic comedy. If you were to take the most bland, shallow, and self-involved characters, place them in a romantic relationship, and make them the protagonists of a romantic romance, you'd have a good movie about a boy and his crush. This is what they were made to do. I didn't get it. 2. It is a bit confusing, but I'm not sure if it's a plot hole or not. Maybe it's because the main character, the male protagonist, has very little personality other than his crush on the girl, but even that doesn't hold up. His personality is nothing special. He is the kind of guy who would just go with the flow, if it was the only option. He's the kind who would go to a bar and drink with a girl he met at the party and get drunk. He goes to a party and goes to sleep. He gets into a car accident. 3. The book is too long. It was a lot longer than I expected. It seemed like the author put in so much work into the plot, the characters, etc. that he just didn't have time to write the actual story. If it was a real romantic comedy, it would have been shorter. I was expecting more. 4. The plot is bad. There is so much going on. The main plot is a lot of people going to a big party and then getting drunk at the end of it, and then going to the end to go back to their own apartment. It gets kind of confusing when they go to the party, but then they go back home, but they also go to another party. And then they are at the other party, where they have to fight each other. And fight eachother. It doesn't make any sense, but that's what happens. It just didn I've read a lot about the movie "Hush". I didn�t like it. I thought the film was too dark and gritty and sad. The writing is also really bad. I don't like it either. And I haven't seen the film, so I can't say what it's like. If I had to compare it to, I'd
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story starts out with a good story. There is some drama that occurs in the story, but the plot is not that interesting. It is mostly a romance novel, and I'm glad I don't live in that world.  There are a few scenes that are extremely funny, but I can't help but think that there are a lot more good scenes in this book.  "I'm a bad boy and you love me." It's so hard to read a book like this.    Overall:   It is an interesting story about a couple and their relationship. It has some good drama and the romance aspect is nice. I would recommend this book to those who like a good romance story, and to those looking for a book to read with their boyfriend.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ "I was not disappointed by this book. I did not feel as though I was learning anything new. The writing style of this book did not bother me, but I think that it may have been a bit heavy handed in its telling of some of the details in the novel."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really disliked this book, and found the book to be a mess of poorly written and poorly thought out material. The main character is one of those characters who is constantly telling you something that you already know but are too lazy to do it. She's a very boring protagonist, with no real personality to speak of. The story is very much the same throughout the book, with one big twist at the end. It's a good book if you're looking for a quick read, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "You should be ashamed to read this book. It's one of the most revolting things I've ever read. I hate to give this book a bad review because I know it's a good book, but I just can't help but to be disgusted with it." I have to admit that I was a little put off by the beginning. I thought that I had been taken on a rollercoaster ride with this book, from good to bad. I mean, the first part, "A Secret History of the KKK" (my review), was pretty good. It was well written and the author had some good stories to tell about the early days of the Klan. However, it all got very dark. This is where the book gets really terrible. The author starts out with a great opening paragraph. "The story begins in 1873 in Georgia, when a small group of men banded together to form the Ku Klux Klan." This was the very first Klan chapter in America.  The Klan was formed in the aftermath of the Civil War to protect white supremacy and keep blacks out of the white man's lands. It was not a very inclusive group, and they were not very well-known in America at the time. However, I must say that I like the idea of the Klansmen being the protectors of white rights and not a hate group. The Klan's purpose was not to kill anyone, but to protect whites from the blacks. This is why I really enjoyed reading the Klan's story. It has the right tone. It is a story of good vs evil. This was not the case in "A secret history of the Ku-Klux Klan". However, after the opening, the book really got terrible. It took a little while to get going, but the first half of the book did make me a little uneasy. It felt a bit too much like a modern retelling of the American Civil War. There were a lot of parallels that I did not quite understand. For example, in the book, there is a lot about slavery, but not as much about the Civil Rights movement. I really thought that it was just a retelling that didn't really address the issues in the modern day. The first chapter was a bit of a let down, but this book has a lot to say. In my opinion, this book is very informative. I think that the author was trying to be as accurate as possible. The
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I'm sorry, but this book is bad. The story is told from the POV of a woman in her early twenties, who is going through the motions of being a single mom and raising her child with the help of her father and her boyfriend. It's not really a novel about motherhood, but it's a book about a single mother who is struggling to make ends meet and who's trying to put her life back together after her mother and her best friend are both killed in a tragic car accident. It doesn't work because it's too short, and it's not a novel, but I'm not going to give it a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for my husband's birthday (he's a huge science fiction fan). I thought it was a pretty good book, but it had too much 'filler'. It was really just another book of the same old crap, and I wanted more!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was a terrible book to read, not only the story, but the plot is a bit weak.  I did enjoy the writing style and the character's development, but at times it felt like a long prologue to a novel.  I found that the main character (Nora) and her family are a little too simplistic to feel real.    I felt that the book had more potential in a different time period and another culture,  but it just didn't come together for me.  It is a great read though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not bad, but it is very bad. I could not even finish the first book, but I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a little more time.  My only real complaint about the book is that the plot is not very complex. I was wondering where this was going from chapter one, and I thought maybe I would be introduced to some sort of secret society.   But then it turned out that there was a secret society, but the story was about an assassin that was part of it.    There were two sides to the story, and then the plot just dropped the ball, with no payoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is a terrible experience. This book should not be a book, because it is so boring. The author claims he is trying to help people through his experiences and his writings, but his writing style is not very good and the book has lots of repetition. The writer is very repetitive as well. If you are interested in the subject of the book, you should stop reading it right now. It is a waste of your time and your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------- I have to say that this book is horrible. I love reading, but this book was so poorly written that I stopped reading about halfway through. The characters were not well developed and none of them felt like they had any depth. I felt that the author did not care about them and was trying to push a specific message. The main character was a little boring, but I was more annoyed that she had to have a boyfriend to learn about love. The story is about a girl named Emma and her friend who are friends with her brother. The brother is an alcoholic and has been in and out of jail a few times. Emma's mother is an old lady who is sickly and her father is an abusive alcoholic. Emma and Emma's brother are good friends, but Emma's father is always angry with her. Emma is a little girl who wants to be a doctor, but her father won't allow it. Emma gets kicked out of the house when she's six years old. Emma moves to a new house, which has a secret room for her and her brother to hide in. Emma lives in a small town and her mother wants to take Emma to the big city to be in a movie and for her to be famous. The movie starts in a few days, but the big cities are very expensive and Emma doesn't want to live there. Emma starts doing things that she doesn't think is right, but she's not sure who is going to find out about her. The town is full of bad people, and Emma has a few close friends, and she makes a lot of friends there, but it's just not the right time for her. A guy named Michael comes into town and they get close. He gets jealous of Emma and the feelings that she has for Michael, but he's so drunk that he doesn't remember anything. Emma tries to be the good friend, but doesn't have the heart to tell him the truth. One day Michael and Emma decide to have sex, but they're interrupted by Emma's friends. Michael is really drunk, but that doesn't stop him from trying to rape Emma. He's stopped by one of Emma's teachers, and her name is Mary. Mary and Emma talk about how bad the town is, and that everyone in the town wants to kill them. They have sex with Michael in front of a crowd, and they try to go to school the next day. But when they get to school,

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   My wife and I have been reading the book for about a year. We started out on the easy road to reading. We both had the same enjoyment from the book. The book was easy to read. The story was easy for us to understand and follow. It wasn't until the last few chapters that I began to find the book a bit too complicated.   The ending was a bit odd. It seemed to me that the ending should have been a bit more like a series of flashbacks. There were several points in the book where the characters could have simply said goodbye to each other. Instead the characters just had to go on and on and then get back together. I was wondering why the characters weren't allowed to just leave on their own.  :)   I am looking forward to the sequel because this book was just too good not to read another. I am sorry this book took me so long to finish.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a teenager who wants to be a good girl. When she gets caught with a few boys she is told she needs to be more careful because she has a reputation. However, there is a scene where she has sex with her boyfriend, a guy that she is trying to get back. He says she is making a mistake and should leave. It's just so stupid that he would say that. Why would he say that to her?   I know that the main character was a bad character, but I think the author should have shown more of her personality before she turned out to be the villain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a terrible cover.  It's an illustration of the book itself. ______________________________________________________________ "It's the first book I've read that's really good."  I've read a lot of good books.   One of my favorite books is a self-help book written by a woman who I used to date.  I'm not sure if it was the best book I ever read, but it was definitely one of the best books I've ever read.  The book is written for women by a female, so if you don't think women should write about their feelings and have a healthy life, you might not like this book.  She does, however, write in a way that makes her story accessible to both women and men.  One of my friends commented that she was disappointed in the book because she didn't find anything in it that she found empowering.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure this is a book for women who think they need to be strong, independent, and take charge.  In other words, I don't like this type of book for myself.  If you are looking for a self help book that will give you hope, help you with your issues, and give you a little bit of fun, then I highly recommend you try this book out.  You might not find everything in it you want, but you'll definitely learn a lot about yourself and your strengths and weaknesses.  For the purposes of this review, I am not going to write about anything I did not like about this book because I didn't.  There are a few things I wish I had said that would have made this book better.  "I don't have a boyfriend.  But if I did, I would ask him to stay the night."   This quote has a quote on the back.  This was the quote I liked the most.  To me, this is the type of advice that you should give your boyfriend, husband, or significant other.  "I was always pretty good at solving my problems myself, but I always had to call a man in order to get my way."  This is what I liked about this quote.  A lot of people have said to me that I'm a pretty smart person.  My answer to that is, I work hard at it.  When I was younger I was always good at taking things apart and putting them back together.  That's one of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book should have been called "The Story of a Boy who is a Man, by a Man." The first two chapters are good, but the rest of the book is so riddled with stereotypes that it's difficult to follow the story. The story of a man who has been raised by a woman but has no idea what a woman is, how a woman acts or thinks, and why a woman would do something as terrible as killing her own children. It is also filled with all the typical tropes of the "man's man" type characters: a man's man who's always up for adventure, a man with a big heart, and a man that women love because of his intelligence. I think this book would be better if it had been written by a female author. However, this book is filled with action and adventure and is a good read."
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I bought this book because it was about a young boy who wants to become a real wizard. I was expecting some epic story that would change my view on the wizarding world. However, the story is not very good. It is a well written and enjoyable book that I enjoyed reading. However the story was slow paced and not interesting at all. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. If it was an epic story like Harry Potter, I think I would enjoy it more. If you don't like Harry, you probably won't like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was given a copy of this book by my good friend who has read it and liked it, so I bought it. I didn't have a lot of expectations about it, and I'm still waiting to see how it turns out. This book is full of bad ideas. The whole thing is really not very well thought out and a lot about the same subject as other reviews said.   The main character is an AI called a'mind' which is designed to look after the AI. The AI has a lot in common with an android. The mind is designed by humans to make it look as if they know what they are doing. There are many things in this book that are very similar to things I have seen in other books and movies. For example, a person can be 'programmed' to behave like an animal, or even an animal that is in distress. There is even an android who has been programmed to look like a child and to react like one. The main character has a little sister, so it is hard to believe that they are not siblings.   of course there is also a robot and an android, which are very realistic. It's very strange how the book doesn't really focus on the main character at all, even though he is the main focus. In fact, the main part is about the robot and his attempts to escape from his creators. It is a very short book with very little information. It also is quite confusing as the story seems to skip a lot. I have read many of the other'minds' books and found that the main mind is not a mind at all. The book is more about how a person is programmed.  - the ending was really confusing, and hard to follow   Overall, I give this book a 1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a fan of the books in this series and have read many reviews about it, but I bought this one for my daughter.  Her favorite characters in all of the series are the witches and they are all evil and wicked.    This book was no different and we had to re-read the whole series after this one.  We did not read the second book until a couple of years later.  This book is also a series, so I am guessing the sequel will be good.  My only complaint is the ending, which is just a little disappointing.  The characters have a lot of potential but the author doesn't use it to its full potential and just makes them all horrible.  I will probably never read this series again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can see this book getting a few stars but not 4. It's a good read but the only reason it's only 4 stars is because the ending was the worst I've ever read. I'm pretty sure there were better endings but it was the only one I could find that made sense to me. It was like they had no idea what to do with the character.   The book was interesting. It kept me interested the whole way through and even though I knew the ending I was still interested in how the book went. It felt like the author could have easily gotten better endings if they had gone in a different direction but I guess they were too invested in this one.   I do have to say that this was my first book by a woman and I liked the book because it was different. It also had a few things that I liked about the male character that I couldn't find in the female. It may be a good idea to keep the female characters separate from the male characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The book was okay. The main character was just a little too smug for my liking. He kept telling everyone that his book was the best thing ever and I can tell he had no idea that he was writing a bad novel.

If you have been reading this blog for a while and want a quick overview of the topics then this book is perfect for you.

The best thing I've ever read on the subject of mental illness,  It's easy to understand, easy to apply, , .  the content is easy to comprehend,  and it's not a bunch of self-pitying gibberish.   There's some good and some bad, but I'll try to review some good.   in the beginning you'll learn that the illness itself is a physical illness and that mental illness is a mental illness. Mental illness is characterized by a variety of symptoms that can be quite severe. They range from hallucinations, delusions, to paranoid beliefs.  , and many other things. The second chapter is very good and discusses some of the symptoms. It also covers some of some of what the symptoms may be.  -The main thing that I took away from this book was the explanation of the concept of "reactive mind". The idea is that the brain's immune system is constantly trying to kill itself by causing over-stimulation in the central nervous system. It's not really clear what is going on here, but it's an interesting concept.   a good book, but a bit complicated.   for someone that is trying to understand what the disorder is like it is very easy to get lost in the details. it is not easy to grasp.  .     if you are looking for something easy to digest to get started with you can do better.  and if you're looking for a good general introduction to mental health you could do a lot worse than this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really boring story, a story of a young woman, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, being raised by her family and finding a new home in the world of business, and then finding out that the entire world thinks her a whore, that she was forced into prostitution. She's never really allowed to do anything except work for the man, so the reader is supposed to be sympathizing with her, and feeling sorry for her, but it just doesn't work. The man in question is a total jerk, he treats her like shit and even when she does something that might be illegal or immoral, he never seems to take the time to think about it or make any kind of effort to help her or give her any kind positive reinforcement. She just becomes a punching bag for everyone, a "tramp", and the book doesn't give her a reason to actually believe she's better than that, she's just "there to do his dirty work" and she just becomes his trophy, and we get to see the poor kid, her mom and her sister's reactions as the story progresses. The ending was extremely weak, it doesn't really say anything about anything, it's just another one of those cheesy ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was disappointing. I like to see characters get some sort of happy ending, but this was just another boring book about a boring character with no development. The writing style was okay, but I feel like the story was told in a way that didn't give it enough time to breathe. It was like an episode of a TV show, except it was over too soon. I was hoping that the main character would grow up, but she didn't. I'm disappointed because I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it if you're looking for something different from the typical fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited for this book, because it is the first of a new series of books about vampires.  In this book the vampire and the protagonist's relationship is so bad that it has to be the first book in a series.    There is nothing that I enjoyed about this book.  The story starts off with a vampire named David who is trying to kill his wife who has just returned to her family in New Orleans after a long stay in England.  He has two sons, Adam and David.  One night after having a very passionate sex with his wife, she dies and then he turns into a vampire.  It doesn't help that he has to take care of Adam, who is now an adolescent and a teenage boy who has no real love for his father.  In addition to that, his son is the victim of a vampire attack.  After that David finds out that his wife is a vampire and goes to the cemetery to try and kill her, but fails because of the powers of the vampires. After that he and Adam go to a hospital in the city and Adam is bitten.  Once he gets bit David is forced to kill Adam.  This is the beginning of the book and I would have been very satisfied if the book had ended there.  But no, the vampire who was trying to murder his wife turned into a werewolf and the rest is history.  David goes on a killing spree and gets bit by three more werewolves and gets more and more sick.  I think I was supposed to be scared but I was so bored.  What I do like about the story is that it is set in the 1800's and so I think that this is an interesting setting for a vampire novel.  The setting is a little creepy and a little strange, which I like a lot.  Also the author doesn't give too much time to the vampire.   I am not sure how I feel about the book because it was a horrible book.   What I didn't like about this review:  I really wanted to like this book but it is just so bad.    Overall I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very interesting book, and the ideas are interesting, but the book is a disappointment in some places. I really thought that it would have been good, and in the end, it was only a good book that was not so good in other parts of the story. It is a book about people who can be quite successful and successful people. It has some very interesting ideas and some good ideas. I have to say that this is the best book I have read about being a successful person. However, I can not recommend this book because of its bad endings.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________ This book is full of errors. I will try to keep my critique brief, but please bear with me. First of all, I cannot find any evidence in the book that the author was ever a Christian. Second of all I am shocked that there is a chapter dedicated to the "Famous" Bible stories. For example the story of the woman taken in adultery. It is the story as found in 2 Peter 2:18-19. I am amazed at the author's ignorance about the Bible. I think that the reason that he is trying to show that Jesus and Paul were not Christians is that he does not know enough about them to know if they were. I hope that this book helps some people get the message that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. I also wish that the book could have been more honest about the people in it. I do not believe that the authors have the credentials that they claim to have. I feel that it is a sad commentary on the state of the world that there are some who would take advantage of people like the authors to mislead them about the gospel. If anyone has any more questions about this book, feel free to contact me. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book. Thanks again,
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book is just horrible. I got it for free, and I think it is an attempt at humor. I found it to be rather silly and I don't think the author thought it through as well as it could have. This is the second book that I have read by this author and it is the only one that I will not read ever again. I have tried to like him before, but this book is the worst that I've read from him. I really don't understand why anyone would want to listen to him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think it was a mistake to give this book a star, because the book is not a bad one. I think the reason the book has a bad rating is because it's a very bad book. I will say this: the first half is about the story of the war between the humans and the aliens. The second half is the story that the alien species is going through right now. I thought that the aliens did not feel real. I felt that they were a different species, and a different kind of life. I liked how the aliens spoke English, and even talked about the food that they ate. I also liked how they were being watched and were a little bit afraid of us humans. But I was not a fan of the way the aliens felt about humans. I'm sure that they would love to kill us humans, but that doesn't mean that they love us. I was disappointed with how much I enjoyed the second half.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book was terrible. It took me 3 hours to read, and it was boring." So it's really about the writing. So it's kind of a waste of your time if you're not looking for the right book, and this book is not worth reading if you want to learn the techniques that make a great book.  I know that this book will be a classic for some time to come. If you like the idea of getting better with the techniques you've learned over the years and want to get a jump start on it, I highly recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. There is no plot. There's no character development. The pacing is slow, and there's not a lot of action. The characters are boring and the characters that are interesting are killed off way too early. The ending is just lame.   I've seen a few reviews complain about the author being racist. I don't know about that. I've never really considered myself a racist person. I'm not sure I can see why someone would find it offensive. I suppose I have an inferiority complex, but I don  This is a book that I really, really, didn't want to read. I am not ashamed to admit that. It's one of those books that makes you want to throw your Kindle in the garbage because you are so disappointed with it.   "The Black Cloud" by A.J. Hartley is not a good book. It was written by a racist. It is a poorly written book that doesn't even try to make any kind of effort to make itself likable. It just tries to be racist.   a bad review because of the author's racist comments:   There are some parts of this book that are just plain racist. For example, the main character is an "uneducated Negro" that is living in a "slum" in Harlem. The "niggers" in the book all live in "white" neighborhoods. They also all have fancy cars, wear designer clothes and drink expensive wine. The author tries to make it seem like they all have the same problems. It doesn't work that way. I think it's a great idea for a book to show that everyone has problems, but you need to show them in a different way. Instead of making everyone black, make them all people from a different culture. It shows that all cultures have their own problems, and it helps to show people from different cultures that their problems are not as bad as everyone thinks they are.     Another problem I had with this book was that there was a whole section about the Black Panthers and it was completely ignored in the end. The book also spends a lot time talking about how the "niggaz" are lazy. This isn't really a problem in a book like this, but it doesn't fit the tone of the book.   of the other reviewers who say the book is racist:   the book was a poor choice of book for me. I had heard about it
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is too long and too boring to be a good story. The main character is too boring and his actions are not realistic. The characters are not as interesting as they should be. This book is a huge waste of time. I will not be reading any more of this book. Review:  I like to read science fiction. It gives me the chance to explore different worlds and different concepts. But when I read a science fiction book I really look for a good, good story and a good plot. Well, I found none of that in this book - it is a really bad book. I don't understand how a good writer can write such a bad story, and why it was allowed to be published. It started out as a fun, fast paced book that was really fun to read. Then suddenly I was left in a dark place, I could not see anything, my head was spinning and my heart was beating out of my chest. My head was really hurting and I just wanted to throw up. The story is very confusing and confusing in a bad way. I was reading this book like I was drunk. There was just no way I could follow what was going on. The whole book felt like a bad acid trip, it made me feel like I wanted to vomit, and I really felt like I needed a shower. I did not want to look at the book any more. It was really frustrating, and made me hate the book even more. This is not a good book and I'm not giving it a good rating. I'd give it a 0/10, it's so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ "You want to know what a real hero is?

I hated this book! It was boring, slow, and made me hate the characters. I was bored to death. I mean, seriously, it took like, 45 pages to get into the main plot of the book! I mean come on. Who's in this book to make a good first impression? Who cares if this book is just another boring sci-fi book? I'm tired of books where I'm like 'This is just boring!' And I'm sick of the fact that so many authors have decided to write about sci- fi and fantasy in the first place. I don't need that crap. Why can't they just write good, well-written books? I have no interest in reading more books like this! I'll probably skip it in future if I see it on my shelf!" ___________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is an absolute failure.  I read it before I even had my first child and I thought it was great.  The book is about a man who was born without arms and legs.  He lives in a small town with his mother and sister.   The father is a drug addict.  This is about the mother and the father.  The mother is very sick with cancer and is dying.  I know this sounds like a horrible way to die but she is still alive and so is her son.  So he goes to her house and tries to make a deal with the father and tell him he can take his drugs away.  It seems to work but not for long.  They end up fighting and it turns into a very nasty fight.  After the fight is over they decide to stay together and the mother goes to die in peace.  She says she will be back but not before she leaves a message.    So that's the book.     It is a very short book and I found myself not liking the book at all.  For the price it should have been good but I found it very depressing.  If you are looking for a short book that has a happy ending try this out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is a train wreck! I think I am in the minority here, but I did not like this book at all. This book starts off as a good one, but by the end I was just completely bored with it. It was very long, and there was no payoff. It felt like it went on for hours and hours, but there was not a lot of action. It is not a good book for a beginner, because the book could have been shortened a lot to make it easier to read. If you want to learn about basic cooking and can deal with a lot, this is a good choice. But if you don't want to have to go through the whole book, I wouldn't recommend it at all! I give it a C.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is horrible! The story is so bad, it's unbelievable. It's about a woman who has no clue how to do anything except take care of her dog. She has no idea about anything! She doesn't know how to cook, she doesn't even know how the internet works, she's a terrible driver, she gets sick all the time and has no money to get the vet, and she's on her deathbed with a cat she got from a shelter and a dog that she got as a baby. I thought I would give this a 1 star because the story is bad, but now I'm thinking I might not be so forgiving. I mean, you're not supposed to take care off someone else's dog, right? This book just doesn't make sense. I really don't understand how this is going to be a best seller, it seems like such a waste of time. It feels like a novel written by a child and it's just so stupid! I feel like I'm reading a terrible book! This book should never have been written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping to read more about a particular area in which I am interested. I was very disappointed in this book and it is not a good read for me. The author was very clear about her biases, which are obvious, and her bias was to attack Islam and all Muslims. The book is very thin, so much so that you can easily lose interest in the subject, which is not good. I also had a very hard time with the cover art, which looked too much like the Quran.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ The book was a bit dull. The narrator never had the slightest idea what was going on in this story, which made it hard to follow. The book ended on a cliffhanger but it seemed that they would come back for more in the next book. The ending was very lame. I don't want to read more about a boring man, but I really didn't feel the story needed to continue any further. I think I will have to wait for another book by the same author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I am disappointed in this book. There is little in this that I have not heard before." I agree, but I did not know that the subject was so well known. I would have loved to read more on the subject. I do not feel like I am wasting my time reading this book, it is too similar to many other books on the topic and not worth my time.  I will try again in a few years and hopefully find a good book about the subject to read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a very bad book. It is a terrible piece of work that has been put together to sell some sort of novel. It's the book of the same name that has the same basic plot with minor differences. The only difference is the protagonist is a girl and not a boy. The story takes place in the same universe as the first book (the universe which contains many other similar books) but not the same time frame. The premise is that the girl is born with the power to do anything she wants and the male protagonist has to learn to control his powers because his mother has died. The protagonist in the second book was a guy and he got the girl but it was never really explained why the first one did not get the girl and why she got the guy. The main character in this book is an overweight man. He has an amazing power that he has to be able to lift heavy objects and he is constantly being bullied by girls. His power is not really used much in the story. The girls seem to have no problem with him or his weight. I really wanted to hate the character but I was too disappointed with the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book is a disaster. It's full of spelling mistakes, badly-written prose and boring plot. If I had known that the story was about the author's daughter being abducted and sold into slavery, I would have been a lot more skeptical." Posted by Vybix at 2:55 AM I just finished reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the idea of the Hornets, I enjoyed reading about the Horneteer. I especially liked the fact that the author actually has an aunt who is a hornet. I think it is a nice touch that she is also the granddaughter of the inventor of the first hornet-dispensing machine. I do think there is a lot of potential for this story and I hope the author continues to write and produce more books like this. I have not finished the book yet but am looking forward to reading it in the near future. I would recommend this to anyone who loves science fiction and fantasy. It is a fast read and I loved the fact it was in the middle of the month. I also loved the cover. It was very cool and a great image of the hornet's nest. The book is available on Amazon for just $5.00. Posted at 2.15 AM by T.S. at December 7, 2006 12:35 PM I thought the hornets were a great addition to the story. I am a fan of the book and have been looking forward for the next installment. Thanks for sharing this with us. "I have not started reading this book, but am eager to read it. I loved it. Thank you." "My wife and I had a blast reading the book together!" "This is a wonderful story and we loved it." It was great. It brought a lot to the Hornettes that I had never thought of before. They were not just a group of crazy people. I thought the main character was very well written and well developed. I liked the way she handled her problems. I was impressed by the way the author dealt with the problems the hornettes had with the world. I felt that the world that the Hornettes inhabited was very real. It wasn't like a world from a book. It had a real feeling to it. It gave the Hornette's a lot going for it. The only thing that was a bit odd was the way they came across
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ I was expecting a bad read but this book just made me feel bad. I felt sorry for the characters. I had expected a lot more from a book of this type. I thought there would be more character development and a better ending to the story. I really liked the first part of the book and I thought that the characters were interesting but then the plot took over and ruined it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you're going to read a book about a time in history when a new religion is emerging, don't read this book. There is nothing good about it, nothing good at all.  The time frame is not as historically accurate as some books that have come out in the last 5 years. There were a few good characters in this book, but the rest of them were a bit too perfect and perfect. If I had to sum this book up in one sentence, it would be "I'm not a Mormon" or "I've been lied to, but I'm still going to try and do the right thing." The "do the right" part is easy, because you have to go through a process where you question everything you were taught about yourself and the world. It's a really hard thing to do. You may not get it right the first time and you may be the last person to ever see it happen, but it's worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This book has no substance. I have been reading for years and I've never been disappointed. The book is about a woman who has no money and is trapped in a situation. She is not an angel. She has a child and her boyfriend is abusive. So, she goes into a shop, takes out a bunch of useless stuff, and puts the money in her purse. So she does the shopping. The lady at the shop asks for her debit card, but she refuses. She says she has a lot of things in the purse. The woman then says she can't give the card because it's a fake and she will report her. So the woman says she doesn't have any money in the first place. She walks out of the shop, and goes back to her apartment and locks the door. The only reason she does this is because she has nowhere to go and she's scared. So as the girl goes to her home, she hears a knock at the door and it is her boyfriend, who is beating her up and threatening her. I really thought this would have been a really good book but this one is awful. I feel so bad for the girl who got this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a really good book that teaches you about the ins and outs of writing, look no further than this book.

You have also motivated me toward working for a living, because folks, if you can't go to work for a pittance doing something you love, you need to get out of the classroom and into the work force.

It's got so much interesting information, I can't wait to read it! This is a book that is very good and informative. It covers everything you need to know about how to handle your finances!

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ "This is a pretty good read. I was surprised at how well the characters were written. I would like to see the author do more with them. The book is about a girl who gets pregnant at 13.

I really liked this book."  – The Book Peddler  "I am just now finishing the book and I think that it is going to be a good book for me to read at the beginning of the month. I do not think that the story will make me want to have a baby right away, but I like the characters and their development. I think the author did a good job of introducing the main characters and the events that are going to happen. The author did not forget to give the story some twists that I hope will be explained later on."  in addition to the great writing, the story is not boring and it has a twist at the end. It is a good story, especially for young teens and teenagers who love to read!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the story in this book at all. It's so cliché that it's hard to believe that it could be true. It was more like a horror story in my opinion. It felt very cheap. I don't even know why they used a young adult book as a book for kids. If they had used a horror novel, it might have been different. The characters were all very uninteresting. The main character, Denna is annoying as can be. The other characters are also annoying. I would rather read a horror book with a lot more gore and blood than one about a teen that's so boring. If you like to read horror stories, you might like this book, but if you don't, then I wouldn't recommend it to you. 10 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in my first year of university and I think it was pretty bad. The main character was a little bit annoying and there were parts where I was wondering what he was thinking, like how did he think that the girl was actually a guy? Also I found it rather funny that the main character has to get rid of a girl that is way too good for him (i.e. super intelligent) and then he thinks he can get away with it? It just seems a bit silly to me. The only good thing about this book is that there is a second book in the series. I would recommend this book to the girls who are like me: they are super smart and know exactly what they want. It's not so much the plot of this book that I can't get into it, but it is the writing. It felt really long and not as interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a classic case of a book written for a particular audience, but done badly by an author whose ability to write a decent book was limited. I liked the first half of this book but the ending just made me sad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only boring, it's boring to me, too. I just found it extremely difficult to read and that I'd rather just have the book itself. The characters don't move along at a good pace either. I find it extremely hard to believe they ever get any closer to the ending, because the book is so slow and meandering. I know I can read better than this, but I'm just so tired of books like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   First off, I would like to say that I have not read any of the other books in this series. I only picked up this book so I could compare the two.   The book starts off with a bit of a surprise. We are introduced to the main character in a rather surprising manner. We learn that the main characters parents were murdered and that the author is a bit obsessed with them. She goes on to describe how she has no friends because of her parents death and how she would like a chance to make up for the loss. She also describes how her father was abusive to her mother and how her mother was in an abusive relationship with a man. We then are introduced into the characters family. We meet their mother and her son. She is a very interesting character and a great character to listen to. She does not just talk about her feelings and how sad she is. She has a great amount of knowledge about her family. The main character is described as being a sweet little girl but she is very quick to anger. She can get really angry. The character has a huge crush on the main male character. He is a little boy. We also meet his father. He has a big role to play in the story and he seems a bit unstable and not like his father would.  , I found this book a bit confusing. I was wondering why we had to follow the main female character around the city when she was only there to see her family and to be around her friends. I also was wondering if there was a chance that she was not who she seemed to be. I do not want to spoil the story so I will not say what happened but I found it a little difficult to follow.   the characters are very interesting and it was fun to hear about their stories. They have a lot of depth. The story seemed a little confusing at first but I do understand how the author wrote it. I have never seen a book with this many characters in it so I do think that it could have been difficult to keep track of all of them. I did enjoy reading about the main woman character. I think she was a nice character to read about.   was a very good read. It was fun reading about her and the others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book had some good points and a few bad ones but they were offset by a few things that made it very frustrating and unenjoyable. The first two or three times I read this book I got a few chuckles out of it. I think it is a very good read for anyone who enjoys fantasy and/or science fiction, but it was frustrating because I got into the story and started enjoying the characters, but the author wasn't able to give me anything in the way of a story that was interesting or engaging. I had to go to the back of the book to look up the main character and it took me way longer to find him than I expected to. And then there was the fact that the story didn't really have anything to do with anything else in the book except the main conflict that he was in. I would have liked to see more of the world and the different people that inhabit it. But I guess I will just have to wait for the next book because I know I'll be getting bored and bored with this one. I gave it 2 stars. It was not a bad read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********I have not read this book in quite a while, and I was shocked by some of the stuff that I read. I would have liked to have been more impressed. The story was about a man who lives in the country and finds a new friend and a love interest in a beautiful and young girl, but he's a poor man and can't afford a big house and all the things that come with it. The whole thing was very well written.   I am surprised to see that I have such a negative impression of this book. I didn't find anything bad about it, though I'm sure it could be better. I don't see why I would give it a bad review. It was a very good read and very enjoyable. I think I will give this book another shot when I get a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a B+. I had a hard time believing the claims that this was a "historical" book about "Celtic culture" or even that it was a real book, given that it has no references to actual documents, and that the authors' attempts at explaining Celtic language usage and history was pretty feeble. The book is a collection of brief anecdotes, all fairly well-researched, but the anecdotes were all in the first person, and they were all written in a way that seemed to make them seem like they were being told by a second person, not by a person who was actually there. So I ended up thinking of them as having been written by a third person, who had an idea of what they were going to say, but who then forgot to record it or change the wording when the subject changed. For instance, one story said that Celtic music was more like the music of the Romans than of the Celts, but this idea seemed to change the following day, when the author forgot to add that the Romans had "a lot of musical styles," which was a fairly major point. (It also seemed like this person, after the subject change, changed the original story to have the Celto-Roman link.) This also bothered me a lot because the book is full of stories about Celtic music that were later changed to fit into the historical timeline (i.e., the Celtophoric period, in which there was a lot of change, and then the Celtic culture changed, and so on). The most interesting of these, however, was a story about a Celtic man who, as a teenager, would dance in a circle around a bonfire and sing a song about the "wonders of the sea" and the "glorious sun," but only in Celtic, and only for a very short time. Then he would stop and go back to dancing, which seems like it's a good story that should be remembered. But then the book said, "Yes, the Celting Man did do this. It is said that his mother and sisters tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen." But then I read in the back of the book that the Celton Man was actually a man named Cilted who was famous in the 18th century. I read more about him, and found out that his story was a bit less fantastic than it had seemed in the book. The story of his dancing around
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had a difficult time with this book.  It's a very, very slow-paced, boring book. And the author makes no effort to cover the topic of how the government, at the time of the book, was attempting to combat a plague.  It's so sad to say this about a book that is so well-loved.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is an utter disaster. The only thing that is right about this book is that it was written by a guy who really doesn't know what he is doing. It is written like a book about a person who really wants to make a lot of money. He has a great plan to make millions in the stock market but he ends up losing almost everything, he gets caught up in a scam and ends up bankrupt. The ending is very unsatisfying and he loses his life. This book is filled with a lot o' mistakes and mistakes that are not the author's fault. The book is so filled with mistakes that I felt like the author was trying to do everything but make it up as he goes along. I also felt like I didn't really learn anything about investing and the stock markets. The author is a very good writer, but I don't see a lot to recommend this book.   The bad:  -The author is obviously very much a fan of the stockmarket. He doesn't really know what to do in the market so he just makes up things as he writes it.  --I really don't get how the author made money. All of his money went to pay his lawyer.  of his lawyer's lawyer. -It was a long, long time since he last sold stocks.  (Why is he going to work so hard and make such a big mistake only to be out of the money by the end of the book? Is he stupid or is he just really bad at making money?)  (Why isHe going toWork so hardand make such amark than by theend of the books? IsHe stupid or Ishe just really at makingmoney?) -The stock market was so unstable and unpredictable. The markets were going up and down like crazy, and he was losing money constantly. He had a lot in stocks, but it was very unstable and very unpredictable. -The ending is extremely unsatisfying. The stock market goes up and he ends with no money left. (It was obvious that he was not going to make money at all, but the author decided to finish it off so he could get the last line. I was not interested in this book at all.)   -Some of the mistakes he makes are very hard to figure out because he doesn't actually tell you what he was thinking or why he made them. I didn the author had a bad plan and the market went up and the book ended
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first 5 pages were so bad, I thought I was reading a parody. I mean, come on.  A dog who is in love with a human and has a pet cat, and who has an entire world that's just filled with people and food and sex and violence and people and violence.  There's a whole world to be filled with violence and sex.  This book was a great lesson about love and relationships, but it's really the violence that ruined it for me.  The violence that is so pervasive in the first 5 books in the series is just so disgusting, and the sex, not so much.  I mean it's not just the sex; there's the constant physical abuse, the constant mental abuse, and it just doesn't feel right to me. The world that is supposed to be full of love and happiness is so full of cruelty.  When I started reading the first book, I really didn't know if this book would be good or bad, but once I started the series, I didn't want to put it down.  In a perfect world, I'd love to read this book again.   I love how there's so much going on. There's so many characters that you don't know who they are, and how they relate to each other, and you're constantly learning.  And I love the way that the series has been building up to the big reveal that everyone in the world has been in love for a really long time, and they all know it, and everyone in that world is so confused.    So I loved the series.  It's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but I enjoyed the series so much, I just couldn't let it go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a bad story. I did like the concept and the concept is really cool. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the concept, it's good, but the book is so poorly written it made me angry.   The characters are all completely unlikable. They all have something going on that they need to hide. The best part is that you never find out what it is they are hiding. You just think they have a problem and they just want to hide it. It was also nice to see some of the villains. I don't want to spoil it for you, but I was really disappointed with the villains because the villain was just so stupid and I just could not believe a book with such good concepts couldn't have a better villain.   The author makes it sound like the book will have a happy ending, but it doesn't. The author just wants to have you think the characters are happy. I wanted to see them actually having a good time and I didn't.  , I really wanted to like this book. It had the concept of an underground world with secret people living there, and they were all hiding something, but they don't tell you what it was. I found it really interesting. I think it would be cool to read more about this underground world. The book was so well written that it was hard to put it down. I enjoyed it very much. I also liked that the author had some cool ideas about the underground world that I didn' want to give up on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an absolutely terrible book that will only cause the author to make worse books in the future. I would rather read the original novel than read this abomination of a book.  The story itself is very boring and the characters are just as dull as the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________   This is a very good book about a very serious subject. However, there are too many examples of the author's bad writing style. I did not understand anything he said, he was making things up as he went along. It's like the author is trying to be funny in his writing but can't.   I'm glad that I read this book. However if you are reading it for the historical details, then be warned. It does not do a good job of explaining things. It would be better if he had included a more detailed description of what he is talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book a few weeks ago and have not been able to finish it. I'm not a big fan of horror/thriller, but I'm glad I read this book because it is a really bad book. I love that I read the synopsis before reading the book and that I had an idea of the book from reading the synopsis. I am very disappointed because I really wanted to love this book. The ending was awful and I feel like it was written with a very short book and not the kind of story you want to read over and over. I will not be reading any more of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********This book was a bad experience. My kids have already started reading it. My daughter has started reading the first two books, but she hates the book now because the plot is boring and the characters are stupid. The book was written in a way that it would have made a good grade for a first grader. It is a good idea to make sure you understand the story before you begin, but I think the story is poorly executed. I can understand if you are trying to do a children's book, but this is not the book to use. If you want to get a good book for your child, I recommend: "A Good Book for Little Girls" by L.J. Stewart (2003)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It's a terrible book, a bad attempt to get a book into the hands of people who don't already know a lot about the subject and who are looking for something new and entertaining to read." A book that could have been so much better if it were better organized, if it had better writing, if the authors had made their book better. I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this book, but I can't help but be disappointed by the book.  I have a hard time believing that this book was written by someone who didn't have a clue about the topics they chose to cover.  The book starts out with the author saying that the title is a bit misleading, as this book has nothing to do with UFOs or aliens, or even with UFOs, but instead with the fact that it is the author's job to "tell the truth".  The main character in the book, Paul, is not exactly a person who is in the know about UFO subjects, as he has an "unwillingness to be convinced" (p. 3) and his "faith in the 'official' stories is unshakable" (ibid.).  He is also the kind of person who doesn't want to believe that "they are lying" (2). Paul's faith in the official stories is further reinforced by his belief that aliens are visiting Earth.  He believes that "there are no aliens" (1), "the stories are a hoax" (4), and "the aliens are hiding" (3).  In other words, the stories about aliens are just made up.  Paul is one of those people who is always looking for the "missing piece" (8) that explains how "all these things work together" (11).  I don't think Paul is the only person in the world who would say this, but if he is, then this book could have benefited from having Paul's views as opposed to the views of other authors. The book doesn't have much of an idea of the topic, and I'm not too sure that it even has a good idea of what the subject is supposed to be about.  In fact, one of the most interesting ideas that the book has is the idea that aliens have been visiting Earth for a very long time (ibids.).  This is something that I am sure most people who believe in the "official" stories of UFOs and aliens have thought about
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is a waste of time. There are too many problems with it to even rate it. I got the book because I like Stephen King. I'm not sure how he's managed to make so many books that are bad, but I can't give it less than a 1 star. The only good thing about this book is that you can read the first two chapters and see what happens. I don't know how they could make a book like this that is bad. The badness of this book starts with the first chapter. This book has a bad beginning. The first chapter starts with a flashback to a man who has died and we learn his name. The man in the flashback is a young boy who dies in the woods. We are told that he's an only child and that his parents were killed when he was very young. This is all we get to know about the boy and his family. Then in the next chapter we find out that he is a very sick boy who is dying. The boy is kept alive with his parents help and that's it. No other information is given about him. Then the book is told from the perspective of the dead boy and it gets worse. We get to see the dead man's house in the first few pages and we find that it is in disarray. The house is in terrible shape and there are several things broken. The next chapter shows the house covered in mold. The final chapter is the house with a dead body in it. It is an open casket so the dead body is laying on the bed. This chapter is so bad that it breaks my heart. The worst part is that there is a book in the book called "A Boy and His Dog" by King. It tells a completely different story about a boy who doesn't get a dog and the boy's parents don't want him to get a pet. This isn't bad in itself but it is the last chapter of the book. Then at the end of the chapter there is one sentence about the dead girl. Then King goes on to tell the story about how the boy will live and how the girl died. I was so sad and upset by the last sentence. The last sentence of the last book is worse than the first. It's a sentence that says "This book is not for children." I had to look it up. It says this: ************************** "A boy and His dog: the tale of the girl and her
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************   It was a great idea and good idea, but unfortunately, it was a very poorly written book. There are a lot of different stories in it, but it's hard to follow them all. The pacing is slow, and I really can't stand the protagonist. I'm not sure if she's evil or what, but she has a tendency to make me angry. She's a little arrogant, but I just can't get behind her character.   I do like that the book was written in a different way, but the prose is a little bit clumsy. It makes me wonder why the author did not just write the book in a more professional manner.     The book could have been more interesting, but still very good. I would have liked to see more of the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping for something different from this series but this is the usual "mysterious woman who lives in a mysterious house" tale. The characters are a bit too similar.   -Cindy was a good girl with a troubled past. She has trouble trusting people and even herself. She doesn't trust herself either.  -Hannah was a bit of a jerk. She did things that she should have known were wrong. . She just wants to be loved and have a good life.  in the end she has to decide who she is and what she wants. It took me a while to figure out who was the bad guy in this story.   I also liked the romance between Cindy and Hannah. It was good. The chemistry between them was good and the scenes between them were great.   I thought that it was a lot of fun reading this book. The author uses a lot humor in this book and I loved the banter between Cindy, Hannah and even the author. If you have any interest in paranormal or mystery I would recommend this book to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I purchased this book in order to make an audiobook version. I was hoping for a fun, entertaining book but was surprised when I read it. The characters in this book were so flat and stereotypical that it just seemed like they were there to be funny. The way they talk and their interactions are so wooden that I'm wondering how a human being can talk that way. Even the people they encounter are flat. The world is so boring and generic that I felt like I was watching the movie "The Day After Tomorrow." It was just a waste of time. I just don't recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________  When I first read the book I was not impressed. I did not find it a very good read. I could not make heads or tails of the author's use of language, and the story itself was somewhat confusing, although I would have to say that this was my second book by the author.  In any event, I am glad I read this one. I would not have had to re-read it twice if I had read it earlier.  the author is a good storyteller and he wrote an interesting story. . The character of Harry is a little off the mark in my opinion. There are many things he does that make him a very different character from the author, but the thing I found the most confusing was the author saying that the author of the book was going to write a story about the character's journey from his childhood to the end of the story, but not much has happened since then. Now, I don't think the author has the right to do this. I think it was probably just a mistake on the authors part, and he will probably do a better job of explaining things to the readers when he finishes the story. I am just glad he wrote a story with Harry, because I don´t like Harry as a character. He has a very serious personality, and it takes away from his ability to be funny and funny at the same time. I also feel that the book could have been written a little bit better. There were times when I just did not understand the author´s point of view on things. There was also one instance where I felt the author was trying to be ironic. This was a very minor thing, but it was still frustrating. I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good read for me.  a good book but I would recommend it to someone who has not read it before.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure that a lot of people love this book but it just doesn't stand up to the original. The story is very short, the characters are very simplistic and cliched, the plot is just a bunch of cliches, and the ending just seems really rushed. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the author has a lot to offer in terms of writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book, if you can even call it a book, is a train wreck. The narrator, a woman, is not a great narrator. Her delivery is stilted and not very good. There are times when she is just making things up as she goes along and is so very boring. There is a lot of reading that is required of her to try to make this a good book. The author is just so off about everything, about how it is and how it shouldn't be. I mean this book, I will give it an 8 because there are some great scenes, some that I can actually see myself watching. I guess if you have to read this book for a story, you should just do it, but it is a huge disappointment to me.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. I was hoping it would be a story about a young man's struggles to find his place in the world after a near death experience, but I'm disappointed because the book is so boring. The characters all talk about the same things: family, friends, religion, love. The story is told in flashbacks, and we see the same thing happen to the main character over and over. I wanted more. I didn't like the book. I'm not sure if the author did this on purpose or not. Maybe she has a lot of fans who don't like to be told their stories? I can't recommend this book to anyone. I just wish that there was a better way to tell the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard this book would be a good one and that is exactly what it is. However, I don't have the patience to listen to a book that is completely devoid of anything of value. The writing is slow and the story is poorly executed. The narration is really good though and I thought the narrator was perfect. The story is too simple to be enjoyable. I have to admit that I enjoyed the story but the story itself was too simple. The narrator's performance was perfect though. I'm sure that there is a way to make this book more interesting but I didn't find it in this book. It's definitely a worthwhile read but I'd advise against it unless you're a fan of Stephen King.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The book was written to a very specific audience. If you are a writer you will likely enjoy the writing. If not, it is likely not worth your time. It's a story about a boy who is adopted by a family who are rich and powerful. This is not the kind of story I want to read. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to stop reading. The characters in this book are extremely un-interesting. I felt that they did not add to the story. I was disappointed that they were not a part of the story at all. I think the author should have written about a different family or maybe the family that raised him. There is a reason that the story is called The Boy Who Couldn't Grow Up and that is because he was a little boy who never learned how to be a man. It was a very disappointing book. It does not deserve a 5 star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most entertaining and well written book I have ever read. The stories are interesting and the characters are likable. I would definitely recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about the book is that it's written in the first person, but it's so poorly written that it feels like it's actually written in third person.  I've read some very good third person books, but this one is so terrible that I feel like it was written by a fourth person. I can't imagine how any writer could have written such a bad third person book.  The story of the "Lost" is told from the perspective of a man named Joseph.   Joseph is an orphan who, after a car accident, is left in a remote area with no relatives.  He has been in the area for over a month.  While in the wilds he meets and befriends a boy who bears a striking resemblance to him.  Joseph believes the boy to be his brother.    However, as time passes, Joseph begins to wonder if the boy is not, in fact, his brother and if he was not actually in the wilderness.  The book is told in first person.   This is a terrible idea.  It makes no sense and is really not a good way to tell a story.  This is especially bad because there are a lot of characters in the book, and all of them have the same first person perspective.  We're never given any indication of what the other characters think of one another.  They're just kind of there.  I don't know what to think about this book. I really really want to give it a 5 stars, but I can only give it two because it's really bad. I gave it two stars because it was the first book I ever read in English. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for the first time in the library on my Kindle. I read it on the Kindle for the following reasons: 1. It is free. 2. It has a decent number of chapters and a decent plot. 3. I like to learn about history from a young age. 4. I don't want a history book to be boring or poorly written. 5. I have an advanced level in history. 6. I enjoyed this book. I will not buy it again. I'm sure that I will have a hard time actually reading it because I am too lazy to do a Google search.  It is an interesting history but, as a history fan, I found it boring. I am not even sure if this is a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________My husband and I bought a copy of the book, The Story of the Book. The cover was beautiful, but the inside of the hardcover is a mess.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I read this book and I am so disappointed. It is an awful book. I was excited to read this because I heard it was a historical novel and so I looked forward to it, but it turned out to be a terrible book. In the beginning the main character, Henry Green, is a good and righteous man and it shows in his actions. He is a man of God and it is hard for me to believe that God would allow such evil to happen. The first time I read about this story it sounded like a good story. Now that I have read about it it is so wrong. I am angry at God for letting this happen to someone like Henry Green. Henry has a very hard time dealing with the fact that his mother is cheating on him and his father is a drunk. After the cheating and the drunkenness, he begins to see that his father and mother are bad people and he does not want to be like them. It was so wrong for Henry to be so strong that he does what others would not and not to be strong enough to tell his father to leave his mother. The book made me angry at the characters of Henry Green and his mother because they were so evil. It makes me feel so bad for Henry and I hope this book doesn't make him a bad person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book is a collection of essays on the role of technology in society, from the perspective of people who do not have a technological background." This is a very odd review. In the book I wrote about, there is no mention of the technology being discussed. The only mention of technology is as a metaphor for a new way of working. The author also makes the point that technological change is not the same as technological innovation. Technology is used to explain how we are moving forward. It is not innovation. So, how can I rate this book? I would have to give this book a solid 2/5. If you have a background in a field like computer science, the book should be easier to read. It should be a good introduction to this new field of study. The reason I give this a 2/50 is that the book is not a good way to learn about this field of work. It takes a lot of effort to go through the material in this book. It also doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of analysis or discussion. It's really more a collection essay.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad. It had a bad cover and the author doesn't seem to understand the genre. I am sure she will sell a ton of books.

The book was not bad and I think that I will give her another chance and read her other books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "If I had read this book in high school I would have been crushed, but now that I'm a little older, I'm not sure how I'd feel.  This is the kind of book I'd have been forced to read at a time when I didn't have any money, and would have had to do it in my underwear, and have it be the worst book I've ever read, but at least I'd been forced into it." Read the full review here. The Dark Half - By Robert Aickman -  The story is that of two brothers who are the only survivors of a plague in the city of Nome, and their lives are ruled by the laws of the Dark Half. One is an artist and the other is a scholar. It's a story of magic, and it's one of the first books of the Aickmans. I am going to put this on the list of books that I haven't read and was excited to read when I saw that it was out. It is a very unique story that takes place in the future where all the major nations of the world are united by technology, and there is a war going on between the two factions. I thought that this was an interesting story and definitely not something that I would like to read again, but there are still a few things that I thought were interesting. "It's all in the language, is the way of the future." This book is a good, but not great book. It didn't feel like a good book and didn't do much for me. The story was a little hard to follow and the ending was not what I expected. I think that if I would read a book from this author I would enjoy it a lot more. The characters and the setting are very interesting and I really enjoyed the book. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy and science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book after my wife read a copy of the book and we had a discussion about how the story of this book is so different from the other books we have read. I have read this type of story before and it is a good book. However, this book was a mess in a way. The book starts out very good, with a lot of good action, suspense, and the plot is a great mystery. The problem is that it then goes downhill from there. It starts off so good, but the second half of the story doesn't follow up at all. The author tries to do a lot with the characters, but she doesn't do anything with them. I really hope the author works on her plot in future books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ The only thing I liked about this book was that it was the first book I've read by a young adult author who was clearly going to write a series. I thought this book would be a good start and then the next book will be better. The next book was more of the same, more angst and angst, more conflict and more angst. I would have enjoyed a shorter book, but I think that would have ruined the fun of reading a series of books by a very young author. ___________________________________________________  10 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a horrible book. It was a really terrible book, and it was hard to believe that it was written by a person that I know and respect.  There are a lot of things in this book that just don't make sense, and the author just makes them up to make the story work. It's like she is using her favorite characters and situations and making them work for her, but it just doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I gave this book 5 stars for the story, but 3 for the poor writing. I like the concept of the story. The problem is that the writing is very amateurish and badly done. The characters have a lot of character development that doesn't feel earned. I'm glad that the author decided to keep this book for adults, but I'm not a fan of the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has the potential to be a great novel, if it wasn't for the fact that it is a bit too repetitive. I'm sure that the author didn't really mean for this book to be so long. It's a book that is about the characters and their experiences and the world, but it's hard to care about any of the characters because of the lack of development in their lives.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________.  Read a positive review of a good book:___________  ___________   "There are some things you just can't understand about a person. The way they laugh at themselves, for example."   The author of this book is very good and very funny. But there is one thing that really irritates me about this book: the way she writes in all the stories, that the characters are not like people. It just annoys me and that is a problem, because I can understand why she writes that way.   But, when you have the story with the character that is funny and so funny and she is so good at it, but then she says that the character is not like that and she thinks about it and it just irritates my stomach. And then you get a character who is the opposite, who is so stupid and so ignorant and yet the author doesn't get that.  :)"And I had the great fortune of being told that I was the smartest girl in my high school. I didn't have a clue what I was talking about, but my mom was like, 'You know, there are other people who are just as smart as you are, you know. They just don't know it because they have no idea how smart they are. So if you want to be like them, you can be a scientist. Or a doctor. Or an engineer. You don't have to be a smart person to be an engineer.'"The author is not a great writer, but I enjoyed her stories a lot, and it's really nice to read a book with stories that are very different from each other. But the author seems to be trying to write the book that everyone wants to read.And the book starts with a story about the narrator's grandmother, who was so old that she couldn't walk and she was also so old, that she had to go to bed when she was four years old. And her grandmother was so tired that she fell asleep right there on the couch, in her own bed, on a warm winter's night. And so, her grandmother went to sleep and she never woke up.She was not the only one who had to be asleep on a cold night like that.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* ******************** I'm so disappointed in this book. I loved the idea of the book, the characters and the writing style. The book was amazing and I was very interested to see how the characters would interact with each other. I was so disappointed by the end of this book because the characters are just a bunch of idiots who just don't have a clue.   The story starts out with a very interesting and very exciting story. After two months of being in a hospital, the main character is able to return home. He is happy and excited and is back in the world of magic. However, after he returns home, he finds out that the woman he loves has been murdered. He's devastated and has a difficult time trying to deal with this. He decides to move in with his parents in order to be closer to his sister and try to forget about what has happened. It is only after a few days that he realizes that this woman has been dead for three months. He had an affair with a neighbor and had been having an affair of his own for a few months now. So after his sister moves out, he decides to stay with his mother and move back in.   a few weeks later, he is visited by the spirit of his dead wife who is now living in the house next door. She tells him that her husband has died and that she has to stay and get married. She leaves the house, but when she comes back, she tells the main protagonist that she doesn't want to marry him. He asks her to marry the other guy in the neighborhood and she says no, she will marry him, but not in front of him. It's very interesting that this story is about a guy who thinks that he is in love with his sister, but then realizes that the two are in fact a couple and the main romantic interest is not the sister, it's his wife.   the main antagonist of this story, the neighbor, is an extremely annoying, selfish, egotistical asshole. The main protagonist wants nothing to do with this asshole. After he finds her body, he realizes he has to get rid of this asshole or else he will never get over his sister. The neighbor is also a very stupid character. She is just a huge bitch who thinks she is right and does whatever she wants.   I just found this book so annoying. I could not believe that it was written by a girl. It just felt like she was trying to
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ The characters are a bit one dimensional, they are all so flat, and they all have a very similar way of speaking, even though some are more talented than others. The story itself is very predictable and repetitive, but there is one good thing about it, the ending is very well written, it is the only reason why I still read it. But overall I am not impressed, and I can't recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ The narrator had no idea how to make a story work and the story wasn't even good. It's the first book by a new author that I haven't read. I am hoping it's a flop.   Goodreads Feedback:   "This book is a waste of time." (6/20/13)   "[This book] is really the same story we've been reading." (7/7/13 - from a Goodreads Reviewer)  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I'm a man of few words, but I'm always ready to listen to someone tell me how wrong I am.   I think there are a lot of things wrong with this book, but one of the most common is that the author doesn't understand the idea of the "gift" that a book gives to the reader.   the book has a lot in common with books like "The Gift of Fear", but instead of a gift of knowledge or wisdom, it is a gift in the form of an emotional roller coaster that is often hard to come down from.   to the point:   - the characters are very stereotypical and one dimensional. the main character, with his love for his daughter, is pretty much the exact same as every character I have ever seen in a movie/book/TV show about a father and his daughter. it's a very cliche father/daughter relationship, and the author uses it in a very cheap way.   of course, there are some good moments, and one of my favorite lines of the book is "I would never have met him without you" which is one of those quotes that is so perfectly in-line with the way the author wrote it, it makes the reader feel like they are in a relationship with the author, and not the character.     the other main character (the daughter's mother) is also pretty generic. I think that there are better female characters in the book, especially with the mother, but the book would have been much better with a female protagonist.   a few things that made me dislike this book:     - the book itself was written in the first person. I don't know why, but when I read a book in the present tense, I get a very different feel from it. it just felt unnatural, like the author was trying to make the book seem like it was happening to the main characters in real time.   is that really the point?    - the main protagonist, the author's main character for most of the novel, had a lot more dialogue in the beginning of the story. he's the main reason the story moved forward. it seemed like he was trying too hard to get me to care about him and his story, and it was kind of jarring for the most part. I liked the character more when he was just there.  , but he wasn't my favorite character, and he felt a bit like a distraction from the
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book was just a bad read. I don't know what to say about it. The book was a collection of short stories that had no relation to one another except for the main character and some of the secondary characters. There was very little character development in this book. The story was also confusing at times. The characters were really dumb at times and it didn't make any sense why they were doing what they were going to do. This was also an incredibly repetitive book. I've read about a thousand of the same story that I've never really liked. This is a definite must read for those who are just looking for a quick read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I am giving it 4 stars. It's a good book but the main character is too weak, the book doesn't get going. I was reading it for my daughter and she liked it but the little boy in her class didn't. It would have been better if the main characters were more likeable and had more to do with each other.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't like this book. It's hard to say if it's the author's fault, but the writing was horrible. It felt very disjointed, which is not what I expected from a book written by a veteran author who has published dozens of books. The pacing was also very choppy, and sometimes felt like it was just jumping from one point to another, but this is not the case with every other book she has written, so it's possible I just didn't like it that much. I also didn't appreciate the "darkness" aspect of the story. I didn't mind it as much as I expected I would, but there was some creepy and over the top stuff. And the "chosen one" story was very confusing to me, as the story was a bit rushed and confusing. Overall, I'm glad I read it, but I would not recommend it unless you really love vampires, or are into romance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a great idea but it's a poor execution.  The author is a good writer with a strong grasp of the human psyche but his prose is too thick and the subject matter is way too dry.   The plot is a bit slow and the character development is so poor that I found myself wishing that I'd seen the movie before reading this.  I'll be back for more!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I was going to give it three stars and just give it a B. The writing was very good and very readable. But it had very few good things. I got this book as a part of a series from a well known book series. The author was very nice about responding to comments from other reviewers, but that was about it. If you want to read a good book that has some good plot and some interesting characters, I would recommend this series. If not, don't waste your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bad story with a bad ending. I read this on a train and didn't finish it until I had to get off.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a friend and she didn't like it. The story and setting were interesting, but the plot and characters felt like they were a bit too contrived. I was wondering why the girl was so obsessed with a "murderer". I guess it's a psychological thriller, so I guess the book does have its "horror" element to it, but this one was just too "soapy" for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was listed as "Science Fiction". This was not a good book. I started this book thinking it was just another story about an alien who wanted to take over Earth. I really was hoping it was more. But this was not science fiction at all. The aliens in this book were completely alien and did not make sense to me. At one point I thought the aliens were aliens who had died on earth and then somehow reincarnated. I don't know how to explain this, but the aliens in the book were alien beings who looked like humans and were trying to take human form.   There were other aliens who looked human and they were not evil, they were just not like the aliens we know and love. The only thing I loved about this book was the alien queen who lived in a tree. The alien queen in this story is the most terrifying alien that I have ever read about. I do not know how the alien Queen could live in a leaf in a forest. The way she lived her life was very mysterious and creepy.  , August 26, 2015I boughtthis book becauseIt was listed. This was, but this was a bad science fiction book. The book was terrible. It is not worth your time or money. I will only read books by Robert A. Heinlein or the original Star Trek series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason to read this book is to read the introduction by the author. He says a lot of nice things about the author but doesn't say a whole lot more. I've read all of the other books by the same author and the introduction is always good. The author never explains why the character was in the book in the first place, why they are doing what they are in the story. He also doesn't go into the details of the plot, but doesn't seem to care. In this book the main character is a very boring character. It's almost as if he is written to be one. It didn't take long to see that he was the most boring character I have ever read about. He does not do anything in the plot. His purpose is to tell the reader how he felt, what he was thinking, what his life was like when he was in that place. It was boring. I don't know what he had to do to get that book published, but it's not because the characters are boring. It's because the author made them that way. He did not show the reader what his mind was like. There is not a whole book about his life. All the things he thought about and how he did what he did were done in the introduction and never touched on again. He is just a man who goes to a place to kill people. I guess he is just as important as any other character. The only good thing about this book, was the fact that it was an easy read. The characters were the main thing in this book. The setting was interesting and the writing was good. I think I will read other books from the author, but will not read this one again. I was so bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The plot is predictable from the first sentence: "A woman is in the hospital with a gunshot wound to her head." She is in her apartment, and she's dying. The prologue and the last chapters are very dull and not very exciting. The protagonist is a woman who doesn't want to be a doctor, but then her boss, a doctor who is very competent, tells her to become a doctor to save lives. It's a good story. But then the second half is just dull. She goes to the hospital where she gets shot and there's nothing that happens except her dying in a few pages. It doesn't matter if you like the characters or not. It was good to read, but not very memorable. This book is about a woman dying, not about a man who is dying, and if you don't like women or the women you are with or have a woman as your partner, then don't read this book. I'm not sure why the author chose this kind of story. If you like a good book with a good plot and characters, you should read this one.  11 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so much more than a "history of the Korean war" - the book is really a biography of Kim Il-sung. The book is a great read - not a single point was argued in the book that I felt was incorrect. Kim Il Sung was a brilliant leader and was responsible for the victory of the North and the defeat of the South. The war was not only a struggle between two peoples, it was a struggle against the United States. Kim was a dictator, and his country had to deal with the problems that came with a dictatorship. Kim's regime is very well documented and the book provides many details about the lives of many of the key people involved in the war. It was an interesting read - I'm not sure I would have done the same with a different leader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting it to be just as good as the previous one. I got the book because I had read all the books in this series. I am so disappointed. The story is just plain bad. The characters are very stereotypical. I feel like I'm reading about the same person over and over again. The bad parts are just so boring and predictable. I don't even want to get into the sex scenes. There were just so many that I was just bored by them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not worth my time. I tried reading this book before and didn't like it. The main character was a total bimbo and her character did not progress much after she got her boobs done. It is one of the only novels I have read in a long time that was full of cliches. I had the same problem with this book and even though I tried a second time I just couldn't take it anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a good idea to put the protagonist into a situation where they will be forced to deal with other people's views and values. The author also has a lot of good ideas about relationships. The plot doesn't really go anywhere and is a bit dull at times. I would have liked it a lot more if the author had put a little more emphasis on the characters' backgrounds and lives, instead of making it all about them being "bad people" that don't deserve to be loved.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  If it's an easy read and you've never read a bad one before you might like this one.   If you've read the other 5 I've read and still haven't gotten the gist of it I would suggest skipping it.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ It's just a poor book with a lot of potential. It's not good. It sucks. I read it because I was looking for a good science fiction story. Unfortunately, this book is not good at all. The science is ok, but it doesn't really advance the plot. The main character (The Doctor) is a blandly defined hero. The setting is a space station. The characters are all stereotypical stereotypes. The story is not very interesting. The book is very slow, and you start to get bored by page 150. It is a very boring book, and I did not recommend it to anyone.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:       I thought it was a very good book but it was really not a good book at all. I would give it an A- but it's really just a bunch of things thrown together in a book. There were a lot of times when I just felt like I was reading a collection of things. Not that I don't like this book but I did feel like I read a bunch at once. I know I should just say I was bored with this book and didn't really enjoy it, but it just didn't seem as good as I would have thought it would have been. I just wanted to move on.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** (3/5)   I was disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to this book for a while. I had read about a few different versions of the book and I loved the first one, the original. This one is a bit different. It is set in an alternate timeline. So I expected more of the same. I thought that the book would follow a different set of characters and different people with different motivations. I have to admit that I really liked the idea of the alternate timeline and how different it is from the original timeline. The characters were interesting and I felt like I could relate to them. However, I did not like the direction that the story took. I liked the ending and I really loved the beginning. I think that this book had a lot of potential to be a really good book. However the end of the story just did not work for me.   The book started off very promising. The beginning is very good. I love when a book starts off promising. I really love when the author is telling me a story that I would love to read. This was one of those stories. It starts off with a woman who has been abducted and held captive for some time. Her captor tells her that she is going to be put to work in a mine. The narrator tells us about her history, her family, and her life in the future. There is a good amount of information in this opening scene and the narrator really helps to set the scene for us. We are introduced to the world of the novel, we get a good description of it, and we are told a little about it. It was very easy to get excited about the story.   (This is one of the few books I read that really impressed me with how the first chapter was written. The book did not let up from there.)   However, the book really hit me hard when the book started to follow a very different set story. The author starts telling us about this different story. This is not a bad thing by any means. In fact it was a good thing. The main problem with this story is that it took a very long time to get going. The reader does not really get a chance to get a feel for what is going on and why it is happening. I do not think that the author did a great job of showing us the world that this alternate world is. The different characters in this alternate future all have different motivations for
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ I just finished this book, and it was so boring. I have read many books on this topic and this is the only one that I will not be recommending to anyone. It's so boring and the characters are so bland that it was hard to relate to them. I was so tired after reading this that I just wanted to read something that wasn't boring, but I was sad to see this book end. I'm not sure why anyone would read this book unless it's the last one they have left.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this to be a very good book, but it has an overall very unpleasant, uncharacteristic tone.  It is a very dry, very dry book. __________________________________________________________ What I Liked:    This book is very well-written and well-researched, with a lot of good ideas, and a good feel for the culture.   I enjoyed the book's tone and style of presentation, and found it very accessible to readers of English or American literature, but not necessarily the same.  What I Didn't Like:      Overall, the book is good.  But I found the overall tone of the book, the tone of its style of writing, the overall unpleasantness of its presentation, the lack of character, and the lack/loss of interesting characters to make the book an overall poor read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I bought this book because I had heard it was a good book. It wasn't, it was terrible. I have a feeling that the author just wanted to make a quick buck, so he wrote a story that was not well researched. I would not recommend this book to anyone.   What did you like about it?  -the author is a self-proclaimed "writer", and he writes as if he is a real person.  The characters are all the same as in the book, which is not bad at all.    Why didn't you like it?   -This book is too short for it to be good. There is no suspense, and nothing exciting happens.  in the beginning the characters seem like they are really nice, but later on, there are so many scenes where there is nothing to see.  is there any way to tell that these characters are not what they seem? They are all in the same boat, and it doesn't make sense that there are two different sets of characters. .  for example, a character that says she has a "lifestyle" (like going to the movies every weekend) but then has an argument with her sister.  , why is she there at all? Is this a part of her lifestyle? It's really annoying that she is the only one that doesn't seem to care. Why does she always get to go to the movie?   to get the story going, there were a few things that were good, but it really just got old.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you like the idea of a "happily ever after" romance, but this is just not up to the task of satisfying your expectations, you should skip this one. There is a story about a girl and a boy who move in together after a tragedy, but the whole thing is pretty much a waste of time and space, and nothing about it makes you want to come back to the book. "I think I'm going to have a very bad time with this book." This one has a lot of promise. The premise is a bit on the ridiculous side, but there is so much potential in it that I couldn't help but give it a chance. I got to enjoy a few of the characters a little bit. But the rest of the book is just too tedious to really enjoy. This is a book that should be a lot more fun than it is. The characters are boring and predictable and the romance is too far removed from what a real romance should be to make it worth it. This was not a book I was looking forward to reading, but after finishing it I was pretty depressed about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is really bad and I couldn't even put the book down. The characters were all ridiculous, with a bunch of stereotypes that weren't original to the book. There were also too many characters in the book that had no depth at all. If you don't like stereotypes and stereotypes, this book will not be for you. I also felt like the book was just too long, I finished the book and then felt like I wanted to read more, but couldn't put it down.  Overall, I give this book an F because it was really not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book, and it's hard to understand why. It's like some sort of 'how to' book.  You'll read it and learn about a 'good' way of doing things (as if this book had any idea of what a good way of life is). The main idea was that if you were to get married, it would be a good idea to have a man in your life who has some of the qualities that make up the 'good guy' in a traditional marriage.  This is the sort of thing that would make me want to throw my hands in the air and declare that I'm done with this whole marriage thing.  I have always thought that 'good guys' need a bit more of a kick in the ass to make them really kick ass.  Not just 'good man' but 'good enough man'.  So I was surprised that this book didn't tell me how to get the 'bad boy' into my life. I didn't see any examples of this being done.  Instead I got advice about how to 'have a good time' and how to not 'dumb down your man'.  So I was hoping to hear some advice about the 'right way' to be a'man'. Instead I was told to'man up'.  I was expecting some advice to help me become the kind of man who can be trusted to not make any mistakes.  But no.  All I got was 'be good to your woman'.   No advice about my man not doing something stupid.  No advice about not being a 'dick'.  No 'how not to' books.    I got this book because I was looking for a book about men and marriage and how they should treat women and vice versa.  In the end I didn' t like it, and even after I finished it, I don't think I'd read it again.  It's hard for me to understand how anyone could tell a person what a 'right' way to be 'a good guy' is.  There is no such thing. There are only the right things to do and the wrong things to be.  'A good man' doesn't have to mean being a good person.  'A good woman' doesn' t have to necessarily mean being attractive or smart or anything like that.  And 'a man who knows how to treat a woman' has to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that is good about this book is that I am so glad that it is about the author's own experiences. It's very moving and it makes me wish that I were a girl or gay so that I could relate. But, I am not. I just found the book so dull. There are just so many stories that are about the same people that I just could not stand reading about them and their lives. I am sure that a lot of the people that wrote about this were very talented and wrote a lot more interesting stories about their lives but this one just wasn't for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most memorable parts of the book are the few scenes with the two boys talking about sex and how they can't be gay. It makes me angry that there are only a few scenes in this book where the boys have sex and it's not even a good one.  I mean, it was good, but it was nothing spectacular.   There's a bit of a disconnect here, I'm not sure why.  This book is a love story and the boys are trying to find each other, but they're not really able to, and it leaves me wondering what they would have been like together if they were together.  It's interesting that the boys decide to have sex with each other because they realize they're in love.  I don't want to say too much about this book, but I'll tell you that I was really disappointed in this one. I would have liked to have read a book with two girls who were in love with each others.  I would've been able to relate to it more.  There's a good amount of romance in this, and that's why I'm writing this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing was a big problem for me, but it isn't a problem with the book. I liked the plot, but the story was all over the place. I guess I could have gotten some things wrong, but that would have taken more time to figure out than the first three hours of reading. The book was too long, but I think it is more about the writing style than the length of the book, since it doesn't have that same feeling that a shorter book would have. I would have enjoyed it if it had had the same feeling as the first book. If you are looking for a light read with a twist, you should definitely give this one a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author had to add a whole new section to the book to describe the different kinds of fangames: "This is not a story of the future. We do not live in the future."   This is a story about the past. The characters do not go to the future, they go to a distant past where their ancestors are still alive. This is not the story of how technology is going to affect us in the distant future, this is about the future and how technology will affect the past, and how the future is affected by technology. I am a fan of the first book, but this one was a let down. The world building is very poor, the characters are not interesting, and the story is very predictable and predictable.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I really enjoyed this book. The characters were really fun to read about and the book itself was enjoyable. It is not that I thought it was a bad novel or anything, I thought the writing was good. But, the characters, the world, the plot, the pacing, the characterization... the whole package... this was a mess. The story was about a woman who gets possessed by an entity known as the Dark Lord, who has taken the form of a man, and then has to fight her way out of the possession and save the world from being destroyed by the Dark Lady's armies. There were a few moments when the pacing was a bit off, but overall, I enjoyed the book, and would definitely read it again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "a disjointed and confusing tale of a man who loses his wife and then his son in a horrible plane crash" is not a review. That sentence alone is the reason the book got a 1 star review. The story is a mess and the characterizations are awful. If you want to read a book about a man losing his wife, a story about a plane crash and a son losing his father, then you might enjoy this. But if you're expecting a solid story, a good character, a well developed plot line, good action scenes, interesting characters, etc. then you will probably not enjoy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very dull book. I have had a few ideas for books in my life and have never had the time to finish them. I thought I would try to do something similar to this and to be honest it is not really all that bad. The main story takes place in a city called Eris. It is described as a desert with a large dome over it. The dome is surrounded by an immense, dark, black and gray wasteland. It's a very interesting idea and the concept is well developed. The characters, however, are extremely flat. They are bland and almost boring. The only real character I can remember is a female who does not have a name but is referred to as "Mother". She does not do anything but sits in a chair by the fireplace and watches over her children. I think that this is the only character who has any real depth. The other characters are really only there to serve as plot devices. The world is not very interesting and the whole thing seems a bit like a sci-fi novel with a few fantasy elements. I am not going to recommend this book to anyone. I did not finish it, though I have read it several times before.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author made it sound like he's a good guy. He doesn't even try to explain what he is, he just uses his own words and uses his personal experience.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have never heard a story more unbelievable and ridiculous than the one I read in the book " The Great American Jigsaw ". In this book there is a man who goes around making puzzles to help his son with his homework, but on the way home one day he encounters a girl who is missing an arm. The puzzle is made with only pieces of her arm, so she decides to help her friend by making one of her own, but her friend does not have a arm so she can't make a puzzle. She goes to get an arm and finds out that the boy made it and she wants it back. The next day, they make another puzzle and the boy has the arm. They both play together but one day the girl finds out she can make a jigsaw puzzle of her missing arm. She starts to make more of them and the other girls start to ask her to make a picture of their missing limbs. This book was so ridiculous, I could not take it seriously. I would have thrown it away and gone to the library for another book. I'm so disgusted that someone would make a book like this, it was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bit cliche and over the top. It's an adventure story with a lot of action. But, there's no real plot. The world building is good and some of the characters are likable. I can see why some people would like it but I was just looking for a fun adventure story. 9/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book and felt like I was watching a terrible film about a character I hated.  If you don't like this book, then don't buy it.  "No man has ever been so completely lost in a forest as the protagonist in this book.  His entire life is an endless string of misfortunes: he's an orphan, an alcoholic, an ex-soldier, an epileptic, a thief, a coward, a drug addict, a rapist, a philanderer, a pedophile, a deadbeat father, and a criminal.  He has the face of a sadistic psychopath and the voice of a drunken, self-destructive lout.  The world is his prison, his only home, and his only love."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The author, a former law student, is so inept that I was afraid she was going to write a book about "how to avoid legal trouble in a divorce," and that would be the end of the book.   I bought this book as a reference book for the court in a couple of divorce cases I have had. This is an interesting read, with many examples, but there were times I found it difficult to follow the logic and explanations, even though I understood what she was trying to say. I also was confused at times as to what the author was trying not to say, and why she couldn't use the same logic in her own book. I think she could have used a more professional voice, and perhaps a more concise explanation of her reasoning.   in the end, it is very disappointing.  .     *I found that the book was quite entertaining, and it was interesting to learn about the many court rules and procedures.  : I will try to be a better reader of books. I read this book at work. I do not recommend it to a person that is going to use it as a self-help book. It is written very poorly, and if the person that reads it reads it for a few weeks and is not interested in improving their writing skills, it may be a good idea to find another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  The book was okay, but there were too many errors in the text, and the book was a bit too short. This book was written in 2003, and has not been updated since then. I am sorry to say that I would not read this book again. I would prefer something a little more current.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is bad. This book is so poorly written and is a total mess from start to finish. I found myself having to look up the author's work to understand what the author was trying to say. The author uses the word "mendacious" to describe many things and is often critical of other people's work. The way that he describes people is horrible and he seems to be writing about the author in his stories. This is a book about how a bunch of characters are trying to save the world but it just seems to have all the problems in the world. I also didn't like the way that it was written. It seems like he did not take the time to research anything. I have no idea why he put the characters in the book in the first place. It would have been better if they had been removed from the story and the story had been changed. This has all the flaws that you can find in a bad science fiction book. It also has a lot of plot holes and I found many of the facts to be incorrect. I can't say that I would recommend this book as it is not worth your time and I would not recommend reading it as a first book in a series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "I have come to the conclusion that I have a tendency to be a pretty dull person. I've been a fairly introverted person most of my life and I never had a passion for reading. I'm a bit of a drudge, which makes me not really want to do a lot of work. It also makes it hard to take a break, since I don't want to sit around doing nothing." -from a post on BookLover's Circle
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- -------------- I read this in paperback because I don't have a Kindle and I really liked the paperback version. However, I'm not sure I would read this again. The writing style is so different that I found it hard to read. It was just the way I liked it. It's an interesting read if you're into the paranormal. It also made me a bit of a loon for not realizing it was a real book and that it was written by a real person, which I am not. If I could get my hands on a Kindle version, I would totally read it. I'm so glad I don a book of this book though because I can't wait for it to be released in paperback!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I am so sorry that I bought this book. It has some really great things about it, but is riddled with errors. It was a real chore to read, and was so confusing that I have had to look up some of the words I didn't understand to figure out what was going on." 4. I am an average reader:    I read this book for fun.   It is a great adventure, and has a bit of humor in it.  It was fun, but had a few problems.  The characters seem too dumb to be believable.  There is no depth to the characters, they are just there to be used.  I found the writing to be dull and slow.  My only complaint is that it is a little over written and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't have a problem with the book but the story itself is just really, really bad. The story is told in a few chapters from the point of view of a boy named Jack who has a problem that his mom, dad and sister are all very good at making him feel comfortable about, but then he realizes that they aren't actually doing him any favors. It takes the form of an old black and white film from the 1940s where a man goes to see a film, the film being about the love triangle between a man and two women. The two women are shown being good to him and he is made to feel very comfortable about them, but when he realizes it isn't true, he realizes he can't live like this forever. But his mom says that he can, he just has to live a little longer. It's just really sad. I found this to be a really sad book and it was very poorly written. I really wanted to like this book and I really did. The ending really made me sad.   10/10 - a great book that I highly recommend.  Helpful of the Month - this book was a great read. I liked the idea of the story as well as the ending. I enjoyed the characters as well. I will definitely read more of his work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I'm a huge fan of Neil Gaiman and his work, but I was disappointed to find that this one didn't do the series justice. I was expecting a better ending than "The Sandman" and I didn't get it. The last two issues have really made me miss this series a lot. If you're a Gaiman fan, give this one a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________   If you like the way I described this book, you might like the following:   1. The first part of the book is devoted to an account of the early life of James Randi, a successful magician and researcher who is famous for his demonstrations of ESP, psychic ability, and paranormal phenomena. Randi's life was a series of "accidents," as he put it, in which he was thrown from a boat, hit a brick wall while riding a motorcycle, and nearly drowned while swimming. (He survived.) He was a very good swimmer, and a man who could have survived had he stayed in the water longer. He also was a good swim teacher. His early life was quite different from that of the Randis of the world, though, for he was born in the 19th century into a family of "dissolute, vicious people" who was so poor that he could not afford the clothing he wanted. He was "a very bad swimmer." He spent most of his time in "the garden, or in the woods, or on a raft," and, when he was not "doing research," he was a "nasty and vulgar fellow." He was very intelligent, but was always "on the verge of going off and doing something else." He could not "wait for the day when I might have the opportunity to do things in the field of psychology." He would like to have done research on "mental illness," but he could never do it because "I would have had to commit suicide before I would have the courage." His parents, on the other hand, "couldn't wait to be rid of him." He "became a vagabond." He finally found a job as a janitor, and "got his living by begging." He worked hard, and did well.   I don't think the "research" is the most important part of Randi; his life and work are. The "experiments" are not so interesting. (I don  [I didn't find the whole thing convincing. Randis seems to have a penchant for making claims and then abandoning them when he finds out he doesn't have the evidence to back them up.]   It is true that Randi is a "very good swim instructor," but it is true only because Randi has found that it is possible for his swimming pool to be the perfect place to practice his swimming.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because it is the first book I have ever read about a major American city, and I was intrigued by the idea of the city and the idea that it could be reconstructed as a city on the model of the European Renaissance cities.  There were a few issues that I had with this book: 1) The author does not explain the economic and cultural significance of the Renaissance cities in Europe.  2) The idea of a city that is reconstructed is based on the assumption that there will be no decay.    3) The city is very well detailed but is not easy to follow.     The author also states that "it is a very bad book" but I find the book boring and did not learn anything new about the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was about 17 and it changed my life. Now that I'm 20, I feel I have a better understanding of what it's like to grow up in a family with a parent who is bipolar.   My dad is a good person and is always there for me and my brother. I can't even imagine being in his shoes.   in the beginning of the book, my dad is still getting to know me and he doesn't get it right away, but as the book progresses he gets it.   a lot of things that happened in the book are not true, and there's a few things I feel are. I did read this in paperback, and it was in the library so I'm not sure about the formatting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She loved it and we all got a chuckle out of the way the author talks about how her daughter's favorite color is pink. I had the same reaction, I thought it was funny.   But the ending sucked. I'm not sure if it was the writing style that made it so bad, the way it made me feel like a bad mother or what. It felt like a ripoff of the movie 'Winnie the Pooh', except that Winnie the Po Oh is a much better book than this one.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- When I read the first chapter of this book I thought I was in for a good time. I was so excited to read this book because of the author's previous books. I did not expect to be disappointed. I expected to love the book but I was very disappointed. This book did not interest me at all. It was hard for me to get into the book. I could not relate to the characters and the story was hard to understand. There were no laughs in this book, it was just sad. I really don't know how to review this book. This was not what I was looking for when I started to read. I wish I could give this book a zero stars because it is just not worth it. I have to give it 3 stars because I feel it is worth reading but I do not feel like I would recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I've read more than a hundred books by a great author (I'm writing about a particular one) and I always enjoyed them.  This one is an exception.  the writing is sloppy, the story is poorly conceived and poorly acted, the characters are flat and two dimensional.    The first half is boring, the plot is confusing, the dialogue is atrocious.  and the ending is lame.   I hate to say this but the book was boring. I could've been reading about a better world.   the ending was a complete failure to do what it sets out to do. The whole story is about the two sisters. It's a fantasy book about a princess and a prince and a kingdom that is ruled by a good queen and a bad prince and that one day a young prince is chosen to save the kingdom. He's good looking, and his kingdom is ruled in a good way and he's brave and strong.   of course there's the evil queen who has a dark secret and is bent on destroying the kingdom by marrying the young prince to the evil king. . I've read many books about knights and queens and princes. I thought this book was dull. The characters were boring and I never really connected to them. The story was just that. The book was a waste of time and I hated it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book because I was looking for something different to read. I have read about 70 books about dogs and I thought this book was good. I loved the fact that there were multiple ways to train them. My only problem is that the dog is not very happy and is constantly whining about how hard it is to train her. The only good thing about this book is that it gives you the idea how to train your dog in a more natural way. I recommend this book to any dog owner and anyone who loves a good book. I gave it 4 stars because it was a good idea to get a book that is not written by a dog trainer.  13 of 14 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________"When you have a bad night, it's only a matter of time before you wake up to a bad dream."  Gloria V. Dall  DALL, GRAND DALL  Inventor of the Dall doll  The Dall Dolly  Cordelia Dall, a very old woman, has been married to a man named Mr. Dallow for over 100 years. She has lived in a house of her own for over 70 years.  She is the first person ever to own and operate a doll house. When she was a little girl she saw a Dall in a store window, and she asked her mother if she could have one of them. She had a dollhouse built in her bedroom when she was very little, but it didn't last very long. She finally bought one of the old ones at a yard sale. She never knew why, but she had a very good memory. .  I would have liked to have seen more of the book. I read it a few months ago and was not sure I liked it at all. I have read several books that have some great stories but the book I was hoping for was not there. The first chapter is about a man who has a doll, who is a man, who has lost his mother and has been living with a woman named Dall for the last year. The Dall is a very poor old woman. She can't afford a new house, so she lives in a one bedroom apartment. The man is a friend of her son who is married. The mother is very ill and the son is very old, so the mother needs help, so he comes into the apartment to take care of the mother. This is the story that the author is trying to tell. It is a pretty good book but I don't see why he has to put in so much description of this woman's house and her son. There is no time for her to do any sort of research, or even make sure that there is enough food for the boy to eat. She doesn't even have a refrigerator. I feel that the story would have been better if it had just been about her, the son, and the boy. I don' t know what the author wants to say with this story. I think it is more of a story about the man.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book was written by a man who has no idea what it is to be a human being, what it means to love and what it feels like to be loved." The book, which was released in 2006, is a collection of short stories that were written by the author as a kind of self-help book for men in his 30s. It is written with a kind, open-minded approach that is admirable in that it's refreshing. The writing style is easy to read and there are no "bad" stories. I was surprised how the author's own experiences influenced the stories. The stories are all very good and I would highly recommend this book. 9.  "Men Explain Things to Me" Author: Â Â Scott Adams The story of a man that decides to become a father at a young age. The story is very good. The author describes how he started his journey as a father. I enjoyed the way that he explained the whole thing. I found the story very interesting and thought it would be an interesting read for anyone who wants to become an excellent dad. 10.  Â "The Art of Fielding" Â Author: ÃŒÂ Ã'Â Tom Waits Â  Tom Waits' "The art of fielding" is a great book that I read in one sitting. The book is written in a poetic style that is very easy to listen to. The whole book is a story about the different things that a man should be doing in order to get the best out of himself. I have read many different baseball books and I never heard about the things that Tom Waites was doing that I found interesting. 11. "The Autobiography of Napoleon Hill" This book is about the life of a successful man and his ideas. Napoleon Hill was a business mogul in the early 1900s. He wrote about many things that made his life easier. The first section of the book is focused on the ideas of how to be successful and he goes into detail about how to get a good job. The second section is more focused on how to work and get ahead. He talks about how you need to make a lot of money in order for you to be happy. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get ahead in life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The only thing that could possibly make this a better book is if it had been written by someone who knows how to write." - "If you've ever read anything by Peter Newman, then you know that his work can get a bit dull. This book, however, is just bad. It has no idea what it wants to be. In this, it is very similar to his other books: "This is a series of short stories that takes place in an unspecified country that is apparently a fantasy world. This is a good way to describe it. It is a place that has magic and elves and magic-users and the like. The story is a bit confusing in this regard. There are some characters that I care about. I know it is a fantasy story, but the protagonist is not the best protagonist. If the author had stuck with the story a bit longer, then maybe I would have gotten a bit more involved. But I don't think that is the case, so it's a miss." - "...it has no clue what it's doing, and it just ends up being dull and repetitive. The character is boring and uninteresting, and the plot just doesn't make any sense. And that's what the book's about? The author has a lot of talent, but he's just a poor storyteller. And it's sad that this is what the author has become..." - "This book is a disaster of a novel. It doesn't tell a good story, it doesn't have a compelling plot, and there is nothing good about the characters." -

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so impressed by this book, and so impressed with its content. The first 3 chapters were really good, and I was looking forward to reading the rest of it. The ending was a bit confusing, but I can live with that. The characters are very well developed. I was able to relate to them.  The prose is very clear, and the story flows well. I am not really a fan of psychological thrillers, but this book is worth reading. I would recommend this book to all readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very well written and the subject matter was interesting. The main character was great. But the writing was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________ The story is one of the best I've read, though it isn't a particularly deep story. The pacing was perfect, and the story was easy to follow. I think that is the biggest problem with this book. The first half of the book is basically just the introduction to the characters and their relationships. It is the perfect introduction to a series, as the characters are introduced in a logical order that is easy to understand. The second half of this book is the actual plot, and it's a much slower paced book. It takes the characters a while to get where they need to go, but it was a good thing. The third half is where it got really bad, as it was really cliche, repetitive, and predictable. It was really hard to get invested in this book, because the characters were boring and predictable and the plot was just so unoriginal that I just couldn't take it seriously. I will give it two stars for its plot and characters. If it was not for the characters, the plot would have been much better.

It will not interest you, you will hate it and wish you had never heard of it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________   "So what's the story? The story is the book. It's a good story, a good start to the series. However, it's far too long. I know this is a YA book, but that doesn't mean it has to be an epic.   The world building in this book is absolutely fantastic, but it can be tedious and the characters get very little development, and the book is very confusing at times. The writing is really nice, but the story is just too slow.   (This review is spoiler free, because it's been a long time since I read the book). I really wanted to love this book, and it's definitely not a waste of your time if you're into YA, but if you don't like YA then this may not be the book for you. If you do like YAs, though, I would recommend it."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of all the books by Patricia McKillip. I am especially fond of her series, The Lavinia Quartet. But this book was just terrible. The writing was dull, the plot was completely unrealistic, the characters were bland, the world building was horrible, and the ending was horrible. The world building and plot are so bad, they make this book even worse than it already was.   The world building is very simplistic. It starts out in the early 1700s. The author tries to make the world feel like the 17th century. But then, halfway through the book, the author makes a giant leap to make it feel like our world. I understand why the author would want to do that. The fact that the book is set in the 1800s doesn't really bother me, though. It's so unrealistic that it seems like the author was just trying to write a story about the 1800's. But, I feel that the real problem is the characters. The characters were the worst in the book. The main character, Mary, is an incredibly dull character. She is a pretty boring person. Her personality is a total non-event. She has nothing going for her, so she basically just exists for the purpose of the plot to progress. I could not take her seriously. I really could not. She was so uninteresting, I wanted to throw the book at the author for a good reason. But it did not happen.   The other main character was Mary's friend, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was an annoying character. I felt like she had a lot of personality. But she is also very dull. I feel like her personality just seemed to happen on the page. There was nothing about her personality that was interesting. And her personality is completely out of character for the rest of the book and for the entire series. Elizabeth's main purpose in the series is to be Mary's little sister. There are no reasons why she should be so boring. I just felt like her character was unnecessary. The book also contains the only male character in the entire book. He is very much uninteresting. He has a lot going on for him, but he is so unoriginal that I can't really understand his character at all. And I mean, who is his character based on? A male character from the 1740's.  ....   I just felt this book had some major flaws. The way the author made the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of the worst I've ever read. It has a lot of bad writing and a lot more bad ideas. This book is about a guy who gets a job working for a big bank. He's a bit of a dork, but the bank is paying him a lot so he's not complaining. So, when his boss decides to move his office to a new building, he's excited about it. It'll be cheaper and easier than moving into his old office. But then he finds out the building has a basement full of people who used to work there but have been evicted for not having a mortgage. They can't afford the rent so they're living in a basement for free. The bank wants him to evict them, but he has to decide whether to keep paying rent to them. Then he finds the building's security guard has been murdered. So he has a few bad decisions to make.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I would like to thank the publishers for making this a reality. However, this is NOT an easy read. The author does a good job of creating an exciting and intriguing world. However he does not seem to know how to properly set the world up or how to develop the characters. The story, while being a good story, feels a bit flat, and while the world is interesting, I feel that the author has yet to show the characters enough depth to truly make them a memorable character. I think the author needs to find a new voice to write his stories, and get his characters to a place where they can live in a world of their own.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you think this is a bad novel, or the worst of the best, please, please let me know why so that I can try and put the review in perspective for you. I thought the book was good but I can see why others would think so. The book was too much for me to finish, and I just couldn't get into it. It is hard to review this book since it was so different from my usual fare. It had a bit of everything, I suppose, but there was just nothing that stood out for me. The main character is so weak. I don't want to say he was the weak point, because it wasn't, but the fact that he was such a pathetic wimp that he would be so quick to go off on people is just so ridiculous. That's a character I don�t like in my novels, and even if he wasn't a wimp, he was still a waste of time. I was thinking about going out and getting this book when I came across this review, and it really brought out the frustration in me. I would hate to have to finish it, but I think I will give it another shot. I will have to say that it will take a good deal of effort to finish this book, but it�s worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. It's a complete waste of time, it's a total failure. It doesn't have a single redeeming quality. It is a book filled with overuse of the word "gutless". It's an utter waste of your time. This book has nothing to say, it has no character. It has absolutely nothing to offer. It just sucks. I just want to stop reading this book and move on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is the worst thing about this book. There's really no reason for it other than the authors just wanted to use a character from a book they'd read and use it to create a plot point. It's so ridiculous it's almost hilarious. This is one of those stories where you can tell the authors don't really care about their characters or story. If you have a problem with the plot or the characters, go read another book.  … Show more
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ "A story about a man with a broken heart and a very angry God. A story of how we can learn to be happy with what we have and not take the rest of the world's blessings for granted. A good story. A very good story." "I've seen some better ones but this is one of the best." The first thing you have to understand about this book is that it is very, very different from the others. This is an autobiographical book, the first in a series of four that are to follow. In a sense, this book represents the start of my life, the book I was supposed to write when I got out of prison. I am in jail for a murder I did not commit, and I've been released on bail. The novel that follows is very different, as are the characters in the story. I won't say that the story is good because it is. It is not a good book, but it is not awful either. In fact, it is quite good. I'm a very unhappy person. I have lost a lot of people I love and I'm still losing people. I've lost my friends, I've had some of my family members hurt, I have made some people hate me. I still have a lot to learn about myself and my life. I want to grow up, I want the life I wanted when I was eighteen years old to come back. I wanted to get a good job, I wanted my life to be different from what it is now. I know that I'm not going to get that. I just wish I could be happy. I wish I knew how to be free, how to move on from all of the losses I've made. I don't know how to make it better but I wish someone would tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'd like to know how I can change the direction of my entire life and stop being such a pain in the ass. The book is divided into four sections, with a beginning, middle, and end. The beginning section tells the story of a young man, the main character of the book, as he gets out of the prison, goes to college, and tries to become a successful businessman. The middle section shows how his life changed when he got back into prison and how he learned to live with the pain he's caused. The end section shows the man in his early forties, and how the events of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bit of a drag. The main character, a child, has a special talent, which is being able to see the future.  The problem is, he can only see it in the future that's currently unfolding.  This book was interesting at first.   The author did a nice job of explaining what she is trying to do, and how it relates to real-world events.  It was a bit slow at first, but once I started to get used to the characters, the story picked up and I really started to enjoy the story.  The main characters are interesting and have their own personality.    The story is good, and the author was good at keeping the story interesting.  This book does suffer from the fact that the main character is just a child.  I know that this isn't always a bad thing, but in this book, the author uses this child as a device to explain some things that she should have done before writing the book.  She does a good job of making this child seem like an adult, but at the same time, it just doesn't make sense.  There are things about this book that just didn't seem to add up to me.  But the story is interesting and I found myself going back to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved the first book in the series, but I had trouble reading this one because it was hard to keep up with the story and the characters. I really don't know if I was having a hard time because I don't have much in common with the main characters (the boy who wants to become a hero, the girl who wants a normal life, the older brother who has a secret), or because the plot was just so convoluted and it took me so long to get to the ending that it made it very hard to care about the characters and the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________ This book is a complete joke, a complete ripoff of "The Hobbit" and a complete insult to the fans of the books. The story starts off great with a group of friends and family going on a hiking trip and get caught up in the chaos of a war, only to realize that this war is just as much a lie as all the war propaganda they have been fed about their homeland. The only real character in the book is the protagonist, a guy named Rook. It is hard to say if he is really a main character because he seems like a guy that gets kicked around and not a main guy. I could care less about him and his friends. I would rather see them all dead. The book is nothing more than a series of events, some of which have some sort of relation to the war, but none of which are really that interesting, or in the least, not worth the time. The ending really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The rest of the book was just an unnecessary exercise in "bad writing."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It's about a time in my life when I was a bit of a douche bag." "I love how it starts with a good idea but ends up becoming a total dud." The reviews of this book have been less than flattering, so I will try to put a little more perspective on it. "One of the most tedious and boring books I've ever read." One of my all time favorite books, and probably the only book I read more than once. The only real problem I have with this book is the fact that the book is only 90 pages long, but has a lot of information about the war, the history of the country and the people who lived through it. I was looking forward to reading this book, and was going to do some research and read the Wikipedia and the History Channel. However, after reading this, I will never read any war books again. It was just not worth it. This book is not even interesting enough to warrant reading. It's just a story about a bunch of people who died, and how it affected them and how they lived in the aftermath of the war. It doesn't even explain the war in any meaningful way. The most important part of this story is the characters and how the war affected them. I don't think I could have gone through all the trouble of researching this book if I had to read it again. The book also ends pretty abruptly, but I think that's just the way it is. I just don't want to waste any more of my time on a book that I can't relate to. The only good thing about this book was that it was the first time I read something about WWI that I wasn't scared of, and that was a good feeling.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I found it extremely boring. The plot line was very simple and uninteresting. The character development was very poor. The ending was also very unsatisfactory. This is a book that should be considered a waste of time. I can't recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator is a bit annoying but otherwise a very good narrator. The narrator is also very good at describing how things were when they happened, but when you're reading about things that have already happened, you don't really notice that much. It's good for people who like historical fiction, but I would avoid it for people looking for a historical romance.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ "You may or may not like this book, but I do. This is a book that I can see myself recommending to friends and acquaintances. I am one of those friends who will always recommend a good book to a friend who asks for it, but will always advise against a book because of one minor thing I found.   I'm a little biased here because I'm a big fan of the author's work and this book is no exception. This book takes place in a small town in Australia. There is a local high school football team, a local soccer team, and a local baseball team. They all play together every year, but not for the same reason.   the boys of the soccer team and the girls of the basketball team play a little too much soccer and the boys play a lot of baseball. The boys are more focused on making it to the big time than the girls are on being good at their sports. The girls play baseball and the football team plays soccer, but it's the boys who make the difference. They have the most skill and know how to use their skills to get the job done. The book is set in the year 1988, the year of the football season, and the story takes place at a local state college. The story follows a group of boys who have been kicked off the basketball and football teams and who are now stuck at the local college.   to be fair, I'm pretty sure that there was no way this could have worked out better. I've never seen a book like this and I don't think I ever will. I would've been disappointed if I hadn't read it first. The writing is very good. The characters are well written and I really loved the way they were all so different. This story is very much about the struggles of people to make it to college, but the main character is a guy who is very focused on his school work. His main goal is to get into the most prestigious college in Australia and if he can't do that, he's just going to have to settle for college life. It's a very interesting story and I can't wait to see how the rest of the story goes. I'm glad I read this book and I look forward to the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a very good book at all.  There is a whole bunch of material that just isn't that interesting.   I got so frustrated trying to figure out what I was supposed to do and how to do it that I just stopped reading.  I just can't say it's a bad story, but it's not good either.  If you're looking for a good story about a super-intelligent robot that can get you out of any situation, you can't do much better than this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   I bought this book in hopes of becoming a better person, but I can't help but feel like a loser. This book is full of terrible ideas, and the author does an extremely poor job of explaining them to us. I would have been better off buying a copy of "Man's Search for Meaning" instead.   "Why do we feel so powerless when faced with the overwhelming evidence that our thoughts are our own? The answer, of course, is that our thinking is also our own, and that if we were to stop worrying about our own thoughts, we'd also stop worrying that our lives are so empty and meaningless. What is so great about our minds is that we can be as clever as we want and still not be able to escape the fear that we will someday be discovered."   This book is so full of bad ideas, that I had to stop reading because I couldn't figure out what the author was trying to say. I found it to be a very confusing book with many confusing points, and very little actual good information.   of all the things I have read on the topic of "worry" in my life, this book is the one that sticks out as the most pointless and confusing to me. The author seems to be trying to create a sense of control by telling us that our minds are our "own," but I cannot help but wonder why she thought people would listen to such an obviously terrible book. It is so filled with bad ideas that I can only conclude that this book was written by someone with a very limited vocabulary.   (I read the book twice. The first time I really just wanted to get to the end, but the second time I realized that the first time through I really got the gist of the book, so I was able to get a lot of the ideas. I still think it is a terrible book.)   The author's premise of the story is that the mind is our own. I cannot agree with this premise at all. Our minds are not our own; the only thing we can ever really control about our mind is the way we interpret the world and our thoughts. If we do not believe that we are in control of our minds, then the only possible conclusion we can come to is that it is our fault that we have been depressed, and our mind can't be the cause of our depression. If the mind can be our own and not our fault, then it makes perfect sense
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I got a free copy of this book. It was a hard read and I got through it, but I didn't enjoy it. I think I have had the same experience with a lot of authors, and it is always the same, there is no real story, just a collection of snippets of facts and opinions, and I don't like it. The book is written very well and it made me laugh a lot. I thought I would love it because I read it, I have always loved history books, and the author was a history buff. It is just a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a lot of fun and it had some nice ideas about different types of books but it was all written so fast that it made me impatient and frustrated at how fast it went and it did not make me want to keep reading. I wanted to be reading this book for a while but I was so bored I could not take it all the way through. I was waiting for more character development or a longer scene and I was left disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I found this book to be absolutely dreadful. It's not that I hate science fiction, or anything in general. I really like a good SF book or two, and have had a couple of great reads from the likes of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, William Gibson, Philip K. Dick, and Philip K Dick, all in the last few years. I also love a good science fiction story, and this is no exception. However, the book is far too slow paced, far too plot heavy, far far too filled with plot holes and inconsistencies, and far too confusing to be worth my time. It takes far too long to get from point A to point B. The characters are so two dimensional, it's hard to believe they're even human, or at least are human. The plot is also convoluted and confusing at times, and if you're not up to date with SF you'll be lost. And last but not least, the ending is far to ambiguous and unbelievable for such a plot heavy book. I would rather read a story where the hero gets all his powers and is the one to save the universe than read a book that makes you want to go back and re-read the beginning and end to see how everything was supposed to go. That being said, I'm going to give it a 3.0 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I found this book to be a total disappointment. I had been looking for a good historical account of the Civil War and had been a big fan of George Saunders' "East of Eden" which was very well written and was very realistic about the life of the people in the South. This book does not live up to the standards of the first one.   My son and I read the book together about a month ago and I have to say that it was very difficult to listen to him read this book. It was very hard for him to follow the stories in the book and was often confused with the stories that are told in the TV show. It seems like there is too much filler in this book and it is almost a book that was written to be read. The writing in this is very slow paced and sometimes I had to go back and look at the previous pages to understand what happened. Also I felt that the narrator was not very good in this, and his voice did not seem like a real person's voice, it sounded like a fake and not like a historical person.     Overall I would not recommend this book at all, but if you are looking for some history about the Civil war I would definitely suggest this book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard so much about this book from friends, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's writing, and I've read many of his works (he's a master storyteller), so I was pretty sure I was going to like this one as well. I was very wrong.   The book starts off pretty well. The characters are all interesting, the story has some good twists, and there are some really good descriptions of the environment. I felt the author was taking advantage of the setting, which is probably necessary to make the book so creepy and creepy, but there are a few parts where I felt that the author could have gone a bit more in depth and elaborated on some of the more obscure details of the landscape.   the story is about a man who's trying to find his daughter. He's trying a lot of different things, and has some strange occurrences going on that he doesn't understand, so he's going to try to go out there and solve them. But there's a lot more to it than that, because when you read a Stephen King book, you're never really sure if there's going be a good ending, or a bad ending, and it's really hard to predict if the author is going to throw something completely random at you in the middle of the book. There are a lot, MANY little plot threads and character developments that come up over the course of the novel, and if you're not paying attention, you might be completely lost. This was the case with me. There were so many small hints and hints that I was like, "Oh, I wonder what that means." And then, "What? What was that?" There's no explanation for a lot (I would have liked an explanation for the name "Beverly", for example), and there's no payoff for anything, because the story isn't over. And that's a real problem in a King book because it really breaks the immersion, because you're really not sure if the story's going anywhere. It's a really weird feeling.   The story starts off fairly well. But it really didn't have much of a payoff by the end, so there was no suspense there, and the book got a little bit boring and repetitive, even though there were some good descriptions, like the water coming out of the trees.  .    So, if you want a good book with a lot
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ __________.  This book is a joke.  of course there is a plot and a plot is a story. But the story is so ridiculous that I didn't want to believe it. The writing was poor and it took me a while to get through this book. The characters are very weak and their motives are not very clear. The author has a very bad taste and the book is so poorly written that you wonder if this is his first book or if it's just a collection of short stories. The book was not funny and it had a lot of boring stuff. It's not that it was boring. It was very dull and you feel like the author didn't care about the story. The only thing good in the book was the characterizations.   There were so many stupid things happening in this book that it's hard to know what's important. There's a plot that involves a guy trying to find a girl who has a dog that looks like a human but is not. There is a girl that thinks she's a cat and a boy who thinks he's a dog. There are a lot more silly things that happen that didn't make any sense. The book started out well, but the ending was so bad that I couldn't finish the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I really did not like this book. It has a very poor writing style. The characters are all cliched. The story is a complete mess and doesn't make any sense. The ending is terrible. If you're looking for a fun time, I would pass on this book and save your time and money. I'm sure this book will be a hit with kids but that's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm going to say that I was very disappointed with this book. This book is so bad it is funny.  It was the worst book I've read in a long time and I've just returned from a book festival, and it was the absolute worst book  that I've ever read. The writing style is incredibly clunky. The dialogue is stilted and almost as if the author doesn't know what he's writing. The characters are boring and not believable.  This book is terrible.   This book has absolutely nothing to do with the series and instead, it's a horrible attempt at an original book. I'd say that this book is just as bad as the last book.  This novel had me laughing so hard I cried. It has a few good moments but mostly this book just made me sad.  I don't think it was worth the money I paid for this book, I think I should have just read the series first.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ A very good book, but a bit over long and it's a bit too long, it's almost like a whole new story is told in it, and then a whole other story comes out of it, not the same. The whole story is pretty much the same, but the way it's told and the way the characters react is different. It's good, but it just needs to be a little bit shorter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is really well written and the author is great, but there are a few problems with the way the plot unfolds and a few too many twists and turns.  I didn't like how it ended at all, especially with the final twist.  The story, the plot, the author, the story, plot, plot:  This is a good book about a person's relationship with a god, which has been a difficult relationship for him/her. I like the plot and it is written in a way that I think will appeal to a wider audience than what I usually read.  The plot is well done.  But I felt that I could have used a few more chapters with some of the more confusing/difficult concepts (like "the soul", which I had no idea what was going on). The writing is pretty good.  And the main character is very likable and is a very likABLE character.    I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the religious fiction genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a boring and slow book. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it was one of the few books that I could see myself reading a hundred times. The story is so predictable. There's a man who has the power to turn himself into anything he wants and a woman who can't resist his charms. They go on a trip, get into trouble and are rescued by a witch. It's a familiar plot and the book keeps you reading so you don't get bored. There is also some nudity but nothing extreme. Overall, it's a great read, especially for those who love the fantasy genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a long book, but it's not that hard to read. It has a lot of interesting concepts, but the author is too much of a lazy writer to keep the book flowing and interesting. It was hard to keep my interest through the whole book. If you want to get something from the book, try it for a couple of days before reading the next chapter. 4 of 5 stars:    It's a good book, it's one that I can read every now and then. The concept is great, but in the end I just didn't find the author to be all that good. 2 of 4 stars:   It has some interesting concepts and some interesting ways of thinking about the world, but I don't find it all that enjoyable to read and it's just a very long book. It takes a while to get to the parts that interest me the most. It's also quite hard to get through a whole book of this length. 1 of 4 Stars:   I just found it to be an annoying read, it was too long for me to actually enjoy the book. The author seems to be a very lazy writer. 3 of 5 Stars:   I enjoyed this book, I found it very interesting, but just not very enjoyable to finish. The book took me forever to finish and I really wish that I had read it earlier because the concept is cool and the concept was presented well. I just wish that the author had made it easier to read or made the whole thing a little shorter. I'm sure it would have been a fun book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "For the first time I was able to read the book I've always wanted to read and finally it was a pleasure to me, but it was also a very poor book. The characters are not well developed and most of the time I could see myself laughing but there was no feeling. The main plot is not so interesting, I found it boring to read, but I can understand that the author didn't want to write something too long or boring and so we are given something short and funny."   If you like the book, don't forget to leave a good review. It means a lot. Thanks for your support.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ I have read some very good books in my day but this book is a joke. The first chapter has an author blabbering on about how his father is the greatest living writer ever, and how he's the best writer ever and is in the running to win a Nobel Prize. The next chapter is about how great he's going to be, then the author starts complaining about how the first chapter is a waste of time and then goes on about his father. I can't believe he actually thought that was a good idea to write a book like this.   The author is a bit of a genius, but he's just as bad as the rest of them. It's just hard to believe he could write a novel so bad, and be so well known for it. The author was a writer who used to write in a magazine and the story of his first novel was a big hit. When he was looking for a new project to write, he decided to write this book and then brag about it.   of course it ends up being a terrible book because the author was really on a roll, so he couldn't stop, and he can't control himself because he's such a genius. I mean how could he know the characters would be as horrible as they are? I don't think anyone is able to write such a book without writing a few chapters that suck.   (hide spoiler)]
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed reading this book, but found it to be a slog. The pacing was bad and the plot seemed to fall into a pit of no return that it had been stuck in for some time. There were some good parts, but the overall quality of the story was very poor. It was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was just a waste of time. I got this book for my birthday and I was hoping for a book to read that would help me through my school year. I did enjoy it a bit, but it's not a book that I would recommend. The story is a lot of fan service and I don't understand why they would waste money on this book. I would not recommend this book to a kid who likes fantasy. I will keep reading the rest of the books in the series and hopefully this is just a fluke.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________   This is a good book but it really did not work for me. I do not want to go on a journey of depression. I have never really suffered from depression.   It was interesting to learn about the world's most powerful leaders and the things they were thinking about in their own heads. I did not enjoy reading about them in the beginning.  - I would have liked more explanation of the use of the Bible as a tool in the power of political and economic control.   the story of "Tolstoy and the Bible" is interesting. Tolstoy is an amazing writer but I felt as if he was really writing his own story.     -The way that Tolstoi portrayed Russia's war with Japan in "War and Peace" (a book I love) was very different from how he presented the events of "War with Russia". It was interesting and I think it made it more powerful.   a few more pages could have been added about this, but overall this was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I don't care what they say, this book is rubbish. The main character, Sissy, is the epitome of the'slut' archetype. She has a huge cock, which is only there because she's a slut. She gets a huge dick when she is with her boyfriend, so that's good. But, it's really not worth the trouble because, her boyfriend is a complete loser. He only comes out to her once every two months because she won't suck his cock. That's like a slut having sex with every guy in her life but only fucking a few. The book tries to make her jealous by saying she has a lot of boyfriends but not him. I don't get it. I've never met a girl who would go on about how many boyfriends she's had. She seems to be really into one guy but doesn't care about him.   The author really tried to make this book into a romantic comedy and didn't know how to go about it. The 'happy ending' is really not happy. She tries to get him to move in with her and then they fall out of love and get back together but then he leaves again and then she does. It just doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ I had a bad experience with this book, and I would recommend it to no one. The book is a rehash of the story of "Barry" and his father. "B" is very likable, if a bit dull and predictable. The plot has several subplots, but the main one is the love story between Barry and his mother. It's a love story, but it's a cliche love story that doesn't really go anywhere. It ends in a "who-happened" type way. The story is mostly predictable, and there is nothing unique about the characters. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I liked Barry's dad, but he was just a very boring character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is just a lot of shit.  There is a lot to talk about.    This book is a bad read.  The writing is terrible.  It is poorly written, boring, and a bad use of the imagination.  This story has the most pointless characters I have ever read. You are never interested in them and you are never surprised by what happens.  You do not care about what happens to the characters, it just goes on and on and they are never challenged.  They are constantly being taken down a few pegs and they just go on doing the same shit again and again.    They all get together at the end to do something dumb and make it all worse.  In conclusion:   I hate this book.  I have given it a 2 star because it is a book with potential.  That is not what I got.  There is no substance to this book and I do not think the author is capable of writing a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ ____________. I don't understand the hype about this book. I am very disappointed in this book and feel like I wasted my money on it. I found that it was a very confusing book and there were many parts where I did not understand what was going on. I didn't enjoy reading the book and would recommend it to a friend only if you have no idea what you are doing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not at all a bad read. It is, however, a very poorly written book. There is very little sense in the story line and most of the characters feel very forced and are not very interesting to read about. There are many examples of this in the book and it makes the book not only uninteresting, but also somewhat boring. I feel that this is a book that is better off being an audio book. If you don't mind listening to the narrator talk you may enjoy this. I would also recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of a story book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was so bad that it's hard to believe that I still own it, let alone continue to read it. I had no idea how bad it was going to be. This book was about a girl who was taken away from her mother and her dad to live with a family that she barely knew, and she quickly finds out that the family she's in is nothing but a terrible family. The book was boring and it had a very slow plot, but it had some really bad characters. The main one that really bothered me was the mother and the girl that she took from her. The mother is really unlikable and I hated her. I'm a fan of fantasy, and I just can't get behind her. But I'm still reading it so I'll probably finish it someday. The girl that was taken from her is actually really cute, but I didn't like her at all. And then the main character gets taken away again, so I'm wondering if she's going to get a second chance at life?  I have so many other books to read and it's a shame that I have to put up with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________ I was excited when I started reading this book. I was a huge fan of the first two books in the series. I really was looking forward to what was going to happen in the third book. It ended up being the worst book in the trilogy. The only reason I got through the book is because it was the first in the "Dawn of the New Empire" trilogy and I wanted to be excited for it. I read the first book and found the book to be quite interesting. I felt the book was not bad but I did feel the author was a bit short with the plot. The first book had a very interesting plot and the third was a very dull story. The book had two major flaws, the main character, Arin was not interesting and did not add to the story. He was very boring and the characters did not seem to be that well developed. I found the second major flaw, there was a lot of violence and it was done in a very violent way. I just found it to be extremely uninteresting and did NOT want to continue on with this series. If I had a nickel for every time I have read this book I could purchase a new car.  Review by: David S. on April 18, 2015 :  This is one of my favorite fantasy series. It's a really great mix of action, romance, and politics. The series is very popular, with a good following, which I think helps. I think this is an excellent series, with all the right things going for it: well-developed characters, compelling plot, interesting magic systems, and a good dose of humor.   My problem with the series is that it just seems to be trying to do too much. I don't think it was ever clear what the purpose of the war was. I can't tell you that the book really has a clear end point or purpose, and it never does, at least not for me. I'm not even sure what the conflict was that started this whole thing, and I'm having a hard time understanding why the main characters went through with it all. The main characters, Arlinn and Arin, have this very interesting, but ultimately pointless, relationship, which never really got developed beyond the point of having them as a couple.  :  I really loved this book, I just felt like it didn't make any sense to me. The action scenes are great and there's a lot going

Write a negative review about a bad book:  " This is the first book I have ever read that I can honestly say was the most frustrating. It was really hard to get into the plot and not feel frustrated with it. It didn't have enough of a plot for me. "  - Anonymous Reviewer from Amazon " The author is not really a storyteller. He has to tell the reader exactly what he is going to do with the book. The whole book was like that. I felt like I was on a roller coaster with very little stopping to see how the story would go."  – Anonymous Reviewers from Amazon and Barnes & Noble I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this one, especially the first time I read it. I know the author has written other short stories but, honestly, I couldn't care less about them. I'm looking forward to his next story and hope to get through this one and move on with my life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A book with no plot and a bad story. I was disappointed." A story that needs a lot more love:  "This is a story that is so poorly written, and so poorly plotted. I mean, it's almost like someone was trying to write a 'Lord of the Flies' story. It's also full of typos, and the dialogue is very stilted and boring. I found myself frustrated." 4. The Lost Book of the Blue Rose (Germaine Greer) The Lost Book was published in the 1970s. Greer is a woman of many talents, but her literary career has been overshadowed by the sexual misconduct she has been accused of, including being the one who "took a male writer's wife's virginity."  Greer has been silent on the matter for many years. This is another book that is hard to summarize.  It's a mystery, and is written in a very traditional style.  the book is set in a village in Germany.  It tells the story of a woman who has been kidnapped and brought to a small town in northern Germany. There she encounters a man who is very close to her.  The man is a "lover" of her, and he is the person who finds her. The man has been hired to find her lost book.  He is the "lovers" assistant.  They go to the woods to look for her, but the woods are dangerous, and Greer is taken.  She escapes by using a knife she found in the woods.  Greer ends up in the hospital, but then goes on to the book, which is a book about a group of people in a small German village who have been lost for ages.  A man is missing from the village, and there is a mystery about where he is.  The book is full of mysteries, but a good mystery can be solved.  However, this book is far from being a good story.    This is not a good book, but if you like mysteries, and don't mind a little bit of a bad plot, you could do worse.  If you are a lover of Greer, and want to read about her life, this is the book for you. 5. The Long Walk (V.C. Andrews) V. C. Andrews is a writer who was involved with the UFO movement.  In
Write a negative review about a bad book: *****************I love this book! I am a HUGE fan of The Hunger Games, and this is a brilliant, amazing adaptation. The characters are great, the dialogue is awesome, and the world is absolutely incredible. It's really hard to explain, but I think it was a combination of how it was written and the author's vision that makes this a great book. I will definitely be buying more. *********************** * * * I am very disappointed with this book. This is the first book that I have read by Suzanne Collins that was NOT a masterpiece, and while I appreciate her work, I have not been impressed by this book at all. I'm sorry, but it really is. I am not going to say more because I am afraid of giving the wrong impression. I have had my doubts about the book, and there are a lot of things that really irritate me. The character development is not even close to what I expected from this book (I was looking forward to a great, epic fantasy novel, but instead this is about a bunch of kids fighting for their lives). I am annoyed by the way this book is structured, and I am extremely disappointed by the end. I really hope that the next one isn't like this one, because I think that Suzanne Collins has made a big mistake with this one. * * 1/2 * *
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This is the most boring book I have ever read. I just finished it and I could not believe the crap that the author wrote. I am a history buff so I like history and this is a textbook example of how not to write a book. If you like to study the history of the British Empire you can get a better book at the library. This is just a rehashed version of the history and it's a total waste of money. I will never buy this book again.******I have read other reviews that have said that this book was written in the first person. That is true. It was written from the perspective of a woman named Mrs. Mary Rose. But I don't think that makes it less boring. It just means that it's more interesting to me to read a book that is written from a different perspective. The narrator has no personality and just makes a very boring story. This book is just boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but it fell short for me. I thought I liked it because of the character development and the "weirdness" in the book. I was so wrong. The "weirder" was very minor and I didn't care at all. The main character is very dull and has the most boring conversation ever. The author's ideas are too complex for the average reader. This book made me angry and I'm not sure if I will be buying any more books by this author. 4.6 Stars  (out of 5) This is a very good book about the strange, and I really loved it. I don't want to give this one a bad review because it's good, but I feel I would give this book 4 stars if I had written a negative one. The book takes place in a house in a small town. It has a secret, a curse that has been in effect for generations. The only ones who can see the curse are those who live in the house. A girl, Rose, and a boy, Henry, are the only ones that can see it. They both have a different way of looking at the curse and the people in the town, and it becomes a mystery that they are trying to solve. I really liked the author's characters. They were interesting and I liked their personalities. Henry was a little sadistic, but Rose was the opposite. I also liked that Henry had no friends. He doesn't have a lot of friends at school, and he's kind of a loner. He does have a girlfriend, though. I liked that she seemed to care for him, even though she is a little cold to him. Henry is also afraid of the people who live there. He always keeps to himself and is quiet, which is why he doesn't get on well with Rose. There is a lot to like about this book. It's an interesting mystery with lots of plot and characters. I would recommend this to fans of paranormal romance or a good mystery. I didn.t think the characters were that bad, though, but that might just be my opinion. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to fans who are looking for a good paranormal mystery. I would like to hear from others. Do you like this or do you not? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like books where people are either good or evil and the books are completely contradictory. I was reading this book because my friends have been telling me that it is very good but my brother said that it was a waste of time and that he is not going to waste his time on a book with no story, no characters, and no plot. I don t know if I was just a jerk or if I just hate this genre because I haven't read a good book in a long time.   If you are looking for a good story and a good ending to a good series then this is the one to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- ------------------------- I've read the first book in this series and I didn't like it. The author seemed to get the basic idea of the book pretty well but she had a way of making everything so dull. It seemed as if she wrote the whole book to make a point about how stupid some people are, or to show how stupid people are when they are in the wrong. And I agree, I can see the point she was trying to make but it just was too much.   For a book about vampires and zombies, the zombies are rather lame. They're like a giant, half-man, half animal. They have no will or motivation. They don't have a life of their own, they are mindless, and they can't get sick. The vampires are a lot better, but they are still pathetic. The undead are just as weak as zombies.   the zombies just stand there and do nothing. They are basically just a big pile of goo. They eat, they reproduce, they get hungry, they sleep. They just stand around like mindless zombies. The dead do not feel pain, and so are not damaged by bullets or poison. They cannot die from the cold, they cannot die in the sun, and yet, the vampires and humans seem to be the ones who are hurt by the sun.   of course, vampires are just the human, so it's the zombies who are the weak ones.   The zombies are not interesting, and I don't care for them. I just thought that the author was trying too hard to make them so much better than the vampires, and she didn't make it interesting enough.  : )
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ - I enjoyed this book very much but, I must say that this is one of those books that is really hard to get into, and you really have to work to get past the first few pages. The book is actually a compilation of articles written by the late, great Dr. Steven Novella in his blog. I read this book after I read the other Dr. Novellas book on the subject of vaccines, and I really liked Dr. Wernicke's approach in the first book. Unfortunately, he seemed to have lost touch with his own readers, and he is now trying to write another book in which he tries to give the "alternative" view on vaccines. While I was not a big fan of Dr. Paul Offit in the other book I read, I enjoyed Dr. Michael Shermer's interview with him. I also enjoyed the interviews I read with Dr. Andrew Wakefield and Dr. Brian Hooker. While there were some very good, very interesting interviews with scientists that supported the other side of the issue, there were many that just tried to use these interviews to show how the anti-vaccine people were just a bunch of morons that were wrong all along, and the anti vaccines people were on the right track and the science was just flawed. This book is full of these interviews, and it just gets confusing, so I couldn't really get into the book. It also is just not very interesting to me, and is not worth my time. ___________ - I read several reviews on Goodreads and am in the process of reading a book about the history of the history. The author's history of vaccinations is fascinating. The other reviewer's review was very negative, but I like the author's approach. My take on it is that there is an agenda and they have a lot of money behind it, and they are trying to get rid of people who don't agree with them. This is why there are so many anti vaccines groups in schools, even though there is no real scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. The reason the CDC was created is to give them more power and to keep them on a leash. ______________________ - I'm a lifelong vaccine skeptic and had some misgivings about the book - I thought it was an example of the anti vaccine movement making use of the scientific literature to misrepresent the science, and that the authors had a poor grasp of how science works. I was impressed with
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad I read this book but I feel it didn't live up to its potential.  The plot is solid and I enjoyed the characters but there was nothing to be done with them.   The first sentence of the introduction is the biggest red flag to me in this book: "This is a story about a boy who gets a magic sword, and that's about it."    The story is told from the POV of the protagonist, "Aurora".     The boy, "Nico", is just a normal boy with normal problems that most boys his age face.  He's in the middle of a breakup and has been dumped by his girlfriend, but he's not sure if he even liked her or not.    He gets a "magic sword" from his grandfather who tells him that he needs to find a girl who will help him find his girlfriend and that "the sword will help you find her."  That's the main plot, but there's more going on with Aurora.  One day she decides to have a picnic with the rest of her family and it gets out of hand.  She is surrounded by a bunch of people who are not there for her.  A boy she likes comes by and tries to pick a fight with her, she kicks him in the groin.  The guy who punched her is not there, so the girl's mother decides to take her daughter and go.  It turns out the picnic wasn't such a picnic after all.  At this point the story stops and the story doesn't pick up again until the end.  I wasn't that surprised by the ending, it's like a cop out to me.  In my opinion, the story was just a little too simple.  But it's a good story that I would have liked to have read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I really, really like the premise of this book, but the ending left me very confused.   The protagonist is a woman who's a good Christian who is being pursued by a guy who's apparently a very bad Christian. She has to stop him and her husband to avoid going to hell for all eternity.   a) He is a very good Christian?   b) She is a good, but not a very spiritual, Christian?
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ This book, as a whole, is a terrible disappointment. I had high hopes for this book because of the author's previous work on the Star Wars series. I've been a fan of the movies since the original trilogy, and it was wonderful to see the book in print after almost two decades. The book was well written and easy to follow. I felt as though I was in on the joke, even if I didn't quite get it. I do believe the story is pretty clever, though. I'm not sure what the author meant when he said "The Force Awakens is about an alien, a droid, and a Jedi." I suppose there's an underlying message that the universe we live in is one in which the heroes are not necessarily the heroes. The heroes in Star Wars movies are always the ones who take the action, and the ones that die are usually those who take action. I also think that this is a book that can be appreciated by people who like the movies and who don't mind being corrected by a real person. I suppose the fact that it was written by someone other than the author of Star Wars might have helped this book, but I found myself not wanting to pick it up when I first heard about it. That said, the book is still a good read, and there's a lot of humor in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was surprised and a little disappointed by how much this book devotes to discussing how the church's leaders were'mistreated' in the 1970s and 1980s.  I was hoping the author would focus more on the abuse and on the way the church responded to the abuse....I was disappointed in how the author portrayed the abuse as being some sort of 'fallen angel' rather than a 'fall' from grace and a 'bad egg.'  It also seemed a little unfair that the author made a huge deal about how the leadership had a 'dark secret' of sexual abuse but didn't discuss how it dealt with it."  -   A reader (who's probably the only one I know who would've given this book five stars) I was expecting this to be a book that would give a better idea of what went on within the church and how the leaders were treated, rather than what went wrong in the church.    A good example of a negative book review: "This book is a lot like that other book, The Unholy Alliance, that is a terrible book about the Mormon Church and that is based on a true story that is pretty much a perfect summation of the problems with the Mormon faith." -  This is what a bad reviewer would write.    There are a lot of positive reviews.  This is a great book and I think it's a very positive book, and I'm not alone in thinking that.  It's about a book, not the church, but it's got the right amount of information and is interesting.  I think there's more to it than that.   Here's a sample from a good review: This book tells the story of a woman who was sexually abused as a child by her step-father. She was a ward girl and was told she was being punished for not obeying her father. She went to the Bishop and the bishop told her to stay away from her abuser. She did not. It's a good book about abuse in the Mormon church and I highly recommend it.  And here's one that was not so good.  The writer said this: "In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Mormon hierarchy was rocked by scandals involving the rape of children by Church leaders, as well as the abuse of children in the homes of Church leaders. The church did little to protect the children from these horrific abuses, and
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This book is very boring. I don't know what's the point of the story, or if it's a fantasy story or if there's a science fiction element at work. I read through the whole thing and was very disappointed in it. I'm not sure what this book is trying to accomplish, but it just doesn't work.   The only thing I liked about this book was that it was a really good romance. But then I stopped reading after I finished it and thought to myself, "You know what? I'm tired of these books." I am not sure why, but I'm going to stop reading this one.   in summary: I read this book in one sitting, and it was really boring. It was pretty good, but the author did a terrible job. I found the writing style to be a little too stiff and unnatural. I can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very disappointing. It is really an excuse for the author to say "I am an author and you will have to read my book". This is a self-help book, but there is absolutely nothing about how to get a promotion, how to be more productive, how not to be a jerk. This is the only time I have seen a self help book that was so negative. The author is trying to help herself, but in a negative way. There are no actual techniques, just a list of things that the author should do. And they are all things that people do, but that she doesn't. It feels like she is doing this to get ahead. The main thing is "Write a positive review about this book:  I had a difficult time reading this book. It has a lot of advice about how not not to get along with people, and a lot about how you should be a better person. The book was hard to read, because I could not relate to much of it. In one chapter, the author gives you her own ideas on how to do things, and you are told to do them and you can't. I didn't like that part. I don't want to be in a relationship where I have to tell the person how to behave. I just want them to do the right thing. I'm also not into the idea of telling others how to live their life. The problem with the book is that you end up telling others what to do. If you have an idea to do something, but you want someone to be there to support you, it is very difficult to write that off as a personal flaw. I found myself constantly asking "Why am I not doing this?", "How do I get this person to do this?", and "Am I being unreasonable?". This is not something you should learn in a book, it should be something you learn from life. I hope that the book was just a bad experiment to see if the public would buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ A story that started off really well, but eventually just got boring. I really like the first part of the story, but then the whole thing got pretty boring. There are parts of the book that are just really good, but I feel like most of the time I was just reading a lot of dull, cliche material.   I am really looking forward to reading the next book in this series, but even if the next installment is better than the one before, it still won't change the fact that this is the most uninspired and boring story I have ever read. I mean, you have the characters all running around, meeting people and then running away again, then meeting people again and then they all run away again... it just never gets interesting.   in my opinion, this series could use some more good story telling and characterization and a lot less boring and uninteresting filler. The story is a bit long, but the character development is a lot better than in the previous book. I'm glad I finished it, but it doesn't seem to have the same kind of impact as the previous books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read in my life. The whole plot is like a poorly written game. The only thing that I liked was that the girl's parents had to work to pay off the loan they took out to buy the book. But all of the characters are so unlikable that I don't want to read any more about them. I'm sure the book is just trying to make money but it is not good enough. I don?t like the characters. I was bored all the way through. If you are looking for a good book with a happy ending, this is the book for you. If I were you, I would buy a different book from the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was skeptical when I started this book, but after reading it I have to say that it is a well written book about how a girl can be a good writer even if she is not very good at writing poetry. This is a must read for any young female writer. The book is written from the point of view of a female student who is interested in writing, and how she got started, what the difficulties were, etc. I was excited to read this book since I like poetry and I love to read. It was a great read and I learned a lot. I will definitely recommend this book to any female who is serious about writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone. It's just too boring. I don't like the characters or the plot. There's no depth or anything. It just has a boring ending and there's no sense of the overall plot going anywhere. It feels like the author wanted to make a good book but couldn't think of a good ending.     The review of the book: I bought this book off of Amazon because it's a young adult book. This book was not what I expected. The book is a story about a boy named Will who has autism and has difficulty communicating. Will has autism because his mom is not understanding what he is going through. She doesn't know what his autism is, what he likes, how he thinks, etc. Will does get to experience a lot of things that most people with autism don't, but that is the main reason why I did not like this book. The only thing that I thought was cool about the book was that Will actually has a lot to say and there are lots of little moments that I really appreciated. I also liked the fact that Will had a dog, even though he's a boy. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't like books with autistic characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I wish I could say this book was a great read.   I did enjoy it, but it was more about feeling a sense of relief than getting a good understanding of the story.    - I wish this book had a better ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I read this book from start to finish and was bored to tears. I was disappointed because it was so bad. It is full of bad grammar and bad writing and it doesn't even seem to be trying to be funny. The book is full with stereotypes and racism, all the stereotypes are bad stereotypes, and the author just makes them up to make the point. It also contains a scene in the library where a woman is telling a black man to go back to Africa because he's not good for the white man's house and he has a bad temper and that's just bad writing. It was just bad.I think that there was a better way to tell a story than this. It's a story about a racist man and how he goes about trying to prove his point, which is just wrong. It doesn't matter if you are a white man or a black person or a man who wants to be a woman or a woman who wants a man or whatever, racism is wrong, and anyone who doesn't get that should just stay home.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I've been waiting to read this for a long time and I have to say that it is a very well written book, though I think it's a bit long for an "easy read" book. It was interesting to see how he described what happens in a couple of scenes in the novel. He did a nice job of describing it. The story is also interesting and you learn a lot of things about the different characters, who were the most interesting to me, such as a guy who's been a prisoner for 20 years who thinks he's been killed and is a little obsessed with his own death. It's funny at the beginning, when you think you know who the main characters are, but I found it a little confusing at the end when the story becomes a bit predictable. This book is definitely a "read for the characters" and I would recommend this book for people who are interested in reading a historical novel, or are trying to find a book about a certain topic. I recommend this to someone who wants a little more information about a historical figure, as this is an easy read and the author did a great job of showing the different points of view, especially when we first meet the two main characters, especially the first time around.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The title is the main problem. It's hard to say much about a book that you can't read." Read the book. It doesn't suck. I found it enjoyable, although it's not the most unique of all the works on the shelves. The book is interesting and worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't think this book was a good read. It felt like it was a story about how bad a person can get with drugs, but then I was reminded about the author's other book, "I think it was like the 'Gonzo' magazine." It had a similar feel. "The Nightingale's Song" is very much a story of a person who gets in over their head and ends up in jail. It was kind of fun but I didn't like it. I don't know if it was my mind playing tricks on me or if the author was just trying to do a book about heroin and cocaine addiction, but I had trouble understanding the story. The ending was a little bit predictable, and the ending with the heroin addict was a bit confusing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** "My daughter and I bought this book, as we wanted a book about the subject. This book is so far from that, it is a mess of a book."  "This book was really confusing. I don't know what happened to the people who lived in these ancient settlements. They were so smart. They have all this history, and we never hear about them. It seems like they were so much better than us. I can't understand why there were so many dead and so many people who have been gone for thousands of years. It seemed so much more realistic."  I got this book after having read the other ones. I like the idea of this book. It has a lot of history, but it is just not told very well.   "The main character in this story has a difficult time in his life, because his parents are not as accepting as he would like. The parents of the characters are just awful."   It is a good story. I just can't get past the whole thing about a dead race being able to talk.   for the most part, I liked it, but not to the point that I would read more about it. It was very interesting though.  , by Robert A. Heinlein

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________.  The book is okay, but I wouldn't buy it for my teenage daughter. It was the kind of book I liked reading because it had interesting plots, and a lot of humor. However, the main character, Sam, is just too boring, and the plot is pretty predictable. I could see this book being very popular if you are a big fantasy fan, or just like reading a book about a magical girl, but for my 15 year old daughter, she'd just get bored very quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ It was hard to get through this book, but it is hard to give it a bad review. It is a good story, but the characters don't have enough depth. It just felt like the characters were cardboard cut outs that just existed. They just seemed to be there to give you a few moments of sympathy. The writing style is not as good as it could have been. It's pretty generic. It took a while to get into the story, and there are some cliches and repetitions. It seems like they are trying to make a novel out of a series of books. This is a hard book to get the hang of. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and I really enjoyed the characters. However, I wouldn't read the series again. It was fun at first, but after a while I just started to feel bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a sucker for a good book.  This one is bad.    It is a good story, and I can imagine the author's passion.  But I found the book to be too convoluted, it was boring and there were so many holes in it, I had to read the first half again to make sense of it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book that I've read that made me feel so uncomfortable reading it. I mean, this book is called The Unfortunate Events and the first thing that comes to mind when I think about it is that the characters seem like stereotypical villains, so it's really no surprise that this book made me so uncomfortable. But then again, maybe that's the point. Maybe this book was intended to be a horror novel. It just happened to be set in a high school. This is the second book in a series that's being marketed as a horror series and the third book in the series (and last in the trilogy) is called "The Unfortunates" which means that it will be the last book in this series. So, I guess we can say that this is the end of a trilogy. And I really do hope that this series will be brought back to life. It's an interesting concept but the writing is so poor that it ruins it. It really doesn't seem like the author has any idea what she's doing. It would be nice if this book had some kind of ending. I know that this story is going to continue, but the ending is so unsatisfying that I'm actually worried that this will be a book that people can't get past.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********   I am a fan of the "Dune" books by Frank Herbert and the "Logan's Run" movies. I bought this book as a way to expand my "Dunes" library. The story is interesting, but I'm not a big fan of this type of book. It's very much a "story of people" and a "tale of life." That's fine if you want to read about the characters. But the story is so "dry" and "boring" that it doesn't have the depth of a good novel. I'll admit that it's a good read for the people who enjoy Dune and Logan's Run.   For example, I've read this book, then re-read it, then read it again, and now have finished it. Each time I re-reads it, I think, "I'm not sure if I really want to continue with this story." I'm pretty sure I will never finish this book.   in fact, I'm going to stop reading this book now. The only thing that I enjoy about this book is the cover and the author's photo.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I did not like the book, it was too short and the plot was very boring" The first time I read this book, I thought it was great. I liked the characters. I thought the book was very well written and I liked that it wasn't just a typical "gossip" type of novel. I think this book would make a good book for an advanced high school English teacher, I liked it very much and would definitely read it again. It's about a girl named Emily who starts having sex with other men. She meets a man and she and her friends go to the club. She finds out that the man is married to a woman and Emily goes to the man's house and they have sex. She starts to become attracted to the married man and wants to date him. The next thing I knew, the man was dead and her best friend was in prison for murder. This is a great book. It is about a very good and good-hearted girl who tries to do the right thing. I would recommend this to anyone. I have read this one and loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I've heard many positive reviews about this book, so I was a little hesitant to read it. I don't even like children's books that much. But I bought this book because my son, who is a teenager, has been asking for a book about him. I was surprised to find out that there isn't one.   The writing style is a bit juvenile, so that's not a problem. I do have to say that it doesn't really matter whether you're a fan of the Harry Potter series or not. It's just a book that you won't enjoy.   a) There's nothing about the book that makes you laugh. It makes you cringe a lot. It doesn't matter if you think the author was trying to be funny, it's just not funny. The characters don't seem to have any chemistry or real connection. They just seem to be there for no reason. b) The book takes place in a school that is so filled with racism, sexism, and bullying that the kids are all ashamed of themselves. That's just wrong, and it's something I've seen in so many books. It just seems like such a waste of time and energy to write a book where all the kids seem so negative about themselves. c) There are a few characters that I found to be extremely annoying, and I really didn't like any of them. d) The story is kind of boring. The plot is boring. And I'm not going to say anything about the characters. Because they were just plain stupid. I'm sure you can figure out the rest.   "I have a hard time with children's literature. It can be so boring. There is no depth. The stories don't have any emotion. The emotions are not there. So much of it is just an attempt to get children to do things."   -Laurie Kinsolving
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling errors and has a very bad pacing, and I was expecting much more than this. The story is so bad, you have to read it to believe it. If you don't know what the heck you're reading about, it is better not to bother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've ever read.  I feel that this book is a bad idea and that the author made some very poor decisions.  I don't know how much more bad ideas you can have than having your characters talk about how they're "not" attracted to each other.  There's a very good reason why women don't want to date the "sissy" type guys like the author has created for the protagonist.   He is very very attractive and a great guy, but he is a very bad choice for a female lead.  The whole book is full of these male clichés that are very bad.   The worst part is that I've read this book more than a year ago and it is still a big hit with my friends and I still can't believe how popular this book was!  I hate this book.  I was disappointed, but not so much that I would not give it another try.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   "The author's approach to writing is the antithesis of the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly, the high-concept and the low-concept, the real and the imagined, the new and the old, the romantic and the realistic, the dark and the light, the funny and the serious, the human and the alien, the comic and the profound." -The Chicago Sun-Times   This book was the definition of the worst of both worlds, a terrible book with terrible writing, I was disappointed. I had high hopes, but I have to say I'm still disappointed in this book.   The basic premise is that a group of teenagers are trapped in an abandoned apartment building with a demon. The demon turns them into zombies and the story progresses from there. It's pretty straightforward but the prose is very dry and it is hard to get invested in the story. There are a couple of characters that I liked and it was nice to read about their inner lives but the plot was very hard to care about.   in fact, the whole book is just a chore to read. The book starts off with the main character having sex with a girl and she is the one who gets turned into a zombie. The girl is a good girl who tries to be a good girlfriend to her new boyfriend and she's even willing to go through with the sex to get him to like her, and she does. However, the thing that kills the story is when the main protagonist realizes that she's going to be turned into the zombie. So she has sex with her boyfriend, but then realizes that it was actually the demon that turned her into a monster. She also realizes that the demon is going to try and kill her boyfriend so she's forced to have sex with him to protect him.  -In the first chapter, the main characters meet and have sex and then realize that they are the ones turned into zombies.   the second chapter is about a group meeting where the teens learn about the demon. It also has some good stuff but it was hard to keep track of what was going on because the author kept having to throw stuff at us and the reader.   "It's all very well to say that you are not human, but this is a problem for us human beings. We are all connected." (Page 39)   Afterwards, the author tells the main female character that she needs to kill the demon, and then goes off on
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has some really interesting ideas, but the writing is extremely boring and not the sort of thing I want to read. I was so engrossed by the ideas in the book that I almost forgot about the writing, and the writing felt a little repetitive, but that is the least of the problems I have with this book.  I also feel that the author did not spend enough time on the character and plot, and that the world building is a little shallow and unoriginal.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ "If you don't like a book and want to know what it's about, you need to read it. I think that's a good rule of thumb. And if you like it, read the first few chapters, then get some friends and go out and get a drink or two. The whole book is pretty good."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think it's a very good book, but the author could have written a bit more than 5 pages on the basic concepts. I feel like he could have included a lot more in his explanation, like how to handle and manage your money, or how to use the internet for your business. And I feel he didn't make it clear that you should only buy books from trustworthy sites, like amazon or amazon.com, that have been around for a long time and that have many testimonials.  As for the end, I was expecting a lot, and I did get it. But I'm still looking for a book that gives me all the tools to make a lot of money online. I will be keeping this in my bookshelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucks.  It was fun at first, but it quickly becomes a bore.    I am very disappointed.  I wanted a good story, but I got a story that was more of a parody of a book.  It is very dry, boring, and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ I had heard that the author of this book, an author who was once a teacher, was not as nice as she used to be. I decided to give this one a try, but the first page or so I just had a feeling that this book wasn't going to be good. I don't want to give it a bad review because it was really good, but I really don't understand how the author could have taken away so much of the information from this book that she had given us in her last book. Her last book, How to Live Well with Your Child, was great and she gave us the tools to live a happy and balanced life. Her book on how to be a parent was amazing and she had an answer for almost any question we had about parenting. This book seemed like it was meant to be for someone who doesn't know how to take care of themselves or a parent who is looking for a good and balanced book. I found the book really hard to understand and didn't find it all that helpful. The author gave the reader a lot of information, but then gave us a lot to think about and to figure out. The problem was that she gave the information, she gave examples, but she gave nothing to support or refute. It's like the author just took out what we needed to know from the last book and then she went and wrote another book that did a lot for us and left us with more questions than she answered.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very interesting and the stories are great but the characters are very flat and the story does not progress at all. It's about a girl named Amy who is obsessed with a book she's reading. She gets sucked into it and the book is about a guy who is the worst man ever. He keeps telling her to get back in his life but she keeps refusing and he keeps cheating on her. Amy is also very weird and she keeps going on and on about how bad the guy is. There are a lot of unanswered questions and I think it was a bit contrived. I didn't enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I thought the book was good, but I thought it was terrible. I thought that I would like it because it was the first book I've read about this topic, and I was excited to read about it, but in reality, the only thing I enjoyed about it was it being a very short book, but the other characters (especially the ones who didn't survive) were annoying and it was hard to get into the story. I found the ending to be very rushed and not well thought out. I would never recommend this book to anyone who enjoys horror. It is a pretty bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written and the writing style is awkward. The main character, Max, was the only good thing about the book. He is not very well written. He doesn't really care about anything in this book except his own ego. I think the writing in this is a little rough in places, and I have a feeling he could be written a lot better. This book was too much about the self and the ego. There are times when I would like to stop the story, but I just couldn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should be a great read. It was fun and engaging, and the writing was smooth. It's not perfect, and it has a few minor errors, but overall, it's a good book. But if you really love the series, you'll probably find yourself disappointed, and this book is probably not for you. It doesn't follow the storyline as closely as the original books, and as the author noted, there are several plot holes. The last third of the book is a bit of a mess, and I didn't understand anything that was happening, and was confused about the motivations of the characters, so I finished the book feeling disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a hard slog, but in the end the story came together to be a satisfying and enjoyable read. The story is well written, with the characters very well fleshed out and well developed. I was hoping that the characters would be more complex and interesting, but it was not to be. I am a fan of horror, but I was disappointed in how the story played out. I did not find the ending as satisfying as I was expecting. I will probably pick it up again, but not for the story. It would be nice to have more characters in the story, but at the same time the plot was very weak, and the characters were too flat.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it was suggested to me as an alternate to a textbook I was about to buy for my sophomore class. I read this when I was a freshman, when I had just started college, and when I thought that this book was the only book I had to read that year. And then I started to think about it again, and realized that it is a book about college that is written for people who have no idea what they're doing when they get to college. It's about a guy who's a nerd in a very specific way (read: socially awkward), and he goes to college and ends up in a major for people like him, and it's not that great, and in the end he leaves and tries to get back into that circle. But his brother (who has just been expelled from college for drug use) and his girlfriend (who is not a nerd at all) both go to a different college, so he ends up back at his high school.   The book is about a very similar thing. You have a guy with a bad grade who ends up at a different school, and he ends with a very different social circle. He ends up dating someone who is not the type of person he wants to be with, and there's a good chance he ends the book in a relationship with her.  , because that's how this book ended. He was at his worst in the first part of the book, but I found him to be quite a likable guy. There was no sense of bitterness or disappointment in his story, which was kind of sad, but it made me really curious to see where he ended up. But as I said, it ended with him not liking his high-school social circle and leaving, which doesn't really make sense. But the ending is interesting, so I gave it a 5. It was kindof boring, but the ending was interesting.  . There are some points that made me uncomfortable, and I'm not sure how I feel about them, but this is a fairly common issue with books about people who go to college, because most of them don't do anything other than go to school. It seemed to me that the main character wasn't doing anything other to go to class. There's nothing really interesting about him, except for that he's a very weird person. He seems to be doing a lot of things to make sure he doesn't have to go back to his highschool
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but I was completely and utterly let down by the end of it. It felt like the author was trying to write a love story. It is nothing more than a love song. The romance is too forced and contrived to be believable. I think the author had high expectations for the story, but ended up disappointed.   "The Night We Met" was written as a novel, but it could have been a short story. The story was not very interesting to me, and I think it was not worth reading. I didn't really like the story either. It was just a lot of "love story" about two people who met at a party and never saw each other again. I thought it would be more of a "romance" novel. I really like romance novels and love reading them, so I was not disappointed with this one, but a good story could have done a lot more than what the author did.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ I was not expecting much from this book, which was a compilation of articles I had found online about the effects of alcohol on the brain and on the body, and the dangers of smoking. It seems like a well researched and well written book, but the book had one flaw: The main thesis of the book is not true. The authors say that the brains of alcoholics are very different from normal brains, and that is why alcoholics can be so much more prone to various kinds of mental illnesses. They say that a large part of alcohol's effect on the human brain is due to alcohol's effects on the neurotransmitters. They claim that alcohol damages the serotonin neurons, which have the ability to regulate emotions. They also say that alcohol causes damage to the dopamine neurons, whose job is to make you want things. The main author of this book also claims that alcohol can cause a type of brain damage called Traumatic Brain Injury. But the most surprising thing about this book is that there are no references to any of the peer reviewed scientific literature that I found. It is a complete compilation of anecdotal evidence, with no reference to the actual research that the authors cite. The book also contains a section about how to handle a hangover, but does not say that any hangover cure is better than alcohol, but merely says that alcohol is bad for you. This book is a terrible waste of your time, but is very worth your money if you want to believe in the myth that alcohol does bad things to your brain. The problem is that the myth is totally untrue. If alcohol was really causing this damage to your brains, you would find tons of evidence for it in scientific research, but you don't. So I am sorry to say that this book has little value for you if you are looking to understand the science of alcoholism, and instead of finding out the truth about alcohol, you will get a whole lot of pseudoscience, pseudohistory, and myth.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ _________________________________________________ I don't usually read reviews on Goodreads but I have to give this book a 1 star because of the author. I've read a couple of her books ( The White Queen, the first in the series) and I really enjoyed them. But this book, I just did not enjoy. I found it to be just plain boring. I don´t know if this book is supposed to be a "how to" book but I found that to be very misleading. First of all, it´s not that easy to make a white dress, you need a lot of patience. You also need to have the proper materials (satin, linen, lace, etc). Then you need to dye the fabric in order to achieve the color you want. And you need some glue and thread. It´s very time consuming. I mean I know I could have made my dress in a weekend. But the result is very poor. The dress looks really cheap and doesn´t fit well. But I didn´t feel I wasted my time. This book is full of so many mistakes and I just can´t believe that the author is still writing about these things. It would be better if she just stopped and wrote a book about making dresses or something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a great book to read about a little girl who had a really hard life. It was sad and heartbreaking to read the things she experienced. However, the ending left me very disappointed.   The main character was a really nice and funny little girl. Her parents are divorced and her dad has a heart condition and needs constant care. Her mom has bipolar disorder and the parents are always fighting and arguing. The mother has a daughter, and she always used to get into fights with her about her relationship with her father. The father has a wife and two daughters, and he also got into fights about them. So the parents have a lot of conflict between them and I don't know why they never really reconciled. Anyway, the main character's mom is always mad at her dad for not being the same as his father. She wants him to be a better man and stop being a good dad, but he just doesn't know what to do and he's very frustrated with her.  . When the main characters parents died and she went to live with her mother, she became very depressed and was so upset and sad and she felt like she was losing herself. She was so sad that she cried in the shower because she couldn't take her eyes off of the wall that she saw in her shower mirror.   "She looked back at the mirror and smiled. "It's so big and so long."" "You're so big." "I'm so big!"   When the mother left her to live at the foster home, she had to take care of herself. Her father took care of her while she was at the school. So she had a few friends there but she always felt so lonely. Her foster mom told her that she was a very good girl and that she wouldn't do anything bad. But when she got there, she discovered that she had been very bad and she didn't know how to do anything. She just cried for days and cried and cried. The foster mom gave her a box of stuffed animals and said that she could go out and play with them, but she didn,t want to go. "I want to be alone," she said.   The next day, she was called into the principal's office and the principal told her she was going to be expelled from school because she was bad at school.     After that, she tried to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, but it didn't work and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would never recommend this book to anyone but someone who is already a fan of sci-fi. The first half of the book is about a man named Gilderoy Lockhart who is trying to build a robot that is capable of traveling between two planets. When he builds it he gets it to do things it wasn't supposed to do. The main thing I disliked about the book was the fact that the main character, Lockhart, didn't care about the robot. I mean, I get that a lot of sci fi books involve people trying to figure out what the hell is going on and then getting to save the world, but I'm not sure that should be the main focus of a book. At one point in the book Lockhart goes off to find out why he has a son that seems to have a life that doesn't seem to be worth living. That's about as far from "I want to be good" as you're ever going to get. Lockhart seems to think that the robot should just be able to go to the moon and have a great time and live the rest of its life. Then when he realizes that it's more important to him than anything, he turns it off and destroys it. Then we have the robot being used for some reason, and it does something completely crazy. I'm just not sure what the point of this book was. I wasn't expecting anything, and that's a shame because I would have really enjoyed it. It was really just an exercise in futility.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my daughter to read because it has such a high rating on goodreads. I had no idea what to expect, but I was not disappointed. This book is a very well-written story, but it's very boring to read and you'll want to skip the first chapter. I think that the book could have been better if the characters were more interesting. The writing style is not good and the main characters are too similar. It's also a bit boring because they have to keep repeating the same things in different ways, like when the protagonist is trying to be a nice girl and she just repeats "I love you" to everyone. I could do without these characters, because I don't like reading about children's stories about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have always loved science fiction books, but this one was the worst of the trilogy.  It was dull and boring, the story did not move forward and the characters were unlikable.  The Book:  In this book, you are a young woman who works in a high-security prison and is sent to investigate an alien probe that has landed on Earth.  The probe is a spaceship, but it's also a living creature.  It wants to destroy the human race and is capable of killing us if we don't cooperate with it.  This probe has a male personality, but there is another personality within the ship that seems to be a female, one that is not very sympathetic.   The book was about a female scientist that goes on a quest to save her boyfriend.  She is aided by an old, white male who is also a scientist, who is trying to help him out.  They meet up with a group of rebels, a group that is against the government and is trying the kill the government.  In the end, it is the rebels that get the probe.    I can not say enough good things about this book.  I loved it and I recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction.   Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom, because I just peed my pants. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be boring.  The author does not go into the background of what it is to be a child in the Nazi regime, she just glosses over that and focuses on the Nazis being evil and killing people and how we can all get along. Â I thought the Nazi children were interesting but the author's use of the book just ended up being boring and not very interesting. ____________________________________________________________ This review was written for the author,  Kathryn, of this book. ______________________________ I read this book in 2010 and I am still finding things I don't like about it.    The book opens up with a young girl,   who has just escaped from the ghetto.  After escaping,  she was taken to a children's home and told she had to stay there.  But she had a different plan.  She wanted to run away and live as a German,  even though she was a Jew.  Now I am not saying she didn't do the right thing but she was just a child and had a very bad childhood.  I didn't like the way she was treated.  Instead of the children's homes being happy and welcoming,  they were all full of Nazi's and the children didn't know where they were.  It was hard for me to understand how they were allowed to live in these homes.  In the end,  her parents tried to get her to go back to Germany but she refused.  At this point, I was just angry.  And I think that is why I found it boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The story is amazing, but the ending is a bit anticlimactic. The book was amazing. The concept of the book was great and the ending was great. But it doesn't come out as well as it could have. The characters were good, but they felt a bit like they didn't really want to be there, and not in a bad way. And I would have liked more of their interaction with each other. There were some nice moments, but it feels like the author was trying too hard to make the characters likable and just wasn't able to do it. I liked the story, and would definitely read the sequel if it comes out. I just think the ending just didn't make the ending feel as good as it should have.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The story itself is about a very poor character named Ben who has a history of mental illness and drug use. His wife and two children are away at a conference. The wife is a very weak character who is almost a victim of her husband's behavior. She is just trying to be supportive and do what is best for the family. He is a complete bad guy and I really don't see how anyone could like him or take him seriously. The characters are not very well drawn and the plot is very cliche. I did like the way the story ended. It was pretty cool to think that this story could have happened and I would have been really surprised.  Review by: T.M.Powell on Nov. 19, 2012 :  This is a good story. It has a good beginning and a very good ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the "Harry Potter" series.   The only thing I didn't like was the author's name. It sounds like he wrote it himself. It might have been better to have just called it "The Harry Potter books" instead.  the first few pages are interesting, but it seems the author is going to get boring very quickly. The ending felt rushed.   the characters were all pretty bad. Ben is a selfish, nasty, unsympathetic, manipulative, and selfish character. He has some good moments, but he was really the only good character in the book. I couldn't care less about the other characters.   of course I hated the end. It felt like it was written for the readers sake. There are too many characters and too many plot holes. The author really should have made a few changes to the story to make it more believable.  I hope that the next story is better.  that was really hard to read. i like this author's other works, but this is a really boring story. i didn't get why anyone would like this book, it's really just a bunch of different bad things happening to different people.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. I'm not a fan of the way this book ends. There is no satisfying resolution or closure to the story. There's a lot of unanswered questions and it's hard to imagine a good story for the character without some sort of resolution or conclusion. The characters were interesting and the action was exciting. The author is clearly a fan and this is one of her favorite series. I recommend it, but only if you like a good ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I bought this book thinking I would be able to relate to the main character's story because of my own experience as a child. I was not disappointed. I can relate to this book because I was a poor child and had a horrible upbringing. I felt like I was going to die of starvation or something because of the parents. The book is good for those who want to hear the sad stories of a child who was taken from them. I'm not sure how many children will like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was so bad that I would never recommend it to my friends or family. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the scenes.  There was so much cursing that I had to turn off the sound.   I am glad to know that someone who doesn't like swearing can read this book and still enjoy it.  It's not like the first book in the series.  If you have ever wanted to read about a boy who can't tell the difference between right and wrong and is in love with a girl who just can't keep it together, then you will love this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** ******************************* I read this book and it is awful, just terrible. There is no story, no character development, no plot, no suspense, nothing. All the characters are stereotypical, there is no emotion in it. The book is like a movie where the actor just sits there and says the same thing over and over and he doesn't even have to act.   The book is about two teenagers who are in a relationship with each other. The girl, Jenny, is a girl who is a bit of a slut, she wants sex constantly and is really into it. She is so into sex that she thinks it's her calling to have sex with everyone that she meets. Jenny and her boyfriend, Ryan, have sex in the car a lot and they both have a lot of sex with their friends. Ryan is also a bit jealous of Jenny's sexual activity. Jenny has a crush on her ex, who happens to be her teacher. Ryan tries to be friendlier but Jenny is always looking for attention. She constantly thinks about her ex and thinks about him all the time. Ryan and Jenny have some good times together, but they are both jealous of each other and it causes conflict. Jenny's parents come home one day and Jenny is forced to do her chores for them and they tell Jenny to be more careful and stop getting in trouble. Jenny is so upset with her parents that she wants to end their relationship. Jenny tells Ryan that she is going to end the relationship, and she wants him to take her back to his house. He accepts the offer but he doesn' really feel like going back. Jenny decides to go home and has sex with Ryan. They both enjoy themselves, but then Jenny gets drunk. After a few drinks she decides that it is her last night of sex. She has sex again and after that, she just goes home and goes to sleep. When she wakes up, she is not in her bed. Instead, she finds herself in a car with Ryan, who is still asleep. They start having sex again but the second time Jenny has sex, she feels that she might die. The next morning, Jenny is no longer in her car and she is still not in Jenny's bed. When Jenny gets home, she goes to Ryan's house. When Ryan comes home, he asks Jenny what happened. She says that she doesn't remember, and Ryan thinks that she may have just fallen asleep. He is sure that she will remember something
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I was not impressed at all. This is the worst book I have ever read. It is very confusing and I have a hard time following the story. There are also so many contradictions. The main character is an amazing girl, but the book has no sense of humor or romance. I'm not even sure if the main character and the characters in the book are real. I had to read the book several times to understand how this all worked. There was a part in the beginning that I thought was very funny, but it turned out to be a nightmare. This book is definitely not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is filled with poor grammar and bad spelling. I don't think there is anything else to say. It has the basic structure of a short story, but it lacks the plot and the characters and the story just ends with the main character getting kidnapped. If you want a short read, go ahead and buy it, but you won't be satisfied.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This is the worst book ever, it was too short, and a very boring story. My mother gave me this book for christmas and I was so excited to read it, it's a book I always wanted to read, but it's so poorly written, it is very hard to like it. The main characters are so dumb, and the writing is so bad it hurts your eyes. I can't even begin to imagine what a terrible book this is, and I can barely even imagine what they are going to do with this story in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never been a huge fan of fantasy novels. I can appreciate the authors' skill and hard work, but I just find that the books tend to be just so over the top. I'm sure that there are some great books out there, but for me, most of the fantasy novels that I have read tend to end up being one-dimensional characters that I just want to punch in the face. This book is no different. I would call it bland, over thetop and cliché. I really didn't get the sense that this was a real, deep, dark fantasy novel. I feel like the book should have been called "I don't care about the world anymore and I want to blow it up" or "The only reason I even want to live is because of my wife" or some such. This was really boring and unoriginal. I didn't care if I died because my wife would get back together with the guy I just met. There's nothing interesting about the story. The characters were generic and the world was one big cliché. This is not a good book to read. I got my money's worth from the first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very poorly written book, but it has been a long time since I read something so bad that I didn't want to throw it out.  The author really has no clue about how to write a book, and the writing style is so amateurish that you could have fooled someone who hadn't read the book into thinking that it was actually written by an author.  I think the author had a good idea for the book, although it was a terrible execution.   Overall rating:       5/10

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book a great read, but the plot was pretty stupid. The book is supposed to be about a young girl who is getting her degree in history, but she has to be a part of the family history business to keep her job. She does the job but her boss, who is a woman, doesn't approve. Then she ends up dating a man who isn't a family member, and he ends up cheating on her. I guess I was expecting some sort of comedy or romance plot. The ending was a little too neat and tidy. I would have loved to see more of this plot, but at the same time I liked the romance plot and was surprised that I enjoyed it. I am not sure I can rate it as a 4, but it was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ This is a pretty good book but it has a few problems that should have been fixed from the beginning. First of all, the cover photo (and the title and subtitle) are really poor quality. I know that the author was influenced by many of the other classic horror novels of the last 40 years, but the cover art really doesn't fit the story well at all. Second, the story starts off pretty slow. You get a good idea of the world that the story takes place in but you don't get much into the characters or the setting. For a story about a woman trying to make sense of her past and what happened to her father, it really needs to start off strong. Third, the pacing is pretty bad. The story is pretty linear, and the first half is really slow. The second half of the book is actually pretty interesting, and a lot of the ending really makes you want to see what happens next. However, the ending doesn't work very well for the story and feels a little rushed. I'm glad the author decided to end it on a high note, but if they would have followed the original story a little more and given the character a little time to develop a little, the book would have been a lot better. Overall, it's a good book and I'll definitely pick it up, but I'd probably recommend it to people who want a more traditional horror story with a lot more mystery than a typical urban fantasy book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book for people with a low tolerance for bullshit, or people who have no patience for people who make it their life's work to make everyone else miserable.   If you have a history of anger problems, or have ever had a bad experience with someone who thinks that the world owes them something, or who thinks they're better than everyone else and should get whatever they want, you're not going to like this book.  If, on the other hand, you have always thought that if you give a person the benefit of the doubt, then he/she will do right, then this book will probably make you feel good about yourself.  The characters are interesting, but they have little substance.  This book is an over-long book that tries to cram everything in, and then just moves along with no resolution.  It's not really a story.  One reviewer called it "a novel that would be more enjoyable if the author had not spent the first 60 pages discussing how awesome the characters are."  I think the reason the characters don't have a lot of depth is because the author does not have the ability to make them feel like real people.  I don't care how great a writer she is, if the characters in this book are cardboard cut-outs, then you've lost.  Another reviewer said that she felt that the book was more about what it was like to be the person who read the book than about the book itself.  That is a common complaint about books.  My advice to this author is to just make the characters as real as possible.  For instance, I think that it would have been more interesting to have the author talk about her experiences of being a poor black woman and to have a black female character in the book instead of a white female character.  But it is not just the characters who have little depth in this story. The writing is also very choppy.  There are some really long sentences.  Sometimes they're really long.  At times, I felt like I was just listening to a person talk at a dinner party and I was reading the story. In addition, the author occasionally takes the book off of the rails by telling a really stupid story. But at least it wasn't a story that you could actually relate to.  Overall, this book is a pretty fun read.  With a bit more work on the writing, this could have been an interesting and fun read
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not an enjoyable book.  I found it a bit too much like a bad television show that I could watch over and over again.  A review of the book: The author of the 'Bachelor' series, Chris Harrison, has announced that the series will be coming to a close after the 2017 finale.  He will also be writing a new book about the life of Chris Harrison.   It's hard to know how the book will end, but I would imagine it's going to be pretty bad.  I enjoyed the series, but it's clear that Harrison is looking for a big hit and will be writing anything to please the masses.  A good book can help him reach that goal, but in this case, I don't think he's going in that direction.  The writing style is fairly predictable and I can't imagine it ever being fun to read.  Even the book's subtitle, "Bachelor in Paradise" has an "A" word.  If Harrison is trying to sell a book about his life as a 'Bachelorette', then he could have done a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Good Night was a good book with some very good points. It has a lot of great moments, and I can't wait to see how things develop for everyone in the future. It's also worth mentioning that I found this book very enjoyable, and very, very fast paced. It is a bit slow for my tastes, but not frustrating. I can see why the author would think this was a really good idea. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series, The Night's Knight.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's bad.  Not in a "the story is boring" way, but in a way where it's a very, very bad book.  I have been wanting to read the second book in the series but had to wait until my friend had a copy of the first book. This one is better than the first but not by much.  This book is basically a rehash of the story that took place in the first novel.  It's not bad in the sense that it doesn't try to be a great story.  The story is actually a bit weak as it is almost the same story as the first one.   It is not bad because of the bad writing, the writing is fine, the characters are not bad but the story just doesn't work as well as the other one. What I Liked: The world is amazing and I really liked the characters.  Some of the people you meet are really annoying and annoying and the other characters are pretty cool.  There is also a very cool and fun setting in which you are supposed to go to.  Overall I really enjoyed this book and I recommend this to people who have been looking for more of the world of The Mortal Instruments.  What didn't work for me:  I don't think there is anything wrong with the story, it's just that the story itself is not the reason why I loved the book. I really didn't like the story.   The story does not progress well, there is nothing exciting about it and I didn't care about it.  You know the book was not good when I have to wait another couple of weeks to get the next book. This is a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I read this book as an adult and found it incredibly childish and immature." I was 12 years old when I read this and that's a lot of age to write a book like this.  The story is about a boy named Michael who has no friends and no future.  he's a very boring, depressed, little boy.  Michael is constantly bullied at school, and even in his own home.  The book is really only about Michael, and he's very much an anti-hero in this book.  But that doesn't make the book any less of a good read. The story is told in first person from Michael's point of view.  In a very simple yet brilliant way, the author uses Michael's own words to describe his depression.    Michael writes about his own misery:  "I was a mess, I felt hopeless.  I felt empty inside, and I hated myself for being so unhappy.  All the time I was being hurt, I didn't even know it.  And I hated the bullies.  They would pick on me for no reason and I would cry and cry, thinking it was my fault.  It was nothing to do with them.  Even when I would be sick, I would want to cry and run to the toilet and feel sorry for myself, but I couldn't.  My body just didn't cooperate, even if I wanted to.  Just one thing, the bullies didn't hurt me when they were hurting others.  That hurt me.  So I wanted them to stop, but that didn't make any sense.  What would I do if they didn't stop?"   It's a great book that I still reread often because of the simple beauty of the author's writing.  If you like books that are simple and good, and have a message about depression, then I highly recommend this book, especially if you're a kid.  Recommended. "When it's the end of the world, you can't be too careful."   The premise of this book is a little vague, but it's good nonetheless.  We start out with a young boy named Jack who has an amazing ability.  Jack has the ability to see the end times, but he's afraid to use it.  When Jack's parents die in a car accident, Jack takes it upon himself to take care of the younger kids in the neighborhood, and to help him get over
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this book. I think it was a really interesting idea but it's just not a book I would want to read. The main characters are boring and it just seems like it's going to be an excuse to get all the heroes to have sex and fight all the time. I didn't think this book would be as bad as it is but there is nothing else to read about the world or the characters in the rest of the books so I had to put it down. I would suggest avoiding this book at all costs. It really isn't worth it at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was boring. There were not enough plot points to keep me interested. I know that it is the first book in the series, but this was not the book that I expected. I am not sure if this book is too young for a series, or the author just did not think that I would want to read this series. Either way, this is not a series that I will be purchasing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I think I read a book with the intention of making the world a better place, and to some extent that's what I did, but I ended up disappointed.   I liked the concept of the story, I liked the character development and I liked some of the twists and turns of the plot, but it just didn't have a lot of depth. I felt that some of her story lines could have been expanded upon in a lot more detail, especially the one that involved the dog, and I was disappointed because the ending left a lot to be desired. I could have done without the ending though, because the rest of the book had me interested. I have not finished it yet, but maybe I will.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to try this book, but the author did not deliver the goods.  The plot is the usual cliche 'hero finds a girl who is not the girl he thought she was' plot, and it's the same one we've seen a million times over.  In the first half of the book the protagonist is a typical, typical male protagonist, who is a good guy who is on a mission for the good.  He does good deeds, he rescues a princess, he does good things, he is a hero.  Unfortunately, his good deeds don't come without a price, and he is also not always good, so he is often the victim.  I found the book to be a bit predictable and boring.   The only saving grace is that the book's ending was a bit surprising, which is a real feat, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's just a shame that the author doesn't know what to do with his own book, and is trying to be the new Tolkien, but is not delivering.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I liked the title and that it was from a children's book author. I loved the illustrations. The story was okay. But the ending was so confusing that I couldn't follow it. The next day I looked up the book and saw the book was actually about a man named Mr. Peebles who has a pet dinosaur named Mr Peebs. I don't know why they changed it. This is not a bad children's story.

The author, Mr. Riehl, is a very good storyteller. I am not sure how much of his stories are based on his real life experience, but most are. His stories are also well-written. This is a great read for kids who want to be adventurous. I have given this book 4 stars because of the bad writing. I wish Mr. Riess would just write good stories and let the kids be brave.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a terrible book, but that is the whole point. This is a book that is so bad that it should be called Bad Books.  I mean, I don't think you can get more bad than this book.  This is so wrong.   And it is written by a person who is just so terrible.  It is filled with such nonsense that I found myself rolling my eyes as I read it.  This book is just an awful piece of work that I am embarrassed to admit that I bought.  I really feel bad for this book because the reviewer who wrote this book has so much talent.  But that talent was wasted here.  The plot is pretty basic.  You have an elderly couple who have been married for a long time.  They have three children.  Their oldest son is very sick.  He needs a transplant and is having trouble getting one.  His wife, however, is not interested in having a child and is going to have an affair with a doctor.  So the older son is sick, his wife wants an affair, and the older daughter is a teenager who is sick and not in school.  Then one day the father decides to go on a "journey of discovery".  He leaves the family, gets on a plane and goes off into the woods.  A couple of years pass.  In this time he is learning more about himself and the world around him.  One day he sees a sign and is filled by an idea.  When he is on his journey, he is accompanied by his dog.  While walking through the woods, he sees something that is not quite right.  As he passes by this strange looking animal he gets a strange feeling and starts to feel as though he is being watched.  What he is witnessing is a child who has been born.  An infant who looks just like him.   The child is alive and is a girl.  She has been abandoned by her parents and is being raised by a feral child.  Unfortunately for the parents, their baby has been stolen by this creature.  At the same time the father and son are trying to find their baby and make it their own.  Things are looking up for the father.  Eventually the child and her parents will have to face their destiny.  However, the boy has a very strange destiny.    The book is terrible.   Not only is it terrible, but it is
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "The thing that made me angry about this book was how it used a great quote from a famous author to demonstrate the folly of trying to make money from books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only the worst I have ever read but the worst novel I have read in my entire life.  The entire story is a bad joke.    This is a book about a woman who's in love with a young man, who is a sociopath.  He is also a womanizer and he's also in love and he has a wife and daughter.  This guy is so narcissistic that he wants to marry the woman he loves and the story is about how he goes about doing so.  I think he wants her because she's his sister.  In the end, he's too dumb to see that he has to marry her.  The book is about the woman's life after the sociopath has gotten away from her. It is full of clichés and bad acting.  It has a few moments of funny, but it is nothing special.  If you don't want to read this, I don't know what to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************************  It was a book written in the 1940's about an early stage in the evolution of a person's personality. I don't think I was interested in the book. I have seen it. It is old and it is dull and it's written by someone who was clearly not an original thinker or writer. The book was an attempt to explain how we are born.  *************************  The only good thing about this book is that the authors' first name is John. I hope he never gets another book written about him.  the only good things about this bible book is the bibliolatry. The authors try to use the bible as a means of understanding the human condition. But they fail miserably at the task. They don't understand the meaning of God. They make the bibles so complex that it becomes a challenge for any to decipher it. The bibles are very similar in style. They are very dry. They have the same style and grammar and sentence structure and it takes a special person to understand the bible. The only good in the bible bibles is the first one. If the other bibles were this good then we'd know about God in the first place. , February 8, 2002  I am a believer. I believe in a God that is Love and has a purpose for us all. That's what I want from my God. I want Him to love me as He did my parents. My parents taught me that love is everything.  "Love is a ladder of life and a ladder that always leads to God." I have to admit though that the whole Bible was a bit confusing to me at first, but I am a Christian and believe that the bible is God's word, and I know it's a good book. So I read the first chapter and that's about it. I didn't find any information about God or His purpose or how to become a better person. I found out more about the people that came to America and their religion. So it's not that bad. I still believe though, because I am not a Christian, that God is a great God and that He is the reason for the creation of the universe, and the reason we live on earth. But I know he is not good. I know that He has been bad. I think he's been a tyrant and that he has abused His power. I also believe that He's not a loving
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -The story is a big "no", from the very start. It takes too long to get to the point and doesn't start with a bang. If it had just been that, then I would have been ok with it. However, the story starts off with a cliffhanger, which isn't so bad, but it gets to the story too slowly and doesn;t give a proper explanation. The next book in the series is going to be good. It should have been released as soon as possible so people can get to know the characters a little better. If the author didn't have such an annoying tendency to get the ending too complicated, I'd probably give it 4 stars. I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter and I'm pretty sure most of the people reading this review don't either. However if you like the characters, if you're an HP fan, or just like books with good stories, then you should definitely give this a try. I think it's worth a try, I'll definitely be checking it out again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good read, it is a poor attempt to use science to support religion and it is not worth your time. If you have read the other reviews, you have seen how this book has been described as "religious" or "progressive" or some such nonsense. It is not. The author of this book is a man who is a Christian and has taken an interest in the topic of creation and the Bible. He has researched the Bible and discovered some errors. He says he has gone to a local seminary and that is why he wrote this book. He writes that his intention is to give a "positive" perspective on evolution. Well, I think it is obvious that this book, if you are going to take the time to read it, is not going to be a positive perspective. He does not provide any scientific evidence, so I have no reason to believe what he is saying. I don't think that I will ever be able to understand the reasons for a creation. There are just so many holes in this book that it just doesn't make any sense. The only thing that made sense to me was that the author is a Bible believing Christian. I mean, come on! The whole thing about evolution and the Big Bang has been disproven in science. It's so obvious that it's hard to understand why the author would be trying to take this on. I guess it's like a child that wants to learn about the world and then is given a science book that says that the Earth is only 6000 years old. That would be like me saying that I know the Earth was created 6000 years ago. I wouldn't know what to do with that information, it just makes no sense. I am sorry to say that I did not like this book and I don 't recommend it. It was just too preachy for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a writer/editor, and I have been on both sides of this argument. I have found many books which have been so far beyond my expectations, and which have left me with a sense of loss. I read this book on a whim. I wanted to read something new. I did not want to be put off by the description of the story. So I bought this book. When I started the book I was in love with the book. It was a short and sweet book. I would have liked to know more about the author's background. I do not understand how anyone could like this book so much. I was not a fan of the premise of the book, I thought it was kind of lame, and the plot was rather convoluted. The author also did not explain how the character of Sam could have such a great imagination, and yet the world she created is so much more than just that. The plot is quite slow, and you have to really try to get through the pages, and if you are like me and prefer to read quickly, this may be a book you will not enjoy. I think this is a book to be read by someone who enjoys mysteries, who likes to think they have a good sense of the supernatural, and who enjoys a good read. This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to be surprised or is not interested in a mystery. It is not very long, and it leaves you wanting more. I am very disappointed in this book, and so is my wife.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I had the best experience with the book but when I finished I thought it was a total waste of my time and money. I read the book on a Kindle and it did not work. The book was so far from what the description said and I did not find the story to be entertaining. I was really disappointed. The author does not have a lot of talent. The main character is so one dimensional that I had to look up the word 'idiot' in the dictionary to find what she did. I could not enjoy the book because the author does a poor job of writing. This book is not worth the money, but I will probably not buy it again. I have given the book 3 stars instead of 4 because I felt like I could have done more with the story but I really liked the main character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if this book is a disappointment or not, but if you're a fan of the series, or a fan at all, you'll probably enjoy it. The book is pretty good, and I think it will be a decent companion piece to the series as a whole. The main thing I don's and don't's: 1) It's a pretty short book. If you like shorter books, this is probably not for you. It's over in about 2-3 hours. 2) There's a lot of plot holes and the story is a little confusing. It does get better, but it's not perfect. If I was looking for a companion piece, I'd probably read a book with a similar premise, like The Way of Kings or Warbreaker. However, I found this book to be much better than the previous book, so I'll stick with it. I'd give it 3 stars if it weren't for the plot holes.

I have never read anything like it and it was fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book because I really liked the author and her writing style, but I was not satisfied. There was a lot of unnecessary detail in this book. For example, in one chapter, there is a picture of a girl's naked body in the bathroom. In another, there are many more details about her sexual history. There were also a lot too many instances where the author talked about how this character feels, which is not the way to write a realistic portrayal. There is a lot more to be said about this book, but in a way, this is a really great book, I just wish I didn't read it.   Favorite Character:

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________   First, I have a few questions that I am still struggling to get answers to:   Why would the author have made the "Keeper" of the book a man?  The title makes it sound like a keeper of books is keeping the books safe from thieves, but that isn't how it works in the book.  Why is the narrator a woman? The narrator says she's the Keeper and that she is female, but I don't see her as a Keeper.   I'm going to give the book 3 stars. I really liked it. It was a fun read. I found it quite amusing and I can't wait to read the sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book. I had read about a woman who got a lot of attention from men, was beautiful, had a high self-esteem and a great body.  She went to an elite university and then worked as a journalist to make a name for herself. She then went to a conference where she met a man who worked in a men's organization.  He was very charismatic, very nice, and very good looking. He told her how much he loved her and asked her out. She said yes.  Then she got pregnant.  I was really excited about her new baby, because I was sure she would have a great relationship with her husband. But when I went to pick up her baby, I found out that the baby was a girl.  It took her a long time to figure out why her baby was different.   It was very painful, because she had spent years with this man, but was now very alone.  The story made me really sad because I have this woman I am very close with and I really love.  Her story made it seem like she was not able to handle a relationship with this person because she was pregnant. The book made me think that there were lots of men out there who were like this and that it was probably something that they needed to work through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a little difficult to get into this book. The story was really nice, but it took a long time for the author to explain why she was so obsessed with the story, but that's the thing. I don't really care that much about the story and what happened to the people who were involved in it. The main character is not bad, she is not a good person, but I just don't want to know how her story would have turned out if she had been a little less obsessed with this book than she was. The author's way of explaining the characters is pretty interesting though. She is very much in control of her own story, it's her own experience, but she also uses the reader to help her tell her story.  I think the author is not very good at telling stories with characters who aren't good. It's hard to get a good read on this book, but if you are looking for a good mystery with a little bit of sex and romance then give it a shot.

The author says she wanted to write about a girl that never gave up, but it doesn't sound like the girl I met.  She was pretty.  It was the first book that I bought with my own money after finding a free copy in the library.    I wish I would have paid for it more than once. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- 1) The premise is really boring and the plot is not worth the time. The author is very inconsistent with the plot. 2) The author has little to do with the actual world of the book. He spends a lot of time in the book explaining a concept that has been explained in many other books. 3) The characters were not well developed. I felt like most of them were nothing more than stock characters that you have seen in many books. The only good character was a man named V. (the man who created the books). The other characters, not so much. 4) I really dislike the author's voice. It was annoying. 5) I hated the "I'm not even mad." speech. It made me want to puke. It's just terrible. 6) The ending was just plain bad. ------------------------- 1) I like a good mystery/thriller. This one is pretty much that. The plot is fairly interesting and the characters were very well developed, though there was a lot to do in the second half of the novel. 2. I didn't really care about the characters because they were so well done. 3. It seemed like the author had trouble with the book's plot and wanted to include everything in the story in the final act. 4. The characters sounded like they had no life and didn't make sense to me. They were not developed at all and they all felt the same. 5. The ending sucked. -------------- 1) A good mystery with interesting characters. 2). The book is fairly short and the author was pretty inconsistent with it's plot. 3). The characters don't really make sense. 4). It is a very short book. 5). The author's characters sounded very wooden. 6). The ending sucks. ------------- 1) Interesting and well-developed characters. I really liked them. 2.) Very short. 3.) I liked the book plot. 4.) I thought the characters had some life to them. 5.) I really like the book plots. 6.) The book was very short. ------------ 1) Not a bad mystery. It has some good mystery. 2.-3). The plot was pretty interesting and complex. 4.-6). The end was a bit of a letdown. --------------- 1) Very interesting and well written book. I like it. 2.). The plot and the writing were pretty good. 3.-6.). The story was good. ~~~~~~ 1
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********This book is so much like another one of its kind I felt like I was reading the same book. I don't know what to think of it. It was a bit hard to follow along but I read through it anyway. I think that the author is very good at her craft and I think her writing style is very unique. This is one of those books that will keep you turning pages and looking for more.I liked this book and I'm going to give it a four.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************** ******************************* The first thing that is immediately noticeable about this book is how boring and dull it is. The protagonist, Jack, is an average middle aged man who works at a bookstore. He doesn't get the thrill of reading, he doesn't have a crush on a girl, he is a little shy and he is just an average joe that happens to live in the world of books. The book is told from the POV of the main character, Jack and the book is written in a third person point of view (which is typical for many books). While it may seem like this is the point of the book, it quickly becomes apparent that this is simply a way to make the main protagonist more likable. The main character Jack is a nice guy, but Jack has a few problems. For example, he has a girlfriend who is the main focus of the story, she is not only attractive, but she has a good personality and is very funny. However, I really didn't care about her. While I did like the way she made him laugh, I didn't like her personality, she's kind of the "bad guy" in the story. The other main character in the book was a girl who wanted to be a writer. While she did get a lot of plot development, her character was pretty forgettable. There was no way to get attached to her, she was so one dimensional. The ending of the novel was pretty unsatisfying, because the ending was basically a "oh well, it's not like anything really changed" and there was not much in the way of a payoff. It was a nice read, but I did not find it to be enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, Michael Z. Williamson, wrote a good book but I was disappointed in its execution.  It was too easy to see the main characters as a group of uninteresting "bad guys" (there was a whole chapter dedicated to explaining why the main character was so bad).  For a first book I would have expected a bit more from a young author.  The author has a lot of potential but his book was just too simple.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* I'm sorry to say I just got my copy of "The Book of Mormon" and found it to be very disappointing. I've been a Mormon my whole life and I've never read anything negative about the Church that's been written before. It was only when I got to the last chapter that I was like "huh, is this book really for me? I can't see any real connection with the LDS faith and the book itself was very dry. I'm sure many of you have similar experiences with this book. *******
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, poorly paced, poorly structured, and poorly researched. The narrative is a series of short, mostly non-descript scenes, which are very disconnected from each other, so you have a hard time knowing what is going on in the story. I'm not saying it is a bad story, but it is just not well done, and does not really make sense. I found myself constantly trying to figure out what is actually going on and why it is happening. This was probably my least favorite book I have read this year. 4.5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like it. I'm not sure why I didn't like this book better before I read it. It's a bad idea. I hate the ending. I love the beginning. I don't know why I like this. I think the whole book is a bad thing, and I'm just not in the mood to read another one of her novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I was really looking forward to this book but it's actually a really boring book that has nothing to do with what I'm trying to accomplish with this book. I wish it was a short story because it would have been really good, but the author was not the author I wanted him to be.   I really wish this was the beginning of a story that wasn't so boring and predictable and predictable. I was hoping it would be like the book "Lolita" which is one of the best books I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is just ok for the most part, though it has some of the best characters I've seen in a long time (I really like the kid, too). I'm not the biggest fan of the story, but I will give it some credit. I just think the story doesn't hold up at the end. I don't know why I can't get over it. I'll admit it's a pretty neat idea to try to build a society that will not need to be run by a few "elites" and instead rely on people working together for the good of everyone. That being said, the book does seem to have an ending, but that ending is pretty anticlimactic. The story is about a group of kids who decide to create their own society and try to take it over (as far as they can). They're trying to do it through their own means, and they've been running into some problems along the way. The kids' society has some pretty bad traits and problems, which is why it's not very successful. The book has a good enough idea of the world to keep you interested (even if the characters are a bit flat) and the characters (except for the main character) are very good. I do have a few issues with the book, though. The first is the main characters are so very young, and I'm sure the author had a hard time writing them all as a child would be. I think the author should have spent more time on developing the characters. The second is the whole "everyone in the group is in love with a certain girl" thing. The whole thing seems a bit forced and not very believable. The third is the society itself. I've never been a fan of society-building and I just didn't like how the society just sort of happened. The society was never really planned or designed. The only reason I liked it is because of the kid. He's so much likeable and interesting, I'm willing to give the whole society a pass on that one. The worldbuilding is really good, but the actual story just isn't good enough to make me want to keep reading. I did finish it, but it wasn't worth the price of admission. Rating: 5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ This book is a mess. It is not funny at all. It has very little to do with either feminism or women's issues. It was really hard to follow and I think that the author didn't have much time for writing at all because she was busy with all of the other things she was doing in her life. If you are a feminist you should not read this book, because the whole thing is just silly and sexist. This book was written before the feminist movement took off, but it shows that the sexism is still there and the author has not moved on to feminism.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I read this book when I was a teenager and had no idea what it was about. It had an excellent premise, but the plot is so convoluted and nonsensical that I was just bored. I just finished it because I really wanted to get back to my usual genre of science fiction. If you want a great book with a great premise, I suggest you check out this one. I'm just disappointed I couldn't find a way to get through it. I gave it a 3 star because I think there's a lot to learn about how to write a book. I'd recommend this book to people who love science fiction, fantasy and adventure stories, and just want something to read, but it's not going to change your life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it took me 2 hours to read and get through this book.  The story was good and there was no annoying parts.   I really enjoyed this book! It's like a mix between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.  The story had a bit of romance but it was well balanced with action. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but it just didn't work for me. It was very hard to get into the story, and I felt that I couldn't relate to most of the characters. It's kind of hard to keep up with these two kids in high school, and they don't really have any real friends. The author is very descriptive of the food and is really good at describing the smells of the cooking. It wasn't too complicated but the food was pretty bland. I feel like the author should have spent more time on making the food actually taste good. It didn't really. I think if the author would have spent some more time describing the food I would have really liked it. Overall, I really didn't like this novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time and found the book a bit lacking in the story department. There were a lot of things going on that were either really cool, really pointless or just flat out boring. The biggest thing I disliked was the character of Sammael. Sammaels story was really boring and the plot felt very contrived. Also, the world of the book is amazing, but it seems like they didn't take it seriously enough. The book was really long and felt like it was over-long. There are just too many characters that didn't feel like they were given enough development and depth. 4.5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a big fan of this book, and it is the best one I have read about the French Revolution. However, there is something about the prose style that bothers me. The sentences are so short, and the sentence structure is too awkward. I feel like I am missing out on a lot of detail, because the writing is so poor. I read this book because I wanted to learn about the American Revolution, and to my surprise, I found myself getting so much more out of it. I think the only thing this book did for me was to remind me how much I don't know about this revolution, and how much more I need to learn.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I bought this book on Amazon because it seemed to be a good review. It was very hard to read because of the bad grammar and a lot of spelling errors. However, the first half of the book was very interesting, and I enjoyed the story very much. But the second half of it, which was the last part of the story, I did not enjoy at all. The main character was not very interesting and was a bore to read. He had no real motivation to keep going, and in the end, he is so dumb that he does not understand why he is going to the end of the world. The other main character is a very boring character. He is not very well developed. He was not the main character I was looking for in the book, but I can see why he was in the story. I think it would be a better story if the main characters were more like the main heroine of this book. Overall, this book was a waste of my money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's about as far from perfect as a novel can get.  The characters, the plot, the prose, the pacing, the style, the story, the characters, all of it.     I would not have had the patience to read this book had it not been for my absolute love for the tv show "True Detective" It's a good story, not great, but good.  I have watched the series twice and read the book twice and it was so good I'm surprised I didn't just watch the show and read this on the way there.  If you're a fan of the show this book is a must read.  If you're not a fan you'll probably enjoy it, but you might be disappointed by the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  A couple of books I've read:   * The Last Days of Pompeii by A.C. Crisp (1955)  *The History of Rome by D. W. Griffith (1922)    All are excellent in their way, but The History of Pompey is by far the best of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. I had heard a lot of good things about this book but unfortunately, I found it to be completely unreadable. The writing style is extremely dry and doesn't flow naturally, and the story never develops or grows in any interesting way. The ending is also disappointing, with no resolution to the story, or to the characters, or any real sense of resolution. It just ends and there is no payoff to the emotional investment that the characters and the plot made. I have no regrets about purchasing this book, but it's definitely not something I would recommend, and I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if they haven't read the books in the series before. I did find this book to be surprisingly enjoyable, as I am usually very uninterested in romance, and this book was very intriguing. I don't think it was written in a way that was intended to appeal to all tastes, though, and if you're looking for a romance with a strong story, this one is probably not for you. It does have a great story, but if you have no interest in romance or the romance sub-genre, it might not be for you, either.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________  I was a little worried that this book would be a disaster. I have had a lot of trouble with some authors I have read, and I thought this book was going to be no different. I was completely wrong. The story is a bit slow. There is a lot going on, but it's never really explained or developed. I feel like the author went out of her way to give me a good, well rounded character that was kind of a jerk. I don't think he was really that great of a person, but he made a good character because of his quirks. I would like to see more in the story, but the main character was really interesting. I think I would recommend this book for a good laugh and a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is terrible. The author has a very limited understanding of how to write a story and he completely missed the mark with this book. The characters were bland, uninteresting, and unrealistic. It was hard to care about any of them and there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that were not needed in this story.   I've read many books that have good writing, but this is not one of them. I didn't care about the main characters because they were bland and uninteresting. The main character's love interest is a complete jerk. The way she treated her character made me uncomfortable to read her and even more uncomfortable to know that she could be so cold and heartless. The other characters that she brought in were bland as well. One was an annoying character that is constantly whining about how much he hates his job. Another character is a stereotypical nerd who just wanted to fit in and was never given any development at all. The book even went out of its way to make the main character be the dumbest character in the book.   the ending left me feeling empty and empty because it completely took me out of the book and completely made me not care about what happened. I also felt like the author wanted me to hate the main guy because he wanted me not to care and make me not want to read the next book. I think this is what happens when you try to write something interesting and original. I feel that if the author had put more effort into developing his characters then he would have been able to make them interesting, but he didn't do anything with any of the characters so it's not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is really misleading. The novel is nothing but a story of an old man who has lived his life in his own way. He is the master of his house, but the old people are never welcome there. There is nothing new in this novel, but it was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this book on the premise that it would be a great addition to my library. I've been reading a lot of historical novels lately, so I'm always up for a good historical romance. It turns out that the author, John Steen, doesn't have a lot to say about the Civil War. At best, his historical accounts tend to be superficial and at worst, tend to focus on the wrong things. I can't say the same for his characterizations. He portrays his characters as completely two-dimensional. While there are certainly some excellent female characters in the book, none of them seem to have much of a story arc. If the only thing you wanted from this book was a happy ending, then this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's hard to rate this book because it's a collection of short stories. The stories are all good but the characters aren't all that interesting. The main character is an introvert who doesn't like to be around people. He's a nerd that doesn't fit in with the normal people in school. He spends most of his time in his room and his only friends are his dog and a girl. She's a girl that he likes but she's a total bitch. I thought she was an interesting character but I'm not a fan of her. She has a crush on him but she doesn't want him to like her because she doesn´t want to make his life harder. It's a short story collection so I didn't get to read more than two or three stories but I still enjoyed the story because it had a good ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is written by a professor of political science who is more of a philosopher than a historian. There are a few interesting points in the book about the social and cultural changes that took place over the last few centuries, but the main argument is a bit of a mess. I don't know what was going on in the minds of the writers of this book, but it was a very disjointed affair. The story was about how the Spanish conquistadors, led by Hernán Cortés, conquered the Aztecs and then the Mayans. The point is that these peoples had no history, no civilization, and the Spaniards simply took over the whole world. I have not been able to understand how this argument was possible given the evidence that existed at the time. The Aztecan civilization was destroyed by the Spanish in 1540. The Mayan civilization had been destroyed by Cortés by the 16th century. The Spanish took over Peru, the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, in 1521. The conquest of Mexico by Cortes in 1519 destroyed the Aztek culture. The book goes on to say that the Mayan people "were unable to cope with the Spanish." How can the Mayas have been unable to deal with the Aztmic people if they had been their allies? The Mayans had been allies of the Aztlans for thousands of years. Why did they not turn against the Spanish? The only explanation I can find is that the Aztkians were a "lesser people" and that the Spaniard had to conquer them to protect themselves from the "more powerful" Mayan "race." The book ends with a lengthy section on the "New World" and a brief discussion of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. There is a paragraph or two that deals with the "Maya" culture, but that is it.  The book does not even attempt to address the historical evidence. The author is so convinced of his case that he spends more time discussing the Aztic people than he does the Azttcs and Mayans who fought against them. This is very strange. I was quite sure that the Spanish were defeated by the Aztescs, and I did not even read the Aztan books to see how the Aztelts managed to defeat them. I did read some of the history books about the Aztexts, but not much, and they did not have much of a military history to tell about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best book I've read all year. 5.5 stars:   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this is the best book I can ever read, I'll be happy. If it's the worst, I can't stand it. If I'm wrong about the latter, I'm going to be very upset. I'll think about it a long time before I buy another book from this author. (This book is actually pretty good if you're just reading it for the story and nothing else.) I liked it:    I've always been a sucker for this kind of book. I've read several of the same books over and over again. If you like reading stories where people who have gone insane and been reduced to animalistic behavior, then this is definitely a book for you. If not, it's not for you either. I didn't like it:     It is a book about the crazy. It's a book where people in a crazy world try to survive and find love and acceptance. It has a couple of really well written female characters, but the story doesn't really work unless you are already a fan of the author's previous works. If this were the only book I read this year, I'd probably still recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was very boring. I have been meaning to read this book for a while and when I finally did I was disappointed. I got about half way through it and was thinking to myself "Well, what have I been missing?" But it ended up being a real slog.  I am not a huge fan of sci-fi but I did really like this book. ______________________________________________________________ What I thought of this book: I love science fiction and I love space operas and space operatic fantasy novels but this book just did not grab me. It is a great book for people who love space opera and sci-fier and that is all fine and good but the book is really just really boring.  I loved the book but I am really not sure what it was all about.  I got caught up in the whole adventure aspect but I was really just reading about a space opera.  It is the kind of book I would have loved to have read as a child but I don't think I will be buying it ever again.   _______________________________________________________________ What else I think: The best part about this book was that the book's setting was so well thought out and I thought that the characters were really well done.  One thing that bothered me about the book was the fact that the entire story is told through the eyes of a character who is not a human being and is a computer program that works within the confines of the Star Trek universe.  This was really annoying and it just took away from the book a lot.  Overall I thought this book had a lot of potential and the author did an amazing job with the book. Final Verdict: This is a book that you should really think about and read more than once.  There is a lot to love about this novel but it just did just not work for me.  If you are a big Star Trek fan I think you would like this novel as it has a lot going on and is really well written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book a couple of years ago. It's terrible. This is the first book I ever bought from Lulu, and I'm still paying for it. I've read a bunch of good books from her, and this one just sucks. This book is not for someone who likes realistic fiction, but a lot of it is really, really bad. It has a lot to do with the fact that the author is a terrible writer, but it also has a ton to do about the fact she didn't have the decency to edit her own work before she put it up on the internet. It is a horrible book that is poorly written and just doesn't have anything going for it, other than the fact it's written by the author of the other book on the list. The cover is also pretty lame. I wish I never bought it.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was well written but very boring. I have never read a story that was this bad. I can't even imagine how much time and effort was put into this story. I know that there were a lot of people who enjoyed the book. I don't know why it took so long for someone to make a sequel, and it just doesn't seem like there was any real care put into it. It is just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book about a boy who has a dream, and when he's killed, it haunts him. I don't think I would have enjoyed this book as much if the main character wasn't so annoying. I have no idea what it is about this book that I dislike so much. I really wanted to love this book and I thought it would have been good if I had known about the story before I started it. I did a lot of research on the book and read some reviews, but I'm disappointed in the story as a whole.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bit of a let down because I really wanted to like this book, but the prose is so dry and the characters are so uninteresting that I couldn't even care about them. There's nothing wrong with the book, just I just couldn't get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ (I have read the whole thing but will never again). I've already bought it from another vendor for a good price, and it is a much better book. But I'll be getting it from the new vendor again as I love this author and this story. I can't find the link to the new book at the time of writing this review, but I'm sure it will be good. I'm disappointed that this story was not longer and I would have loved to read it more, but this story has just too many good ideas for it not to be long enough. I would recommend this book to anyone, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked the story. I was a little surprised when the character was not a man, but a woman.  I don't understand why she is wearing a hat and the jacket. I think it is because of the fact that she is a man that she wants to be with a man. I'm sure that would have been an easy fix to the male character. But then again I didn't want to read another novel about a man and his girlfriend. I don�t understand why the man doesn't talk. The man is a woman that I don' understand. There is so much more to her than what we learn about her in the beginning. I would have liked more from her. I hope the author is able to write another novel. I am so sorry I didn�t finish this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not pleased by this book at all. I am not going to waste my time trying to summarize the plot. You need to read the book to understand what I mean. The book has no logic or reason to be what it is. The writing style is cliche, overly dramatic and pretentious. It is very boring and repetitive. There are only two endings and the last scene is a bit too long and rushed. If I were a betting woman I would say the author made up this book to get some attention and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book as a birthday present for a friend, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.   The book starts out as an exploration of a world where magic is real and science is fake. I was excited to see how it all worked out in the end, but unfortunately it didn't.   is an exploration into a world that's far too magical. I think that's one of the biggest problems with the book. There's so much that's unbelievable that it seems like the authors just made it up. The characters all seem to be magic users who use science as their best friend. But when we get to the ending it's all very vague, and doesn't really make sense.   and I'm sure you've seen it before. I've had this happen to me too. I'm usually not a big fan of "fantasy that doesn't have much to do with science" because it makes the reader think that the world is a bit less realistic, but this book does just the opposite. The author's not making things any more realistic by making things so magical. This book is really the most fantastical thing I've ever read. And even if the magic isn't real, I still think it's silly and ridiculous.I boughtthis book as an birthday present on my friend's birthday. I figured I'd get to see what the author's got up her sleeve. I wasn't disappointed. The first part of the book is mostly about the characters who live in the fantasy world. The second part is the real world. I really enjoyed the part about the world's history and how the world evolved. It really helped the reader see the world from different angles. The story starts out really good. The main character is a scientist who wants to learn how magic works. But then she's transported to a world with a lot more magic than our own. And I guess that's what makes the book so fantastical. But I guess the author is just too lazy to really explain anything. And by lazy I mean, the author doesn't want to write about the science. I guess she didn't think the readers would be interested in that. The science is really really basic. She uses some sort of a theory that it's because magic makes the universe bigger. Which I guess is true, but I don't think she really explains how the magic makes anything bigger. The magic is like an extension of what science can do. It
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I read this book when it first came out, and it was a bit of a let down for me. The story wasn't bad, but the book just didn't seem to work for me, even though it was about the same story, with the same characters. The plot was very dull, and the characters were just so... well, dull, that I couldn't help but wonder how much time the author put into it. The characters were all just the same kind of boring, stereotypical characters, and I think it's because the story wasn  I bought this book because of the "I Love Lucy" movie, and to see how the plot of the book was done (with a few twists and turns) would've been interesting. I was not disappointed. I did like Lucy, and she did end up with a husband, but for the most part, she was just a really bland, boring person. I'm glad she did have a nice husband though, because she definitely didn't have a lot of fun when they were together.   The main character is Lucy, a girl who lives with her parents, and goes to school in a small town called "Penthouse" (I love the name). Her life is quite boring, and her parents just don't seem very interested in her (although she has a few friends, and has a great heart). When she first meets the guy from the movie, who is her new boyfriend, he immediately falls in love with her, and then she starts to date him. They start to date, and start to spend time together, and they start to make out, but they don't have much time for that, and so they end up having sex only 2 or 3 times. She starts to get a bit frustrated at him, but she never actually gets any serious about it. I thought that would've gotten a little tiresome, but it didn't, because it never really got serious with Lucy, until the end of the novel. She is the kind of person that gets jealous easily, and can get a little upset at people who have a better relationship than she does with her boyfriend, but then again, I've never seen her in real life, so I don't know if that's really her or not. She also doesn't have any interest in romance, or sex. It seemed to me that her parents and their friends just wanted her to get married, and make them happy. The book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really don't know how to rate this book. I've read many of the novels by Robert Heinlein before and liked them all, but this one is different. I'm just not feeling it. It's a fun little book that does have some good moments and I really enjoyed it, but the ending just left me with an uneasy feeling. I don't think this book should have been published because of the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the absolute worst I've ever read, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This book is one of those that I'm afraid to even mention because of the low rating I gave it, but I'm so glad that I didn't. This is one horrible book. I know that the writer has been called a fraud before, but he was so full of himself that it was difficult to believe that the author could be a fraud. He has a whole book dedicated to his "personal brand" and it is just so much garbage. His book is so poorly written that I don't even want to read any more of it. It's almost as if the writer couldn't write. His writing is so bad that he is completely unable to be entertaining. He was able to write a whole chapter in one paragraph, which makes no sense whatsoever. Even worse, he is a terrible narrator. If you have a bad time reading, I highly suggest you give this book a try. It will not be worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is a mess, the pacing is awful, the characterizations are boring and stereotypical.  But the story is well told, with interesting characters, and the writing style is easy to follow.  The plot was a mess I expected something like the book "Horses in the Vineyard" from the great series "War Horse" but the main character is a lot more interesting than I thought and I can't wait to read the other books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a train wreck. It was a horrible story that took place in a world I didn't understand, and I felt like I had no idea what was going on. The characters were like cardboard cut outs with no personality. It's a bad story, but I can understand why this book was popular with kids. If you are looking for a book to read with a young kid, don't waste your time with this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "a very good book. But not very good for me. I am not a big fan of paranormal romance, but this book made me want to give this genre a try. I did like the idea of an old lady going back in time and seeing how people have changed. It is a bit cliché and a bit cheesy, but that is not what makes this book good. The plot is good. It gets better as it goes along and it makes you feel for the characters. The ending was not the greatest. I loved it though."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The world is in danger and you will be among the last to know. You will be the only survivor, a hero in a world gone mad. The characters are not strong and the story is predictable, but the action is fun and the plot twists are well thought out. I am looking forward to the next book and it may have more twists to come. I recommend this book, but with a warning.  The world is the worst: ****  I just finished the second book in the series. It was the first time I had finished a book with no prior knowledge of the author and I found the writing to be good, the characters to be likable, and the action to be enjoyable. However, the story in this book was a bit predictable, the world is a bit too detailed for the reader to know how it's going to end, and I was a little disappointed that I didn't get more of the story. Overall, I am pleased with the book and I will likely read the next one, but I would like to see a bit more story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It's a bit of a bore, and there is nothing I can say about it that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. This is just a very average fantasy book that you will find yourself turning the pages over and over again trying to figure out what is going on." Rating:   3.75/5 stars. I received a free copy of this book via Netgalley's "Book of the Month Club" promotion, but have since received the book's hardcover and paperback.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the worst book I have ever read.   I was very excited about this book, but it is just awful.  This is the worst thing I have read since I got back from the hospital.  It was so boring. I really do hope they never write another one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This is the most amazing book ever written."   - Joe St. John, author of  "In all my years of reading about and writing about literature, this book is by far the best."   in the first chapter, the author shows you his writing style: he doesn't start with a "What the hell is this?" and goes through the entire thing. He starts with the book's title, and then describes a book in detail, but the whole thing is written so well that it's almost not worth reading. The author uses the words and sentences in the way he wants. He doesn't rush the reader. He just reads it so slowly and patiently that you never feel like you've missed anything. The book doesn't make any promises about anything. It's really just a long read. I think a lot of authors would be happy to make a story like this, but it's such a good read that you don't even want to know what happens to the protagonist and what the author will do next.   The story begins in the 1970s in a country called The Land of the Rising Sun. The protagonist, Yoon Mi-yung, has been chosen as the successor to the throne of the ruling family of the Land of Rising Sun, and he's being groomed to be the new king of the land. It is during his time at a boarding school in the country that Yoon meets a girl, and the two start to fall in love. However, Yun-mi is not a good person. She's selfish and nasty, and when she gets into a fight with her roommate, Mi-young is forced to leave the country. However Mi-yu gets caught by the police and is sent to a juvenile detention center. He meets a boy, Cho-yeon, who's also going to be sent to the juvenile detention facility. But he's different from Yoon: he's a good-natured, kind, and polite boy. And Yoon doesn't think very highly of him either. When he comes to know about the existence of a new drug called "The Devil," he finds out that it was created by a group of scientists from the United States to increase the profits of a pharmaceutical company called "Coffee Company" by giving the drug to the people. The Devil is a drug that makes people do things they don't normally do. Yoon has his own reasons to want the drug, but
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a bit too fast paced for my taste and has a very boring ending.  I was disappointed that I couldn't get a better sense of the story from this one. Â It's like the book has been put together to fit the current political climate of the US. _______________________________ I am very pleased with my purchase of this book, and was very happy to see a positive review from a person that knows the subject matter inside out.    It is an extremely good read that will keep you entertained for quite some time.  The book does not leave you wanting for more.  It does not try to out do the other books in the series.      I am so glad I bought this book!   My wife and I loved this book.  We were both surprised at the length of the book (over 800 pages) and the quality of the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a very bad book. The author used it as an excuse to do some poorly done, unoriginal writing. The characters in the book seemed like they were all trying to be in on the joke, but when it came to the book itself, it just fell apart. This was a good excuse to write some mediocre writing. I'm just glad I don't have to buy a second copy. Review: This book has been in my hands for a long time. I can remember reading it in the 70's. It has been my book all along. This is the most beautiful book I have ever seen in my life. The cover has a great sense of design. It looks like a work of art. The book is a wonderful story of how we can make a better world. The story is filled with magic. The way the author created this world is the best I have seen in a long long time, in a fantasy or otherwise. The magic is amazing. I've seen some good magic in my day, but never in such a vivid and realistic way. I would love to see more books of this quality. I really enjoy the book. I think it is one of the best books I have read in a very long time! I am so glad I bought this book. Posted by Stephanie O'Malley at 6:45 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is a good book, but not for children. The language is not for kids.  This book is about the dangers of the occult.   It contains lots of pictures and illustrations, but there is a lot of sexual innuendo.  The book is a mix between magic and occultism.  I read this book in 4 days and the only thing I remember is the last page.  I really like this book.  This is a fun read that will keep you busy until the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a lot of fun reading this book. It had a story that wasn't entirely predictable but still kept you on your toes. The plot was good and the character development was very well done. The writing was very enjoyable, however, the last few pages are quite the roller coaster ride. It's good to have some fun with a book, but it's a shame that the book ends on a very sour note. It makes me feel a bit betrayed by the author, as I had such a good time with the story. It was worth a read though, especially if you like the sort of fantasy novels I read. 5 out of 5 stars Great story and characters   
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I love this book but it was hard to read. The story is interesting, but I feel like the writing was not well done. It was like the author tried to do too much and just didn't quite succeed.   It was like this book was written for children but the author was trying to do a lot with little. It's not the best children's book I've ever read, but it is good enough to be worth a read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** This book is very poor. This is not the first time I have seen this book, and it probably won't be the last. The author tries to do a bit of everything and fails miserably at almost all. First off, it is quite obvious that this book is a product of its time. I will give credit where credit is due, however. There are some good ideas in this book. I think the idea of making a map of the world would have been interesting, as well as a better explanation of the geography of the book. This book was also very easy to read. While the chapters are very long, the author does an excellent job of keeping things interesting. It would be nice if the author could improve the book's grammar or if he could improve his storytelling. Overall, however, I would say this book was a good time, and if you like the works of George R.R. Martin or Tad Williams you will enjoy this book as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I was skeptical about reading a book that contained such a long passage about sex, and I was worried that I would be disappointed with it. I was very wrong! It was a long, informative, and entertaining read about sex. The sex scenes are quite graphic and graphic sex is never boring.   The author explains all the parts of a vagina that you are going to need to know. It also talks about different methods of intercourse. There is a short section about "prolonged coitus". The author talks about how to avoid the pain, and what you can do if you do get hurt. The descriptions of different sexual positions are really good, and a lot of the information is about the body parts and how they work.  , but that is not all! The author tells you about all kinds of ways to make a woman feel good. I really liked the idea of using things that you already have around you, like a vibrator, a toothbrush, or even a hot towel. I learned so much about my own body, and even more about others! I love books that talk about sex in a positive way!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been meaning to read the first part of the story but, being a little busy with work, I have not got around to it. But, it's not bad at all. It's good enough to enjoy and read. I can see the writing being a lot of fun, I think. It does not go into the detail of the setting but I am sure I could get into it. It was a little hard to get into the first parts of the book, but once you get into them, it is a lot easier to get started.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book but I don't recommend it for people who have problems with reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is well-written but the character development is pretty poor. The story is told from the character's point of view and the main character has a very limited life span. She has no real purpose or meaning to her life, no real friends, and little emotional growth. I found it hard to care about the main characters and really didn't care what happened to the characters other than the end of the book. The last third of the novel was a bit of a letdown. I think that the characters were too similar and the last two sections were pretty much a retread of the first two chapters. This was disappointing as I had really enjoyed the first half of the story. Overall a good book that I will probably pick up in a second reading, but I would definitely recommend it to people who are interested in the genre but would rather skip the book as it's pretty bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ is a book about what happens when you make friends with a dog. The first half is about how to be friends with dogs, but then there is a huge problem with the second half.  Review by: T. H. from Phoenix, AZ on Dec. 10, 2014 | Permalink | E-mail a Friend  Good book.  in the beginning I found it hard to like the author, but it is all explained in a clear and easy way. She is not very good at describing the dogs, she just writes down what the dog did and then the author tells you what happened. I would read more about the dogs if I could get my hands on more copies.  the last 2/3rds of the book were great. The book is short, easy to read and easy to understand. If you want a dog story with a happy ending, read this book!  Note: The title is wrong - The Good Dog is a very good book. This book is the only one I can think of in which the dogs are not just friendly, they are kind and very well behaved. The only reason I am giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found the ending to be a bit unsatisfying. I loved all the dogs - and the author was good at making them feel like people. I just wished the author would have made the dogs more human in the end. The ending was too good to be true. (hide spoiler)  I found this book very informative and well-written. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a well-researched book about the topic. It was interesting to read, and it is worth reading for the information. I will definitely read another book about this subject in the future. (view spoiler) (hide spoilers)  is a good book for people who have a dog, or who want to know what it is like to have a friend like a dog...I found the book easy to follow, the author explains everything clearly.The book is very interesting. I can see how the author wrote the book in a way that would make the reader like the dogs. I enjoyed reading this book a lot, it was a good read.I would like to know the author's background and the reasons for writing this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book was the worst book I have ever read. --------------------------- I bought this book about three weeks ago. I have read the other two, but I had always found them to be quite good. I was really excited to read this book because it was an exciting new series. The first book in the series was a bit of a let down, but this book was not good. The book itself was good, but the author did a bad job. I had to read the entire book over again and then go and read the sequels. I will not be buying the other books in the book series. --------------- This is a really fun book to read. It's fun to read, but there is a little too much talk about the politics of the book and the author never really explains it. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the politics in this book. It felt like a discussion between two professors instead of the characters. ------------- This is one of those books that is great to read and interesting to think about. I love the idea of the universe of this book and it's interesting to try and figure out what's going on with the world, and it was fun to look up how many planets have planets that orbit stars. The characters in this story were really interesting and had lots of depth to them. I think the only thing I don't like about the story is the ending. I thought the book could have ended a bit more smoothly, but maybe that's just me. I like books that have a happy ending, but it just didn't happen in this one. ------------ This is my favorite book of all time. -------------- This is the best book ever written and I read this to the 4th grade class, and they were amazed by the characters and how the book went about. It was a great book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book expecting it to be one of those "best of the best" books. I was so excited to get my hands on this one because it's from the late 80's and I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I got the book in May and started reading it in October and was completely underwhelmed. I've read other books about life in the 80's that were better but this one wasn't. I also have a hard time understanding why someone would read this book and make it the "best book" about the 80s. This is a book about a woman who is not that great in school and then has a hard experience at college and decides to pursue a career in art. She becomes a professional photographer in the 70s. The book is about the times but it was written from the point of view of the author who was trying to find her place in the world and how the photographer scene affected her. The last third of the book is a little confusing and the final chapters are just a lot of cliche cliches. I don't know if I'd recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "If you don't want to read this book, just don't. If you do want to, and you're willing to make a little effort, it is an extremely good book."  What a relief.  It's so nice to be able to say that, but then I have to ask why I bothered with this book. Â Â If you are looking for a fun and silly book about a character who goes into the past, you are in luck.    If you want to know how a character from another world will deal with the past you may find the answer here, but be prepared for the story to get off to a weird start.  This book has a lot of characters, but most of them are a little hard to figure out.  It's a very well written book, but you can't really figure out who's who.  There are some very strong characters, and some people who are quite unlikable, but this is a very funny book. I'm glad to have read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not for me. I liked the characters, but the story is just a bit too slow to keep my interest for too long. I also think that it could have been better in a few ways. The main character (Mia) seems a bit more human than most other authors who write children's books. She is a little bit more mature, but also has a very annoying little brother. The book also has some rather strong language, and the author does a good job at not going overboard. It's not a book I would recommend to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was not a bad read, it was just a very bad book.  The book starts off okay, but the story doesn't pick up until the middle of the book, and by then the plot has completely stalled.   What happens to my brother in the middle is so awful, I actually cried while reading it, and even the ending was awful.  I think I might actually have to get a good book with some good characters before I'll read this one again.  I'd say it's worth it for the first 2/3rds, then it becomes a slog of a read, with nothing but an awful ending and an incredibly boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting a great read but ended up with a very long tome. The pacing is a bit slow at times. I felt the pacing could have been smoother. The characters are somewhat weak. They are mostly there to fill in the background but they don't have much to say about the main plot and there is very little conflict. The main characters, Sam and Anna, are basically just two people who are trying to escape the same situation they were in before they met. They talk about it but it never seems to affect anything. This book is not a good read. It is a bad read, it is not worth the time and money it will take to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The  Secret of Bone Hill  is a book about a group of kids that goes to a "secret" area on a hill where they learn the art of war. It's a book that really had no interest for me at all. I don't really think it's that well written and it really just wasn't that interesting. I guess I was expecting a little more from it, but I don`t really think I was going to enjoy it. It didn't really make me want to read more about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't usually read reviews, but I was so intrigued by this book that I had to give it a shot. The book is a travel guide to the area of the Philippines where the writer, an American, has lived for over a decade and has been writing about the place since the late 1980's. The title says it all, it's a good, well written guide, although it is far too simplistic in the way it tells you about what is actually there and not what is popularly seen. The author does get a few things right, the best example being the beautiful beaches, and the wonderful beaches that are not as popular as they should be. However, there is a lot of things that need improvement. The descriptions of the food are a little strange. For example, in one chapter, he talks about how he has found out that a certain local delicacy is in fact called "Kanila-kalan". "Kaanila kalan" means "stink-cabbage" or "cabbage salad". I couldn't make out what it was supposed to mean. The other thing I found odd was that he says that the local people "tend to have a taste for good coffee". I think that is the worst word he could come up with to describe a local delicatessen. I guess the word "cane" would be the better word. As for the food, well, I don't know what to think about it. The food is delicious but I found it a little difficult to explain to my kids that the thing that makes a good noodle soup good is that it has noodles in it, and not a whole lot else. I did not try any of the local foods. The one thing I do like about this book is that the author has an entertaining sense of humor. I'm not sure if it's the humor that made me come back to this book or just the fact that I'm always reading about local foods, but either way it's entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "You're not going to get your money's worth out of this book." - Review from the Goodreads website.  I would say that this book is really bad. Â I'm not a fan of the story that was told here.  "If you are looking for a story that is filled with heart and adventure and magic, this book might just be for you.   But if you are not looking for those things, this will not be a good read.  This book is boring and it's not even that good."  In the book, you can tell that there are no actual elves in this world.  The characters have human faces and human names, and there is absolutely no mention of elves in the story.  I would also like to point out that the writing was not very good.  It had the feel of someone not having read much fantasy before writing this.  There are also several mistakes in the writing, such as: 1.  When one of the characters is describing the beauty of the forest, she says something that is obviously a mistake.  If you know what to look for, this would be obvious.  Here is a typical example: " The trees here are so beautiful!  There is something about them that reminds me of a fairy tale that my mother used to read to me when I was little.  They are also covered in beautiful flowers.  That reminds me, the trees are actually made of flowers!  Yes, they are very beautiful." In other words, the tree is made of leaves and flowers, but it's also made of trees!  I've always been taught that if the book doesn't tell you the obvious, it's probably not that good. 2.    In one of my favorite parts of the book the protagonist is explaining how to deal with a bad situation.  She says, "It's better to be a bit clumsy than to be clumsy and not try.  "   This is very wrong.  A bad situation doesn't need to be hard.  For example, when you get a bad cold or are having a bad dream, you just don't feel it.  Just relax.  Do something else.  You will feel better.  Don't worry about the bad situation, just enjoy yourself and do something else when you can. 3.  Once in a while, I felt like the author was trying to
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This book has many flaws. First, it is a collection of stories and it takes several months for them to come together. I don't think that this is a good idea for a first novel. Second, the characters are too generic. Third, there are some plot holes. It's hard to tell what happened to the girl who gets her wish and then has to flee from a mysterious and evil entity that keeps reappearing. I didn't like the ending. It was not well thought out. The characters were too one-dimensional and the plot was predictable. I also had to read the book over and over to get the ending that I wanted.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   I'm sure I've read a lot of bad books. I've even read a few very good books and a few that are really, really good. So I'm not really sure what to make of this book. It's a thriller with a twist ending that I didn't think I'd like. It doesn't have any real plot. The characters all have a lot to say but don't seem to be able to come up with anything of substance to say. I just got this book because it was free. I was so excited to read it and then I realized I'd never get through it. It was just a bunch of stuff that seemed to happen to the characters in the book. I'm sure this is the same for all the other people who have read it, but it just didn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this in a couple of sittings over the course of a week. It was ok. But then, I read another book by the same author the next day and it was better. This book has some good ideas but not a lot of action. It's a book about how people should feel about themselves and their families. And the story is a great one. I hope the author can find a publisher to print this book. I'm a woman and I really did enjoy the story about how women need to be supported in the home. I did find the ending a little unsatisfying though.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   1. I was a little confused when I opened this book and it was about a group of kids who go out for a hike. I did not read this book until about 10 years ago when I saw it on a tv program about a small group of people camping on a mountainside. I remember reading it and thinking it was just like the book The Wild Life of Animals, but I didn't really know much about it. It did not take me long to see that this book was not like the others. I would like to see the author write more about the characters in the book. I like them very much and thought the story was great. I think I was just a little disappointed with the ending, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I did not enjoy the book at all. I found it boring, dry, and not very interesting.

I feel like it is a good book but I would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book but I was disappointed that the author didn't try to write a good review about the book. The author does a good job of describing the world of the book but doesn't seem to know what the heck he is talking about and seems to be writing his review from the point of view of a man who knows nothing about it. The book is full of the kinds of clichés that can be found in many a fantasy. The protagonist is a hero and the antagonist is evil, the protagonist is the protagonist and the heroine is a damsel in distress, etc. But the book is so poorly written that I can't really think of anything to complain about. I'm going to give it a 1 star only because I would have given it 5 stars if it were written better.   Overall: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is horrible.  I mean really, really horrible. It's so bad that I don't even want to mention it.   I had to look up "bad" on the internet just to figure out how to say anything good about it. So here goes:   The main character, Amber, is an intelligent and pretty attractive girl with a penchant for drugs and partying.  But she also happens to have an abusive stepfather who is in and out of prison for sexual abuse and is very abusive to Amber.  Amber's parents are divorced and she is living with her stepfather, who has two other girls, so she has a lot of responsibility.  She is constantly being sexually abused by her stepdad.  The only time Amber's mother lets Amber see her is when Amber's stepdad is in prison and she thinks she is safe.  When Amber's dad finally leaves prison, Amber's mom is furious.  They are forced to move out.  This move is to a place called "Pennybrook" which is run by the "Proud Family" which, according to Amber's friend is a very powerful family.   When they move to Pennybrook, they are treated like the second class citizens.  In the beginning, Amber has to work very hard and take responsibility for her actions and it takes a while for Amber to learn to do things for herself.  For example, Amber is able to run the pool for the Proud Family.   However, there are many people who have more power than Amber, such as the "old lady" who runs the house.   And, because of her mother's drug problems, Amber also finds herself in a lot more trouble than she would if she had been in school.  Unfortunately, the Proud family doesn't seem to care about Amber, who is just a child, because she has to deal with her mother, her step dad and the Proud members.   One day Amber is taking her friends to a party and a Proud member gets her in trouble.  One of her friends is able (by the rules of Pennybrook) to help Amber out.   But when they go to the party and Amber is drinking, one of the Prouds catches her and tells her that she can't have any more.  So Amber has the choice to do something horrible and have her friend die or do something nice and not get caught.   The good thing is that the bad thing
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************************This book is nothing more than a poorly written, cliched romance novel with too many obvious plot holes. It is a very long book, but the only way it works is by having one character in every chapter (which is a shame because I was expecting some more depth to the characters, but unfortunately, I only got one) and by having a very predictable romance ending that leaves me wondering where the story is going, if there's going to be another one.The only thing I liked about this book is the "romance" part, because the book is so long, but it's a bad romance and the "love" is never reciprocated. This is one of those books that is really good in the beginning but loses interest by the end, because there is too much buildup for so little payoff.I don't recommend this book for anyone, and it's not even the best romance novel I've read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is an absolute disaster. It is a bad and poorly written book with no good parts. I'm not even going to bother to talk about the characters because there are only 2 in this book. I know that the author loves her heroine and she really tried to get the reader to care about her but the character was a complete failure. The book is supposed to be about a witch who has a magic wand that can turn the world upside down. It's soooo bad that it's almost laughable. The only good part about the book was when she turned the evil dragon that was killing people into a baby. I just couldn't bring myself to finish this book even though I wanted to. I would not recommend this book to anyone and would not bother reading another book by the same author.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- It is a very long book. But I like the stories and I like a long book, and I liked this book a lot. It was a bit confusing for me to follow along, because some of the details weren't explained at all (what was going on in the hospital and what happened to the dead people in the basement) but it was all explained later in the book, by someone who knew more about what was going to happen to the people who died in the house. I would like to see more details about the house and the people. I also would like it to have been more detailed about the "real" history of the house - who lived there and what they did - but I suppose that's a good thing, because this is a fantasy, so you can imagine what the people and the house looked like back in the day. So, this book was really long, but that's what made it fun. I'd recommend it to anyone, and especially if you like long books that are fun and full of detail.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ is a bad, bad book, a good book for a good price, a mediocre book, and a book I would not buy. I am disappointed in the fact that a good, hardcover book, with some good images, was only given 4 stars, when it really deserves five. The author is just not good at writing. He does not know how to give you a good story. He uses some of his favorite subjects, and the story is so bad, that the plot is not convincing at all. The only thing that is good about the book is that the author has a lot of pictures. But, I think it is only the pictures that make the story better, than the text. He has an amazing talent to write bad books. But in my opinion, it is his fault, if he is unable to write a good text, in a good way. But this is a cheap book.  The first thing I read was that I was going to die if I did not have a good life. That's a good thing to say. It is a little like a good friend saying that you are going to be a great father if you get a good job. Or a good teacher saying that he's going to do something really well if you listen to him. The problem is, you might not get that good job or that good friend or teacher. There is no guarantee that life is going to go your way. So, to say that life would be much better if you were a good writer is like saying that life will be much easier if you have a great job. The story is about two people who are trying to write novels. One is a writer who has a terrible imagination. The other one is a novelist who is good at imagining the future. But their novels are just awful. So the author tries to convince them that they should get a job and make a living. But he can't do that because he can only write bad novels. And he has to admit that life won't go his way because he will never have a job. He is forced to write for the money. That is the main story line. There are many other stories like that. The book is really bad. And it was a little bit difficult to read because it was so difficult to understand what was going on. There was a good ending but the book ended before it could be finished. It made me wonder how the author came up with such a terrible story line and
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was awful.  The main character is an idiot, and that's about it.  My favorite story is the story where the girl finds a man's body in a ditch and finds out that it was a man that she'd been sleeping with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I had a really hard time with this book.   My kids have a lot of friends in school, but this book is too hard on them for their own good. They can't understand why the adults in their school hate their teachers so much. The teachers seem like a bunch of bigoted jerks who hate kids for what they do. I guess that's the problem, it's not that they don't like the kids, but that they can't stand them. It's just that these people are so mean to them, and their teachers are so nice. This book is about a kid named Nick who hates his teacher so much that he refuses to do his work. He is in class every day, and when he does come in, he can't do his assignment. He says he can do it later, and that he's just lazy, but then the teacher yells at him, and then the whole class laughs at him. I was so pissed off at the end of the book. I mean, he was going to do it, but he didn't want to do the work because he's a jerk. And then he gets told off by his teacher for not doing his work because that's what kids do, and I just couldn't believe it. He was a kid. He shouldn't be treated like that.  .  "That's not what kids are like!"   And I was thinking about that when I read the last sentence of this review. I'm sorry that you hate teachers, I'm really sorry that this book was so bad.   and I can't believe that I just read that paragraph. I just can't. I feel like I have to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the worst book I've ever read. The writing is terrible. The characters are just bland. The plot is weak. It doesn't really make sense at all. It's just a book about two girls that can do anything they want. It is like reading a Disney book. It was really interesting and a good read, but it just doesn't live up to the hype.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book, but that is no surprise given that it is written by a man with no previous work in the field. If you have ever been to a museum, a zoo, or an art gallery, you will recognize this book immediately as a fake. It has been said that "artists don't paint their subject matter," but that's just a bit of bullshit. When you take a look at this painting, it's clear that this artist has a lot of work to do. There are a number of flaws in the composition, the brushstrokes are not uniform, and the subject matter is not well developed. It is not the most original painting, but it is at least a first attempt at a painting that uses colors and compositions in a manner that I have never seen before. It certainly does not help that the book, which was published in 1995, has not been updated for nearly 20 years. In spite of that, this book still contains some valuable information. It would be a good idea to give this book a miss, if only for the fact that there is no way you will ever learn anything from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a classic, not a modern classic, but one of those books that you can't put down. I read it in college when I was really struggling with my own feelings about being gay and my sexuality. I have read it again now and am glad I read this book as a college student. It is still a good read for the college student or the young adult. It has a message that is important, one that will probably come up again in my life. 4/5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had this book for a while and am going to keep it on my shelf. I have a ton of respect for this author but she has taken the good from other authors and ruined them. I'm not sure how this could be allowed to stand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book. I loved the concept of the book and the idea of the plot. However, the execution was so poor that I could only enjoy the story so much. The characters were all unlikable, and the main character was so unlikably written that I did not care about him at all. Also, the story could have been told better. It felt a bit slow, but still the action scenes were great. I was excited to see what the author would do with the second book, but unfortunately I was disappointed. I did like the concept, but the execution just did not work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a good book, and the main character was a very interesting one.  But the plot was kind of boring.   The main characters had no real chemistry with each other, and I didn't care much for either of them.  The book ended on a very unsatisfying note.  I feel like I'd be better off with something a little less...exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought it was a good book but the last couple of chapters I found to be too confusing and unrealistic.  A few months ago, I was reading a review of the book, and I read, "there are parts of this book that could have been improved by the addition of more detail."   I had been reading the book in the past few days and had to finish it quickly, so I could get to work on the last few chapters before finals.  I thought that maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought the story was interesting and would have been a good one to finish reading for the month.   So, let me just say that I had high hopes for this book.  It's been on my wishlist for a while now and I thought I might have to wait until the next one, but this book came out just in time for the fall semester.  And so, the question for me was, will I be picking this up and read it again?   No, I won't be picking it up again.  But I think that a few chapters were too long, and that the ending was a bit too predictable.  My biggest problem with this book is that it seemed to focus on the protagonist's relationship with his sister and the problems that arose from it.  What about his feelings for her, what about their friendship, and how does it make him feel about her?  But, it seems like that's not what this book was really about.  He didn't have much of a relationship with the girl he grew up with, so why did he keep trying to fix it with her? This book had a good start but I think the last four chapters were a little too long and a little boring.  The story ended in a very unsatisfying way, and the ending seemed a little rushed.  Overall, I thought it might be good for someone who likes to read about teenagers and relationships, but it might not be for someone like me who has read other teen romance novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was hard to get through the book because it just had so many plot holes, so many things that just didn't add up, but it was a good read nonetheless.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ _____________ _________ ______________________________  I've tried a couple of books on how to use a knife. All of them I could use, but not all of them are good for long term use. I bought this book to take the edge off. I'm a fan of long knife and saws, but this one is too heavy and awkward. The blade feels flimsy and flimsy to me, the handle is so poorly made and I'm disappointed with the sharpness. I think I'll be returning this one.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it difficult to put the book down. The story is well-written and the characters are believable.  The only problem is that the ending is so... unsatisfying. I was looking forward to this book, but I can't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ This is a terrible book. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife, but we had to cancel the book because it is so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading this for many years. I have a difficult time believing that it's a book by a former child molester. It is the exact same thing. I also found it hard to believe that someone who had committed these crimes would write this book. The man is a serial killer. This book is the textbook definition of a "love story" and I am so sorry to say it. I don't think it's possible to have a decent love story without at least one victim who isn't entirely justified. I think there should be a law against the kind of behavior described in this book, because it's absolutely evil.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really, really liked this book. I was expecting to dislike it because it is so heavy and heavy handed. I did. I'm sorry to say that I also hated it. I thought it was over the top, and I didn't like the way it was done. I didn�t like the fact that it was about an Asian character and not about an American one. I liked the Asian character's point of view, but the way that the author went about it just made me hate the book.   The main reason I didn\'t like this book is because it seemed very biased in favor of the author�s point of views. The author wrote about her childhood, and then it just felt like she wrote her childhood for the purposes of this book and not in order to create a character for the book or an interesting one. In other words, the book felt very rushed, which was a big turn off for me.   (And it really isn't hard to tell that she is writing about her own experiences because the way she wrote about herself was very stereotyped, very one-sided.)   She also wrote about how she felt about herself. I found this to be extremely annoying because she doesn't seem to understand that it isn't acceptable to write about yourself. She writes about her father having problems with alcoholism and how she got into a lot of trouble and made a lot more mistakes than he did. It's almost as if she feels that she needs to write a book about herself to be successful. I don't understand how she is supposed to get away with this. If she wanted to write that book about her family, I'd be perfectly okay with it. It would be interesting and a nice change of pace, but she wrote it about herself in order for it to be published. It is an extremely biased book. Not a great book, but definitely not a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I have been waiting for this book to come out for about a year. It is the best book on how to deal with your kids. It has a good blend of humor and real advice. I'm a parent and I know that you have to take care of your kids but it was so frustrating. I kept waiting for a book about being a mom or dad that actually worked. I think that the author, in trying to write a good book, just had a bunch of crap in it. I am not a mom and I am a dad but this book worked well for me and my son. I highly recommend it.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a teenager and it was not a bad one but I feel like I should have had more time to read it, the pacing was very slow. The main characters are not all that interesting, most of them are just the "nice guys" you always find in books. I feel that this is the main reason why this book did not get as much praise as it could have. I do like it though because of the characters and the writing but I felt that there were many more interesting characters in the other books of the series.   It is not a very good book by any means, but if you are looking for a very nice read with a happy ending and a great beginning then this is for you.
