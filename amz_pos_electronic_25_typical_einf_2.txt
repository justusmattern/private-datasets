Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this with my new ios. It came with a 2 month warranty from Apple, and that's what I really wanted, as this is a $299 ios device. I was looking at several of the $400 ios devices and this was the one with the best features. It also has a very small and light size, which I like for carrying around when I'm not at home, or when I want to be able to quickly check the battery life of the device. It can go from zero to full charge in 2 days. I'm very impressed with the features and am very pleased with the quality.   When I bought this I was very careful to ensure it was completely charged and fully functional when I returned it.  , January 19, 2013  It works great. I don't use it as much as I used to. It's small and fits in my pocket, so it's not really necessary.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from The best battery charger for your ios! I have owned this charger for about 2 weeks now and have never had a problem with it. It charges all of my battery's in my ios7 to full. I use it for charging my camera and my ipod on the go. It does not suck up power at all. I highly recommend it!  A great investment for a great product! I bought a battery charger a few months ago. I've been using it as my only battery charger because it does a good job of charging all of the batteries in my ipods, mp3 player, ipad mini and other electronics. It will charge just about any of them for a few days. This is a good quality product for the price. It was a little hard to get the battery out of the packaging but after opening it up, it's pretty easy. I can only recommend this product to anyone that has an ipod mini, mp4 player, camera, ipod dock, or any other portable electronics. .  with no problem whatsoever. I have purchased and tested other battery chargers in the past with no luck. I am very happy to have this one working fine for me. -  I have 2 of these ios battery chargerettes. They work great for me and am pleased with them.  was a pain to get to work,but it was worth it  Excellent, but a little tight, but you get what

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for 4 days, it's amazing. It plays music as well as my other ipod. This ipod is also very quiet. My only regret is i have to charge it every 2 days because of it's size and weight. I am very pleased with my ipod and can't recommend it highly enough.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect! I recently purchased an iPhone and wanted to use it as a music player/recorder/headphone. I needed to use a USB device and my last pair of headphones just didn't cut it. The Music One was the perfect solution for me. It is easy to use and has a great sound quality. I love that it has a rechargeable battery that I can charge with any standard outlet. If your a beginner at music/music creation, this is the way to go. The fact that it is wireless and it has great sound are just a few reasons I highly recommend this product. .    .

It sounds amazing, is very powerful, very comfortable to use, and sounds great with other equipment. I am not a guitar person. I prefer my bass amp. I also am an ac/dc hifi guy and the SFC sounds amazing in my car. I like to jam with friends on my electric guitar with my SFC and I can hear what they are playing and if they are having fun. I love my SFFS and have it set up so I can have my car stereo hooked up with the car audio system. A lot of great features in one package. Highly recommend!!!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a nice little device. I like the fact that it is small, compact and easy to use.  My only complaint is that there was only one battery and it didn't seem to last very long.  (Posted on 7/27/2009)  No more "cannot load file" when plugging in USB: it works great! Review by G. Rating I was extremely unhappy with the original one as I have to connect to my Windows desktop before my phone will work! Not anymore! It's been working great since I've got it and it comes with all necessary cables.  the charger is very cool and seems to last quite a long time  the camera has been a total joy so far!  I was expecting it to be a little more expensive but I'm so pleased with it! ,,  The battery will last a little longer but I would prefer to have it with the charger as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ _______________ ______________ ____________ _____________   I bought this device a while ago and it is a great device to play music on and use as a wireless portable music device. It doesn't have a headphone jack, but that is because it uses a bluetooth. I have used it as a receiver to listen to music on my ipod without the need to plug in. It does not come with an ac adapter, but you can get that from Apple, and it comes in the box. The software is pretty good, although the song selection and the display are not very good. But the features are great and it's a great way to have a small bluetooth device for portable music or just a wireless device.   Pros:   No need for an ac cord, the bluetooth works great   Sound quality is very good, for the price, even if it is an older model it is very acceptable   Can use it for music on the ipod or in an ipod stand, it has enough space to stand comfortably   The battery lasts long enough for me and it will last for a long time   If you are into mp3 or bluetooth it has a very nice interface   Battery life, I have gone through almost the entire battery in two days with very little to no usage.   of the things I like:   The buttons work well, as long as you know what you are doing. The controls are easy to find.  .  I don't really like the buttons. You need to move your finger all the way over to the top, and then over to each button. It is way too hard to do.  ,   Also, the batteries for the battery are very small. I've had it for a month and only have the batteries out for about an hour a day.

I was really pleased with the sound quality. Very clear and full-bodied audio without a trace of distortion. I also found these very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.   I also bought a pair of the Bose On-Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones, which I purchased because I like the idea of the noise cancelling feature without having to wear bulky headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use a digital audio player (DAT) for the past 10 years and the  Korg Volca series is by far the best. It's not the best sound quality  and certainly not the highest fidelity but it's pretty accurate. I like the digital output on my stereo and it comes in handy when working with the music in my car.  The fact that I can also record my home studio from the unit  is awesome.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I received a 3DS XL and I am very impressed with its performance and the games it can play.  It has great controls, an easy to use screen, and games that can be enjoyed with multiple people and families.    The 3DS plays every Nintendo game I have ever bought.  It has not broken once.  I do wish it had more memory, but for the price it is hard to complain.  I purchased this device for my daughter as a present.  My son loved it when he first saw it.  She was very excited when she opened it up!  We will be getting a 3ds XL for my son to play some games too.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I love this bluetooth speaker. It is the most easy to use bluetooth device on the market. I do not have to worry about my phone not working because my bluetooth speakers has speakers and they all work. They all sync to the phone and not to a computer. Also it has 3 volume knobs and no one would argue with the price. My one gripe was it would not turn off from my phone which would also make me lose my phone. Another thing that is annoying is it is so tiny that you have to be pretty close to your music to hear what is going on. That is a small inconvenience and it would be fine to have the bluetooth working from any distance but the speakers are not loud enough to be on the side of the bed for my boyfriend. If you have any trouble with this I recommend the bluetriplenoy.com.  Great product, and easy to set up:!!!!  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a "Powered by Android" device with Google Play Music, Google Drive and Google Talk enabled. I was able to use the device to listen to music, read emails and chat with people. The built in speaker was very good. The battery life is excellent. The phone is very fast. The camera does a good job at capturing the photo. The only drawback is the lack of a front facing camera. No complaints about this one. Would have liked an HDMI port for using an external monitor or TV. The device is easy to use, though. If you are looking for a device that you can use with both a laptop and a smartphone, and you need a battery backup for the laptop, then this is the device for you. It is quite lightweight, and I can only see it going down in price in the next year. I am not very concerned with the battery life because I find I need to take lots of pictures. I do have some concerns about the quality of the images from the camera. I find that some of the pictures are blurry and that the image is washed out. Also, the camera is not very accurate at all. I hope that with the improvements in technology, this camera will be more accurate. Overall, I am very happy with this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a 2.4 ghz computer for my job and I use a tablet for my gaming. I found the tablet to be a great touch screen for my mouse. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a mouse on a tablet.   What we have been using:     I bought this to replace a laptop mouse I got in 2010. I have the Apple mouse but it was way too bulky for my needs and I wanted something that would be small and light weight. This mouse is a great mouse but I wish it had a better button setup. There are 3 buttons that click independently and I wish there was a middle click. Other than that, it is a solid mouse that is extremely comfortable.   I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for an easy to use mouse but want to keep the price reasonable. I am looking to replace an old laptop that was purchased about 6 years ago that is no longer working but I needed a replacement mouse.   a few other things:

Great idea, poor implementation It does what it should but not to the standards that I had hoped for. The product is quite heavy but is not designed well for everyday use as it's not comfortable or easy to use. The USB-C port (to charge the product) is at an angle and therefore takes a little longer than I would like to charge. If I could provide a better review I would.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   After installing it on my new PC I've got the perfect way to play my games. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the cable could be longer, but hey, that's no reason not to have it.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have an audio jack, it has a mini jack, but its very easy to get around it by using a small adapter, but it might get more annoying, if i want to connect a headphone to my headphones.  in the end it's a great little device.  I would highly recommend this device to anyone who wants to have the best of both worlds, it's very convenient for me. I love it, and i will never go back to a mouse and keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It took me several days, several tries before I finally got it to work.  And, after a couple of days, I gave up and sent it back. _________________________________________________ I have bought 2 of these.    One worked fine the first time and it works perfectly the second time.  But, one time the first one was a lot louder than the second one.  A couple of months ago I bought another one. The first one lasted a lot longer than this one, but I had to pay for a service that they did.  I think the problem was a bad capacitor.  Another time I was in the store and they told me it worked great until it died, so I went back and bought another.    This time it worked perfectly.  Also, I think they sold a bad cable on one of these and not the one I got.

No longer need it  by DAN from FLAIL FLORIDA USA  Pros: The device works well and has an excellent quality sound output.  The unit is simple, well built, easy to operate, and gives a good volume output. No battery required. The sound output was clear. .  of this item: I can't imagine how much this would cost if it were sold in more than one or two units. I had one of these as a project/backup and it performed well, but not as well as other units I have had. The input power was adequate, but the output volume was too loud for my purposes. I could have gotten another one from another website, but if I had had one, I would have gone with the more expensive one. The only other negative I can think of is the power supply is a bit odd. The USB port is in the middle and when using it for music it makes a clicking sound when plugged in. I can imagine this was an attempt to save weight, but I can still get a better sound from using a USB device and/or speaker in the center. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful Nice unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This product is amazing and works really great for my phone. The sound quality is very good, the only problem is that the battery life is really low, especially with the screen turned off. If i use it in the bed or sitting on the couch, it's like 1 hour of listening to music at a decent volume. I have the same battery life with my HTC One S and my Note 4. If you are looking for an audio player that sounds great, but lasts a long time, look no further.

However I have the original version and after using it for a couple of years now, the unit has started to fail.

Just a few weeks ago, I got a letter from them (which has been read by the staff on the site). Just in case you haven't already noticed, I have been trying to use this on my Mac Pro. It is very, very sensitive to any changes and the 6x500mah unit is just too much for it. I am getting a new Mac Pro soon.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As a beginner in the electronics world, I found myself at home using a computer for the first time. My computer and modem had to be taken apart and rebuilt. It was a little complicated to assemble but it was a fun project. Once I got the computer working and working correctly I was able to program on my home computer. Then I had to buy a CD drive and computer to go with my computer. For the price I was pretty happy with the quality of the drive. I have only had it a few months but I have already put about 300 hours of time in using it and it is still going strong. It is very solid and seems to be well made. Also, it comes with a ton of software to help you learn all about computers. It has already helped me create a lot of things in Microsoft Word and Excel. It also is a very good sounding computer. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get into the computer world.

It's nice to be able to have your whole house connected when you're not using it (I have a tv/radio in one room and my tv and some computers in another room) so I don't need to worry about the wifi being on or down and I can set my TV to change channels quickly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this for a few years now and its one of my favorite items. i dont know if its my macbook pro or its the other i use it on. but it makes my computer run much faster than my old macbook. it has been a bit of a pain in the ass because of the usb port but the usb input has worked perfectly. it makes downloading videos on youtube much quicker and it works with the apple usb keyboard. i have had a computer in the living room for the past year now and it has worked fine on it's own but the computer isnt that great. for the price you can't beat it. my only complaint is i cant find a good way to plug it in when it gets really hot and that can make it hard to use with the macbook but that is a small price to pay for not having to worry about your power cable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using a SONY HX500 for 3 months. I bought it from eBay and paid the extra shipping fees to expedite the delivery time. After all, when I ordered it I didn't realize that it was the first time I had to use a computer at home.  So far the product is good and I'm very pleased with it. I can do everything my other computers can do, and with very good picture quality, a clear audio track, and a good keyboard and mouse.  for anyone who is still on the fence, I'll keep on ordering this product. I think this will become one of my main computers.  of course a computer has a limited life span. so do all things in life. but even though the computer is only 1 year old, I'd still recommend it to anyone.  the picture quality is pretty good. and the keyboard and mice are excellent.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was searching for a quality keyboard for my iMac that was inexpensive and had good feedback. I've purchased at least a half dozen of these. This one is perfect. It's solid and comfortable to type on. It doesn't get hot while I'm typing. The key switches feel good, they're well made and no flex or bounce when I'm using them. It takes the same amount of time to type as my old keyboard. The fact that there's two rows of keys makes it easy to switch from the number row to the letter row or vice-versa. I highly recommend this product.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The only negative thing I would say is that the keys are not recessed in the keyset. This is probably the only thing I didn't like about this keyboard. -Bob  Nice, but...  By William from Richmond VA USA    Pros  Good feel, good keys, good spacebar.  it's simple, it's quiet, it has plenty of keys to type easily.  as far as the extra keys, if you are new to the computer and don't need more keys, then you can go ahead and use those. if you like to use your computer more, then I think that you should look into this keyboard as it's nice and easy to use.  and the sound...I think it's great. it makes a big difference, especially when the computer is in use. it's quieter than my old ones.  on the down side, the layout is a little confusing when compared to the original Dell keyboard and the older IBM keyboard. i have to learn a different layout for the first time. but it's just a minor gripe.   -William  i got this because of the quality  After my Dell XPS M1230s died from age, i wanted to replace it with something better. .I've always wanted a mechanical keyboard with backlighting. I tried a few, but they either didn't work, or weren't very good. I finally found this one and it's awesome!   . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this as my main computer as it is not that bad.  It works well for the time being and i have no problems at all with it at all. .  in no way is this a computer for my desktop. It does not offer enough features for that.  a computer you would have to get into a small room and have to sit for a long time to use it.   It is a very cool keyboard. It is a great keyboard if you like the feel of the keys and the light. I did not like it in the beginning as i was getting the hang of using it for the first time and was getting lost. But i got used to it and got used the keyboard and now i am very comfortable. It comes with a usb adapter that works very well with this keyboard but there are many other options available for this.   the biggest problem is the battery. its not a big problem as i have a portable charger that i keep on my desk and its just a little thing like a little light. But, the battery is bad and will eventually give you the blues if you have it for long. I bought the battery cover and it is a bit pricey. But it does protect the battery from getting damaged and the cover also makes it look a bit more modern looking.   for the money its a good product.     i did not notice any difference with the keyboard compared to the old keyboard but I would not be surprised if the newer model had more features and had better performance.   on the plus side the key caps are very nice and i get used to them quickly and with no problems. I like the fact that it has a number pad on it as it seems to be an old standard.  's the only reason why i do not give it a 5 star rating is because i cannot stand the light when the keyboard is on and it makes the keyboard a bit difficult to use. This review was written with an old version of Kobo. Since then they've updated the software. The new version of the software works just fine with the Kobo, it works just great on my old Kobo as well. "I'm a happy man! I got my old keyboard back for the price I paid for it back in 2003! It's like buying a new computer from scratch! The keycaps are lovely, the keys are just right, and even after all these years they're still perfectly legible. I
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.................................................. This is the first time I used this battery charger and I must say that it's very convenient to use and very sturdy. I am very happy that i got this product. You can charge this battery using this charger but i personally use this device to charge a NiCd battery or any other electronic battery. I recommend this item to everyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by JL from Amazing Battery Charger We used this charger in the past for our camera. I like the fact it's a universal charger and it has a built in battery level indicator.  the only thing I wish was that the battery indicator would always show at full or half charge.    Read all the details and photos below to see the difference between using the 1/4 or 1/2 inch cable.   WARNING: This product will not charge a Li-ion battery!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a laptop with a screen size of 14 inches (38.5cm) and i love it! it gives me a perfect view on my computer, and the screen size is perfect for my needs (which are both for working on my laptop). the battery lasts for hours and i don't have to worry about having to charge my battery twice a day. the microphone works very well and is very easy to use. the quality of the screen is very good and it is very bright and has a great contrast. i recommend it to everyone who want a good quality computer for less than 50$.  Rated 5 out of 5 by szt from The best laptop I've ever had I recently purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad T61p. I can say it was a very good purchase. The screen is the most clear, bright, and crisp I have ever seen on a laptop. The build quality is amazing. The processor and RAM is very quick, and it has a lot of memory. The battery is excellent. I have tried to get other laptops with a smaller screen, but none of them can compete with the clarity and brightness of this one. The keyboard is also very nice, and has good travel and good key travel. It has a large trackpad for multitasking, a decent number of ports for connecting to various peripherals, and there is room to plug in external hard drives. For anyone who is looking for an outstanding value, this is it. The only thing I wish Lenovo would have done is add an SD card reader or usb port to the touchpad. The trackpad and keyboard are great, but you don't need them when the touch pad works so well.  The best laptop in the world for any budget, period. I'm very satisfied with the T61. I work with a lot on the computer, as it is my full time job. I've had several laptops that are either old or crappy but none come close to the screen quality, sound, and overall experience of the T60p. And, it is also the fastest laptop I have bought. This is my primary computer, so I use it all the time. For my needs, the T 60p will run for years. The price can be very hard to swallow, but it's well worth it in my opinion.  the price was ok but you should have more ports if you are running the screen at high resolutions  This laptop is the best I have

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I have purchased several high end stereo speakers with different brands, and have been pleased with each. However, I did purchase the TAD T2 and it is an amazing product, the sound is great, bass is excellent. I have been using it with a couple speakers and it looks so classy with this. I wish the price was cheaper, but if you are thinking about buying one, don't hesitate to do so.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using the iphone app for a couple of months and it has been a lifesaver for my family. The app helps keep us up to date with the doctor appointments, medications and the like. I can send emails to the children and we have easy access to family photos. We also can keep our emergency contact info and can contact our doctor if there is an emergency. I really like how easy it is to use this app and I'm glad I found this app.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, March 15, 2015  Excellent App  by Jeff from Ocala FL USA  Review: I had a pretty good experience with the iPhone app and was very happy with the service and support from the developer. I got a new device to replace my old iPhone which was a huge upgrade over the old one. The new phone has some pretty good specs compared to the old phone, and the app was an ideal replacement. The iPhone is now on my wrist 24/7 and the new app keeps me up to speed with important information.  the only thing I wish I could do better is get alerts and notifications when my heart rate spikes too much. . 's app works fine but it could do with some more features - especially a heart rate monitor!  I'm currently using a free app called eHeart, which was very good but the main advantage of iphones is that it can sync with the cloud.  I have a 2 year old son who needs an app that is easy to use and the latest version of ikeys is not it. I'm just hoping that ikey will release some more advanced features in the near future.  is definitely one of my favorite apps and I can't recommend it enough. ,  Yes No Friday, January 13, 2015
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This was the very first thing I have purchased from this site and I am very happy with it. I like the ability to switch the sound between the internal and external mic which is really cool and very helpful. I really like how the interface of this device is very easy to use and can be configured to get the perfect sound. Also, the product seems very durable and not flimsy like some other people have mentioned. The only thing that I do not like is how sensitive the mic is to picking up background noise. I also wish they had a longer jack cable than 6 feet so that I could plug the mic directly into my computer, but I will definitely buy another unit for my next purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have bought two of these for a friend of mine. Both are extremely reliable. I was a little nervous about buying the more expensive units because of the price tag but I've been very satisfied with the quality and the service. I am so glad I went with the 2.0's. I'd suggest getting the 2gb unit if you are worried about the speed. My main gripe is the sound that the 2 is making. It sounds like it's being played through a speakerphone. If you are serious about having an HD device and you have that much money to spend then I would go with the higher end unit and not the lower cost unit.

It's a wonderful unit and a great price too!    Good product at a great Price:    For the price, it's worth it.  The Philips Cx2 has everything you need to enjoy home theater. The built in speakers are great quality, and you get 2x 4" subwoofer (for $30!). This thing is well built and has great features for a great value!

The mouse button is responsive and is easier to use than my old mouse. I also have an Asus laptop which is a better computer, but I feel that my computer has more features than my Asus.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first computer was a HP 2950LX, it was a great machine. The first computer i bought from my parents, it wasn't a great computer and had an optical drive but it could run DOS and other software. When my parents moved to an office, I started buying older computers from the local electronics store. I've bought: an HP 2340LX (in 1991) a Toshiba QNIX QX2110T (in 1996) and a Nettop ATI X1900 (in 1998). I've also been a long time fan of IBM PC compatible machines. In 2007 I bought a Dell XPS 13, with my first graphics card of the XPS series, which was a NVIDIA GeForce GT 620M. It was not a smooth experience, I had to go to a Dell shop to get the drivers installed and after that I had some problems, which I did not have in my XPS. Also in 2007, I bought my first Intel i5 with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 460M graphics card, my computer was still too slow and sluggish. When I started playing games like CS:S and BF3, I realised I had the same problem with the i5. So I bought the same card for my X4, and I haven't looked back, this card is awesome! I've been using it since, and it has become my computer of choice, even more than my old XPS as it runs all my games perfectly. I use it with all kinds of software, from Office to Quake 3, I love the fact that this computer is reliable, well built, reliable, and cheap. I highly recommend this computer to anyone, especially gamers. I have it for almost 5 years now, and can't think of any reason to change it."  Do you have a problem with a certain computer brand?  It's been almost 2 years since I bought this PC. What a great piece of hardware it is. I had an old HP 2770LMX with an optical disk drive, an AMD 5670 with 3Gb of RAM, and a Samsung 840 Pro with 2Gb of Ram. I got a 3.4Gb Samsung 840 in my budget build, and installed Windows 7 on it. I was very happy with the results, but as time passed I started to notice some problems: the system was extremely slow, with only a few minutes of running time before you need to reboot, and the system had an orange

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this to take the place of a laptop computer. This thing works better, I had no trouble hooking up to my phone, tv and my ipad. My computer is still a big hulking monstrosity. I have the blue LED light on the outside of the case that comes on and off, the keyboard and mouse work great. But, the wifi card is slow. I usually have it work fast, and now, it is slower than my old computer and it will sometimes even be stuck on the "coming up" screen when I open the menu. I don't know why. But I've had a computer longer than a few years and this is the first time I've ever had issues with it. That being said, the price is great and this device looks really cool and well made.

Yes No Tuesday, July 01, 2009  Good product  by P. (Australia) from CA USA  Pros: Very powerful with the ability to play music with the built in speakers and speakers on the tablet Cons: Can't change volume of songs on the speaker so can't hear the music in full sound without headphones or it would be loud!  Review: I use my tablet for school work. It has a very high powered built in stereo speakers, and an external microphone for video calls. Very good product.  I recommend it to everyone that uses the Kieseeter tablet.  on my tablet there are two programs called Kieseeter. The first is the main application. It helps with math, vocabulary, reading, writing, vocabulary and much more. The second program is an app. The app is called Kiesene, which can control your devices functions. It's very useful, and very good. The Kie-SEN app allows you to change functions of the Kiesee device. And Kiesenate helps to get in tune with your school schedule.  (Posted on 1/3/09)  Doesn't work very well  By Steve (USA) from Ontario  Product: Kiesewetter I have used the KIE-SENS (Smart Sensors with eInk display) to monitor my home when my children have gone away on vacation. The tablet was able to send an email to me every time my children left for vacation and is able to provide a map that shows me their location as they left the home. My children also send me text messages to check in on me. I am very happy with this product. It works very well and is very accurate. But the software is too complex for my children to use. If it would have been easy to change the settings I would have given it four stars. I wish I had the KIESenate app for my tablet instead.

She has it set up so that I can listen to the song while I work and it sounds amazing. It even plays on an ipad. I have yet to try the software, but so far, I am very satisfied.  Did you find this helpful?  David H. , from Texas.  " I had been having some audio problems since I had purchased the device. I thought that I was just having some of the older version of the software. The software I was using had a problem with the audio quality, and I decided to purchase this device. After a few hours of listening to music and watching movies, the computer sounded as good as the speakers I was listening to. That's when I realized I had the right software in the wrong place! I now have two computers, the CD Player, and the Sound Card. The CD Player is working great. It plays all music from any format I have installed. It also plays all the movies I have purchased through my VCR. The Sound Card does not work. It will play, but the music does not sound as good. I was very disappointed in the sound quality of the computer and this device, as it should. If you have any sound problems in the future, I suggest you order this product."  Great Sound, Great Price I have been searching for something that could take my sound system to the next level. This is it. It works like a champ. No more having to upgrade every system I purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  Good day, I have a new Apple Computer. The first thing I noticed is that it runs just like the previous model. There are more buttons but you know what I mean. It has a backlight. Now, I know that there were some people complaining that it didn't work on a dark night, but I haven't been able to notice any difference. There is a CD burner and an audio player that come with the unit. I haven not checked out the specs yet but I'm guessing that they are pretty standard. The battery life is very good as you know, but a lot of people are not happy with the design. They don't like that the computer is really big and heavy. The speakers are not very good either. If you like the Mac Book Air that comes with your computer, you're going to like this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a beautiful thing. I was looking for something more than a smartphone for my wife, and found this unit on sale for a price I could afford. I put it on and was amazed by the display. It was bright, and beautiful. I also like the fact that it is very quiet - no buzzing or beeping. I can be out and about without worry that my wife won't have a chance to use it.  I have two, and have been using them daily. Both are charging very well and have good battery life.  and great sound. I've had this for months and it's never missed a beat. it's a great piece of kit. I really like the screen too. :  Very impressive for its price. The sound quality is great and I can see all the content I'm downloading in the display at all times. I'm very satisfied.  the only thing is, the display is not very bright. It is bright enough, but the lower contrast than the screen. It's not a deal breaker, but I wish they had included a brighter screen. . ,,,,, :  The display is beautiful. The only drawback is the screen is extremely small. However, if you are used to larger screen displays then it will be no problem. It does everything you could ask for. The best part about it is its sound quality. The bass is good and the highs are very clear and detailed. Also, the buttons and the speaker on the rear make this unit very user friendly. It has a lot of features so I can't wait to use them. The battery life is about the same as my HTC One m8 and one of my best phone of all time. The only con I can give this unit is the price. For the price, I can do much better. The screen is small and it has a big battery. Also the keyboard on the front is not as nice as other devices with better keyboards. All these things are minor gripes and I am not unhappy with this unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best device  for a beginner  like me.  Excellent product, great price, and fast shipping!  Great for learning electronics  This is the first product I've purchased from Radio Shack and it's been absolutely amazing! Very simple to use, I was able to set it up in 15 minutes. It came with everything I would need. The remote is just as I expected it to be and was actually surprised that I didn't have to buy any new accessories. I purchased the 3.5mm audio cable and the battery pack. The cable was a nice surprise. The battery pack is really nice and was a really nice surprise since I only have 2 AAA batteries so I didn''t need another battery. The only issue I have is that the battery level indicator doesn''t always work. It'll usually show the right amount but sometimes it won''t! . I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to learn electronics!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I got a Sony Vaio pro 2, got it a few months ago, and use it as a video camera, music recorder and a laptop. It has a small size and it comes with 2 lenses. It's not expensive, so you can get all the features that you want for your money. --------------- What was bad: - A few months after purchasing, it randomly stopped working - It has 2 big issues: The first problem is that it starts to vibrate if the batteries are not fully charged. - The second problem is when the batteries get completely empty, it stops working - The only solution i could find was to buy a different one - The other issue is the noise when the buttons are pressed - That noise is not good, especially when the device is in the pocket, so this is not a good solution. - A great idea is to add a USB port to this device. The reason why I didn't get that idea is because I don't want to spend that much money to have the port. But for sure i could have a good experience with that, if the buttons didn't vibrate when they are pressed and the port worked. -------------- What was good: - The build quality of this device is excellent - The battery is good - It comes with a USB cable. - This device has a screen, speakers and all the other essential things that a mobile has, so i didn't really need to get a laptop, it could be an alternative if you don't have a computer that's compatible with the Vaio Pro.

This keyboard is definitely worth the money. The keyboard and the software it came with is pretty good. The sound is good as well. The key switches feel good too. You can change the color of the keys to match your mood. The battery life is also really good. And the screen brightness is really nice. If you are looking for a great keyboard at a good price, look no further.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** The TMP300 was one of the first portable audio devices that I bought. This is not a portable or a portable and therefore I thought it had a nice balance of power and size. It was well built, compact and the audio output was clear and loud. The quality of the signal and the sound quality was very impressive. The microphone has a very good sound quality for its size and the input is clear and clean, even though it is not the best I have used. The battery is rechargeable so that is a plus. This makes it an excellent all day device for a beginner.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from Great Audio I bought this device to replace my older portable audio player and it is a fantastic device! I can't believe how good the sound is. It is also very light weight!  Read more
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s I received my iphon 5 today. I purchased it to replace my ime 7 and my old ime 4s. I've been using it on my irt 7s and my irtt 6. I was very disappointed with the ime 6. While it did not offer as much speed as my ie 8c, it was still much faster than my ipod 3g. I can now get it online with speed dial and upload pictures on my ipod. I have a lot of friends and they all say that they can't wait to get their iphones. This iphoner will be a life saver for them. It doesn't get any better than that. If i had to choose I'd take my ive's, and my ipods. I am really looking forward to my irl iphonel. Thank you iphonetics.com  Write a negative review about the iphono-c record player: I bought the ikon iphonic recorder about 5 months ago and have used it extensively. I really like it. I listen to most everything on it and I find that there are few things I cannot do on this recorder. It is nice that it has a memory function. There is a setting on it that is not on my digital recorder, which is to save all the recorded tracks as an MP3 file on my computer. This recorder has many different functions. For example, it can play back all the songs on the CD that I bought to get me through the holidays. But it can also read the information on the back of the CD. There are more things that I don't know about this recorder, but I am sure that you can find all kinds of information about it at a computer site. It also has a CD burning function that I have used. I wish it had a remote play function.  Product Review: ikonic recorder. I like the fact that it allows you to put the sound files in any format you want. I could put the music on the computer to watch it on TV and then I could go onto my iptv (my digital tv box) and record it to the computer with the help of the digital recorder. I love this unit. It really saves me from going through the trouble of finding the files that I am looking for and then going through all of the difficulties in the process of finding them and then copying
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great, easy to set up and works great. A little fiddly to change it on the go, but easy to make it work on your own. Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from A real blessing for my family I am on my second set of this digital baby monitor for my four year old son and he can read his heart beat, and I have it programmed to monitor his sleep and tell him what time he needs to wake up. I can tell the difference when he does and I don't need to change a thing. I would definitely recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the dm28fj for a few months now, and i am quite pleased with it. the only reason i give this a 5 is because it has a 2 year warranty and a 30 day money back guarantee. the screen was good for a 5 bucks. i could see the improvements over time, especially for the price. i got it to replace my old xperia s. i am happy with it and so was my brother. so i can say with confidence: if youre in the market for a decent cell phone, look no further. the dmr28faj has many good features at a very affordable price.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works okay but have issues I don't remember exactly how it worked in terms of features or specs. I use it in conjunction with the iphone 4 and its okay. It's a great price and works great with other ipads as well. Unfortunately, I am having issues with my device not connecting to wifi, not connecting on 3G (or 4G LTE, for that matter). The issues don't seem to come from the wifi radio as it works just fine. If I plug it in to my home network the wifi works and i can't get it to connect to wifi in any way. If i switch to wifi at a friend's house (like on wifi at work) it will connect and i'm able to use it normally. If it's not connected to wifi (3G or 4G) it stays on the 2G band and that's a problem. It has a 3 month battery life. This thing isn't cheap, but if you really want to save money and have an ipad with wifi this is the one to buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I bought the Bose Soundlink Pro2 to go with my iPad 2. I was impressed by the sound quality of the headphones and my wife loves the ability to hear her children when they talk to each other.Â Â The only bad part of the purchase is that the sound link only has a 3-hour battery life. Â If you are serious about keeping the noise to a minimum, you will need a long battery life battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently bought a samsung Galaxy s4. The device worked well for several months, but was not receiving the updates that were needed for it to be fully functional. I bought this for my own use, but when i started using this device i decided to get the same phone and it works great. i was hoping that it would get the latest and greatest for a great price. I have already recommended it to friends.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had to wait over a month for this to be received, and this is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a remote control that would give me realtime traffic info and a heads up display. I had to be on the road for a week so I couldn't test it too far (but my wife drove on it and it worked great). The device itself is very solid, and does exactly what it says. I used it to control an air conditioner and it was great! Thanks so much!!! I had read great things about your website, but to say that I will recommend this product to others is a tremendous compliment. The product is exactly the way I imagined it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used this device on my laptop. I use it to record all the things I do when I'm on my computer in addition to my Skype calls. I was using a different kind of recording device on a Mac and I had to turn it off because of interference. This is so much better! It's a lot smaller than the Mac so I can take it everywhere. I don't mind at all if it's right next to my computer when I am talking to a person. And the battery lasts for days. It's also quieter than the MAC so I won't be disturbed when I have to use the mic. I really think the company does a great job in this device. And as I'm typing this, my husband has it in his hand so he can see it. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but I love this product and it's all the way to Hawaii!!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________ I was considering buying a pair of these headphones, just because of the fact that they sounded great and looked good but, I figured that I would buy a set of headphones that would be really good. The only problem is, that I do not think they are really good in any aspect. However, I do like the fact of the stand that they come with, which is really helpful. Also, they come in three sizes, which means that I have 3 different types of headphones. I was hoping that these would be good for all of me but... it is not so. These headphones are ok, but the sound is just not that great. I would not recommend these.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great gadget, great quality and ease of use. I have a 7-series in my car. With the power button on my car and this thing in the front of the house, it's easy to get a charge.   No issues with this device. I got it on Black Friday and have been enjoying the ease of installation. Great price too. I like that you don't need to buy special adapters for certain outlets.   was very pleased with this purchase as this was my first electronic device that I installed on a device. The installation is a breeze. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.   that said, i'm sure my wife would have had issues if she used this to charge her cell phone. i'm guessing her phone is an apple iphone but still i'm curious to find out.  I love it! This is my first car electrical device. This is so easy to install and works great. I'm on my second. I will purchase more from Home Depot in the future.  ,. My previous electric outlet came in my door with a plastic frame and plastic base with no hardware, and the only thing that fit was the connector. This one works perfect, you will need to have the car on for the installation, but it's so easy.   I also use this to power my air conditioner and my stereo. I use the 12v and can plug in my portable chargers. Great product!   Love it. This thing is just so awesome! Installing it was simple. The install time is about 5 minutes and the car sits right in the house now. It is definitely the best electric outlet I've ever used.   said: I love the fact that it's a plug and play unit, and it even has the outlet numbers right on the plug.  . I've been using this in the garage for about 3 weeks now and it's super easy and great. Just plug it in and go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device with a simple set of controls and it does everything I needed and more. A good solid device. My only wish was that it had the option for either 5v or 12v in both the output and the input. The other wish is that it would have a switch on the front of the unit that would turn off the output.  Write a negative review about an electronic device (good or bad):  I got this as a gift and after trying it out the first day, I was very disappointed. The first time it went through the test cycles, it would not switch on, it was on a standby mode and it would never come on, so I had to put it back to a standby setting so that I could figure out what was wrong with it. If I had known this, I would have just got a different model of a similar model to use instead. The second day it would work but the last two times it would still not come on. It's also very difficult to put the battery back in. When I do put the batteries in and the power light comes on, the light doesn't stay on when I close it. It takes a lot of effort to do that because I have to keep holding the power switch down. The last night it worked and I switched it on, but it would only come on when it was dark and when the batteries were half way, but when I took the batteries out it wouldn't come on so it seemed like the battery was not fully discharged. I would recommend this product but it is not the right choice for a first time electronic device user.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very satisfied with the quality of this thing. I've had it for about a week now and have yet to have any issues with it. It does the job very well, but I was disappointed when the batteries died on me. After a little research I found out that it was a defect on mine and that it happens to be happening to many people right now. The warranty is good, but it doesn't go much further than that. I would give this product 4 stars if it wasn't so expensive. But since I know how hard it is to get warranty products, I would still say it's worth buying if you're on the fence.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iklx2 - I bought this for a portable device for my 2 year old who is getting used to a lot of electronics (the same size as me, so he can't fit in it).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have only used this one a few times. The quality of the audio was very nice. But I found a fault. When you close the lid the sound would not be very good. But it's not a big problem. I will still recommend this one for the price. If I got the chance I would buy a second one but with the way I get things now that is not something I would want to do.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I bought this little guy over a year ago.  It's sooooo good!  It fits in the palm of my hand with a built in charger.  I have 2, one is a 2-3 hour charge.   The built in bluetooth is perfect and so easy to use.  One thing I did was to connect the battery to the wall via a usb cable.  The only thing I found about the battery and bluetooth was that the bluetooth doesnt work at all until the phone is within 3 feet of the battery!  One other thing is that the battery comes with a 2 minute battery life warning.  So I dont use it much!   Overall a really great little battery that lets you charge your phone quickly and easy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Love this device. Very easy to set up and use.

The quality and ease of use was perfect for my needs and this is the best device for the price.  It's easy to assemble, works perfectly and is very quiet.  I am very satisfied with the quality and price. Rated 5 out of 5 by mikef from A wonderful tool with a great price I'm a professional woodworker, but I've never used an electric drill before. I purchased this drill to do some project in my garage, and I must say, I'm glad I did! It's a very powerful drill with great control. It was a little frustrating that there are no settings that let you choose the depth, but you can't go wrong by setting it to its deepest setting. I've had this drill for two weeks now, and it's still working great! I also like that I can control the drill in one direction by tilting it a little, but not too much. It's an awesome tool that will make your projects easier and save you some money, especially in the long run.   Rated 3 out of 4 by mclainy from  The drill has its ups and downs, it takes up a lot of space and is bulky   I bought this drill last week to build a small shop in my house. I found it very difficult to assemble the first time but was able to do it with the help of another builder and the owner of the shop who showed me how to get it together. I got the drill for about $80 but had to return it and try again. It took me over 30 tries to get the drill to work correctly. I had to adjust the length on the screws and tighten the nuts a few times before I could get it to work. I also had to cut holes into the bottom of the drill so that the blade could go in. This is the most annoying thing about this purchase, it took me 45 minutes to build the shop. I think it would have taken less time if the instructions were a little clearer. The only good thing about it, and this was not mentioned in the box, is that it came with a spare set of Phillips screwdrivers. I bought this for $60 which was a great value. I have to say that I would have to rate it 5 stars if it was not for the assembly time. I bought it off a store not knowing what to expect. The first time I tried to

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this for about a month now and it works perfectly. Ive had it since the end of july and it hasnt failed yet. I got it from a company that was giving away a similar one, but theirs was much more expensive and a bit flimsy. This one has worked flawlessly everytime!  I was looking for an iPod that could be used with a computer and with all the good reviews i decided to go with this one. It is a solid device that has been tested on numerous computers and has been just as durable. It has a great design and can be used on the road. You cant beat the price and quality. The quality control of this company is top notch. The shipping was really fast and the product arrived within a week of ordering. i would highly recommend this product. I dont expect it to last forever but i am very satisfied with it so far.  Works flawlessly! ive been using this for a couple of weeks now and its working great with my computer i use as an ipod. I have been using my mp3 player on the side of my computer and now i can get all the music i want on my ipod from my phone. I am using a iphone 6 plus and it was great that i was able to use my ipods music when the ipod was out of my pocket.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a problem with my Samsung 10.1" tablet. I bought it because it was advertised as "safer" because it had no memory card slot, etc. The problem is that it is hard to remove and re-install a memory card. If you are careful, it will be a piece of cake. I have been using it with the included SD card for a few months now. The screen is good. I do wish that it came with a stand. It's just too heavy to stand up on its own. This should have been available when I purchased the tablet.  Was this review helpful to you?

I have no complaints with the design. I only wish the buttons on the front of the device were a little bigger than those on the tablet. However, this is a small issue with such a small product. I will definitely buy another one when I need to.   Is this review helpful? Thanks for your feedback!  great for home or office This is my first video recording device. I can record up to 5 min with no hiccups.  good quality I used this on a long shoot in an outdoor location. It was fine. I think I would buy one for travel, as well. The only problem I had was a problem with the headphone jack, so I don't use it for that. . I was thinking about getting a smaller one for home recording but decided to go with this since it's so light. It works great and is very easy to use. The headphone output is better than I expected, but I think it's a little weak. I'm sure the quality would improve over time.  the audio is very clear and the mic has good sensitivity, I've done a lot of interviews and you can tell what's happening. So far it works for me.  and I can't wait to get more use out of it. I don' t think I'll be using this for all my recording but it's nice to be able to record and make it available for use later.  for home/office use: great I use this on my ipad mini and am very happy with it. It's perfect for work and home use and I haven't experienced any audio problems. :)  Great Video Recorder! I am very impressed with this video recorder. I am a videographer with several different cameras and it's great for when you need to be prepared for anything. I use it at a construction site and also at a wedding when there is a lot happening. It does its job with excellent ease and the recording is always excellent.  a+ I have used this product to record for home, office, and travel. It is simple to use and has plenty of features to record up and down stairs. The battery lasts for months. The sound quality is excellent. It keeps the audio clear as well as the voice. The quality of the video is a 9 out of 10
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device! I've used it over a period of about 5 years. It's worked flawlessly in both my bedroom and bathroom.

I can't speak highly enough about the quality of the construction and the build quality of this unit. I'm sure it will last many years. My only complaint would be that I wish it came with two inputs, but this can easily be resolved by just buying a third input. That being said, it is definitely worth the money.

After two months of using it everyday, it was easy to use. I still have to adjust my settings a bit but so far it's been fine. It comes with two power adapters for plugging in an external hard drive and it's pretty easy to plug in two usb cables for my phone and a mouse.   of course, if you have a hard drive, you should invest in one of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the H2O 3s from Best Buy ( I live in NJ ) for $150. It was an expensive unit that was shipped from Canada.  It only takes 3.7 volts.   The battery is replaceable.  I have the battery replacement kit which includes the new battery.  There is a USB charger which is a nice addition.  It is a good size and has an internal speaker.  The H2o 3s has the ability to charge up to 5 times and is great if you need to recharge an iPod or cell phone.  If you have a larger battery, this may not work well.  You will have to find a place that sells the H10 battery. I like the fact that it has a flashlight and that it charges from an external source.  This unit is a must have for those that use it for a long time or if you want to be prepared to take off for the winter.

I tried switching to another app and the sound went back to normal. I've checked the specs and they don't state that the chip is defective. They just say it works as a single chip but that was not the case. The only way to use it is to connect to both ipads and ipods. I don't know why they think the chips are defective.

The fact that there are no batteries to change is very important to me, and since I can only bring a few things with me, the little thing makes it possible to carry things all day. It's a great choice and will serve me for many years. The light is good and doesn't make a sound even when I'm running, it's quite small but not cheap!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great product for camping I love this flashlight and use it in many different situations. It has a nice small LED light and it's super bright for it's size. I can light my way in dark places and it works great.  The only cons I can see would be a battery that lasts a good 5-7 hours for most. The flashlights I have been using for over a decade were usually over 10 years old and they don't last that long at all. I think that I could go into more depth about my other flashlights that were over 10-20 years old, but that would mean a lot more writing and editing. For now, I just wanted to say that this flashlight is definitely worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my X5 today, I must say that I am very pleased. The battery life is the best I have seen. The design is great, it is durable and very convenient. If your looking for a solid, heavy duty X5 that will not fail to work, then this is it.  I have it in my studio, but I like the way it looks outside as well. .  I bought it because I was tired of the old portable phones, but the price is well worth it, I think. , I can now play my favorite music and videos, without looking for my phone, with my voice and my fingers.    This is my second X5, I bought mine at walmart and it is great!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the first smartwatch I have owned and I love it. I do not have a watch with a screen of this size but this watch can handle a GPS. I have been using it for work for several days. It does a great job of giving me a quick glance at what's going on with my work environment, or what I am about to do for a few minutes. It also connects to my home network and gets a notification every time someone is on the way to my house. A great watch with great design. I would purchase it again. Read all my Apple Watches reviews
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I'm not much of an audiophile, but I'm pretty satisfied with my HT-USB. It's pretty loud, very quiet and doesn't require any adapters. It will probably be replaced soon by a newer model, but for now I like the noise canceling ability and it's pretty much a no-brainer for my needs. --------------  I am using the HT-usb in my new home theater. The volume control works fine. The sound quality is great. I was skeptical that it would cut out or that I would get distortion from the high frequencies, but that's not the case. The sub-bass is smooth. -------------------------  This little guy is amazing! It makes listening to podcasts very easy and fun. No more hunting for the sub and it sounds amazing when using the amp. Thanks for making an awesome little device, SONY! ------------------------  Good quality sound! No distortion and a very good soundstage. -------------  Amazing. This thing is AMAZING. I'm a sound guy and it is the perfect device to go with me for work! I listen to podcasts while at my desk and it brings that great sound without the need for any additional equipment. The only issue I have is that it is so compact that it makes it hard to take on the plane and on the road. ---------------  The HT-UHD is a great little headphone/device. It is small, lightweight, and simple to use. I purchased it for my iPhone and I have not looked back since. I do wish that it had the same features as the S-series line of headphones. ------------  Great little product...  My husband loves this little device. He gets a bit excited whenever we plug it into a stereo, a set of headphones, or the front speakers of his laptop. He is a huge fan of the way SONY has brought this to the market. Thanks to Sony!  ----------------------------------  As always, this is a good value. My last purchase from SONY was a $300 headphone with a bad mic (a.k.a. the HU-1) and had to be returned. However, this one is a much better product.   I like the overall appearance, design, and design/look quality. It fits very well, is very compact, and seems to be constructed quite well. I also like the fact that the battery is easily
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just got the first one today and I am very happy with my purchase. It is very bright and seems to be made with top quality parts. The fact that it is so easy to find parts is very important. As a person who does electrical work every day, this is a must have for any electrical work. I do believe that it has its limitations, but the fact that I can make it work is a plus for me. I recommend this product to everyone I know.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've got this baby in for repairs.   A few weeks ago I ran into a minor issue where the battery stopped charging (the voltage never reached 4.2v).   We've had a few issues with this battery that don't get mentioned in reviews, but were the cause of a whole lot of the issues I was having with the device.   was just wondering if you had experience with this (maybe I missed something, but that seems like it should be a pretty common issue) and if so, how is it repaired?   Thanks!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device itself is good, I just got it today and it is a very nice experience. It is easy to set up, I do like the ability to use the wireless network even when the device is not in use, it just makes my life easier. I think it would be great if it had a different design that wasn't so square or so plain and all the buttons and ports are in the right place. I do not recommend it for home use though.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********   The sound is loud, crisp and clear. I used it with my iPhone and I have not had any problems with interference from the phone. I can't say enough good things about this little device.   It's cheap, small and works great.  , and I can only imagine what it could do with more amplification.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my wireless receiver for some low powered equipment like an ATU or an RFID reader or whatever, and with the power supply that comes with it, it's just a little loud, so I bought this one, and it's perfect. It's quiet, powerful, and very stable.  There's a little light on the top, but it's not too bright, and even with the lights on, it isn't hard to see what the receiver is seeing.  One final thing:  This receiver works with a remote, so the remote works with this receiver too! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using it since i got it, it's very good it's amazing i also have a samsung, and it's a great one but this one is amazing, it works fast, i have a g2 and a g3 so this one works like a dream, if you can afford it dont buy a g5, its a great phone but if you have the money to spend buy a s4 or s5 get a s6, they are amazing  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rene from good phone I bought this phone in april 2017, It was very nice, i got the phone for about 80 dollars, but my problem was that it died in a few months after I received it, this happened after 6 months use. When I had to have a new one I went online and i found this one, i contacted a friend who is the manager of samsung and he recommended me a new Samsung, I went on the phone and bought it, and i am so happy, i am a new customer!  I purchased this phone a month ago. After the first week, I bought the extra data because I needed it. When the phone finally rebooted and I went into my google apps, I noticed that my Google account was no longer there. The data was there. I was in an accident that wiped my phone and I did not want to lose it. I googled, and I found this site, I emailed support and after a couple days they called me and they were very helpful. Now, all my apps have data, the screen is a bit dull because of the new battery, and the phone is easy to hold. I would recommend this phone, but I would buy it again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the first time I bought a dongle for use with a computer and it works great. I didn't realize that my laptop had a mini dongLE so the fact that this works is a big plus! It is a little pricey but so far it's worth it. I use these dongles on my laptop to play my 3ds.  Works great.  These are a great value for the money.  I use them to play 3ds and wii u.    I have only 2 complaints.  The one is the USB-A cable is very flimsy and doesn't last long at all.  You can also get some cheapo usb-B cables and connect them to your computer and the dongling will just work.  There's also an issue where the dungling has to be plugged into the computer and not the docked console.  A solution is to use a USB-to-Mini USB Adapter.  It's a little expensive and it takes up 2 USB ports so that's a downside but it's cheaper than buying a docked computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very impressed with the device.  This is a great device for a little under $40.  I can now record video from a smartphone to my home network.    This device is awesome and it is very quiet.  A friend who I have never used this device with says it is the best portable digital audio recorder he has ever used.  It is a big deal when your product is a little over $40 I would recommend this device to anyone with a smart phone who wants a way to get audio on their mobile devices and video to their home network without paying for a $100 device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone is so good that i was not in need to buy any other phone or anything else i have in the last year! its just perfect and very easy to use. and when my device get's broken I wont be a big bother.  Rated 5 out of 5 by sara10 from Easy to use, good sound, and fun to play with! This is a really good little toy. I play with it all the time and use it to make noises on my way to work. It's small enough to take along with me everywhere I go. It has a lot of sound and is great for little hands.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ik.t was fast and accurate. i love my new e cig. i do like the fact that there is an auto shut off feature when the battery is completely dead, and then it will automatically turn the device back on. i would recommend this to everyone. and the price is great.  great product but can be a little hard to find. ive bought three vc mods  Review by Mark I love this device for the money. Its awesome, i would give 10 stars if it wasnt for the fact its a lot harder to find than the cheaper mod  i purchased one in the hopes of it being a simple solution to vape in public places, i was wrong.  the batteries are very cheap but only last 6 - 12 hours at a time. the usb charging port is the worst ive ever used, i tried it several times with different usb ports and always got burned out.  the switch is the most annoying part, it has an annoying clicking sound. i would love for them to redesign it for an option for a different setting. also the usb port has a large gap between it and the device that causes the charger to jam everytime i plug it in. i can only get it to charge on 3 or 4 out of 5 times. also i noticed that the button on the bottom left corner of the unit gets stuck on and wont click when in use.  that being said i cant give the vv mods less then 5 stars ive purchased 3 now. its hard to get one of these anymore  Love it! A great product for the price!!  Great device. Very good for portable vaporizers. Good battery life. No need to charge at all.  of course the battery capacity is very small so i had to buy two spare batteries, but overall a good purchase  I have had mine for about two months now and it does everything that I need it to do. It takes batteries. And it can last me a while. I am very pleased with it. :)  My favorite! This is my new favorite vv battery. I've owned the more expensive models, but the price point is fantastic. I love it for its ability to be a vape in a lot of different situations, and it is very durable. I can't wait for them make the Vv2 version. This was my first purchase with vapewild.com, and I'm a very happy camper.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!I've never had any problems with the unit. It works great! Thanks  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, August 25, 2015  I bought two of these to replace a broken battery for my laptop  by Jeffrey from Santa Cruz CA USA  Pros: Does the job.  Cons: Would have liked a better screen. . ,  Review: Works great for the price. I bought it to replace an old battery for a new computer and it works like a charm. It's easy to install and doesn't require any special skills.  to use the unit you need a computer with a usb port. the device does have two buttons on it. I installed it on my old laptop which had no hard drive. The first time i used it i was confused as to how to change it from AC to battery. you need to change the "AC Mode" to "BAT Mode" or else the laptop will be at max power and you won't be able to use it. but once i did that the computer started to work correctly again. the software is easy to use and can handle the data from the laptop very well. and the unit itself seems very durable. the last thing i would change about it is the small size of it.  in the end i would recommend this unit. it's very affordable and does the job as intended.  with that being said the only thing i'd suggest is to get a larger size battery as the one you get comes with a small one.  that being the case i can't say enough good things about this unit and i'll be recommending it to all my friends that need a new laptop.  or, just get the one i bought and you'll be good  Did you find this helpful? 30 of 33 Found Helpful  Michael from Larchmont New York  Answer: It works good.  the only problem i've had is it took me a while to get it to recognize the different battery types.  a few hours later i got it to work again so i'm pretty satisfied and would buy again.    i was going to replace the battery for the g7, but i'm sure i'll just get a new battery anyway. The only other thing i'm wondering about is that the battery door won't close all the way when you want to close it (in case it gets stuck). You have to press a small tab
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is a great little product. It's very light, and it's quite durable. You can only imagine the amount of stuff you can do with a small box. I have some electronic projects in my closet that are powered by it. It looks great, and you can get pretty close to what you are doing when you're in your room with this. I haven't found any real problems, but it's worth noting that the box is a little thin, so make sure you can fit all the electronics you have in there into it.  Style of electronic device is great: ****************** I purchased a digital video projector from the same company as this one, and while the model was the exact same price as this, I think that the quality of this model is way superior to the one I received. It was well packaged and it arrived in perfect condition. I had no issues in setting up my project on it and all the cables were in the box. If your in need of a large size digital video project projector with a nice screen and nice picture quality, and the price is right, this is a good option. If you have any questions about the quality, then just email me at jeff@fuziondigital.com and I would be happy to help.  (Review of DJI's Inspire 1) "The Inspire is a small, light, easy to handle portable computer, with a huge screen that puts almost any computer screen to shame! You can even turn it on and take a photo straight from the camera! It is small enough to take with you, but powerful enough to run most all of the programs out there."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I received my N1 this morning. This is a small little device. It works exactly as it was designed to. It's very easy to use. My friend who is a car mechanic used it on his car and it worked great. Great job!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm amazed how a small device like this works so well. The light output and sound are great. Great price! It also comes with a battery. I use a 9 volt battery in a 2200 lumens flashlight. This light is about as bright as the light in my 2200 lumen flashlight (I use a Cree XM-L2). Great value, especially for the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product, works really well, i really can not imagine going without it, i love this product!! Write a negative review about an unpleasant experience with a product:    I'm glad I'm not the only one who has this issue with the samsung phones. The phones are super awesome when it comes to sound, but the speakers on the phone when connected to my speaker system just aren't very good. I don't know if I will be able to use this on my speaker as it won't go through my phone's speaker. I also had the speaker system go out at least 3 times today. And this doesn't sound like the speakers sound at all. They're not very loud, and they just don't have a lot of volume. Write an unpleasant review about poor customer support:  This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They are useless to anyone. This was an issue that I couldn't resolve at all and after several attempts I decided not to buy anymore of this product. I wish they would listen to the customer and solve the issue quickly. If I donít receive my package by the time I am to leave for work I will not be able pay for my order with my credit card. I hope they have some kind of tracking on this because it is not something that I like having happen in the future. I would give 1 star for the sound but the sound quality of this is horrible. I'm a little worried about the quality of my reviews. This is my first purchase from an online retailer and I am very happy with my purchase. I was very hesitant when purchasing something that was on sale for so much less than I would have normally paid for a brand new device. However, I am glad I made the purchase and would recommend this product to others.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the SGH-T999A for a few days. I have not seen anything wrong. I am impressed. I love the size of the display. It is very bright and gives the impression that the screen is large. It works perfectly. I had to use it with an extra cable because I do not have a normal monitor or screen. The buttons are easy to use. This thing is great. I wish that Samsung had made it in a different color and that it was a touch more expensive. But as a little bonus, I also have an SGH2. I bought a new Sony for that. I will purchase the SGGS900 in the future as well as the new Sony.  Style and build quality of this LCD TV is very good. Very nice for those that want to have a good looking TV but don't want to spend a lot. There is no black bar when you sit down but the color looks excellent. Overall good purchase, highly recommend it.  the black bars on the SGS900 aren't a big issue for me as this is a very good picture quality. . The built quality is very nice for the price, even though it isn't metal, it still feels very solid. Also the stand is very sturdy.  of the TV I ordered, it is very easy to operate. Easy to connect the HDMI cable as well.  to all the people who are saying they're going to use a monitor in their living room, I don't think you have a real home theater system. You're better off with a console like an xbox, xbone, PS4, WiiU or Xbox One. I do recommend buying a good quality sound system like an integrated amp or bluetooth speakers. That way you'll be able to enjoy your games properly. In the end, this is the best bang for the buck, if you are willing to accept a higher price. If you are thinking about getting one I suggest to spend some more money, you won't regret it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an old Motorola PXA-1000 and have used this for more than 15 years.  It is my first computer, so my computer skills are very limited.    When I first got it, it did not work with my laptop because it only was the VGA output, but when I upgraded to a desktop computer it worked just fine. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- My new iPad is working great. Very good for watching videos, and for reading emails. But it can also be used to listen to music and audiobooks. You do not have to worry about the power supply. Very happy with this purchase ------------------------- The device worked with all the music I tried on it. However, some albums were missing the audio files. If I can hear the files, I am happy. I would recommend the device to anyone --------------------------- When you have a problem with a device, you want someone on the other end to tell you what to do. I've never had the need, but my phone had a problem and I called the number and it said it would call me back later. I went on Google and read the various complaints and finally decided I wasn't buying it and got a different one. I'm happy with my new one ------------------------  Customer Testimonials  "I just wanted to let you know how great the product is and how it made my life so much easier and saved me so much money!"  - Bill R., Chicago, IL  This product is wonderful. It's a great way to listen on your iPad without being tethered to your laptop.  -- John S., Lakewood, CA
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Lovely, easy to use and is very simple.   What I don't like:  - Can't use it as a regular power supply  (No voltage control)  So, I need to use a regulated supply (I would need an external switch for it).   - The cable length is not the same as a typical USB cable  This might not matter to the average user, but for a programmer it is a major deal-breaker.   is great, I haven't used it for a while now, so I have not had much time to write a review, but it still has the power of a good and reliable device.  I have used other devices and this is easily the best! It was very cheap and it's easy to connect to a computer with a USB port!  Would buy again.  on October 17, 2013 byon October 17 in

Overall a good unit for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just got my K3B and i can say this is the best headphone i have ever used for sound. They sound just as good as they look and the only thing that i would suggest is to get a mic.  Did you find this helpful? 23 of 27 Found Helpful  by Thomas from OAKLAND CA  Review: I am extremely happy with the product. The sound of these is great, I have two K3Bs, and the sound quality is identical. I used to have a set of the Focal PX15's (5th gen) and have always liked them, but the sound was terrible with these. They just never seemed to sound right for my preference. I like to have more of a bass boost and the bass seems to be a bit too much on these. However, this is a new product from Sennheiser, so hopefully they will be able to correct that problem.  of the best headphones I've ever used. The bass is very good, and with the volume on low, it can be really hard to hear people talking behind you. The mids are very good.  The sound is a bit thin at high volumes, but I think that's good for a small, portable device like this. I'm sure that will be corrected in the future. Of course, the only downside to these is the high price, which I guess is why Sennhiser chose to make them so expensive. However I can't fault this product. I plan to get another set very soon!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    First, this is the best portable gaming device I've ever owned. This is one of the very few portable gaming devices that is compatible with both XBox 360 and PC. For that, it is a very good buy. It is a little on the heavy for my taste, and I think it would be great for someone who likes to play games without the help of a gaming console, but is limited in space. I have it in the car, in my office, and on my living room sofa. I've even used it as a makeshift portable TV stand in my front office, with a PS3 and 360 sitting on it.   I also love the ability to take my entire gaming library on the go, and this does it perfectly. It's also easy to hook up my headphones, as it has a headphone jack (which I also find essential when traveling).   Finally, the battery is very, very good for gaming and other uses. It lasts a long time (about 8 hours), and is more than enough.  , my only complaint would be that I wish it had a headphone output so you could stream music without using your computer (which you can with most portable games). I would also like to have a USB cable. But overall, this device is a fantastic purchase, and it is now in my gaming rig. It makes a great travel companion too, as you can put it in your laptop bag.I like this game, because I can play it without my computer. I get to choose what to do with it. I play it on my PC, and when I'm on my XBox I play some PS3 games too. I can just play my games on it, it's very portable. I love it, and recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been looking for this item for a long time. I bought a hw, but was dissatisfied because it wasnt powerful enough for me. I had a friend that had one that i wanted to buy as well so i decided to order one from them, and it arrived quickly. The unit is very good, and i love it because it is very affordable. The only thing i would have is that it is kind of loud so when i am doing a long run in my office, i have to keep turning it down so that it doesnt get too loud, but it isnt that big a deal.

I use this to get the right station at the right time every time. I have it plugged in all the time.

You must find the little toggle switch to turn the tone control off and on in the settings page, which is hard to find. ,  had this for over 4 years and used on 2 different radios with it and it still works flawlessly.  and I have a lot of old radios. I bought this after my first electronic I used the other one too but found out that the tuners were way too hard to use with my old analog set up  This is by far the best tuner ive ever used!

I've been using it for about a year now. It's extremely accurate and very easy to use.  it will find your station if you know it's frequency. I find myself using it as a backup tuner for when my digital one doesn't work.  are you kidding me.   i do have the digital tuning button as well as the tone dial for the analog tuner and I find the tones on this tuner much more distinct and distinct than the analog ones. I do recommend that you turn the volume on it up as high as possible. I'd rather use my analog tuners

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikoo-x2b works great as a USB keyboard. I had my hands full with the keyboard and the other gear on my PC, and I am very glad to have this one. Great product and well worth the money.  Rated 4 out of 5 by JamesH from Love the sound quality - but... I bought this with the hope that I'd be able to use it to produce my own music with a high quality MIDI keyboard, but was a little disappointed at its performance. It takes a good amount of force to press the keys in the keyboard (my fingers are not quite used to the extra force). When playing, the sound is quite good, and the keyboard feels responsive, but the key travel is too long for my taste. I'm currently using the X2B with a Yamaha X3100 synth and I'm getting some really nice sounds out of it (for example, the clicky bass in "Rattlesnake"). If I could buy a second keyboard, I would definitely go for the X3200, though.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is an excellent product. It works well and has the best sound of any headphones out there.   I was really disappointed that they did not have the cable connectors in the earbuds themselves so I decided to order them separately, however, I was very satisfied with the quality of the headphones that I ordered.   to add to the good point, these have a good battery life, and the remote is a must have for any music lover.  .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first time using a smartphone, so I don't know much about the specs of other smartphones. I think this is a decent phone.  I like the fact that the camera comes with a decent lens, which was the case with my last smartphone.    It has been well over a year since I purchased this phone. I am using the smartphone for my work. I was expecting it to be slow and sluggish, but it has not been a problem.  This product is so affordable that I can buy a few more if I get used to it.

The app is a little confusing but it works just fine. The only down side is the battery life is very limited. I have had it for about a month now and it's still dead after 8-10 hours of use. Not a huge deal but will need to find a replacement soon.  Had a chance to use this with a Nokia 520 which had a few issues like not having a screen protector, not having an on-board charging port, etc. It is great to have a phone that's small, but with a solid build quality. .  you just get what you pay for  was this review helpful to you?"..." more "I like the phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have this one for about a week now, and I just got it and I love it. It's so small and light, that it makes it easy to use. Also, the battery life is great. I've used it in the house for 4 hours and it still has about 20% left. I use this at home because I like to have something that I can put in my pockets and it's the perfect size for that. I love that you can charge it with the USB port on my iPad, and you can use it on my Kindle Fire HD. Also the remote is a great way to use this product. I wish they came with a remote like the one on my other remote that is the iPhone remote. I also wish I had ordered a case. Posted by Alex at 4:42 AM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! This thing is amazing, I've gotten over a dozen of them and will never use anything else. I have been using it since it first came out and I love it. This thing runs everything I need for everything from my macbook pro to my pc for work, I bought a 2nd one for the bedroom, I got a 3rd one for my son, he loves it also. I just got another one for him to give him as a gift because I'm pretty sure he will get an amazing amount of use out of it. I also like the fact that it is rechargeable and I don't need to worry about my phone dying on me or my pc dying from it charging it all day long. Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best battery on the market The battery lasts as much time as my other batteries, which is amazing since I'm an electronics engineer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I was at work, and thought it would be cool to have some sort of remote control to the vacuum cleaner. Â When I got home, I installed it and the first time it tried to suck up a paper towel, I thought, what was that? Â The second time I did the same, and it turned out to be a paper clip.  I've never heard of a vacuum that couldn't do a paperclip before Â but it was an interesting little toy.  Rated 5 out of 5 by gary from  I own 2 of these vacuum cleaners.    The first one I bought in 1972 when I first got home from school.  It works fine in the house.  The second one came with a broken handle that broke in half about 15 years ago.  I got a replacement one about a month ago. These things are the reason my mother can't use a vacuum.  Heh heh hep hep.  One time the motor in my previous one was very hard to turn, and the vacuum would run at 100% for 5 seconds after turning on.  Then it would shut off and not run again.  Well, this time I installed the power adaptor and it seems to be running a lot better.  This is another time when a "dishwasher" wouldn't work.  So I have to change the dust extractor (not sure how much to change) and I also have to find something to fit the vacuum so it will open on the end and won't stick.  There is a little spring on the back of the vacuum.    This isn't a bad thing.  Just be careful of the dust as it tends to settle on it.

I do have a few things to say, but they are small things. 1- the camera isnt great. I have the g4 and the g3. The g4 is very similar to the g2, but not as sharp. It can get the picture looking ok, but its not as good as the other two. 2- I'm not sure how I feel about the case. It seems like it should be made out like leather or something, because when you open the back, it feels like a cheap plastic piece. I love that it's rubber though.

It works great for me as I was doing a video of my kids and it's hard to tell what they are saying from the video without this microphone. I can also hear people talking so I don't have to raise my voice over the kids and when I do, the kids can tell what I'm saying and it helps them to get out of the house.

I haven't heard any "sounds" like this with a subs from other companies, but it definitely has its own personality. I don't have any of the bass controls, but after setting everything, I did notice that I could make it "sound better" by lowering some of the lows and raising the highs and vice versa. I definitely like the way it sounds and will get more of it if it's affordable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â  I received this from Amazon and it has exceeded my expectations. I bought it so that my kids would have something to use on their computer when they can't get the one at home. We have been playing on it for a couple of hours already. I was able to download the game before I left for work so it was pretty good to have it on the computer when I get there. The only drawback was I needed to download all the game files in order for it to recognize the game, so you can't just save a game onto the disc and play it the next day. I didn't get around to using the game so we have been waiting until the next one to get the game. I do have to say this game is extremely fun. It is easy to learn and get into but it is also hard to put down. We had some family problems and this game helped us with communication and we never had to leave it. Overall, it is well worth the money if you are trying to make up some money. It's just a little bit hard to use because you need the game file before you can play but it will work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________ (Posted on 9/8/2013)  Best portable audio recorder Ever! __________________________________________________ (Posted by Matt in New York) ___________________________________ (I recently purchased this in the hope of using it while hiking. It is a great recording tool, especially for short nature recordings. But I have to say, I've only used it for a few weeks. And I've already had several good recordings made with it. I think I will probably end up buying another one. I just wish I'd have gotten a couple more years. This is one of the best portable audio recorders I have ever used and I use a Yamaha R-30 and a portable Shure SM-58, so the R-28 sounds pretty close to them. The controls on this model are better and more intuitive than the R30, but for most people, the R28 will work just fine. It would be nice if you could add extra battery power options, but I am sure this is possible. I'll be back with another review of the R22. But so far I am very impressed. This could be a contender for any serious backpacker, backpacking enthusiast, or nature photographer. :) (Posted in Minnesota) ____________________________ (I got the R8 a few months ago and it is great) ____________ (Posted a few days ago in New Mexico) _____________________ (I'm using the R16 this morning as my phone.) ________ (Posted last night in Colorado)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first one I bought had a bad cable so I returned it. Then I went through all the trouble of return it and I ended up not needing the second one. It is great, better then I thought it would be. My only complaint is that I wish they had a built in battery for the iPad and laptop.  I bought this for my kids and they are super happy with it. . It's a very durable and powerful device, and it's light weight which is so handy when I'm traveling. ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________ _______________________________________  I recently bought this for my son who has been playing with his friend's. The little unit that came with it did a good job of keeping him focused. The button to switch between "audible" and "silent" is perfect for both playing with friends and keeping him safe. He is always getting a smile from his friends and even the stranger who just wants to talk. The only negative is that when you press and hold the button for a couple of seconds, the unit does not turn off. I had to do a bit of digging online to find out why this would happen. I don't know if you have this problem too or if this is a "hobby" problem, but I hope it is something I can solve for my boys. Either way, they like it!  by: jay l. on 11/21/2012 5 / 5 Yes  Best for Kids by: Anonymous on 11.22.2012 _____________________________________ The first thing you see when you power up the JBL is that you're looking at a pretty impressive and impressive looking piece of equipment. The audio and volume is amazing. There are so many other features that come standard. You can play music on the unit, so you have plenty of music for the kids to listen to. The music also plays through the speakers of your TV or computer, so it's easy for them to have their own music library. I've used this unit with my computer and my older son who isn't a "tech geek" and he has had a blast. If your a parent or grandparent who is looking for a good little system for kids, this is the one for you.  favorite favorite favorite favorite ( 1 reviews )  - November 2, 2012No problems

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have one of these for several years. I bought the first version of the VPC-3000, and then switched to the Vpc-5000. I've never had problems with my VPC. I think they are very well made. The audio output, in stereo, is very good. I really like having a line-level output as well. If you like to hear the sounds coming from the speakers, you are not going to like the low-frequency response. I can understand that on headphones, it will not sound as good as using the VTC-5000 or VPC, but if you have the Vpca-5000, it is still really good. If I had one complaint, I would be that it is difficult to get a flat output with the "line out" jack. The output signal is very high impedance at 6V, so if you plug a line of level from your head to it, it won't quite match what is going into it, and you will get the sound as if the headphones have a subwoofer. I will have to do some wiring modification to do it right.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________ This is a perfect product that works great! I recently purchased my first computer, and am quite happy with it. This adapter really makes things much easier on the computer, as it allows it to connect to the router over the internet (I have it connected to my new computer over the net), thus bypassing the router. This means I can easily make changes and downloads on the internet, and I no longer have to run the router in my house, to connect and access my computer. In my house there is a little TV on my router, and to get it connected, I have to go in and set the password, and then go through all of the other steps to actually set the connection. This device saves me so much time, and makes my life so much easier. Thank you so much! —Cherry T.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________   This product has allowed me to be on my feet for a good amount of time. No more cramping of my knees, legs, or back!   The light is so bright that you can read a book with it and not be afraid to look at the screen and then back out of the dark!   is a good product for the price   Very light, great color. Easy to set up, and use   My wife needed a portable power outlet. I installed a battery backup battery, and this does the trick. I use it to charge my ipod (and occasionally my laptop) as well as to turn the refrigerator on and off. Also, it charges my Kindle and cell phone in the kitchen   I purchased this to charge up my mp3 player, then when the battery ran out I purchased another to charge an ipod which I also use. This was my first purchase from Energizer and I would recommend them to everyone, even if you aren't in a need of an outlet   Just bought one of these as a gift for my husband. Works great, very efficient, but the cord needs to be removed from one side of the plug to get it out of your way. So it gets plugged into an outlet, then out of an extension cord. It took me a few seconds to realize how this was going to cause me problems, but I will be returning the one that was my son's first present.   If you want a portable outlet you can use it anywhere, this is a great option. If you want something that is compact enough to use anytime, this isn't it.  . It is so small and light, it is a little difficult to use but the light is very bright and the cord is so flexible that you don't have to worry about it going all over your desk or around your bag.   of all the places I was looking for a portable cordless portable outlet, this was the one! I bought this to have with me in a vehicle for a little while when I have guests over and my car breaks down. I do not like to use a corded outlet, so having this as a backup was a lifesaver. I can use this with or without the plug, and it charges the ipod on the move, which is an amazing feature.   on the ground when my vehicle breaks down and I need to charge the ipad. My only advice is to make sure

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************* I use this as a portable player for playing my guitar and bass. It's small enough that it fits in the palm of my hand. It has a great sound with the included mics. It doesn't come with batteries, but you can get a couple for a couple bucks, and that makes it really easy to have around. I play in a lot of different venues and with different kinds of instruments so it's always useful. I'd definitely recommend it.  What do you think of this item?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod 2 works well.   It has the same music capabilities as the original, but a bit more.  It is not my preferred choice for audio because it is not as fast or as good in every way, but it works well and I prefer my iPod's better than my MP3 players.  My wife is glad she bought an iPod 2 and I am very happy with my choice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Loomator X1 is a great device, but has the flaw that the screen is a little small.  Also, the charging and USB ports can be hard to access.   I love the Loominator.  I've had it for a while now and have only been using it a few days.  It has great quality and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  The batteries last forever and the buttons are responsive, I've never had a device last this long.  You can use your computer and the Looner as a smart device.  You can send your files over wifi, to anyone in range and the file can be saved right to your device so you can access it whenever you want.  If you get one this is definitely your best bet. My only complaint would be that the buttons do not allow for quick changes.  In a good way, but this is a problem I've come across with many other buttons on other smart phones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As others have said, it works great for my needs! I have never had a problem with this particular battery, but with that said I have also never tried using the other brands that were advertised as being compatible with it. All of them seemed to run for about a month before the battery died. This one seemed to last a lot longer. The only thing I do not like about it is the buttons. They aren't very intuitive, but I can see how they make sense with the volume up/down buttons. Overall, I have been very happy with this purchase. I wouldn't think I could beat the price of this battery (it's only $2.50!).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********************  I purchased this little jeweler to make my jewelry box look prettier for a party in my living room. The little jewelers have a great range of colors to choose from. I'm using them in my room with the little light box I purchased as a decoration. They work great and the colors look so nice.  My 3 daughters (ages 8, 10, and 12) had so much fun playing with them. Our girls are very picky and very pickier than we usually let them be. They made a big mess of the little jeweleers when we left the house that day, but now we all have them. I was worried that they might break but they really aren't any weaker. I love the little lights that are included with each jeweler. They illuminate the boxes that my girls are in. It is fun to see the little sparkly lights.  to use one: 1. place a small piece of paper over the center of the jeweler  2. hold the jewelers against the paper  3. twist the paper around to hold the paper over your jewelers. (the little tiny little jeweled paper)  4. Place the jewel in your choice of jewelry box  5. twist and tuck the paper down to hold your jeweler in place (just like a ball)  in the box (if you do not want to tuck it down)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very happy that I purchased this device as it gives me access to all of my music. I've been listening to it for a couple of weeks and it's been amazing.   A note about the bass:   It's just a little low in my system, but it is what it is. As I've read elsewhere, the device should be aimed at using on a system with no bass, or a subwoofer. The bass on this device is so much cleaner than the speakers in my home theater system, and it even goes well with the subwoofers in the system.   the bottom line:   the sound is wonderful, the unit is compact, and the price is great!   Great purchase!   it sounds great! I like the fact that you can choose the input sources and you can't go wrong with this unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I have owned this particular model for about 2 years now and it has been a pleasure to use. It has had no problems at all and has performed perfectly. It was originally a Sony PX-100, but the company I purchased it from switched to the PX100H which is a better product in every way. I do wish Sony would make these again in the PNX-101 series. It would be nice to see it in a smaller size, as it can fit in my pocket. But, it's not a big deal. The PX101 was made by Sony in the US and thus the quality is better. The only issue I see with the PXL-100 is that it doesn't come with a hard disk drive, which I am not too fond of in a portable unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very useful device. It fits a large battery on the tip of the tool. The battery comes with a cover to protect it. The tool is very handy for opening car windshields, but the battery is not so easy to replace. You need a socket wrench, small flat blade screw driver and small flat tip screw driver to do this. For example, I had an opening in the bumper of my car that had a hole for a battery and this tool broke the rubber off. You can easily remove the cover but not the battery. So this tool will probably come in handy if you work on cars but you have an opening that will not allow you to remove the battery and the tool does not work well for you.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, October 24, 2016  Simple and effective. -Michael in Oklahoma City  Review: I use this tool for many different tasks. I like to have the battery charger to charge the batteries as well. This battery charger comes with 2 batteries. The charger is a little flimsy and needs to be adjusted if you don't want it to jump around, but it works great for me. The batteries come with a small plastic cover that protects them. They also have a little holder to put them in if they get a little loose. They're also a good size so that I can hold 2 at once. The only issue I have with the tool is that you need to be careful not to drop it on any sharp edges. It's very handy in my case because I have a lot of stuff that needs to go inside.  is also a nice little tool, not just for opening cars doors, but you can use it for a lot more.  in fact, I think that the only negative I have is that there isn't an easy way to close the tool completely when you're done. It looks like if you were to just stick it on the end of the tip with the screw and pull it up, then you can close it. However, I found the most effective way to take it off was with the push button and pull the button. I like that I have the ability to carry this thing anywhere and use it as needed.  I think it's very useful  by: John in San Antonio, TX  Pros: Simple, well built.  with a charger, easy to charge or put into car.  of course, the only drawback

I don't like playing it in the car or my car because of the tiny speakers, but that's fine. If you don't want that small speaker, this is fine. And this thing is small. It's great if you can fit it in your bag. I would recommend this little guy to everyone!  New to the scene: ****************************  I recently discovered that there are a bunch of people who are playing "The Music Game" all around the world. I was drawn in by the fact that I could play my own tunes. The more I used it, the more I discovered that this is the perfect tool to discover, practice and expand your musical abilities. The first thing I want to say is that it's not easy to get started with this tool. It was not made for novices. That's the biggest reason I think people who haven't done this for a long time, struggle. It is not meant for noobs. There's a lot to learn. I'm not just saying this because I'm an experienced musician. There are also many tips I wish I had found earlier. I'll tell you now: you cannot learn this tool unless you really try! It's not a toy. You must be dedicated, and you must really invest your time in it. This is an exciting time for the music game, and I'm looking forward to the next step. Thanks for all your support.  Great Music Tool *********   A great addition to any music collection, and an especially great app for iPod/iPhone users.   It's really nice and easy to use, and it's a breeze to transfer all your tunes to and from your computer.   a couple of features that I like are that the songs are stored with a very good amount of "structure", so they should be easy to arrange, and there are some nice and simple playlists.   with some of the features added, and the ability to import music files (as well as MIDI file), the future of this tool is only limited by my imagination!   This tool really is a "music library manager". It's easy to find and organize your music.   to use it just find the songs you want to add and start playing the songs from your library. It can

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   i had it a week now and it is still running.   I used it mostly for my iphone 6s Plus, but also my ipad Air 2, which it works great.  I like the size and the fact that it can be charged to 80% on the go. . , i have tried it for about a year now and i think i got a pretty good deal with it. I don't think it gets that much use but i just use it everyday.    Great product at a great price:   , I really like this charger. It's not huge and you can't beat the price. The only complaint i have is that sometimes i have to wait for the cable to charge because of the plug on it but that doesn't stop me from using it. :  The charger is great, and the batteries that came with mine were great as well. I really enjoyed using mine with my ipad Air2 and a small tablet. 'some features i like that comes in handy: What do i like about this charger: This charger is awesome. The cord is strong and it charges quickly. It is easy to use and the battery is a great size. I also like that i can put two batteries in one and charge the other. The charger has a good weight to it which keeps it from sliding around in my bag  What does it not have: I don't know if the other batteries were defective or not because it doesn't have enough capacity to charge two other battery's at once. I would definitely buy this charger again  It is not a must have charger:    This charge is not necessary but if you want something more powerful for your iphones and ipads this is a good charger.  of all the chargers i have owned it has the best output of juice and output of power, and for that its pretty much worth the price and the quality and it comes with two batteries so you wont have to worry about running out of juice.  in my opinion it has a better charge time than the other ones and it's a little bit bigger so i can charge both my ipads at once  this charger does not have the best battery capacity but it has two batteries which is a plus for anyone looking for a powerfull charger. and the weight of this charger is nice and heavy it has great power output and i would buy
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I own a very nice set of eurorack modules, these sound very good. I use them at a small home studio. They sound as good as the best studio equipment for a fraction of the cost. This is a great product. --------------------------  Not for the beginner: --------------- I have always been a huge fan of electronic music. For over 25 years I have used a variety of gear. The first time I purchased an analog synthesizer I was a bit shocked at the price. The reason is that this particular unit was not made for musicians. The cost of this unit was a great investment. It sounded amazing. After that I spent a lot of time experimenting with analog synthesizers. I am sure I have spent more money than I could have ever spent on gear. I found that there are things that sound better then this product, and even more expensive. This unit is not an exception to this rule. It's a great device, but for the price it's not good value. --------------  Innovative, powerful and well designed: ------------ The Ozone 10 is the best module I have ever used for electronic music production. It is the most unique and powerful analog synth I have heard. It produces extremely detailed sound. The sound is a hybrid of a modern analogue synth and a digital synth. It offers a huge variety of sounds that can easily be edited with a DAW. The module is extremely well designed. It has a very long and wide sound space. It takes time to develop the skills to create the most complex sounds with this module. The OZ10 module has a built in audio interface that connects with your laptop or PC. It can be used in a range of applications. If you are serious about electronic music this is a must have module. -------------  Good value for the money: ------------- The OVO is an extremely versatile module, especially when it comes to creating an analog sounding analog sound. This thing is a beast. There's no comparison in the sound quality, this module is a definite improvement over the Ozone 2.   The only down side to the OVO as far as I am concerned is the size of the chassis. It seems to get bigger in the lower octaves when you hit certain notes. Overall I find this thing very easy to use, although I know I will upgrade to a bigger unit when I get the chance to do so. I haven't tried the O3

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- Great device, good build quality, very efficient. I bought 2 of these and only one died. I have bought several and this one is my best.  Write a negative review about the same device but with a different brand: --------------- I bought the 3rd generation Apple TV 4 in October of last year. After a few months of using the tv, my 4th generation device would not connect to the Apple TV, and this was not the result of any other device. After much frustration trying to get my 4-year old 2nd gen device to connect, I finally decided to try the 5th generation. This device is much better, it connects very well, the tv interface is much more intuitive, and the remote is much smoother and easier to use. I had not tried the 4th gen apple tv, so I will not comment on it as it is not something I will be replacing. This tv would be a great buy if not for the cable problem and the cable box being so expensive. For only $130 you could get a very decent apple tv and not deal with the price of cable.  for the price, i would recommend it to anyone with a 4th Generation AppleTV. If you are buying a TV, get the tv set with a wireless dongle, because the apple tv will not connect unless you use a dongles and the AppleTV is a little slow. I have bought the original 5th gen Apple tv, and a 4k tv, however the tv 4 was my first Apple device and was a great device. As an apple fan, I have the 3GS, 4 and 5th Gen in my household, and they work great. The only reason why I did not get the 4k was because I got a 4G LTE iPhone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So far I have used my new Korg MS10 and it's worked out very well. My main problem with the MS10 has been finding the key on the keyboard. But this has been fixed and my MS10 works wonderfully.   What's also great about the MS0:   The MS0 has lots of great sounds that you can program and you can play as soon as you hook up the keyboard to the computer. I'm a programmer and have done a few projects so I'm in touch with what I like to do. The MS0 is perfect for doing that because the interface is so user-friendly.   of course I was not able to test out the MS5 but it does have a number of the features of the MS9 and I am very satisfied with the sound and design of the keyboard too.

In summary, the A101 was a cheap knock-off that worked OK for the most part. It had a couple of really bad problems which kept it from being great.  These were the lack of a remote, the lack (or lack of any) memory for the device, and a weird thing.  The memory function was a little hard to use because it would not record the same setting on each time you used it. It was sort of like a tape recorder.  I am not sure what's worse, that it worked at all, or that it is so hard to program.  There are some better choices out there.  See it on Amazon, or another vendor (if you can find it):

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for a week now, and i love it, it is so far the best keyboard for the money, i love the size of the keys, and the keys are very responsive, i play games like wow, and it gets me through the grind, there is one thing that would have been nice, but it isnt a deal breaker, the only thing i would change about this keyboard is that there are no usb ports on the keyboard, but that is only a minor con.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ***************** I'm really surprised that it worked after being so disappointed in the first attempt.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 24, 2013  Good but cheap  by Chris from Lubbock TX USA  Pros: Works great  Cons: No remote to use  Review: This worked great for my purpose, I purchased it to use my cell phone as a remote. I had used a cheap one that used a small plug on the end of a phone cord. It was not very reliable at all, and it was hard to set it up, because it was not easily accessible from the top of the unit. This one was much easier to use and was much more reliable. I also used it to control a light switch in a bedroom that had no cable outlet on the wall. I wish it had some kind of remote control. -Chris  It's OK  By Brian from Chicago IL USA  is great for what it is...a small remote.  that being said it can be hard to find in stores as is. so i bought it online and it did not have the remote included. i think it might be worth getting a separate one but it still might just be a small remote..  is great for...  Condition: Used  Transmission: Remote control  Price: $30.99  Specs: 1.5"  Effect: Power on/off  Video:  Size: 3.2"   Pros  1. Easy to use.  "on the go" remote.   Cons  I do have another one in case it happens again. , I'm sure it's just my remote but it doesn't turn off my lights when I turn it off.  for the price, it's not very good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I got this for Christmas last year, and it has been working perfectly ever since. It's so useful, it's even given me a new sense of direction. And the batteries last a long time. I use it on my computer from time to time for an emergency phone call or something like that, and I still charge it up every week and it never runs out of juice.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Simple but useful - no need for an SD card I used this as an alternative to a micro SD card slot on a new laptop. Works like a charm for storing my movies, music, etc on. However, it lacks the convenience of the micro SD slot. The SD slot needs to be able to accommodate the cards that will be inserted into it (such as SDHC and SDXC).  No reviews for this product. , not enough capacity to store your media, and when it works it's too slow to use.  of a bad deal I wanted to purchase a usb flash drive. I thought this would be better then my old one I had that has almost 0 room to store my media. So when I got the flash drive I got it for free, I decided to do a clean install. I just used dd on linux to extract the files I needed. It took about 10 minutes and the system booted up on the first try. When it booted it told me the drive was filled to capacity. I then looked at my phone and found out that the data isnt even written on the drive. I'm very disappointed that a $10 drive is only good enough to hold about 8 movies. I'm going to give it a B, not a 5  This is my second Mac computer, this was my first, and so far, so good. I run Arch linux (for windows) and as you can see, this device has taken up space. .The micro usb slot is a pain in the a$&, this will have to be used on my other computer(for windows, I can use a usb key).I like how the computer is silent, it is very quiet. The screen is a nice size. The case is a little light, but the weight is very well worth it.The battery life has lasted a full day of use on my mac computer. So far so good, although i would like to see the USB 3.0 option for a larger flash drive,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* The Icom IC-307 is a great little tuner and recorder. Its very affordable for a tuner, but does an excellent job of preserving the sound of a good amplifier. It is also fairly simple to use and operate. If you are looking for a quality tuner at an affordable price, this one is definitely the way to go! If you need something with a bit more heft, go with the Icom DSR-II. Overall, I am very satisfied with the design and operation of this unit and I am confident that it will serve me well for many years to come.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jw924 from Excellent! I have used many tuners/recorders over the years, this is by far the best of the bunch, I have the 3.5.4. It's been great listening to all my recordings with all my CDs. It records all my audio formats and has enough capacity to do all the other stuff like send my audio files to audio cd burner etc. Great tuner!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned and used an ipod since 2007 and its been on my wrist now for a year and a half. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of a small issue with the app which the software developers have said they will be working on. if you like the app, you have to pay $9.99 for the upgrade version which doesnt seem that high at all. this is another reason for 5 stars ive always had an issue with having a poor connection to wifi in the past because of the app so hopefully this issue will be fixed in the app version of this one.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, September 30, 2010  works as advertised  by Anonymous from Fort Lauderdale FL USA  Pros: easy to set up, good quality, no battery life problems.  the only downside is that its a tiny little thing on your wrist  Cons: its just a little too hard to put on your finger  Review: Works like a charm. I like the way you can read music and the display. It took me a while to learn how to use the menu system, but after that, it's a breeze.   I purchased the battery only as a backup for my iPod, but for the price, it is really worth it. I also use the music app, and the music is a lot louder than it should be. The display gets a little dim at times, but you can turn off the display with a slider. If you want to listen to music without turning on the display, the battery is pretty powerful and has an hour of music on it. It is a little tiny thing on the wrist, and i would like it a lot better if it was a little larger. .  if you can get over the size, it works great.  have no regrets.  I got mine on sale for $19.99, and bought two more for friends  Great price  was this review helpful to you? Yes No Monday, June 28, 2010
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It was so easy to use.  The ability to monitor a whole building/area is awesome.   I could see at a glance how much power my water heater was drawing, and it was even a lot cheaper than a meter that I had.  I also love the price of the unit, as it's the best price I could find online at this time of year!    5 out of 5 stars   Thank you.  This is a great product.  It is easy to install and has no dead spots.  We have been using it since we moved in and we haven't found one.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to know how much electricity their appliances are using, or for home owners who want to know the exact amount of power in the room. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a fantastic piece of kit for use with our DSLR. The sound quality of this mic is superb and very clear. The battery life is excellent, it even lasted through the entire first day of filming, with only a few minutes of charging. The only negative thing about this device is the fact that there is no on/off switch. I really want to try out the'solo' version, but it would take a lot of fiddling to set it up. Other than that, this is an excellent piece of equipment.  Great mic, terrible battery life: The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered it thinking it was a good deal for the price. When it arrived I was disappointed in the battery life because I had no idea it would be so slow. This is the only reason the 5 star rating is lower than 5, otherwise it is well worth the money. Great mic, poor battery life.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, June 23, 2012  Not as useful as I hoped  by David from  Review: I have been looking for a cheap digital camera for some time, and this is my first purchase. So far I like it very much. The app is very user friendly. The lens cap is easy to remove. The shutter sound is very good, and the focus assist is very helpful. As for the picture, it is a very good photo. I have taken a few shots of plants that I have never really looked at before. I like the picture quality of the picture. As far as the app, it can be a little bit difficult to use for me. It is very fiddly and I get distracted easily, it just needs a little more polish to be really useful.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this because of the reviews and what I read on the website. I got it yesterday at work, I was hesitant to order it because I didn't want it to be "used" the first few days. But, after a couple of days, I got a lot of uses out of it! The price was great for the device. The device is very sleek. I was very happy that it came with a USB cable to use with my phone. The only issue I had with it was that it seems to get hot if the device is in an open area. I hope the cooling option is available on the future models.

Also, I really enjoy the fact that they have an aux cable to use my ipod's earbuds to my ipod! So much easier to have my ips and ipods in a single place!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good, excellent value for money. The quality of the build quality and the features is great. There was no problems whatsoever during installation or use. The installation instructions were clear and to the point. I would have given five stars, except for two minor niggles. The first was that the light dims very slowly, at least for the first ten minutes of use. This was frustrating when I was working in an office with lots of people and was looking for the light. I could not find a solution to the problem, and I will not use this light if it doesn't keep the light on all the time. The second minor niggle was that I had to re-install the battery after every use because the old battery died. The good thing is that I can just swap the batteries and this doesn't affect the device's functionality. The only problem I have is that after an hour, there was a little bit of fog on the screen. If I could return the unit to the store, I would. The price is excellent, and the quality is top notch. I highly recommend this product.  5-5-15  I used this to check my home for leaks in the bathroom during the day when I have a shower and to monitor my home water. It works great in both situations. It is a very simple unit, easy to use and has plenty of battery life. I do have one major gripe about the light itself, it is a tad on the blue/green side. It may just be me though. Overall a good unit at a good price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought the H6D-100. It's amazing what you can do with a computer, especially a very good one! I love the new firmware and the way it's easy to make adjustments and change colors.  Nice: --------------- As far as the features go, I don't have anything bad to say about the H-6D. It does everything I want to.  the included usb cable works fine with my computer and I'm not trying to hack on it, though I know that will come in handy in the future  Bad: -------------------------- I didn't want to buy this one but I thought I would. The quality of the HV6 has a lot of flaws in it, as it seems to have some issues with the usb port. When you plug it into your computer the usb is very poor and you have to use a USB to power adapter in order to charge. This is the reason I couldn't give it 4.5 stars, and I will try to contact Hitech to see if it was fixed. It really isn't the worst usb port ever, but you should get the power adapter instead of buying the usb. I really wish the price would be lower.  and I wish I would have gone with this one and not the new model.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this thing out of the mailbox today.   It has a good screen quality and is very responsive.   and the wireless signal is a nice touch.   (from a family member)   "Great little portable wireless router."  From Anonymous of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 2/4/2014. I bought this unit to replace my old one and I've had no problems whatsoever. I don't use my wireless all the time, so the extra speed is well worth the money. I had no issues with the initial setup. All the settings seemed to be well labeled.  .  This item is great for its low cost and ease of use. I am very happy with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________ This is one of the best things I have ever purchased from an electronics company. I use it for my home theater, to run a remote control with my car audio system, and to control the remote for my lawnmower and other stuff on my farm. It also provides me with some nice sound with a single battery. I've had a couple of battery failures because the battery in the device has gone bad. This is my second unit, so I know it is reliable. If you have an audio system with a remote controller, this is a great deal for less than $100, and even better if you own a lawn mower or any other power-driven machine. My wife also loves it and uses it to control a camera from inside our home. It's so handy!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been looking for a good portable vaporizer for a few months now. I'm looking for an easy to use vaporizer to carry my small-scale vape pens and e-liquids. This is the only one I've seen that I have confidence to recommend. It's pretty light but does the job. If you're looking for something that's easy to carry and has a few decent features, this is the way to go.  Write a negative review about the unit:   I really wanted to like this unit. I've tried many vaporizers in the past, and I thought that they all sucked because they were too heavy or too hard to use. Then I got this vaporizer. I got the glass. I liked the looks of the vaporizer, but it was a complete waste of money. It sucked. It leaked. It was too big and too heavy to get good flavor. It tasted awful. You have to blow very hard to get anything at all out of it. It leaks and it makes a huge mess. I don't think it will last more than a few minutes. I think it's a waste of time. It will cost more money and have worse results. It has a terrible name and it's going to be hard for someone else to find a decent product.  I will never buy this product again and I will give it 1 star if it's still available. It sucks!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Just a heads up that i am getting a new laptop and the battery was about to die so i tried this out and it didnt last all day....its a good buy for a laptop and a nice compact design.   Didn't seem like much when I first opened it. But there is plenty of room to pack a lot in it. It has a really nice battery life. It is just nice to have a solid battery that lasts.   the only complaint that i had was that i did get a scratch on it...so I have to take it back to the store...but i didnt want to give them money if its not something that i can fix myself.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very nice touch screen and a very good keyboard. I'm using this for a web-server.   Pros:  -Great Touch screen  + I like having multiple programs at the same time  *The software is clean and very user friendly  (A very good thing for any user)   Cons:  and this is the most cons I have  . The touch screen is a little bit difficult to see when moving your hand around and when using the mouse. Also the screen is not that large. It has an aspect ratio of 2:3. So I have the option to use this as a CRT or a LCD monitor. The LCD will be a very nice option. But the touch screen would have been a nice addition to the computer if I was using it for another purpose.  . I found that after about 3-4 months of use the battery was getting quite old.  'the battery life isn't bad but I have to turn on the computer for about 30 minutes to have the battery charged up and it has gotten a little old. But I don't have an AC outlet so that really makes a difference for me.   the speakers are great, I use them to play music to get work done. I use these as my speakers for my PC and my iPhone.   "The best touch screen that I have seen so far."   "It is well made and does what I want it to do. There are no cons.  My only problem is that the touch pad on the back isn't quite as accurate as I would like. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use their tablet in conjunction with a PC."   a little to expensive for a tablet?   I am looking for a touch screen device that doesn't cost too much but also does what it is supposed to do with out being super laggy.   is there any tablet that is worth the price but with a good screen. The display on the S8+ is great, it has a very wide viewing angle and the colors are good. I bought this device because I wanted a good computer, but also wanted an tablet. I was not disappointed. I could not be happier with it. I have used it for about a month and I have not had a single hiccup, nor have I had any issues. I like the way it feels in my hands, although I would have preferred a smaller device because it
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great little device for the price. I used it to check my kids grades in my math class. It works great. I can check my students' work while they're in class without having to take their eyes off of the board. The quality of the unit is top notch. It's light but it's pretty durable. There are two different grades of these little things. I like the first grader because it's easier to use. It only works with a cord for it's power, and it works as long as you want it to. I have the second grader, which has an extra cord that works for multiple outlets.  Both work great for me. I wish it came with a more powerful charger.  I'm still using my original charger for my first graders.    I got mine about two years ago and use it to make sure all my kids are on task all the time. No complaints. I use mine when they do their tests, to play some music, to do my homework, and to do some light math. The kids seem to like it, it makes a difference. I'm going to keep my second graders going to the next grade. I really don't want to get rid of mine, they're still great for my math classes. They keep the kids focused and they seem to do better on my math than the kids in class I had before.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Voodoo 4 is a great piece of hardware, I had no problems at all with the card itself and the USB ports. But this card was not able to handle the very high performance of an i7 6700k @4.0ghz. It was very hard to do anything but simple tasks in the latest version of Doom. I even installed the driver on my windows 7 machine (with no problems) and this card couldn't cope with it at all. It crashed on me a lot. I did a few other things like benchmarking a video card, video editing programs and other computer tasks, but it just wasn't going to happen.  Was this review helpful to you?

Yes No Tuesday, May 25, 2010  Bought this with my son  by David from San Diego CA USA  Pros: It is compact and light  Cons: Nothing  Review: For the price, this is a very good toy. It fits easily in a diaper bag and you can take it to the park or the beach where it can go unnoticed. We use it to entertain my 11 year old son and we both love playing with it. I have only used it one time, but it is holding up well.  "It does a nice job of keeping the noise level down."

I have my guitar hooked up to a mic, it's not loud.  the problem is with the way i wired it. i had a problem with the original cable coming out of the mic.  so i used a new cable with a connector.  but i have to use the original jack of the guitar.  for whatever reason, with this cable, i can play the guitar, but i can hear the guitar clearly.  The original cable was a little longer than the new one.

It saves a lot of time when I am looking for the right audio signal. Thank you for making such a great product. I don't need to use my laptop on the road! I use it almost everywhere.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Chris from Great for the job I use this to stream music from a phone to my amp. It works well enough and I'm happy. There's just no way I can listen to music through my desktop computer and headphones. It would be nice if it streamed over WiFi or LTE. I get the same streaming speeds over a wired connection, so it's not a big deal. I wouldn't recommend this product for serious musicians, but if you have music on your phone and need to share it with others, then this product works well.  Customer Testimonials

My son is in the house and can hear the device and I am having to tell him to turn the device off. I wish that I had purchased the one with a vibrating keyboard. The vibration is wonderful and the sound is good, but for someone who is trying to listen to the phone I don't think this is a good alternative to using the physical keypad. I have the same problem with the Apple iPhone 4.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *************I don't know what's wrong with the audio, the music is just too low for me to hear anything on the screen with headphones. I was disappointed because I had the unit for a while. Now that I own another, I'm just going to use the other one (it's bigger). It seems like a really great unit. I'm using it in my room and I hear a lot better. ********* **********It was a nice device to have, it's just a shame that they are so bad on the sound.    ****  ************ ******** ******** It's just an old, poor quality product. It's still got a lot of life in it though.  This product is awesome!!! i bought this for my son as a present from me and he loves it. so far it works flawlessly, it came with a charger for it so he could use it for a few days so we can test it out before we put it to any big uses, so far he likes it and he wants to use it again. the only problem i see is that the button and light buttons do not work with the device, which may be an issue for some. other than that it works perfect and is the perfect size for him to use and it's perfect for his room (it sits in the middle). also it's easy to move to other rooms as well if i have the need. if the buttons do become the only thing i have to use then that would be a bummer because i can see them being used quite often and he will appreciate it if they do become a thing. i recommend it to everyone who likes their new tv  Great TV - just not for me. I bought this television as a gift for my wife. I took it apart and was concerned with some of the buttons not working. I didn't want to have to have any of the other buttons for the controls.  of course when the tv was working perfectly I was amazed that I had spent all that money for the tv when I could have had a cheaper one. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the purchase. The purchase price was great, and the shipping was very quick. The sound quality is great. I was also pleased with my receipt, I would buy again. It's hard to find any negatives, though, the only negative is the batteries for the microphone and the headphone jack are difficult to find. Other than that, it was a very nice purchase and I will continue to order more from you. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device :  The sound quality of the product is great but the product comes with a very expensive speaker. I would not recommend this product to anyone, if you are looking to buy a wireless microphone then get a wireless kit, instead of buying the one you got with this product. Also you should be able to find an older model if you need a wireless system with a microphone Write an average review about bad/poor quality :    I think the product was a great idea, but it took way too long to get the product and for the wireless microphone to be installed. I'm sure it will be good, but I'm very disappointed in how long it took to get it. I hope that they make more wireless mics and that this one was a small test. Read more reviews on this product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Works great. It's a nice computer. It has USB 2.0 and a CD-Rom. I am glad to have this. I got it for my friend who has a laptop. It is perfect for him. The only drawback is that the computer's battery does not last as long as it should. So when i had to charge it it takes 20-25 minutes before it is fully charged. But with a little patience it works fine. Overall, a great product. I recommend it. Thank you  Product: I really enjoyed my new computer, it was very easy to set up and has good features. The speed of the computer is fast. It took me 10 minutes to set it up. The computer comes with the CD, it's only a $20.00 charge. It had no problems in operation.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Vision Review of DJIfish Phantom 2  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, November 16, 2010  A quality product, but has a few problems  by M G from Stow, KY USA  Pros:  Good Price  Easy to use  Great battery life  Cons: ..  I have had it for about a month now and have not had any problems at all. I also use it for aerial video work and it works great in that as well. .  a few things that could be improved would be:  and a few other things that I dont think are really big deal is that if you want to change the camera you have to use the camera's menu to select the desired camera. You can't just turn it on and it changes to another camera. I would really like the option of being able to choose camera and then change to the other camera in the menu. Another thing that could b improved would a little more flexibility in adjusting the camera settings and a way to save settings to my computer. I can't imagine why someone would have to make a new camera every time a different camera is needed..   Overall I like the price of this Phantom and am glad I purchased it. I have several Phantom's and these are probably the easiest to operate with. I will probably go to another brand next...  an extra feature would be the ability to change out the battery.  is a nice feature, but one I didnt realize until I used the camera for a few days.. The
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus-a I have purchased several of the newer iros/roku systems. The one in the photo below is not the newest but works well, very smooth and it is not too bright when used in an apartment.  My only gripe is it is much too expensive for what it is. I would not buy another one  Positive on Oct 13, 2014  This is a great light. I have an older iros that was getting old and the batteries weren't holding up so I decided to upgrade. I had this on my radar since I was looking to add a backup light to my motorcycle and it came with great reviews. I really like the fact that it comes with the charging cord and the lights are interchangeable, you can use the ones in the box with a different battery and they are super bright and look awesome.   As for me, I use my iros with a red bulb and it's great, no complaints. I also use it on my motorcycle with a single white bulb and its perfect, no problems whatsoever. The iros is a very low-profile light that comes with a charging cord that will fit the cord on most lights or it can be extended with a small extension and I can use it anywhere I go. It does a great job and the only down fall I can think of is the price but it's a bargain compared to the new iros. -Mike  I use my on and off bike lights to keep me safe on the road or trail. I am very pleased with my purchase. The lights are very well made and easy to use. I like the battery indicator light, it alerts me when the battery is low and the new batteries I got came with a power cable that I can extend to an old one on the same light.    For me, this is my new everyday light and I look forward to using it for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- This is a fantastic device, especially for the price. It is very easy to use and the quality is really great. It can be used to make recordings or play an audio file to your speakers, with the optional microphone. I use this to make my own music. It has a very high quality sound, and does not sound distorted at all. I have used the microphone to make phone calls to my wife and friends. It sounds pretty good too. The only thing is that sometimes when playing a file that is more than 24 khz, it will play with the same quality it had before, but not perfectly. It will not have a perfect sound, as it is not capable of that. Also I wish that it could have more features, such as the ability to save it on the SD card so that I can save the files on my computer for later. I will be buying another one for my home, because I know the quality of this one. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to create music and to anyone that does not have the money to buy an expensive computer. If you want to create good sound on a budget, this is the device for you! It is well worth the money and the fact that you can take it with you on any trip you take where you have an internet connection, it is much better then a computer!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s is my new phone and I love it!!!  It does all the things it was designed to do, and more: I bought my first iPhone a few years ago, after seeing all the hype about it and knowing about the benefits, so i bought it. It was the perfect first phone, and even had the extra features and extras that I wanted. I now have two. The latest model with all the extra storage, cameras, apps, a bigger screen, etc. Plus the new iPhone SE is even better! I can't wait to buy the new one.  Not as good as iPhone 5s but better than a Galaxy S8: I have had this phone since it came out, and the problem that I am having is that it is very slow and laggy, and sometimes I have to reboot it for it to work properly. I do not know what is wrong, I just don't like it. The only reason why I still have it is because I use it mostly to take photos. The Galaxy S7 is a lot better, it has a better camera, and has faster processor. :)  Excellent phone and better than I thought I would find. The camera and other functions of the phone are very useful, but the battery life is not what I expected. I've had a Galaxy 8 for quite a while and I was surprised at how good the battery performance was. The 5s takes about half as long to charge but it charges very fast, but my battery life remains almost the same. .

This device is well made, easy to use, and has everything you need. Great for my needs.  I was very impressed with this device. It's perfect!  No matter where I am, I can do everything with ease. I can't complain about it at all. I just wish I could do more than what I can.  to the point of what can I say that's great and why should I buy this...  It's amazing. ,  This is the best. - I use it to store files I take in a flash drive with me and I can backup them to this thing every time i am on the computer.  a great little computer. and, its cheap. i got it because i saw it on youtube in one of the videos that they had on how to make your own keyboard with a usb cable  Best Product ever  For many years I have used a PDA. This is my 1st computer and it is the BEST computer I have ever had!   It is perfect for me. I work from my home office in a small house and it allows me to be productive and on my computer. I don't have to carry my laptop anywhere and it has everything I need. I have the mini version because of the USB ports but its just perfect in every way. You cant go wrong with a Mac or PC.  in a word.... Perfect!    The only con is the screen quality. It is very dim. Not bright. But if you watch tv with it, it looks very nice.  the only thing I do not like about it, is it doesn't have an audio out and it wont have one in the future either.  and i dont think they should have left the micro usb ports open. that's the only downside i could think of.   I will be getting another one for my office. . I'm amazed, This is the only computer I can say I've owned that has all the features I needed and the price point is right and if I have to put money down to buy it, I'm in! And I'm happy to get one of these! ,, It's amazing and perfect. I think I bought 3 of them from Walmart on my first order. Great product!!  , this is just amazing!!!  Just

This one is for all my gf who wants to watch some tv on her android tablet, i have not really used the web version, but i think it works really well, the only problem I have with it is that it will always start the flash in order to load the picture when a new song comes on, but in order not to miss that it starts the flash after you play a song and then stops it after, so you always have to press the play button on the remote for that  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The only thing I would like is a way of being able to turn down the volume. It's easy to turn it up and down, but you really have to have it in loud volume before you can even think about playing a song.

"The device worked perfectly. I used it for a day or so and had it back up. .  (Posted by Jason W. on 11/11/2011) I have a Garmin Forerunner 210 with a heart rate monitor. The device has a built in GPS so I use it daily. Unfortunately, I found the Garmin 210 to have some major glitches and I am very frustrated. I've tried the troubleshooting steps that are on the Garmin site and it only fixes minor glitches, but not major issues. I'm also having to turn the unit off and on and back and forth a lot. When it runs on battery, it looks like a standard heart rate sensor, but when it is connected to my computer, I see a lot of weird and annoying features. It is annoying that I can't read the data on my Garmin devices from my computer without having to change something on my computer. When I turn the computer on and it has the error "Device cannot be connected to the GPS" it doesn't say it doesn' t work. This happens for everything from the time I turn it on to the time it's turned off. I really think that there needs to be a hardware update to the Garmin computer or a firmware update. The software update is very buggy. I haven't had this problem since purchasing the product, but it's a little frustrating.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Amazing price, fast delivery, great quality, good customer service. I'm very happy and highly recommended the company!  Write a negative review about an electronic device. I received an electronic item which was faulty, not tested or fit for purpose. I contacted the company and was assured the item would be delivered as advertised. The next day an electronic replacement was provided. This is the second time I have purchased from them and I've never had a problem. The company is excellent at responding to emails in a timely fashion.  One customer review: I bought a 4gb usb drive to store my music. I had used the original one for years and was looking forward to using the new one. When the new unit arrived the drive was in poor condition. The first few hours after use were the worst I have ever experienced with a drive. No vibration or sound to accompany use and I could not get a clean copy of the files. I tried the latest version of Win7 and then got my hands on the latest Windows 8 software. This new drive was just as bad, it was a complete mess with lots of noise and dust. I have returned it to the company as it is not fit for any purpose. So far I have sent them several messages asking for a replacement but no luck.  of the 5 products I've ordered from this company, I can only say good quality for the price. They ship very quickly and have been very helpful with my issues. They don't have to be so concerned about customer service because they are excellent and have great products.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned a samsung galaxy s for a little over a month now and i think the s is the best phone the money can buy, i like the phone its super easy to use and have a good camera that can take nice pictures of the day its also really sturdy and easy to hold  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from This phone is great I purchased this phone a few months ago. The phone is amazing. The only thing I don't really like about it is the size. It is just a little too big for my hand. The other downside is that the earpiece is a little loose, so it gets in the way sometimes. Overall great phone, just wish it was slightly smaller.  From the moment I set eyes on this device I knew I'd love it. It's my first smartphone, but it has exceeded my expectations, in so many ways. My first impression: great looking, a little bulky, but that's OK. The camera is great, with an extra lens to the rear. The screen has been perfect out of the box. I love that there is a microSD card slot, and that this phone isn't locked to one carrier. My next impression: The camera software is terrible. There is a very poor camera app, which is not good for a phone in 2016. The notification/app tray is also very poor. The apps that came with the phone were ok, but I wish there had been some more apps for it. In particular, I really wish that there was an app to delete old pictures from the phone. There was no such app for this device. My last impression: It's very fast. If you're into video and photography, this is the device for you. I've gotten a lot of photos from it. Overall, a great phone for the price, especially for someone in a tight budget.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device is very good, especially if you are on a tight budget and can't afford a top model.   A great value.   not as great as a lot of the others out there, but if you have a little extra cash, or are on the go it's definitely worth a look.  'tis the season.  The only problem with this device is that it is very short on the battery life. I can't believe it takes a full day for the battery to go from 10% to 100%. I used it during the week and it did not last for more than an hour at a time.The only problem that I see with this product is that the price is not justified by the specs or performance. If it were my laptop, I'd pass on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikitune-10-10t-8mhz-3d-screen-wiimote-pc-game-controller-gamepad-mouse.html I received my ikatune-5 this week and was very impressed. This is a great game pad that connects to pc. A few of my friends had one and are now hooked. It works great. I have a 3ds as well and this is a huge step up. The joystick has some issues when I want to play some other games, but for gaming this is great. My only negative is the only game I can play is Lego Lego but the controls work fine.  Style not so bad for an old guy: ix-5t-10c-wiimg-graphic-card-gfx-pc.html ix is a little on the old side, but overall he is a pretty good old man. I bought the ix5t thinking it would be a bit larger than the other ix's I have owned. It is the exact same size. The ix does have a bit more style then the other 2 I own but the size is the same. It would be perfect if it had a few more buttons or a few less buttons. I am sure this is due to the older design. -A great gamepad for the money: xt-5-10e-pcbook-graphics-card.html This is the cheapest gamepad I own and it is just amazing. This game pad is well made, with a really solid joystick. This was the first gamepad that I bought and it has been awesome. I was a little worried about the button layout, as it's not really a standard one, but its fine, I have no complaints about it. This controller is perfect for me as I do not use a keyboard or mouse, so the gamepad is perfect. Somewhat disappointing but not really the end of the world. I can't believe how inexpensive these are, especially for the price. I don't think I will ever use another of these.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I have had this mouse for about 2 months now. It has proven to be very reliable. The first day I used it I was in the middle of writing a large paper, and it seemed that the mouse was working flawlessly. The next day I started playing a game and I noticed that it was moving really fast. The following day I noticed the same thing. This mouse seems to have the ability to read my movements. The only problem I have encountered is that if I am running a game with a lot of movement, such as GTAV, the mouse can be difficult to use, but if I try to use it for gaming I get the same movement with my eyes closed. That is, there is no feedback from the mouse, so I cannot tell if I made a good move or not. I have also had a problem with a couple of my friends using it and not realizing that the buttons were depressed and the left mouse button is not depressed. I contacted Corsair and they sent me a new one and I have been playing with the old one ever since. If you want to purchase this product for your gaming needs, DO IT! I highly recommend this product.

I don't think I will buy the bigger one because it's just a little overpriced.  However, the mvpower has a lot more features than I expected, and it's very easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second time I bought this product, but the first time was a very good one. The design was very good and very durable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this product from a retailer and it arrived within 2 days and working perfectly. I purchased a replacement of a product from another company that worked properly, but I replaced it with the LG OLED TV and the unit is still working perfectly and not like it was on fire. The quality is really good.   If you have a LG TV and an LG OLED, you will be happy with the device. If you don't have a TV, you can buy this device as it works on pretty much any device.   be careful when opening the LG TV box because it has 2 screws that need to be unscrewed in order to remove the box from the back.   I don't know if the user manual has an update for this but the manual for this device states you need to use a special cable to connect it to the TV. But my TV doesn't come with a cable so I used my cable (it has a built-in 1.0 meter HDMI cable) that I got off of amazon for this purpose. It is also very easy to connect/disconnect the box with a special button on the back of the box.   with the box connected to the television, the picture looks amazing! The blacks are deep and not black and white like it does on most TVs. I am using this on a 1080p TV so it can show a bit better on a 480p TV than a standard TV. The colors and whites look great with the colors on my TV. I would highly recommend this TV for your HDTVs and most people with high resolution TV's are going to be happy here. If your TV doesn 't come with an HDMI cable, you could purchase the cable and connect it yourself to connect to your TV and save a lot of time, you would just need an HDMI extension cable, HDMI cable and HDMI cable holder.   The built- in stand on the TV is very nice and makes the screen very stable, I really like this. I haven 't tried the voice control feature, but there are settings available in the phone app to turn it on/off. It's also easy to use the phone control to adjust the brightness on the screen.   for those who want a lot better picture quality, I recommend the tv stand that LG sells.    Overall, the quality of this TV is great and it is easy to install and use, just buy the proper cables and you can enjoy this great tv.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this since September. No problem for me.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, June 06, 2009  Great purchase  by Andrew from Washington FL USA  Pros: Easy to use, does exactly what it says it will do.  is light weight. . Great price. , easy to change from DC to DIN cable. Cons: You have to insert a coin. It takes some getting used to.  the keypad on the back does not work on this radio.  a lot of people think that is a good thing because it does not take the keystroke to change frequencies. That is not the case. "The T.R.D.T.R."  "I bought a radio on a mission to find the location of a missing friend. I was told by the man in charge of that mission that I should be able to hear radio signals from them, especially as the friend's wife has a son named TJ and is on her husband's side of the mission. He also said I should not worry that I might miss something out on the mission." - J.T., on why he bought this radio, from his personal computer  Review of DJI Inspire 1 6 Channel Radio System:  My DJI Phantom has a 6 Channel Control Box and I wanted a more compact radio. It looks like the DJI Prodigy II is the radio to go with but this radio is much better than the Phantom in so many ways. The controls are on the front of the radio and look very nice, I am very happy to have an electronic radio in my Phantom.  in the 6 Channel control box is the same 6 Channel Controller and the radio is really easy to use and even has a USB port for power. The buttons are all small and easy to find, there are not a lot but you can get to them in less than 5 seconds if you know what you are doing. This radio comes with a 4.3 V lipo battery, the batteries charge fast. I have used this radio on my Phantom 2 Black Edition. With the Phantom 2 having a different firmware this radio works very well. I am a very experienced RC pilot and have used a number of different radios and this radio gives a really good range and has a good sound quality. I would highly recommend this radio!  Have not tried it with the Prodigy 2 or the Phantom
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this gadget for a while now, and its been rock solid and reliable. its got all the features and a price that dont break the bank, as well as a great battery life (5+ hours of battery life). i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great little toy.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works well with all types of sex toys I have this toy in different sizes and with all kinds of attachments that are compatible with it. The only problem I have had is with the attachments, some of them will not stay in place. For example the strap-on plug will fall out, but you have to manually release the attachment with the plug to get the plug back in. The other attachments stay in but you may not want to use them because you might get a leak. But that could easily be fixed. The battery is long lasting, and when it does get low, it charges very fast.  I do not recommend the water-based lubricant for it because it is very difficult to remove. You need to pull the lubricant out of the body part that you want to remove it from. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************ This is a really useful gadget. When I work at home I can't really hear what my co-workers are saying in the office so this can be a godsend. I use it when working from the bedroom and it doesn't make the room feel like I am wearing earplugs. I can hear my spouse and kids just fine and it makes my room feel more organized. I really wish the app was better. But it's great and I'm glad I bought it. (I don't work in an office environment). I don't think it's a good idea for those with noise sensitivities.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichigo-nagasawa This is my first android device and I must say I am very happy with the sound of my earphones. The noise isolation is very good and the battery lasts a good amount of time. I am not a fan of the usb cables that come with my earphone but i did it myself to reduce cable noise. Also the remote has excellent range with its own batteries.  Best headphones ever! I am one of the first users of these amazing headphones!

These headphones are by far the best I've ever heard. The bass and treble have very nice balance and depth to them and the soundstage is amazing.

I will be upgrading them in the near future to an upgraded version of the same. Definitely an amazing headphone. Highly recommend.  the best headphones I've owned These are amazing headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this item for over a month now and have had no problems. theres only been a few times i had a little trouble getting it to work and it wasnt the computer or power adapter i was using. i've tried 3 different brands of the same brand of power adapter (1 of which i only got 1 year ago. so its been awhile since i've done that) and it's still working well. for the price i paid this is definitely worth it. ive got a nice big computer that runs a good amount of games and theres really nothing i can complain about with this unit. the only negative i can see is that the cable that connects the usb to the usb is a little tight. i have tightened it up but not 100% perfect yet. the computer runs good and i use the usb in my PC every day. it also works with the computer from work but i only do this because theres always something to do. if i dont use it, then it cant be used so maybe thats why they dont make it longer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s. When I got this, it came with a new sim card, so I put my old sim card into this phone. I had to make a few changes to the sim card to get it to work. I changed the modem to the one from the iPhone 5 (which is a Tmobile model. I have had it for a couple of weeks). I got the phone and I installed a firmware update that was supposed to update the radio firmware. However, I did not update it. It still does not work. The problem is the SIM is not compatible with the phone. It takes a while to get a good signal. Once I get it working, I can not get the other phone to work with it. The SIM card is useless. I think they should replace it with the correct one, but it will cost about $35 or so. It does seem to be a quality phone. If I had a real android phone, I would not have this problem.  Rated 5 out of 5 by mr from Excellent handset for the price I've owned an old Samsung Galaxy S II for years now, but had to trade it in because the hardware was beginning to show wear. I wanted an Android device, so the G3 came out. I was amazed at how fast this phone performs and the ease of use. It has an amazing camera and the software has improved dramatically over the last year. The battery life has always been poor, but the new battery life was very satisfying. The price is very good too. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a simple, good performing device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for about a month now and i am happy with it, its very comfortable to use, its not loud and i dont have to turn it on if im at home, my only gripe is it doesnt come with a micro usb cable, i just use the usb cable from the watch and plug it into my computer, its better in that way.  i was very happy with this purchase. The device is exactly as described. You have to set it up right, but once you do it's perfect. , the battery life is excellent. I've been using it for over 10 hours and it hasn't had to be charged since the last time I used it.  of course the watch has to be set up correctly. You must have the app "IOS Watch" installed. You then will see the battery icon, tap on that and select your battery settings and use the watch as you normally would, but with a few adjustments. You will notice a battery percentage in the bottom right corner of the screen and in the main battery settings you can change the settings for how long your watch should be on. I have set it to 3 hours before charging it and I'm pretty sure the same setting will work for all the different models that come out. As far as charging it is pretty easy. In your watch app you go to the charging settings, you can add and remove devices as you see fit. If you do have an older watch you can't do much about that. Once you have that setup you just turn it to its charging mode and it should charge in about 1-2 hours. The last time i turned it on, I did get 2 notifications. One at 10 and the other at 4am. When I looked at the watch it had been charging for 5 hours. It also has an auto-sync feature that will automatically start up your watch to tell you the time for you when it gets close to when the time actually is, but this is not the most important feature. Once the time comes and it starts checking for the time, then you need to go into the app again to change the time manually. This is a very nice feature and will give you peace of mind knowing that it's always set properly. I would also like to add that this is one of the most comfortable watches i have ever owned. The watch bands are very nice quality and it fits perfectly into my wrist. It is very easy to set up and use

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a really good product that is easy to use, looks cool and feels good to use. I have a new camera and it is getting very dusty, and it's really taking up space and taking up my space. With the dust it has to clean, it's not like having it clean every couple of months, it has gotten a lot of dust, and this is not something that a camera can live without! I do have to take it out occasionally and get it clean because there's dust everywhere. I do recommend this product. Good product, but not a replacement for a regular printer:  I have bought the Epson Stylus Photo Color Inkjet printer several times over the years. The only thing that it does not have is the ability to print in full color. Since it's a digital printer it's also not very fast, especially in low light conditions. The print head does the best job of the three (a laser printer, inkjet printer and a copier) but the print speed, print quality and ink quality are still not that great. The last 3 times I purchased the Eppers I wanted to try out the inkjet inkjet, as it would be a good replacement for my regular inkjet. I did a test and it was much better. I'm going to give it a try. If you're looking for a full color printing system this isn't for you. It's also more expensive than other similar printers you can find online or in your local grocery store. I also found that the ink on this print head is not as thick as the other printers. I've bought the Inkjet ink from Kodak and the one that I used with this printer was a thin but very high quality ink. This Epson printer I bought does not even have ink, and I don't want to spend the money for the other inkjet printers that do. I would definitely go with an inkjet if you don't have any other printer you like. You can find inkjet cartridges on eBay for about $8 a piece (this was about 5 years ago and the prices on eBay have gone down quite a bit). I bought two 3.5" cartridges and I am expecting to get about 8 inches worth of ink.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am happy with this product, I don't want to say it is the best, because I love many of the other high-end gear I have owned, but this does the job for me. I am able to hear music through the computer screen, which is quite nice. The bass is not as loud as a computer audio system or headphones with a good subwoofer, but the sound quality is acceptable. I also get a nice sense of distance through the speakers, which I do not get with a lot of computer audio systems I have tried. I like the idea of having a stereo set-up, but in this case I prefer to play music through my computer. I don`t know if it is a better use for my $1,199 than using the computer sound card.

This item is as described. It works as advertised. It does have one drawback though. It can't run off of batteries for charging, as it requires an AC power source. This means you have to have an AC adapter.  If you're in a situation where you don't have an outlet nearby, then you could look into getting an external power source for this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the gps for more than a month now and it works like a charm and for the price imo is a steal ive been using it for business and its great. ive used it for hunting for my dog and even when its on the road its still accurate and the battery is a little bigger so its more reliable.    A good GPS is worth its weight in gold.  A GPS has saved my life many times. I had no idea that there could be so many things that could go wrong. Well, it does. I've had the GPS since 2011 and it's still working strong. My GPS is on an old cell phone that my brother has. It works great on the old phone but not on the new one. My wife and I have an old car with an IMSI (International Mobile Station Equipment) that was installed with a GPS. One of the things that caused the IMS IMS is that the battery life was not good. So when it's dead, so is my GPS. And I had to purchase the GPS from another site because they could not fix it. So I tried the GPS. It took me some time to find the fix but it worked perfectly. So yes, a GPS has its problems. I do have two GPS receivers and a GPS receiver, the only difference between them is the antenna. The GPS that i have is not from the old cell phones and I use it only in the car. I find it works great and does what it is supposed to do. I just wish the batteries were a little better. They will last the whole trip.  .  This is the first time i ever purchased a gps, but I'm very satisfied so far. First of all it is very user friendly. I only had to find a small problem to fix and it was solved right away. Second it is so easy to program to my GPS mode. It is a good GPS in my opinion. It's accurate and very reliable. Finally it is a great price. ,  If I could give it 5 stars, it would. It has worked extremely well over the last 3 years. It never missed a turn and was easy to use and install. The directions were very clear and I got everything up and running in no time.  was easy installation, the batteries are not nearly as long lasting as i would like, however the accuracy and direction of travel was always good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price I've been a huge fan of the FiiO E5 and the new FiiOs. It is a wonderful portable unit. It's the perfect sound reproduction system for your iPod or other portable music player. The Fii-E5 is an amazing addition to any musical performer's toolkit.  I'm not even sure what to do with it. _____________________________________________ For more info:    Fiio E5 website Fiiolio E5 -   Fiioboard.net   Fiio e5 is the best portable speaker available on the market today, in the same class with the Yamaha CS-70 and the Fane R-30 I bought my first Fiion E5 when I was 16, just for portable music use.   When I was younger I used to have a lot of portable stereos and these are the last portable units I will ever use, and I'm just that type of person who loves music on their way to the train, in my car or wherever.  The E5's sound is fantastic and the price is awesome.  I bought mine new a couple of years ago and never looked back.  For a portable system they are a lot more powerful and the quality is superb.  A very simple design with an amazing sound system.  Thanks Fiiome.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "The Epson Stylus Pro 8-5 is a beautiful, compact, reliable, and useful digital imaging device. I used to own an Epson scanner but have since been converted to digital photography (Epson Stilson) and have found the Epson to be my favorite digital camera. The Styli is the only digital camera I have owned with an internal battery which is nice as most digital cameras have a built in rechargeable battery (like the Sony A900) or a battery pack (like Canon's DSLR's and the EOS 7D). If the E.S.P. 8-4 or 8-2 is cheaper than the Stylis, I would definitely buy the E-P. It is the perfect size for my small desktop and I can use it with my Canon or Nikon DSLRs as well."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! My iPhone 6+ is great!! The battery life is great, the phone is great in my pocket, the screen is very sharp, the camera is amazing, the battery life....it's like they built it to last!!!!  What do you expect for a cheap phone:!!!!!! I bought this phone because it was advertised as being "low cost." When I received it, I thought this was a joke! It cost $99 and is only worth $9. You have to charge it every month, so it will last you the whole year...and that's for the 16gb model. Don't be fooled by the cheap price and the nice design, this is not a quality device.  My opinion:......................................... As someone who uses a Nokia 930 I can't imagine the Lumia 1020 doing that good of a job. My phone is in the exact same condition as it was when I received the 930. That's not an exaggeration. My battery is dead, the volume controls don't work, the charger doesn't fit, and the case is old.   If you are buying this phone, you might as well pay $100, get a new one, and buy that extra memory card. If you buy the $99 version then you're in for a disappointment.  ,  -Mike, San Diego, California, USA   Lasts about two weeks, is easy to take off and on, and is pretty good in daylight  Why I decided to give this a four-star review:.......................... So far the battery works like a charm. The device works perfectly as a phone, and works well as a tablet. You can hold it in one hand, and with the other hand type on a website while walking around. It is light and slim. The camera is good, and has a nice quality of photography. The front facing camera is not really good, but the front facing video is great. The microphone works perfectly. It's a great phone and the price is right. The only downside is that I don't like the battery. I can get about two days out of it. I keep it in the bag all the time so I don´t have to worry about using it.   with all that said I still think that the price will be a problem, but I would like to see the battery last longer. ...,,,....., I bought

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been playing this for a few days now and I like it better than my old mp3 player. It plays all kinds of music and the quality is great. Its only thing is that the power adapter doesnt plug in very good. It was a lot of fun to play the music on it. I was looking at different mp3 players when i saw this one but i got a deal on it and i think i like it more because it has more features than my last mp3.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  This is my 2nd Rode VideoMic, which I purchased from Red Owl. I really like it. It has a good and crisp sound quality, and is a nice size for my laptop. I have it installed at my desktop, and it works great. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that it is not a "professional" audio device. It's basically just a little mixer that's connected to your computer. If you want the professional sound quality and features, I would get one of the expensive ones. But I can still do a lot of things with it, like recording podcasts on my computer, toggling the speaker on and off, etc. (And the RodeVideoMic is the same as the one on the Apple Macbook Air. So that's a huge plus! ) I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one for the kids, so they can use the same one for both.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  For the past ten years I've used many electronic devices, from a radio to a computer. I've had two units in the last seven years: The Sony MP-CD1 and the MP-RX10, both of which are very good devices. In fact, I haven't found a better unit I own and I use the MP2, the MP3, the iPod, the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S. Last month I bought the Sony RX10. It has replaced my MP-10, which I have had for ten years. The RX10 is also a very good unit. The only thing is, there is a delay when the disc is inserted in the player. That's a small inconvenience, but I find it difficult to wait when I've got to go to the store and pick up more products.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using this for about three years and it has been excellent. There are some issues. First, it has no speaker. This can be solved by purchasing the 3.5mm plug adapter, which connects the audio out to the front. The cable itself is very inexpensive (under $2) and I don't have to worry about the microphone being picked up by others. Second, it can be very noisy, especially when listening to music, and the volume adjustment on the top is not perfect. However, I use it in my bedroom and it doesn't bother me. Last, but not least, the screen goes black and freezes frequently, and it is very difficult to see the number 1 and 2. I have had two devices that had the same problem. In my opinion, this is due to the fact that the internal components in the device are very low-quality. The LCD screen is the best part of this device. I was looking for a high quality, inexpensive computer screen that would last a very long time. I am very satisfied with this purchase!

I have also recorded several albums from the cassette deck, and they have sound so much more clear than any of the recordings from my cassette deck.  to date I have found that my old tapes are much better recorded in this new system.  as for the money, I am very pleased, I can carry my old record players with me while I travel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!  I bought this thing in a hurry on the advice of my friend who knows more about electronics than I do. I needed a simple way to charge the device without having to hook it up to a computer or any power source. I also didn't want it to be a thing that I had to have plugged in to charge at all times. The thing does exactly that! I have to say though, I really wish I had gotten one of those 5800mah ones instead. Not only does it charge faster, it lasts a lot longer as well. I use it every day when I need a little more juice.  Excellent for a good price!  My boyfriend and I have been using the e-cigarette for about a month now. He gets up to 200 a day, and my use has been around 70. We are both satisfied!   We have both got 2, and use the battery life a lot!   the e cig is very sleek, simple and easy to use. I recommend getting the battery case! It helps keep it in place. The device works great, and it is so inexpensive. We do not think there is a better battery for the price  Very good price  of this. It is a great product.  a must have  Its cheap, good quality, works well, and fits in my pocket. The only problem is you have to remember to charge it or you may find your battery is low, but its not that big a deal  Just what I wanted  This was perfect. I've been using it for about 6 months now and I like it so much that I ordered another.  the battery lasts longer than the one that came with it and it comes with a nice carry pouch, also, the battery is in the box so i have a great feeling about my purchase. I have ordered several from this site and i will not buy anything else.  is it bad that i do not like the taste or smell of the one i bought? because this one does taste better. the first one i ordered is not good at all. i am using this one more and more.  and yes, I recommend to all who like e cigs and like the flavor of tobacco.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!! I use it to record all the hours I spend in front of the computer. It is perfect for my needs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love my new mp3 player! I bought the mp3 mp5, so that I can stream my mp3 and mp4 files from my computer to my mpd player. I love this device so much. The mp3 format is very easy to work with, and it is very quiet so that the computer doesn't have to be loud. I also find the mp4 format to be a little more complex to work on, and find it a bit noisy compared to mp3, however, mp4 also seems to be fairly stable. The mpc is really a great player for the money. I can always use it, even if I have to replace it. The only down side to this device is that the usb port does not support micro sd. In the future I would recommend purchasing the sd card and a sd adapter. I have found that this device does support micro SD card, but it seems to take up too much space on the computer so that it can't be used for recording music. However, I find that the mpd works really well with micro SD cards so that is not an issue.  Love it! So this is my third one. One is very new, and the second I bought new. I find this device to be very easy and reliable.  with the new one, I also get better sound quality from it, but that is only because it is a newer version of the device. - Love it!

My DJ setup had gotten a bit out of control and I needed a little help with it. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on software when all I needed was a simple setup program that would help me get it where I wanted it.   to get started on the set-up, there are lots of things that I would have preferred to be able to change. For instance, I liked the ability to cut, crossfade, and mix all in one part of the mixer. Also, I found it odd that you cannot go through a set of loops, just play all tracks at once (or at least, I did).   After finding this site I am so glad I did. It is a good piece of software that really does a great job of giving you all the information you need. I have used DJ Tech tools on two different systems so far and have had zero problems. I would recommend this software to anyone looking for a DJ software or a DJ console setup. - December 13. 2007I was pretty happy to have this site - December 12, 2007I really like it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I received this from my friend for Christmas and it's just awesome.  It's a great, easy to use product, not a big hassle to set up, and its amazing how fast my phone has gotten.    I do wish I was able to buy this item from the app store.  This is a great item for anyone.  The price is good and if you can find the app for it, its great!  It's not an app for the device itself but if you are not a good enough programmer to create it and it doesn't work, there's not much you can do, but it will work for some people.  I had to do some tinkering to get the device to work.  You just need to plug it into an outlet and a battery and turn it on, then plug it back into the outlet.  It will also be hard to install but if the battery runs out or you have a power supply handy, it can be installed in minutes.  If you have no power, you can always power it off and have it restart itself if the device is not in use.  A lot of people may not like the idea of an app, but the device I received was working like new and I think it's great for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I've been playing my Sennheiser HD650 for several years, and it's a great piece of equipment. I've had it for about four years now and it hasn't failed me once. I'm happy with it. I have it with the iPhone 5S. The noise canceling is very nice, and I've never had any problems with sound. I like to listen to my own music and podcasts on it. The volume is just right. The ear cups have an air gap, so I put some music on there and it fits fine. I find myself reaching up and using the headset to touch things in the background when I'm in a meeting, and the noise cancelling is nice to have.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, August 18, 2015  Excellent  by A Customer from New York, NY USA  Review: I'm a headphone guy, and this is my second. I use it with a MacBook Air and my iPhone and iPad. Very nice.  the sound is nice, I can really hear music. I had to do some digging to find this product and I do believe the reviews here are true, it is good  Good Product  By A Customer  Pros: This is a great product for a very reasonable price. /r/HeadphoneReviews  Cons: None  2 of 2 customers found this Review helpful Great sound  Sound quality: 5/5  Build quality: 4/5   Is this review helpful? Yes  Great Product, easy to use  Audioengine, just started using the HD650's  We are in the process of building our first home studio and needed some great headphones that would handle high fidelity audio with ease. We came across the Audioengine HD650 and decided to give them a try. At $89.99 we were extremely happy with the quality and fit of the headphone and felt that we could easily replace them as we move along.   We have used them over the past couple months and have never been let down. This product does what it says. There is very little distortion and the sound quality is just great. I feel like the ear pads are not too thick, but enough to keep the headphones comfortable. I do feel like some people have had issues with the ear cup being a little loose around the ear so i suggest that everyone take some extra care when using

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive just bought this i7 and i can confirm it is awesome! i have a gtx 570 but was wondering if the performance of the 6 gb of ram was the same, well i think so! it ran at over 55 mhz on the game at 4k! the cpu is very good so far too! and it seems to be faster than the gtx 560 ti i got a few months ago!  I just got mine tonight for my birthday so will keep you updated! .  Review by Dan | (Posted on 2/12/2016)  This is the second pc I've purchased for my daughter and this is the first time I've been satisfied with a purchase on the pc store.   The computer itself is very well built. It was built to last. It seems to have better cooling then the 970 i've been using. The SSD I am running on it is fast and can read the games i want to. There's some things to watch out for, but other than that it is a very good value. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good gaming pc!  of course this is just an opinion so buy one that suits your needs and style. but for a decent price this is pretty good, especially when you get to be old enough for it.  .  and finally, for the people who like the way I do this: I don't mind the fan noise, in fact i enjoy it. My girlfriend is used to it but I'm pretty happy with how it sounds.  The only thing i don't like is that my mother doesn't like it! she gets upset when it starts to fan. I would have thought that since it's a low noise product this should make up for it by the power of having a small fan. I bought this computer in mid November, had a very easy time getting it up and running and it works great with all my games (except Overwatch and CSGO). I have the Intel SSD 240 G4 and I have been very pleased. This is my first PC and I'm very happy with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fan is loud, but when I turn off the computer and leave it on the fan turns on, then the fan goes away. But that is a minor annoyance! Overall this is a great product.  of the best for the price  by Mike | ( Posted on 2 March 2016 )

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I bought this to replace my old desktop computer because I have a slow hard drive. I really didn't need that much speed, but I also didn't want to spend $1000 on another computer, so I thought the computer I had would do just fine. The only complaint I have is that the USB ports are very small and very difficult to get to the PC. The cable I purchased with it had a little plastic bag to protect it, but that didn't work very well. Other than that, I've had no trouble with this computer. It is fast, very quiet, and does what I need it to do. The keyboard is small, but it is well made. If you are planning to use this computer in conjunction with a monitor, get the 2.0 version, not the older version. Otherwise, it will work well. I can see myself using this computer for a lot of things.  Rated 4 out of 5 by joseph from Solid product. The machine has a good price point and I like the design. The mouse has a long cord which is very easy to get around to use. If I had to change anything it would be to have the USB port on the back so the mouse would not be so much of a hassle to use but at the same time I feel this is a good feature because I tend to use a mouse anyway so it's not that big of a deal. I have had no problems with the software and I love that you have a little tab to save your settings. "You won't be disappointed. This is a very good, quiet, quiet system. I will definitely purchase from B&H again. And for a less expensive model I would recommend the Gateway e1000e too. 'system runs very quietly, and is very stable. There are plenty of ports and connections, it has a USB port that is handy for plugging in the keyboard and mouse, it also has two USB ports for the hard drive and optical drive. It has four USB ports and a PS/2 port. There is an audio jack on the top for a headset or external speaker, and the built-in speakers and microphone are a huge plus. The system has the ability to run off the built in USB hard drive, or use a second drive with USB-C connectivity. The computer can also accept an external monitor via HDMI. The entire system feels sturdy and it is extremely light, about 2 pounds when closed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!! This is a great piece of kit. It works perfectly and has a range of operation from very simple to very complicated, if it is not connected to the mains it also has power and its very powerful and powerful in use. I have used my unit at work, at home and on the road and it is all working as intended and the only problem I have found is the fact that if you need to use a mobile phone the unit can only connect to the car charger or car dock. This can be annoying when you need the radio to do a call. It will also switch on if the car is started. But for a £65 unit thats good for an everyday device. If I could rate this higher I would but for me its a nice little piece of work.  Rated 4 out of 5 by DaveG from The radio is a decent and good radio. However the problem is its size I own a smaller portable radio with a cord and the one from Rhapsody was a lot smaller and easier to use. You would be hard pressed to find a more compact radio. I use this in a studio so it was handy to have a portable radio.  and good design.

You need to make sure you put it in a safe place where it cannot be accidentally turned on when not in use but the fact that it does not automatically turn on when the unit is closed is a plus. I do wish it came with a small case so I could have it ready for travel or stored on my desk. But for the price, it is a pretty good tool. I will definitely purchase this again and recommend it to other people.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:................................................... I bought this as my primary headphone headphone because it had a headphone output, good quality in sound and a decent mic. I bought the 3.5mm version because it worked with my old iPhone and its smaller headphone jack size was convenient. Unfortunately I never have any luck with the mic (I use it as my main headset) so I have had to get the 4.3mm version for the past year. But the 3m version does a great job and it has a nice mic, but not so good for the quality of sound I hear. I have not been able to get it to work with the iPhone 4 and I've been unable to get any 3m headphone for it to use. I am disappointed because this is a good headphone with a good mic. So I bought an iPhone 5 for my iPad and I am happy with it. I will be buying another 3.3 because it was so much better than the old 3m.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i got it yesterday and i have been testing it since then. First it worked. it would make a sound and the volume knob would turn from 1 to 10. The sound was perfect. then a few days later when i was testing it i was having to use the volume control a lot because the button would just go off. this is the most annoying thing with this headphone. i used to play with my old headphones with a volume knob and the button and it was just fine.   this is my first time using an electronic device and it is a great little headphone!  I can't wait to get a better set of headphones!!  If you are on the fence, buy it.  - Brian K.  on November 21, 2013 I really love this headphone, the best I've found yet. I got it last night and I used it the entire day, it's great. I'm a newbie to this but I like the volume and clarity it gives. The one downside to this headphone is that they only come with the 2.0 ohm version. I am sure that they will be upgrading to the 4.0 and will be replacing them all with these.  the reason i give it 4 stars is because it takes a while to get used to the sound of this device. I find the sound is a little dull. I have not been able to hear the highs very well. I get a little of a bass buzz and the mids are a little muffled. the highs are great. it's a pretty cool little device. i think it will fit all ears and i am very pleased with my purchase. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- This is by far the best little amp I've used. I was very surprised when I received this unit, as it was so new and not even a full week old. I've been trying to upgrade my amp for quite some time, but nothing ever worked. After about a year or so of trying, my amp finally broke. I knew it was time to upgrade, so I bought a $60 unit and I am very happy with it. It's so much better than my previous one, it runs very cool, plays music very well. I'm very impressed! Would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a cheap amp with great sound quality. It also is fairly inexpensive so you can't go wrong.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit came to me at the end of my 6 month warranty period. So, I had to return it after about 1 month because the screen would not turn off. The problem had nothing to do with the screen not turning off (which is what most reviewers state) but was the power supply. The power supply unit itself is very well made. It is rated for 25 amps of power and would be good for any electronic device. However, when I put a 5Vdc 12vDC battery in it and then put a DC5Vdc battery into the unit I found that when the power is switched from battery A to battery B the screen goes off. I also noticed that when I change the power in the power unit (the 3 prongs) it is not always the same polarity.   It is the same problem for me with any other power supply that does not seem to want to work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought the Kobo Aura One for a small project and it worked great. I was able to set a reading point in under two minutes with no need to check the battery at all. There are a few things that could be improved: 1. It doesn't support anything beyond EPUB (it is designed for ebooks, not for any other format). I tried to do some ebooks on it and it would not load them, even if I loaded them onto an external USB device. This means that there are no ebooks available for the KG. I will be returning the KGB to Amazon as it just did not work for me. 2. The KG has a very short battery life. It was about 12 hours before I needed to recharge it with a USB cable. I would like to see an option to have it auto-recharge while reading, but that would need to be programmed into the system. I can imagine that this might not be an option for many people due to time restraints. I have been reading in my car for 15 minutes every hour for the last couple of weeks and it still lasts. 3. The touch screen would be great if it were more responsive. When you have a laptop screen, there is some amount of lag when you press the screen. It is not a huge issue with this device, but it is noticeable when you are trying to read for a long period of time. 4. There were a few times where I was trying to copy an e-book and there was no way to get it back, even though it was saved to my library. I had to resort to the back button to get to the document and copy it again. This may just be the case with my device. Other than these few things, I would recommend this device to anyone who is looking to have a small device that is able to hold their e-books and other reading material.

There is no internet connection on it and the range for the remote does not extend far (about a foot). I can have it at about 50ft from me. The phone app is great however!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first Philips Hue lightbulb, which was the best purchase I have ever made. I would recommend this product to anyone.  How do you pay for a new bulb?  I ordered 2 Hue lights for the living room but will likely get 3 more for the bedroom. I am using it on the upstairs. We are using it already. . The battery life is amazing.   My only complaint, and it is minor, is that we are using the 2 "Hue" bulbs in the same room in the kitchen. They do not look great together. One bulb is too bright and the other bulb is dimmer. I did have a hard time finding a matching "HUE" bulb for the kitchen area (there is one in the living area). Maybe we can use them side by side in the bedroom area?   We did find a matching Philips Hue bulb in our living room area, however it looks like it is not working well. It turns on with the light out, the bulbs don't turn on when I turn the switch on, the color is off, and the brightness is off. It is not really noticeable in the room because I have the lights turned off most of the time, but the problem still exists.  . So I guess I'll keep the 2 in our bedroom and wait for the bulb in the Kitchen. , I ordered 2. I will probably get 3.  of 3 customers found this review helpful

The product is a little big, but it works well and is very reliable. We have no need for a radio at home, as we are at the beach all the time. We can send texts and emails to our family all at the same time. This radio works great. We look forward to using it again.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from I've had this product for about 6 months now and... I've got this device for about six months now. I've received it in a couple of different colors, and I've been using it extensively as my primary cell phone. It's always worked fine, except for the times where the Bluetooth signal is bad, but I've always been able to pair the radio with my phone. Last week, the Bluetooth connection was terrible, and the phone would disconnect from the radio. It would still recognize it as paired, but wouldn't recognize that I had a signal and would eventually switch to the cell network. This was going on for 5-10 minutes, and after a few times of it happening, I realized that my phone was having a hard time trying to connect to the radio because of the Bluetooth. After a few minutes of messing around, it came back to me that my Bluetooth connection had actually been lost. I didn't need a cell signal to talk to the phone, so it doesn't matter that the Bluetooth connections were lost, it's a major pain to have a phone that won't pair with the radio after a while. If this problem was only with the Bluetooth, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, as it's not as good as my previous cell phones. . , and for the price you can't beat it. But, you can make it work. I used this radio to call my mom at work, and when I put the phone on the radio, it connected to my daughter's cell phone and we were talking to each other, but the calls didn't connect. I tried to call her again, and still the calls wouldn't connect to my cell phone at all. Then I tried the same thing with my daughter, and that worked fine. The problem was in my wife's cell, and my daughter was able to get through and make a call. It may not be perfect, but for the money, this is great. Just remember, you've got

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first USB Audio Cable I bought, but the sound quality from the cable, and the speed of its connection made it my go-to setup. I use it with my Tascam DA-20, but I also use it between my Yamaha ES-8s and the Zoom H6 to add bass. For my sound I like the volume on the Zoom, and I really like the extra gain on the Tascams. I like being able to change between two sets of cables with ease, and being able adjust between different input/output configurations, including phantom power for the Zoom. It was an absolute joy to be able to have a cable that I could use for a long time and still have a sound that I like and trust. Rated 4 out of 5 by Jim H from The sound is so good with my PZM. It's just a matter of getting the connection right  Rated 3 out of 05 by ken from I have two pairs and one is not plugged into the USB bus, so I don't know if... I havetwo pairs and two are not plugged in to the USBbus so I can't test them. I'm using them for a stereo amp, which is fine. I might add that they both come with some useful info. One has some information about the amp's voltage input and outputs, which should be handy for someone who doesn't know what they're doing with amp wiring.  Good Value I bought this for a desktop setup for my TASCAM DA-40, and it works pretty well. I was skeptical because it didn't cost nearly what I was expecting, but after plugging it in and connecting everything I had some really high quality sounds, which was great. It is a bit on the thin side, and so should be worn while you're playing - it's not a bad sounding cable though.  the USB connector is a little flimsy, not much protection, it's a very poor quality and doesn't sound that great, but if you don't care about the quality of the USB sound you can buy something better with the same or a better price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is an excellent unit with some serious limitations and a little confusion. The good: It's easy to use (if you have the right cables), easy to mount, fits on a bike rack or inside a trailer, does the job, works as advertised. It has excellent reviews on many websites and it comes in the price range of a $200 camera. The bad: You have to keep changing batteries which is annoying and expensive. The only downside was the camera battery died and that's a bummer. Also the image quality suffers and the image stabilization is crap. I'm not giving it 5 stars because there are flaws here and there, but this is a good camera with great image quality. If you are looking for a good high resolution camera with a tripod mount, a good mount for a camcorder, cheap, and a bit more than most cameras have, this is the camera.

Review of DJI D3300W (Unrated) by j. j.   the radio is great but you have to use a small battery for it to get a good signal ( I use a 5200 mAh battery) but it is a really nice radio and good enough to run in a field in the wind. .  with the d3300w, a 2 cell battery can last about 2 hours with medium use, but with a 3 cell battery, it can last 2 hours on medium use.  that is why I like it so much

The one thing I found on the first try was that it was a bit loud. It's not a bad thing for an 8" monitor, but still annoying. I'm sure if the noise were reduced to a more acceptable level, I would like it more. I will be returning this unit in a few days. But overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase.  More Information:  It is a 8-inch screen that can show video and photos. It has a built-in CD-ROM. This is an A/V/DVD/Blu-ray player and has built in CD-RW. It supports MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC, and AAC audio formats. I have an A7RII and was looking for something like this to replace it. It was a little tricky getting the cable connected to the unit but once it was, I could play a song or two right out of the box. The CD is the only thing that does not have the same quality as my Sony CDX-800 that I have. I would have liked to see the buttons and audio options that were on the CDX, but that is just personal preference.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the nicest and best unit I have ever owned. The quality and value far exceeded my expectations. It came with a nice USB cable and a nice charger to go with it. The price is excellent. I have had it for several months now. Great job! I will be using it for a long time!  I bought this unit as a way to keep up with my friends playing and I have to say this is a GREAT value and I can't wait to buy another one. The sound quality is amazing. I love that I can connect my iphone or ipad with the unit and it is super easy to connect. This is my new favorite unit for my gaming needs and for just getting an ipad I don't have to worry about a new ipad. You will not be disappointed at all.  The unit arrived on time and I was very pleased. Sound quality is great. Great looking unit. The only negative I have is the battery charge and recharge time is long. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Good product. Worked for my need. No problems Review of DJ-PAD Series Electronic Drum Pad:  I have been playing the DJ-Pad Series Electronic Drums since the 80's and this particular model is my favorite, it is a bit smaller than the regular version but that is a nice upgrade and I like the fact that it has two mics, so you can have a double band (or a single drummer) for drum solos. I also have a set of the new ones from Sound City and this one is much better then the old ones. I was using the old version for a while, but I always felt like there was something missing from them. So I finally found a company that had gotten around to doing a good job with the newer version and it is very well made, not flimsy. I would recommend this product and they are a well known company A review from a reviewer who plays on a D-Pad (not a DMC-12):    I love the drum pads. I use them on my Yamaha M2R, they are good quality and work great. Review from an ex-DJ, who also plays on some vintage drums (in this video):    It is a really good product. The main problem I found was that the drum head has a tendency to fall out of the drum and onto the deck when a bit of pressure is put on it. I have put some tape over the opening in the drum. It works great. I think the new version has a little better quality. It is also very easy to set up, so no hassle at all. You just place the drum on top of the module, connect the pads to the drum, and press the pad buttons on the module (this takes about 10 seconds) and off you go. The pad does not need to be touched or moved at all until you begin playing, so it's a nice feature. It has 2 mics and 1 cymbal which are soooo much better than the old one. If you are thinking about this product, I recommend this one. I love this product. The new version of the D-pad, with 2 mikes and 1 snare drum!  D-pad (no mics) (no video, I used a mic to do the recording):  The new D-pads have 2 mike/cable connections and the drum only has one. This is
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought this to replace my old CRT TV because it is old and was in such bad shape. This thing is very bright, it seems like the colors are brighter (in comparison to my old tv) it seems to do better with different content but not great. I was pleasantly surprised that the image is great with the colors. The sound is good. The control buttons and the volume are very well done. The only thing is that it is slow. The picture and sound takes a long time to come up. I'm used to the fast tv, but this thing is slow! If you have an older tv and need something new, this is a great deal!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************************** I had this on my first ever purchase. It came in a short time and I plugged it in and put it in the dock on my desk. Within the first couple of minutes I was surprised with the volume. The only thing that I could say was a little weird is that the speakers are only about 4 inches away from the screen. That's the only complaint that I have. I would buy it again if I needed something similar. The display looks very good. ***************************** I have been looking for a good remote control for a long time. I have seen all kinds of them and just never wanted one. I finally decided to purchase one. It does what it was designed to do. The sound is good and the volume is nice. It has a good amount of volume and it is easy to use with one hand. It also connects to my iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch without using the cable that comes with it. It is not heavy but it is sturdy and the buttons work well. I wish the remote had a little more of a "click" on the buttons. This would make it more user friendly. All in all it is a great product. It did not have the best battery life. The battery will last about one day at full volume with a full charge but it will only last about two hours with the display on.

It is a pretty nice speaker and she likes it. She is the one that decided to buy it.  The quality of the product is great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A must have for your audio equipment. The Sennheiser USB mic is so well built it almost feels like it is made out of ceramic. The quality of the mic is second to none. When listening to a mix with my headphones, the mic always seems to be positioned in the correct place to capture the best sound. The only negative I have about this mic is the size. I am about 5'8" so I find it a little bit large in the front of my face. The front end of the mics are also somewhat wide and I am left with a slightly large soundhole in the back of my head. I prefer to use a more conventional headphone mic. I don't have a problem with this mic and will continue to use it in my studio. If it were any smaller, it would be perfect. I definitely recommend it!Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought two of these devices (one was new and one was used) and i have to say im so impressed with these products, the speed is perfect for me, they look awesome, and the sound is great!! i have yet to use the battery but so far the only thing that i have not liked is the fact that these werent waterproof,i mean they are so light that they dont get wet after a few hours of running, however i am very sure that the device will keep them looking nice until i decide to get them watertight, and i dont know how long the battery life is because i was running a few miles a day before i took them for a bath. (i love my new headphones but they have not been watertight yet) but i am sure they will hold up just fine and i will keep these for my son's future and he will love them!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had used an Icom IC-703 for years, but it was really expensive, so I was looking for something I could pick up at the store and then go home and have.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I am in the process of building my own home automation system with various connected devices (WiFi-connected lights, etc.). This led me to this product because it had an HDMI output so I could stream the video output through my computer. The price is very reasonable compared to similar products. The device itself is very easy to set up. My computer has no trouble working with it. The only con is that if you are in a hurry, this may not stream as well as other devices, but otherwise, for the price, it's a nice choice!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have this on a 5.1 surround speaker.  It is very clear and strong without being too heavy.  It is also very easy to use.  My only complaint is the sound is a little dull, and it might take some getting used to for a basshead.  The unit is a nice solid feeling unit, no vibration is noticeable.  I love this product and recommend it highly.

It's quiet enough to listen to a movie or listen to music on the go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "I have been using my iBox for a little over a year now, I love it, I get so much use out of it. When I first got it, the only thing I did different is I removed the case. I was hesitant to remove the case until I found out that the iBox was able to handle the temperature of my home without damage, as well as its ability to charge my phones and ipads with my computer. I bought this unit because I have to keep an eye on my iBook and iPad at the same time, but this unit is a dream come true. Also, the app is great. There are no other options for viewing a screen or using the screen other than having a desktop computer. So all the time, money, and the frustration that goes with finding a solution that works with this screen is worth it. All the reviews I read about this thing, have been spot on, I wish there were reviews I could share about other devices but there are none. The only negative that I could come up with is that I would have liked to have seen a larger screen or a stand, but I guess that would be a matter of personal taste and not something i would be willing to pay for."
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Very good sound quality and a good selection of songs (especially the newer ones) - also very affordable and good customer service. Have not tried this product but I am very interested to find out more about this product as I'm a big fan of the original. I don't really hear any distinct difference from an iPod but I have a more powerful system and I really like the iPod for its flexibility to my computer system. Also, it doesn't sound like a $200 CD player, and in terms of sound quality, it is as good as an audiophile system is at that price range. Has anyone tested this on the iPod Touch as well? It's just under the original that I got. Great product. Just as advertised. No complaints. This was a must-have item for my iPod. I purchased it after researching many different products, and I'm very pleased that I made the purchase. It is a great buy, and is even worth the purchase of a high-end CD player. Great value, well-made and the sound quality is just as advertised for the price. I highly recommend this product. Sound quality was excellent, not quite as deep, but the sound was clear and consistent. This was my first product from Music Man. I have owned CD players, MP3 players and now the iPod, and this is a perfect fit. Best iPod of the iPod line for the money. I am also a professional sound engineer who has used a lot of different CD players as well as a lot other hi-fi equipment. I bought this unit just for my own purposes but I find it very useful for the kind of music I listen to on a daily basis. It produces a sound that is not as loud, but it has better overall quality than most other iPods I've owned.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first iMac. I have had several Macs before but this was the first one that I purchased. It was a little slow when I first got it but that was not a problem, I upgraded to the latest version 2.3.3 on it. I use my Mac very frequently so I'm very familiar with the software that Apple includes, but it is nice that I have all of the ports that my other Macs have and that the wireless card is faster. For the price, I would have to give it a high five. You can not ask for much more than that.  Rated 4 out of 5 by mike from I am very pleased with my new iMac, this machine runs at 2.4GHz with 4GB RAM. My old Mac ran at 2GHz with 3GB RAM and ran fine. My new Mac runs at 3.1GHz with 7GB RAM, but the speed is not noticeable with my computer setup. This new i-Mac is as good or better than my old machine and for the money I paid for it I can't complain.  The only thing that I would not recommend is to use this Mac to surf the web on. The Web page will look very slow and sluggish. ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this to go with a wireless keyboard for use in my school. It is a very good keyboard, and has the ability to connect to a computer so I can do some online classes (e.g., econ, math, etc.). The key travel is good, I use it in both my laptop and desktop computer (my desktop computer is actually my computer). Also, there is an USB connection port, which is a good addition to my setup. But, the battery on this keyboard is terrible. At first I expected it to work about the same as a normal keyboard. But when I connected it to my laptop, it would not charge and it would be down to 25% of the battery by the end of the day. I tried it several times and it could only charge a small fraction of the time. I ended up having to give up and buy a standard keyboard. However, it is still a good keyboard and I will buy another one to have in my laptop.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little device is perfect for those times when you want the option of an external bluetooth speaker and don't have a good sound system in your car or house. The sound quality is superb and the unit can connect to most of the newer bluetooth devices including my ipod or ipod mini. The only complaint I have is the volume, it can be loud.   Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone looking to add a bluetooth speakers or sound system to their car.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used this for a long time now and I have never had any problems with it. I have found that you get the best performance from it if you use a good quality battery for it. In the past I used a cheap battery and the phone would work for about 3 days. However now it works the same as ever. I used to use Samsung's battery but the first time I used this one I noticed that the phone didn't have the volume keys working and the display would turn off and then back on. But now with this one the display turns off and the volume buttons work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first wireless bluetooth keyboard for me and it worked well from the very first time I turned it on. It did take about a day to install and setup on my computer, but after that everything worked fine. The sound is not the best but it's more than enough for any work that requires sound. It does have a button for volume but it takes some time to press the button on the keyboard for that. The wireless keyboard is just a bit too large for my small hand and that's why I think it might not work well with people who have larger hands. But for a small keyboard the price was great and I got it before the price went up.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this thing for a while now. it is a great device for keeping my mp3 collection organized. i have several other players in my room but this one works perfect for my music. very nice, and it is small! i plan to get two more when i see that the player isnt as easy to break as it should be. i am also going to get a couple of the wall adapters, as they are awesome for this device.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D.B. from Best MP3 player I have Ever owned I am a music producer. I have owned a lot of music players over the years. I was looking for an easy to use and affordable player to use for both the pro and amateur musicians out there. I used to be the type to put my mp2 player on a shelf with the other stuff. I love that I no longer have to deal with that and I have a single easy to access device to put any and all my music on. If I had to change one thing, it would be the design. I would love it if it came with the ability to adjust for the volume when you are using it to listen to music. The other little thing I would change, but it is so little, would be to be able to turn the power switch to turn it off and then on again. I use it so often and am so used to the constant on and off that it is kind of annoying when I have to turn off the device and then switch back on.

It plays mp3, wav and mpg files, I've never had an issue with the files being damaged or anything. I can listen to it for hours on end without any concern. The best part about this thing is that it's portable, it doesn't require any batteries.   a few things I would like to see implemented are a "hold to turn off" button on the device, a "record to sdcard" button and the ability to sync a file while in playback (ie. mp3 file with a different title).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to use with my cell phone because I have a cheap 3G/4G cell phone in my truck and I was having no signal there. I have the old iPod Classic that is no longer supported by my cell provider. I use it with my iPad. My iPad does not like this new iPod either. It has lots of problems with this new device. For example, if you have a song playing that's the song of the day, you can't change it. And sometimes when you're on the road and there is no signal or you just leave your car at a rest stop for 10 minutes, the device won't recognize you as the owner of the vehicle. But I bought it so that I could still use my old iPod. I really like it, but I don't want to be carrying around that old iPod anymore.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product has saved my life. I have been with my iPad and iPhone for about two years. I was just buying a brand new tablet for the iPad that would work well with the iPhone 4, but I was told that they did not have an App Store for the iPhone and I am having a hard time finding the App Store on my iPad. After trying the instructions on how to install the App, I installed it. It was a pretty easy process. I did have to search for the App on the App store, but it worked pretty quick and easy. I can't believe that I had to go out and purchase it again when I could have just downloaded it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good, affordable, and easy to install App for the iphone.

The sound is very good. The screen size is perfect for what I need for my work. And, it was very easy to get back up and running in the middle of a session.

Now, I use the laptop for the web browsing and writing. So far it works fine. I do not have much to say about the audio output, which is fine. It is definitely enough to hear when I use headphones. But, I do like the volume control to be at the top right of the unit. I have a small desktop and like the fact that I never have to look at it for volume. It also is very easy on the eyes. I also like the ability to use my laptop as a PC by using a USB connection. For $129 I think this is a good deal. I plan to purchase a second unit for my laptop. I am not sure if this is just me, or if this has happened to others, but the sound from the built in speaker on the unit does not come out on the speakers output on the Macbook/PC.

It is also quite light weight and easy to carry around and use. I can't recommend it enough!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   When it arrived, it was a really nice surprise. I got a Samsung device. It has some advantages over the other models that I've been using - such as the ability to play music and videos without the use of a computer, and having a removable battery. The only thing that I haven't really been able to get around the problems that my Samsung model has been having is the problems with the touchscreen, as it only functions when the screen is at maximum brightness. When it isn't, it is almost impossible to operate the device. The touch screen is pretty much useless, but the only way to use the device with the screen off is to use a micro USB cable to send power to it. The downside to this is that you are limited to using the touch screen when it is in maximum brightness (when the screen turns off it turns off the device completely). As well as the fact that you have to use this when it isn'  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with this keyboard. It was easy to set up and has a few improvements over the original keyboard that were easy to figure out. The mouse is a bit more sensitive and the function keys work very well. My only complaint is that I feel the bottom row would be improved with the additional key caps for F10-F12. Other than that this is a perfect solution to my needs.  Best cheap keyboard:   Bought this keyboard for the price and works great. I was also happy with the return policy and customer service. I was skeptical about this keyboard, but I am glad I went with this one. The switch is a lot quieter than the original one and there are some other improvements. I can't wait to upgrade from the original to the USB version as it was a great deal when I got it. -Dan  What a joy to use and feel:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------  I bought this unit because it had the ability to make music and it is very easy to use. It can turn off and back on, it is powerful and loud and works perfectly. I also bought a digital camera for a few dollars and I put the camera to use with this unit. I have only used it for a couple of hours but the camera and this unit have performed very well so far. I plan on buying another one for my children to use when they are older. I highly recommend this product.

There is no need for a receiver to be able to play sound. This unit has it's own sound system. It has three different sound modes. I am using my speakers and the radio. It is extremely easy to set up. It comes with a wireless microphone and a battery. I would recommend to anyone who loves to play music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a musician, you can't play without an analog sound. I'm a fan of the Digidesign M-Audio Fast Track. It's a pretty good, reliable and efficient interface. I use the line-in and headphones of the M-audio Fast Track all the time. I can play pretty much anything from my MacBook Pro with a pair of M- Audio headphones, and I don't need more than the headphone out of it. My only complaint is that if I disconnect the line in and headphones, I'll still hear my computer's sound, but there's no way to turn off the line out, which is not great.  As to what the best analog signal is, I don,t think it really matters. You can hear everything from a digital source. I do prefer to listen to a physical device. . , As a musician and musician's wife, I absolutely love this thing! It's just a beautiful and easy way to keep the music I play with my computer. I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the most versatile and useful camera I've used thus far in my life.   I love it and use it all the time!   Great feature of this camera is the ability to set the depth of field when you take a photo, or choose a shutter speed and focus and it's easy to adjust with a dial or button on the front of the camera. Great price and great service by your company!  Very happy with the camera!  it is a small camera, but it is great. You can set the f-stop. It is fast and very sensitive to shutter speed. The pictures are amazing. It was so easy to use. I love it.  I don't usually write reviews, but I just had to write one about this camera. First off I have never used one of these. I use it a lot to take pictures of the family and friends. I'm very happy with my purchase. The lens and camera are both very solid. The exposure is perfect and it records very clearly. I was skeptical, but for the price and quality of this I'm glad I picked this one up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first electronics purchase and my first experience with the new Apple line of equipment. My friend and I were so excited when we received our iMac. We immediately set it up, set it to our favorite applications and started using it. I had trouble getting it going when we got it up and running but once it was running it was really fast. I am very glad I did not go with the old model which did not come with all the accessories. It was an extra $100.00 that I was not going to purchase that I am so glad I bought this. I will be making more purchases in the future. Thank you I purchased this for my daughter to play with. It's the perfect size. It gives her a nice place to play around with it. She loves it and it's much less of a hassle to set up and use. The only thing I wish was better is the fact that you can't have it as low as she wants to play it low. I bought this for me. It is really nice for an electronic device. My mother in law has one and I've been looking to get one for a long time. Now that i have it I have no idea what to do with it lol. The only complaint is that the controls aren't the greatest. Like one of the buttons, on the bottom of it you have to press the button again to turn the feature on. This is not really a deal breaker, I'm sure Apple will fix this someday. Just bought my son a Mac Pro for Christmas, and have been looking everywhere on line for something that can be purchased as a complete package. This comes close to the Mac Pro i was looking for, but the iMac isn't as fast, it has less ports, and a lower res display. Also, as a pro this is the right one for me, because i need a Macbook Pro, that can handle many applications, including this. It runs great in my 3 year old MacbookPro, and for my other pro, iMac i am very happy with this purchase! I ordered this for a birthday gift. I've owned computers for 20 years. This computer is the best I've ever owned. Great job Apple. iMac G4 was the one for the iWork suite, but this iMac has all the features i need, and I'm glad I got it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The phone was a blessing. I had a couple of friends and myself with similar tastes as me, and wanted to get a cheap one that could do some of the things I needed with the few hours a day I had to spend on them.  The i-Phone was the obvious choice, but as it was the only one on sale, we all ended up purchasing it, and were pleasantly surprised.  a good price, a good screen size, the app works and it has a nice set of features for just £50 or so. And it works well, too.  at this price, no other phone really can match it for the price you pay and it's features.   A bit of a warning though. If your battery life gets too bad, just go and buy a different phone. That said, it was a great device to buy and even if it didn't work out for you, it did.  - David   On the way to the beach to write this review.... :-)   Have a great day. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item as I own another TFT TV. The screen quality is great, not as bright as the Sony, but still good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Pico is great, if you're looking for a portable gamepad for your PC with a lot of ports it works perfect. It's very compact, easy to use and I like the buttons for each button, one button is for light/dark and one for the power switch. You can even connect the controllers in series to use both the light and the dark button.   What i find most annoying about it is that it doesn't have an external battery so you have to be careful when putting the battery into the device, it doesn`t plug in straight to the PC, it's a tad bit fiddly and not easy to get it into the holes in the back of the device.   and when it's plugged into the USB port the usb port gets very hot, so you may have to turn it to a higher speed if you want it to last longer. But its pretty cool for the price, even though the buttons are very tiny and you can't feel them, if I could change it it would have been to have the ability to change the buttons in a game so you could play games that require light/heavy, just because you`d want a better control feel.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I recently bought the s5, and I love it. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and it is super fast. The s5 has an sd card slot that I like to use to store some music. The video streaming capabilities and the camera are awesome. I am very impressed. You can add on a smart phone or a lte phone to the s-5 and stream music from your phone to it. This is great for when I am on a road trip and I dont want to carry my laptop. The battery life is amazing, even with my phone and the s1. I do wish that it came with a charger and a micro usb port, but it's not a big deal. I've never been so happy to get a new phone. I recommend this to everyone I know. I like the s3, but the s2 is a better phone.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It's so good, you cant even imagine. Thank you for making this, I am so happy!  Good but not great  by: A.G. I'm not an old guy, and I'm a college student. For me, the first problem is that it's so heavy. This is my second iStick with the same problem, it's not exactly good for it. Now you might ask how the size is so big. The answer is simple: to avoid having to look around so much and try to find something, that is bigger. My second problem is when you go to charge, the button stays pressed. I can't find a solution for that, it seems to happen every time I try. I will send it back and try the new one, that will be nice. If you have an answer for those two problems, let me know.  The ultimate e-cigs accessory  By: R.M. I had a spare iSticker for my iStik battery, and after the battery ran out I bought another one.   I have the newest version, and it is great. The size is perfect, and the iStrikers fit perfectly into the holes on the battery.  ,   My battery is very heavy, but I do use it at work to stay on-line and still have access to the phone for e-mail and other things.   to charge it, I take the iSTicker, put it on the charging port on my desk, and wait for it to charge.   in a couple days I'm charging the battery for my own iStklr, and my spare is still charging, and will hold a charge for about a week (the extra battery on the spare is only good for about 3 days, but it will last much longer with it).   The only issue I have with this product is the button. It seems to sometimes be pushed down when the unit is in use, it might be the battery in my case, I have not tried other batteries.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the M-Audio Delta USB a few years ago when my old laptop failed and I wanted a laptop that would make my daily workflow as easy as possible. I was not disappointed with this purchase. It's very good quality. It is a USB Audio interface so you are ready to go with the right sound card if you need one. It does not have any speakers or preamp built in so if you have a PC audio system then the only thing it has going for it is the fact that you can use the USB port to connect a mouse or a keyboard to. So I am no audiophile but I have some experience with computers so it is a perfect match for me.   This is the second time I've purchased this product. The first was a lot less expensive. I purchased this because I wanted to be able to use the Delta for my work when I am travelling. It has the added bonus of a remote control so you can plug in a guitar amp and have all of the effects of a professional recording studio. I am able to be at a gig with no audio problems because I have a professional mixing setup that doesn't rely on a computer to do anything. It gives me the same quality of sound as a professional mixer would. The one drawback to this is the sound is not as dynamic as it could be. This is because the Delta is a digital interface. It can only handle 44.1/48 and 16/44.1. I have an 8 track tape recorder and have used digital recorders on my laptop but this is an audio interface so it has a limit of 16/32. It may not sound good on a laptop but for my home studio I don't think I would do that with a PC. For the price it's not an issue. I really do like this product for the price and I will buy it again when I have the need.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great piece of kit! I've only had it a short time but i've been using it in my office for several hours every day for a week and a half now. i'm on an upgrade path to a more expensive one but i'm pretty much out of cash and this does the job really well. I have never owned a sound board before and am really surprised how easy the setup is. The only down side i have is that i can't control the volume via the remote. other than that it's fantastic. Also I found the USB audio out a bit weird as you have to be a bit careful as there are no mute buttons or anything but it's fine. I think this is really a great product for the price and really useful if you do a lot of office work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I can only get this device for a day and a half but I must say I have never seen anything so powerful as this. My wife and I used this in the last week of June, after a week of using the power supplies and controllers it's been the most wonderful experience we have ever had. We are able to use this product for an evening in the evening, and now I think we will make it a daily item! It's so quiet, the control panel has no buttons on it that would require the batteries to be replaced. It just has to be turned on, plugged in and that's all. We really have never used anything with so much power. I recommend this to anyone that needs an easy way to set up and operate your home theater system. If you need something that will take care of all of your electronic needs, this is what you need.

The original is small, and I have to carry it in my pocket for a few hours, or keep the battery in a separate charger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this in mid January 2009 and have been using it regularly since then.   It is a great value for the money. It does exactly what it says it does. I haven't seen anyone else mentioning this on the forums and I find it very useful.   to get an idea of how good this is... here is a screen shot of what my screen looks like (screen was turned off when taking the screen shot as it was running at a fairly high resolution)...   (click to enlarge)   In addition to the screen showing what my keyboard (PS/2 keyboard) is sending to my PS2 when I type on the keyboard, it also displays a log of all of the commands that I type onto the computer screen.  , and it's super quiet... but don't get fooled into thinking that it's a lot quieter than a keyboard... there is a lot of background noise... so there is probably a fair amount of static on the output from the sound card.   and my PS/2 card has been perfectly fine so far... the only reason that I've been unable to get it to show any information on the screen is that I have never connected the PS/1 mouse to it... and it has always looked like it was disconnected when it tried to send some information to it. So it's definitely not a mouse.   for what it's worth, and this is my only negative point, I would be more comfortable using a mouse over this device for anything other than playing video games... because it's simply not as accurate as a mouse... the screen isn't quite as responsive either. But overall... i'm very pleased with my purchase.  The Best. Ever.  I'm very picky when it comes to computer monitors and my wife and I have been looking for a monitor that is not only beautiful but one that would not be a distraction to us when we play video games. This one is perfect. The color reproduction is great, I can't think of a single time where I've seen any screen come close to this one.   is a very good monitor... you won't be disappointed.  It's not perfect, but it is perfect for the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________The first thing I noticed was the price. It is inexpensive, but not cheap. I ordered it online from the manufacturer for under $200 and the shipping was very quick. I can't believe it worked so fast. I have tried many different models of these type of units and this one seems to be just about perfect. It took only a few minutes to hook it up. Then I was able to program it. It works very well with my computer and my cell phone. It's just as good as the ones you can buy on the market at $40-$60. The only thing I didn't like was that I didn' t have the manual with me. I'll be ordering another one soon. It worked perfectly out of the box and it can't be beat.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is an amazing gadget! I love the fact that I can get high quality sound and the quality is great. The only downside is the battery life. But I'm not a fan of low battery alerts so i don't use it for the alarms. But for the music, great!  I've got a Triton 8, Tritonic 2, and this new thing - it's my best, I don't want to miss a thing!   Awesome quality! .  Really good looking and it works well.    It works great   Not a lot of use for it, but will still get used to it and keep this one as a backup  Best sound, low battery life, and looks great!   the battery is pretty low so i will have to replace it, however for the money this is a great quality unit with lots of volume!   in the end, for what it is, it works. It is also very nice looking and is a very solid unit! i love the white color and the white buttons.   Great Product, low power draw  The Tritus is a good looking device that can be found for a pretty good price. As for audio quality, this is the second of the Tritos I've purchased and I've had great results from both units. The sound from my unit is much better than my previous Trito, and I can even use the included speakerphone at full volume without it getting in the way of the music. The one big drawback for me is the low battery indicator light.  - One of my units was not charging properly and when I plugged it into my USB port and played through it, it went dark! (Not too big of a deal, because you can use a second battery or charger to help you keep it charged - it just takes up space on your USB port.)  - I'll give it 3.5/5 stars only because the light doesn't stay on for more than a few seconds after it turns off.  , my second unit is still going strong and performs just as well as my first. I am very happy with the T1's audio quality and I have had many of the other T1 models so I am definitely a fan. The battery is great too! I'm going to keep mine charged up and keep it in my car. I would definitely recommend this device. I recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________I was hesitant on buying an LCD monitor because i have seen so many cheap ones that are very small and light weight with the LCD display but the VESA mount gives you so much flexibility in the monitor. I bought this monitor for my son to play with as a little kid and it is the first one that can hold the kids monitor up with the VGA and HDMI port. I also have the older model so i think this model is much more expensive and it looks and feels like a much better monitor with the larger buttons to select features and the LCD better than the old one. It comes with the stand and monitor with it so you don't have to worry about it while you're working. All in all I am very happy with this purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device to use on my iPhone and it works great for that. I like the simplicity, the quality, the price, and the simple but easy to use setup. I don't have a lot of time and it's nice having it when I need it.   "This is an amazing device. If you are looking for a reliable and accurate alarm clock for any time of the day, this is a great choice. The only thing I would recommend is getting it with a battery backup. Battery life isn't long, so having a backup for that extra hour or two of battery is a must. Other than that, its a great buy     Write a negative review about an average electronic device:"  The only problem with this alarm clock is that it is not very intuitive, if you want to customize any settings, you'll have to go through a very long process of finding the settings in the app. Also, it gets loud when your phone is getting close, especially when the alarm goes off at 7:30am. Overall, this clock works well, it has no issues, and it is reasonably priced."   I received this alarm device free of cost in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The device that I got was the Energizer MAX.  I like the battery life that I get from it.    I really like the ability of the battery, but not so much the charger.    I wish that I would have gotten the charger sooner.  A quick and efficient way to recharge a cell phone is the Sony VTC5200 (also a popular one), and with that, a new device for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The radio does exactly what I need it to. It's the kind of radio that makes it possible for a remote operator to have the ability to do everything.   A few things:  -The manual is not easy to follow  I did find the instruction manual to be hard to follow and some of the things were unclear, or there was no clear explanation on what a switch does. This is probably because of the small print. The manual says things like, if you want to change a channel you have to turn it to "on" and then hold the radio down for a few seconds, it's confusing. But once I figured it out it made sense.  The audio/video has a lot of information on it that may be hard for most people to understand. Also, I'd like to see an on-screen display of the volume level, and to be able to go to a different part of the manual and see what that says.  the radio had good sound quality. It had a low volume that didn't bother me, and it didn't distort or muffle too much. It was also easy to operate.    I found it extremely useful to be allowed to listen to FM and AM radio.  .   The battery life was good, the radios are well built and I didn't have any problems with them (I use my older model RadioShack receiver to make it work)   .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for the kids, and they use it all the time. It helps with their math and spelling. It's a great toy for teaching kids reading and spelling in the older grades. I think we have a future for this one!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mandy from The Best Educational Toy I Love this Toy!!! This is my favorite. I play with it all day. I like how it keeps me occupied. I'm so excited to use it this summer in the classroom. I love it!!!!  What's not to like? This is one of the coolest toys I have bought in a long time. The color design, the size, and the functionality are perfect for my 8 year old. And I know that my son will use it too. I purchased it for him because he had been looking at it for awhile and thought it was really cool. He loves it. The only thing he doesn't like is the batteries, but that could be from using it as a play toy. I definitely recommend this toy. My husband is going to try one of these as well.  Great product This product works great with our little boy. He's a very good reader and a big fan of the color-coded letters and numbers. I bought one for him, and one for me, and both love them! My son doesn't have a computer, so it's great that this comes with an SD card that he can use for games and word processing.

Yes No Thursday, April 18, 2014  Works well, can't beat the price  by Kari from Laconia NH USA  Pros: Compact design  Cons: No way to control volume or brightness  Review: This unit is great for it's size and price. The remote control is a bit finicky, and sometimes the power button won't work, but that's not a big deal. It doesn't come with a case and the batteries are small, so the unit doesn't last very long. I've been using it for over a week and the battery is running low. It does work when you want to, but only a little. The buttons are too far apart to be accessible with gloves, so a case would be a great help to this. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality, compact remote control for an affordable price. : Compact model that is compact, with great features, and it works with a variety of TVs, including a 65" Sony LED TV.: Battery life is pretty weak for an electronic device, however there are many functions.: Some functions do not work on the default remote.: The remote is a tad bit finicky, but the power level is fine. ,  My wife bought one for her 60" Sony TV and i bought one also for my 65" one. They both work great with the remote. Only issue i have is with the volume. It is not controlled from the remote at all. It has a button on the side to set the volume and it only comes up to 50%, so you can't turn it up. Also, with a normal TV, the volume is always at 100%, so i don't understand the extra button for volume.

I have this new e-vape on the way and i was a little worried about the flavor, i did not buy this vape as a starter it was just a gift and i just got it yesterday and it works perfect, I love this little vape and it gives me that vape and the e-liquid is good, this is a good starter e-cig. I will definitely purchase from vape wild again. I like the size and look of this e-cigg e-cigarette, its pretty much a little pen which you turn on the top and top, the juice is a bit cheap, i like to buy the real stuff and there are alot of different juices for this device but i just tried the strawberry juice on this device it was the best and the price is very reasonable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very happy with my new computer. It's been quite a while since I've used an old computer and this one is quite a step up. A few things that I liked is the speed it's running at, and the size. It does take up quite a bit of space and I can't fit my XBOX360 and 360 controller in there but its still small enough and light enough. The only issue is that it does have an issue with the memory card reader in it. It works fine when I'm installing games but if I'm trying to download some music or movie files it'll hang up on me and just force close after like 1 second. But I'm a fan of this kind of thing and I get it because the card is old and that's why it doesn't work. The sound quality is good. I got this for the Xbox and my old computer was so crappy with the speakers and music sound quality was terrible so I'm glad I got a better sound system. I also like the fact that you can set the screen to the correct brightness with the remote.  If you're not satisfied, return it within 30 days and receive a full refund:  You got the best gaming system for the price anywhere! I had purchased an Xbox 360 and a PS3 and was very happy and amazed at the difference. I didn't need to look at the reviews for the PS3. It was a solid system and it was a very good purchase. I decided to purchase the PC gaming system and got one for my mom to play with. I'm so happy that I did. I've already had it for a little over a week and the only issue I've had is that there's a very small gap between the left side of the keyboard and the console itself. The keyboard is a bit wobbly which is noticeable and the bottom of the system is a little thin so it will probably chip the underside of the chassis eventually. That's not really a big deal but it doesn,t take too long to get used to it. The controller is really awesome and is very well built. I had it shipped and was super happy to receive it in the mail. I was worried that the PS4 controller would be better and it wasn't. I can live with the smaller button layout and the fact it's a slightly heavier and more expensive controller. Overall I'm super happy with the PC system and can't wait for the next Halo game.  and to
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A couple of days ago I was running the battery down on my iPad Pro and the screen started showing some strange images on the screen. I took a quick look at my computer to see what was causing the issues. I noticed that a large file was downloaded from the Internet. I quickly uploaded the file from my computer and when it came back online, it showed up as a corrupted file. I immediately backed up my iPad and began the process to repair the data.   After about 10 minutes I was able to get back into my computer with the file downloaded and started the restore process. I opened the Apple Device Connector and inserted my iPad. The iPad's screen was on and everything looked good. The problem had completely gone. I then plugged the iPad into my laptop and it displayed perfectly fine again. The restore didn't get it back up to the latest iOS version so I had to do a fresh install of iOS 7 on the iPad. I was thrilled at how it handled the install.   at the end of the day it all went well. I would recommend this to anyone who has an iPad and it worked like a champ.  , February 10, 2016

It is nice for family members who can hear each other over the loud setting but I can still hear what they are saying on the other end.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently replaced my two Dell laptops with new and shiny Toshiba. I have to admit the Toshiba turned out to be a good laptop. The screen looks great, it has a lot of ports and does a great job at keeping the heat out. I just bought a 4th Dell laptop and will be buying a Toshiba one soon. I don't think you'll have to be afraid of your Dell being destroyed by an over zealous motherboard hacker. Rated 5 out of 5 by BK from Good product for the price I like that the laptop has a good keyboard. I also like the amount of memory and hard drive space.

I can't say enough good things about the XB. The display is a lot brighter than the iphones and it is easy to read on the screen. It is very thin but is not a flimsy thin. It has a lot of ports so you can do a lot with it. It charges with the Lightning port on my iphonelove. I am using this as an extra monitor while my ipleak iphonolife is charging.

It comes with a keyboard that feels very sturdy and has a great touchpad, great screen, and the battery life is great. The sound is great as well, the speakers are very loud and the noise cancellation works so great I didn't need to turn it on. There is no question in my mind that I would recommend this to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently purchased my  G.Skill 32GB DDR3L RAM kit for my Dell E5500 laptop.  The kit came as a little flat package, no accessories.    It was shipped in a small box, but it fit nicely into the laptop. I opened the box to find 2 items inside.  One was a clear plastic sleeve for a RAM stick.  The other was a bag of RAM stick parts.  I carefully unwrapped the parts, removed the foam insulation and discovered that the RAM sticks were made of "High Density Plastic".   DDR3L sticks are not designed to be sold individually in small bags, so I was a little upset.  I was glad to find that I could cut out the insulation from the two sticks and replace it with a small metal piece that fits snugly into the top of the RAM stick - so that it would fit nicely under the lid of the laptop, thus eliminating the possibility of dust getting into my computer.  It is important to note that this is a RAM sticks, and is not a computer hard drive, so if the RAM doesn't fit, the drive won't fit in the laptop (and you'll be out of luck if you have the larger hard drive).    So that's the kit, now how do I make a 32GB (or more) DDR3D ram stick that will fit in my laptop? It took me quite a few hours to figure out the best way to do it.  First, I have to remove the top layer of my laptop's case (which is made of plastic) to access the RAM.  Then, I need to remove two pieces of foam insulation from a RAM Stick.  If the foam is removed, the RAM will not fit into the RAM slot (and the hard drive won to be in the RAM slots). Now that I've got the foam removed, I'll need to cut the top and bottom off.  For those that have ever used an  3D printer to make things, I imagine it's not terribly difficult to do.  But if you are new to this, I recommend using a razor blade to cut a 1/4" strip of foam.  After that, I found it easier to use the power drill to remove all of the foam. Next, I needed to create a hole on each side of the plastic part (which should be cut off

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Very good. I can connect an antenna up to a 30mhz antenna and get about 3-4 channels at a range of 15-30 meters. I have a small handheld antenna (a SMA) with a 20mhz output (which is the standard for outdoor wireless). I can get about 5-6 channels out of it at 30 meters. Great device, but the antenna connector on the device is very poorly designed. It's just not a good design. The connector should just be a straight, short, solid connector with a plastic connector that fits around it's metal ends. It would be nice if they included an antenna connector with the device. It doesn't have one (I'm thinking of making my own). I had to replace the plastic connector with two 3/8-inch pieces of copper to make it work. That took forever.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Kip from Not very good. Good thing I have this to share with you... it's the only thing I can give out that you really can not get from the other vendors. This thing works great on my desktop computer, but can't get a signal on the wall in our house. Why? It doesn;t have any kind of RF, only TV. This is my only option. If I can't use it on my computer, I will have to give it away. Why is there no option for TV?  The product itself is pretty good. It is easy to use and set up. We have it wired to our desktop computer and it works great. We bought another antenna, the V-SAT, to use in our home but the V1.0 was a little bit too high. We used it with a V-DIN cable to the TV antenna and it worked great. So if you want something that has a nice signal you will not be disappointed with the product. It seems to have a decent range though. You can't have any antennas longer than 25 feet. The signal it gets from the TV is not very strong, so you may need an antenna that has low gain for better reception. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a good antenna, or one with the widest range. This product is not capable of supporting more than a small household, and if you are thinking of adding an outdoor antenna to this thing, don't.

Its the only thing i have been using to transfer my music onto an external hard drive to be played back on my iPad and i'm very satisfied. I use it to store all my music and media files to my external hard drives. i like the fact that i can select a folder for the media and its just as easy as opening the folders and selecting the files. The buttons are easy to get used to. You dont have to turn the thing on and off to operate, so its easier to operate at night with your lights off than if you had to turn on the lights to use the thing. I'm going to have to buy more, as it is very convenient. Keep up the good work, Rockstar  Have not tried it yet. But it works well.  Good product but it works not as good as i thought...  I bought a second one of these because I wanted to play the files from my old one on a new one (I am moving from a computer and this is my portable solution for transferring everything).   I was not too impressed with how it works, but the fact it could transfer so many things from a hard drive, was not bad.   However, I am not really a fan of the way you have to set it up to be able to sync up with your iTunes music player. I guess you can get around this by syncing it up on your desktop with your Mac via iTunes, but then you lose the convenience of being able to just play a song from your iPod/iPhone and transfer it to the computer.   and even then, I did have to copy the files first with my Windows XP computer because I could not copy the folders on the iPod/iPad from the computer and then move them onto my iPod/iOS device.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this computer for the past few years. it has been very reliable. i had issues with some usb ports, and the screen will not work with the newer usb adapter. i purchased the one that works with the computer and i also upgraded the graphics card. it does not bother me though. the pc is very large, and i am not much of a gamer. it is very light weight and i can use it anywhere i want. if the screen fails it does it so much for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5c battery. it lasts for a long time in my opinion (after a very long day of testing) the only downside is that i can't replace it when it gets weak, i think it will have to be replaced anyway when my new phone arrives (a 5.5 inch). i would recommend buying one of these batteries to replace those you're using.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the ROG SWIFT PG348Q in February. I bought the 24" screen and it worked great. Then a few weeks later, the LED lights on the keyboard started flashing. When you press keys, the screen doesn't light up. So I sent in my keyboard for warranty replacement. I was sent a replacement key and I'm super happy with it. The new keys are much brighter and they work great. I still like the old keyboard a lot, but the new keys make it perfect.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Love this item I own several of these and they are a great help for me when I need to connect to a computer. The speed they provide is perfect for doing a small amount of information with one click. When using them to send pictures or email they do so very fast.  The only thing that I can not stand is the fact that they take up so much space when I am not using it. It takes up 2.5 by 1.5 inch of space. The cable itself is very simple to use and works great and all around great product.  of 13 people found this review helpful Good product. I'm very satisfied with this product  of 10 people found the review helpful good, I have had my Epson printer for about 3 months and it has been very good, the only complaint I have is that it is too much work to set up a usb drive to print out pdfs to my computer but otherwise the product is good.  and of 4 people found their review helpful This is a great product  was good but needed a usb cable.  is a little pricey and it does not support the usb printer  and 5 people found they had no experience with this, there is no paper adapter to plug into the printer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the PicoPSU to run my N5532 on a PC.  You really can't go wrong with this unit!  It's a small box with lots of ports.  be patient. it took me 10 hours to get this thing working.   my first impression:   The Pico is a little "small" compared to a PCPSU.  , but I like it. The PCPSUs are heavy and bulky and really take up some space.   Heavier, smaller, and compact.   and as a PC, it's great to not have to run Windows.   And with the PPSU, I can run OSX, Ubuntu, Windows 7, and Windows 10.   at least for now.   the N5531 uses an analog input. so the PICO is nice. It is quiet and I can plug in almost anything.   I installed it on my HP T4300.   It was really easy to set up and install. It took about 10 minutes.     the PIPU is cool. I can make a PC monitor a TV. I used to be able to do that with an HDTV.   I think this is a cool product.

I was having a hard time finding this item in my area so I finally found it and picked it up at a local store and it was on sale for $4.99 so I bought it with my tax refund. It is a little large for a pocket but it works as intended. It works fine for a few hours and then stops working for about a day or two.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Excellent as a second screen for my TV, as it is far easier for me to use this for my computer than my HDMI monitor as the picture is a bit dim and small. Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 29, 2013 Great for movies and games! By Sean from San Diego CA USA This thing is awesome! It shows me when the computer is running or has to be switched on/off (incoming emails, incoming calls, etc). It is very handy as I do the same thing with my phone and TV. The only issue is that the screen only shows when the PC is active, not when it is in standby mode like most laptops allow. I'm sure if they could make it so it worked when the screen was in standby, it would be great, but at the moment it's not the best solution. I recommend this to everyone that needs a second monitor! Was This Review Helpful not enough ports? I really enjoyed this product. It gave me more choices and flexibility than any of the other options I saw on the market. The only issue I had with this laptop is it had only two USB ports. I didn't use those, but they were pretty convenient.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  - I wish I could return it because I just love it and love my new iPod. - I wish it was longer battery life. - It looks great. - The earbuds are awesome.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for the price and the features I have had the iPod shuffle for a couple of weeks now and I am extremely satisfied. There are a couple things that I like about the shuffle, and a couple that I do not like, but that is to be expected. When listening to music I play through an earbud. I have found that I can keep my eyes on my track while I am driving, I can get out of my car to use the bathroom, etc. The controls are very good and the shuffle is very compact. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that you can not control the iPod from the shuffle. I can control my iPod directly through the settings. However I have been using the shuffle for 2 weeks and have not noticed any problems with the shuffle whatsoever. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a very compact and simple iPod that plays music. I like that it is not as fancy as my iphone, it just plays music!  Reviewed using: iPhone 5, Ipod Nano
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my first Apple computer in 1976, bought a second one in 1981 and then bought an Amiga in 1984. I had a hard time parting with my Amiga for the Mac which I bought in 1983. It's been the only computer I've owned that hasn't taken up the entire wall in my office. I am now ready to part with it for the Apple. I hope it does the job well.   This Apple has so many good features:   The memory: I have the 16 MB model. It is full up for the first time and it only takes me 3 minutes to read 4-5 GB of information from the disk and to save it. It just makes reading and writing data so much easier.  - You can run up to 3 apps on the same screen- You have lots of options- You don't have to wait for a mouse to be in the "hot-zone" on the screen to write to disk. It will write to the disk whenever you press the "write" button- It doesn't take much space to store a large amount of information on the disk, even though it's not a full size floppy drive- It is much cheaper to buy a Mac as you can get it all in one box (32 or 64 MB for $599)- it's so easy to change from Mac to PC with the Mac's built in printer- it's easy to see what's going on on a screen with a great monitor- It's so much nicer to use a Mac and use Mac programs and Mac programs than a PC-   It's so powerful and it just gives you so much more options. I really wish they would have made it a full sized floppy drive.   in my opinion, it should be just like the IBM PC that was made when this computer was launched, with a hard drive, floppy drive, video monitor, keyboard, mouse, and a floppy disk.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a professional photographer and I have bought several products from e-guru. My favorite is the small tripod and tripod base that are made for the Nikon D7000 with the bayonet mount on it.  I use them to get high quality photos from my Nikon D3x, D800, D4, D90, D400, D810 and the D700 cameras with the 24-70mm lens.  My Nikon body is Nikon D1 with the 18-55mm lens and the Nikon lens with a 35mm filter is Nikon 50mm with a filter.  If you need a sturdy tripod, one that is light weight and can be mounted to any camera (or lens), I highly recommend these two products.

Once I had them in my hands I was sold. The build quality is top notch, the screen is super bright and clear, and it plays music and movies just fine without any issues. The only downside is that you need a really good set of headphones to make this work as well as they are. But other than that, it's a fantastic piece of kit. The price is excellent too. I think I'll get my own for my next car stereo or any other audio device that might want a high-end sound system. - Greg R.  the king. I just had my I Am King Sound in a couple days, and I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is a very good camera!! it's light and it's sturdy!!!!!!!!! I love the features it gives!!!! The only problem i have was my phone did not like the lens but I used a polarizing filter on it. It took 2 weeks for it to be fixed but it looks beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Couldn't be happier! This is my first camera and I am blown away by the build quality, the software is amazing and the quality of the pictures is excellent. I can't believe how much I can save with the 4GB cards. I have an iPhone 7 Plus and a Sony RX100 IV but I was worried that it would be hard for a Sony camera to take good photos with that lens, but this phone is amazing! The lens is a little bit to wide but I think it's pretty perfect for a camera in general and I can use a little more light than I can with a larger lens but as you can see from the pictures I've taken, it can take some incredible photos! I can see this as a must have for all iPhone users!

You can easily use it to compare products against the real thing! I'll continue to buy from Amazon as well as this company!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, February 25, 2015  Easy to set-up, easy to compare with other brands: Very good  by A Customer from California  Pros: Easy to set, easy compare with products  Cons: The batteries don't last as long as the other brand of 3 AA Ni-MH AA batteries which also came with the unit. The 2.4-4.8 volt batteries run much cooler, so they last longer.  Review: It was very easy to operate. You put the battery in, turn it on. You use the 1 or 2 buttons to select the number of hours you want to compare. There is also a mode for comparing two brands of batteries, so you can compare two batteries on one side and another on the other side. The batteries have been holding up really well. We'll be ordering again.  on this side, we use them in a few other electronic devices, such as in our microwave oven. We have a dishwasher that also requires 3 AA batteries.  and the other... it would be awesome if we could compare the real world devices and their batteries with the batteries in the devices.   i know that the unit has only lasted a couple of months in our house but i think it has held up well.  in all, i would recommend this product! .  at the same time, the batteries are a little pricey. you would need two for a microwave, as well. if you're a little strapped for cash, I would probably stay away. . but the unit is good for a small project or a good test of the batteries. it's good for comparing products that are similar.  (just in case you need to know for example how far each one of the two will go.)  . and we did the same test with a 5v 3A alkaline battery to see how each lasted when compared to each other. , the new battery lasted far longer than the old one. I am very satisfied with this purchase.   (just a side note: you can buy these separately,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just purchased the iVoid and I am impressed at the performance, quality and build. It does not have a back light, but its a huge plus to me since its one thing I have to look out for with my eyes in the dark. I love how you can adjust the brightness of the screen in the software, the colors are very accurate and the sound is really good. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new device. I have only had this for a few days and was very impressed with the quality. Its very sturdy and fits nicely in the hand. The only downside I have noticed is that when it is plugged in, it uses 2 AA batteries and is very loud when it does. I am going to have to make sure I get a way to make the noise go away. Great device for the price. I got this to replace an iphone 4.0, and the iphon software is terrible. It works ok, but the apps are so complicated and hard to use. When I first got it, it was working fine, then it would lock up, then reboot, and that became a frequent problem. The keyboard is very nice, the keys don't feel like they are plastic and they have a very solid feeling. It is extremely quiet, with its own speakers. This has been my only iph one so far, so I am disappointed that it wasn't better. I would give it an overall rating of 7.5/10. Excellent device for a great price. If you want a really good looking and powerful iph device that works really well, this is it. There are a lot of good reviews for this, and I agree with some of them. Its pretty small, but that makes it very portable. If I were to buy it again, I would get the full size version (I bought the mini). The audio is good enough to hear outside, and if you use the earbud cord and a mic, the mic doesn't get lost. The screen is small, and it's got pretty good battery life. I've been using it a day or two, and its got about 1 day of charging, so if you do it at a desk, or in a bag, you should be fine. It has a very nice built quality and it feels really nice in the hands. This was my first digital device and is a big step up from the ikon

It's a good size, very durable, and the price is really good. I'm sure I'll keep using this one for a while. -David S. --------------  Please provide a better description of this product: ------------- This is a great little piece of kit for a first timer. You can use it for a few years without having to change it because it holds your music, mp3s, etc and you can even have it read it out. It works really well and holds a charge, and is pretty easy to clean. However, the battery does eventually run out, and if you don't change the battery, the thing will die, which takes a little bit of work to change. -------------  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  A great little device. It is so easy to use. It does the job well. There are many things you can add to the unit that will make it much more useful. You can have a little flashlight for those dark nights. There is a very easy way to add a camera for pictures or videos. The battery is really low power. I don't know how much power the unit uses, but that's okay. I like to keep it in my truck. If I wanted a more powerful unit, I would have bought one with a battery bigger than I use. I could probably get more power from a cell phone battery, but it would be much smaller and you'd have to be careful with what you plug it into. I would recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a very low power way of getting a picture.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  A friend lent me his Tascam DR-100mkII when I was at college because I needed to record some drums for a band. I was so excited about the possibility of having some sort of drum machine in my studio and it was great. I did not want a cheap little drum machine that was difficult to use. The DR-200mkII was so easy to use and play. I love having the onboard sequencer. I can take a song and play over it or record it with the DR-300mkII as a virtual drummer. I would definitely recommend this DR-1000MKII to anyone! A friend of mine got the DR1000MKIII from Amazon.  This is a great upgrade, especially for the price.  This is the one that I use to record in my home studio.  It is also very small and easy to transport to my home to work.  I am very happy with this and would definitely buy one from here again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have tried a couple of these devices in the past and they work pretty well, but never a perfect fit, the ones I have had had are very large, and have a tendency to stick out from the sides of the case. I have only had the 2 new ones in a year. I use one for my phone, and one for a small computer. Both of these are light and very slim. I think you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again, as it seems you can't make good use of the internal buttons, and there is a lot of flex in the cases, but it is nice that it keeps the batteries dry while you are out in the field.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "It is a joy to use"   The USB version is very useful.   I bought this for my laptop that I use to type all my work e-mail. It has a decent keyboard that is large, light and has the ability to type upside down when it is plugged into a monitor. It is perfect for my work. Also, there are no ports to plug anything in.   I use my computer as a video editing computer. My laptop uses a USB cable to connect to the computer. The cable that comes with my computer is very short and the USB port is very close to the keyboard. The USB cable is not long enough to get from the computer to the USB device. There are no extra ports.   a very good quality.   (Posted on 9/14/16)  Excellent  I purchased this to replace a broken USB keyboard. I wanted a keyboard that was very easy to use (I have 3 children aged 10, 8 and 6). The product arrived in two days and I was surprised by how sturdy it is. I used the keyboard at work and it worked flawlessly. The only suggestion I could offer is that the USB cable would have been more convenient to use. The device did not have a small USB plug, instead it had a large one. The old style type B USB plug would have worked perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought this many times for my pc, laptop, ipad, iphone and now the phone it comes with. Works very well, its great at transferring files from and to my pc and it has a nice long usb to mini usb cable so it is very handy for connecting it to all my devices as well. If i wanted to transfer a massive file to my phone and i dont want to carry around a usb cable. This will do the trick. As i have read other reviews that have stated the USB connection isnt very good i would give it a 1 star instead of 2 if there is any improvement to the USB cables quality and connectors in the future.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my vr1 for about 6 months now and i am really enjoying my setup but for some reason when i connect my tv i dont get an output signal. has this been addressed? i live in europe and have no cable and a cable provider does not provide a tv or other tv devices. i have to pay out of my own pocket to subscribe to tv channels. i think the issue is that the vr has a 1.8ghz which is the lowest speed the tv can run at. i live just over 400 kilometers from the capital city and i have tried switching to a tv which wasnt that expensive, i had to switch to a samsung lg tv which cost me around 400 euro which isnt that much. i am a poor college student and have to save up so i can afford one of these devices. if there is a fix i am not aware of it as its a brand new unit so i would really appreciate a bit more of an info about it. i really like this device and would gladly pay up for one of those. but not having a cable box or tv provider has been a major problem and now i have a tv with a really low speed and cant even watch tv in its best settings with vr.  Rated 5 out of 5 by kenji from Excellent product for VR - it is perfect The vr4 has everything i need: no cables, no wires, just 3 buttons. i can turn it on and off, navigate the menu, and switch between modes without getting up, which is great for a student like me.  and it works great with my macbook air. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned a variety of devices ranging from a toaster to a radio, all in various stages of use. I've used the s-500 from the very beginning and, while it can occasionally be an annoyance, I have never regretted the purchase. I find that I enjoy the ease of use, it's light weight and compact, as well as being a relatively inexpensive item (around a dollar a month in monthly bills). I've had it for a few months now and am enjoying its light weight. If you are looking for a portable radio, I'd recommend this one.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, September 21, 2011  by DAN from I thought the s500 had a better selection of channels than a cable box. The s-50 had the better selection and a better range. I would recommend the s50 to anyone considering an iphone/iphone device.  I don't get the need for a digital radio any more, so the s51 was a good upgrade.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The MOGO Mini has a beautiful built quality and the sound quality is superb for an iPod. I used it to create a music file in Audacity, a great tool for recording audio. After I finished recording, the MOGOs audio quality was much more than what my MacBook Pro would handle. I also created a podcast, and the iPod was great for that too. I use my MacBook and iMac's as my portable audio gear, and I have to say that the iPod Mini is the best of both worlds. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that uses an iPod as a portable media device.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **************************** After buying this device I was skeptical. After all, I had a previous one that was a year or so ago and this unit was nowhere near as good. This is an extremely good unit! I bought it because it was inexpensive and I wanted to have one as a backup if I wanted it. The device is easy to use. It does all that it should, and does it very well. It has been very reliable thus far. For the price and the features, I will always get it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had my iphone 5S for about a month now and have been playing my favourite music for the whole time, which includes many genres of music from classical to jazz. So far, everything is in great working order. I do not have an AppleCare+ subscription (although I do have a small AppleCare plan I subscribe to) but that is no problem. This unit does not have the dreaded "battery acid" issue as some reviewers have mentioned. So it is great to know it has been under warranty for the past three years. I have also purchased a second battery for the iPhone SE (which also does not exhibit that "batter acid" problem) and this was a very good investment. Thanks Apple.   Was this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I've been using this for 3 months now. I bought the Eizo DLP Monitor for $349 on eBay. It has two DVI ports, which makes it compatible with a large amount of older PC games. The included HDMI cable was used to play a few games from Steam but it seems that you can only play a couple of games from it. I've had this for about a week and I have to say it looks great! It was a bit hard to get to the back so I had to use a dremel to cut down some of the plastic. The screen has no problems with the LED. It's a nice clear light which makes for a perfect ambient lighting. I wish it had an option to have a more expensive and better looking screen for a bit less money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Good price for an excellent device. I would definitely purchase another if the price dropped. This will be the last electronic device I buy from this company for some time to come.  Review of DJI Go 4 Goggles - Black - Small - Retail Packaging - December 8, 2015 - December 08, 2015 Mike B I bought the goggles and a controller in August of 2015 and now have just a small gopro that I will probably use mainly for aerial video and a camera mounted on the goggles. I'm very impressed at how well the gopros mount on the drone, and they are super easy to attach to the gps and work with all the gbx, gps units I've tried.   The only negative I have is the plastic goprons do not seem to last very long. My gopron from August now has a very thick "smear" on it that has turned a dark color. I have also had a few breaks in the bottom plastic and the camera can fall out. If I were to buy another goprio, I would not buy these plastic ones, they do not hold up as well as the solid ones. .

The first thing I noticed was that it sounded very good, and then I heard the video. My old PC would not have had any sound, and the video sounded great. It is very good quality and i have to say I am very happy with it. You can't beat it for the price....................................................  I just installed this item into my PC. Works great!  i bought this product a while back as an upgrade. The video is great, sound quality is great and the installation was simple. It works as a good quality USB audio/video splitter............................................................................    I am not sure whether you've got a Windows XP or Vista PC. This is the first item that I've ever installed. It's very easy to set up. The sound is great. As a result, it is not my first audio/videocast device, but it is the easiest one to install............................  in my house I have a VCR that was in a drawer for 30 years. It will not accept a HD DVD player. It does accept a DVD player if you mount it vertically. I use to get good audio but now have to pay for the extra sound card for the surround sound. The audio card does not fit the slot so I have to mount it on the wall instead. _________________________________________  this sound card does the job I'm using it on a Toshiba laptop. It sounds amazing. Also the quality of the sound quality.     This sound card is awesome! I have been using this for a few months now with no issues. It has enough bass, mids, and treble to be a great sound card, even though I use a laptop with a low volume. It can be configured to use a usb port or just the audio output.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The!!! is a really nice touch and really makes me feel I have a piece of real wood on my desk. If I could find a keyboard of this quality on sale I would pay for it! I would buy another if it was on sale.  Write a negative review about an uninspiring product: I purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with a nvidia gtx 750m last year. I was quite pleased with my purchase as it was a very good looking machine. It was very fast, easy to program, and seemed to be able to run games without any lag. However, the last few weeks have seen it run very poorly. One day it would suddenly crash without a reason, other days it would run perfectly, then again. It had a strange blue screen of death that would go away if I turned it off or got a cold. Then it would freeze for an extra 10 minutes. It's very frustrating to have a device that is supposed to be an amazing device suddenly become a disaster. I would love to use it at work but the price will not allow it.  at times, the software crashed and wouldn't load the next time I tried to load it. I am sure there is a problem that is causing it and I'm sure a fix would be out of the question. I hope to receive a replacement by the end of the week, but if not, I will find another machine that is better for me.  the keyboard was terrible and did not feel like wood. It felt like plastic and the whole keycaps felt cheap. A negative review of the worst keyboard ever: As I mentioned above, I purchased the new MacPro last year, along with a MacBook Air (which is still my favorite laptop). I was so excited to finally have the latest, greatest, and greatest hardware available. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my family, and it is still in use today. However I have had a few issues. I first noticed that after 3 or 4 weeks, the mouse cursor no longer tracks as a mouse pointer. The cursor would instead track across the screen. Then, I noticed that the trackpad cursor was not trackpad scrolling like it should be. Instead it tracked as a keyboard cursor, which is odd because I would never, ever, ever expect a trackpad to do this. Then when I tried scrolling with the track pad cursor in the Safari browser, it just moved up and down without any

I was going to replace it with a new one but I found this for a cheaper price. It's just an upgrade from my old phone, the only thing that I didn't like was the lack of a back light. I will try to find a replacement for this when I get it back from the service.  Not great I bought the iphone and I can say that it works well. The only thing I didn;t like is that it is not a flip phone, and it makes it hard to flip it open. I love a flip, that is the only reason I bought it.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best way to keep phone charged I was on the hunt for a charger that could be used to charge both my  iphone and my ipad. After searching for over a week, I stumbled across the moleskine ipad charger and was pleasantly surprised. This charger is light weight and works extremely well to keep your ipad charged. I was able to take my ipad out of my pocket for several days before I was out of juice. I also like that the charger has a separate micro usb cable so I can charge my phone at night without a problem.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I have a good friend who likes my Â TDA8750 Â and he just got it today so I decided to go out and buy myself a new one! It was well worth the money. This is the best DAC i have ever used for music production and mixing. Â It's so loud and clear, so clear.  It doesn't get loud for a long time before it does, so you won't lose out on that sonic information if you play at very high volume levels.      The bass is tight and very present.  I love the quality, clarity and high dynamic range (compared to most Â USB DACs).   I've already ordered a second unit so i can finally use it with my  MacBook Pro and it will be great.  The build quality is fantastic.  This thing can withstand a beating and still sound like new. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been a computer user all my life. I had my first computer a long time ago (I think it was a 386?). I remember it running Windows 95 and I remember having to get my system and all my software from a CD, and installing them myself. Then the time came when I needed a laptop, and a hard drive. I was a bit worried that I would have to buy the exact same model from the original owner of that computer. It's been over 25 years since that computer was used. But I did purchase the model, and it works great. The keyboard is wonderful and I love the touch screen. I use it for work, and entertainment. It has a built in hard drive and I use a large printer, and I can print to it all with a Windows printer driver. It seems like a quality product. This was a good buy for me and I will continue to use it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by B.J. from Perfect for my home and office. I have had this for a couple months and I'm very pleased with the purchase. I do use a wireless keyboard and mouse with this, but they work very well. The software works very well and I have found a couple of bugs that were fixed. The computer does get hot, but it's a very well made unit. I also like the built in DVD drive, and the wireless keyboard. I'm using a Toshiba Satellite laptop as my main work machine, and this computer is doing a good job in terms of speed.  the only thing that I wish was different, is that the wireless card on this thing is a very old model and no longer supported. The warranty I received was very good, the only things that I did not like was that the computer has been showing some serious hardware problems with some of the software. I would definitely buy from PC World again in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this a month or so ago and have put about a half a dozen different pieces of music/media on it (including the XBMC) and it works great. It does seem that a slightly lower volume is better for my tastes, but it also seems to have a larger amount of soundstage (although that could just be my speakers). All of the music playback and control works fine. I haven't tried the DVD recorder, but I have a friend who has and said it was pretty good. The sound quality is good, but is a bit on the thin side. I could see the audio speakers (which are actually stereo) being more effective for larger rooms, but this one is really nice for the house. I have not tried any movies on it yet, but that may be a good reason for its purchase. This may be too expensive for what it is, but if it gets more music or DVD/VCR playback I will probably add another model to my collection.

The quality of the recordings is wonderful, and the recording is great. I'm not a professional audio engineer, but I am able to pick up very clear recordings. I am planning on upgrading from an iPhone to this for recording audio on-the-go.  I have had this with me for some time and am very pleased with it.  a good value for the money: I am just glad I purchased this recorder. I use it for my home studio, it is a great device for recording.  "Great Recording Device, but Don't Like the Battery Life" It's good for everything from live piano playing to drum loops. I like to record and mix audio on the fly, as I can use this device during live performances. The only problem I have is with the battery life. I find myself going through the battery more often than not. I do not want to be relying on batteries for hours of recording and listening. It has worked out well, so I will continue to use it, but the battery problem bothers me. I purchased it as my first "digital" recording device and it was a good choice. This is a wonderful device for your home or office, it just requires the right setup and an understanding of the controls. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up and use as well, but it takes a bit of patience and is not for everyone.

My only concern is that it is somewhat heavy for a phone. It fits a large 4″ display and doesn't come with any mounts. The top of it is made of plastic that is easy to get scratched up.  and the bottom is made out of aluminum. that aluminum is quite sturdy. It does fit a 5.5″ screen, but it can only be used with a thin case with the screen attached. it does have the ability to use the USB 3.0 port and it is great if you don't want to use a case. 1 star for the screen not being able to be used. 2 stars for USB 3 support. The USB 2 port is very limited on what you can use with it. 4 stars for the performance and built quality. 5 stars for having the best features on a budget phone in this price range that you can purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an awesome device for a beginner. It's simple, easy to use, and really quick to set up and use. I use my iPad with it a lot, especially with the Wifi and Bluetooth built in. It is very portable, and I can use it anytime I want to. The battery is very strong, so there is little worry about running out of juice. I really like that the screen is high-quality, and very bright. I like how the light is controlled from the top. I even like the design on the box - it looks like a nice box, and its not too thick, which is good for transporting. I also like that there is only one port on the device: The headphone jack. I think I will get more uses out of the iPlayer if I just put a headphone on it.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As I understand, the "battery life" is not really a measure of battery life but more of the amount of time it takes to charge it. For example, if you charge a USB port for 24 hours, and you then use it an hour later, you have used more than 24 hours.   I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 running the stock version and with only 20GB of storage. As you can see in the video, I am using it for everything, from reading my text messages to listening to music. It is the best phone I have ever used.   is the battery life as good as it should be with so little storage, especially when I am able to buy a case or carry two separate chargers for the phone and my tablet?   EDIT: After listening to the song again, I'm glad I got the case, it reduces the glare.   of course it is a shame that the case is so expensive, but since I can't get the S3 any cheaper, and since I bought it used, I've no choice.  It is possible to have a very long lasting battery life for such a small device!  Great!  in any case, I was concerned that a phone as small and portable as this may not be able to get enough battery life. Not a problem at all.  the phone is a joy to use, especially with the S-Pen  This is a great phone for the price. I bought the black one.

Reviewer: David, WV - favorite favorite favorite - January 25, 2012  Subject: Great! So, how do you like the device? I have the XM and use it in my vehicle, but recently picked up the XMR.   The device works great, works better than my XM. I have it on my back right now, but will get it to my head and back in a few days.  ,  The only issue I have is a slight delay, which is pretty mild. The only other thing that bothers me is the button that has a "buzzer sound" for the on/off button, but I do not find this to be a bad thing. It is just an added sound that I find annoying, but it can be turned off in the menu. - January 24, 2012great!  Rating:  Review: . - July 6, 2011Great! .  .I used to use a PDA for a long time, and the one thing I always found annoying is when you push the button to turn off, but then when you press the button for re-on, there is a short delay. Then, when you look at the device you are trying to power on, you find that the button will not operate, even though the computer has just powered on. It was frustrating. So I used the XmR for the last 5 years and I never had that problem. It does not take as long to get up and running, and it never has. The XmM and XmS are two different devices. The one thing that I did not like was that the XMs did not have a built in speaker, but now that I have one I find the Xs work just as well. The best thing about the Xmr is that it is silent. I don't have to talk to the XMP on my car anymore. And I can have it anywhere in my house and it is safe. I love my XMR! - July 5, 2011Awesome product!  have one of the best computers ever, and this is my second XMR. - June 28, 2011awesome product!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first "professional" device. I have a Macbook pro and this works like a charm. I use it for gaming and when I need to look something up. I bought it as a gift for my nephew who uses this for video games. It has saved my life in the past but he is getting a new computer in a couple of weeks so I thought it was time to upgrade my equipment as well. It has never let me down and I can't wait to replace the dongle with my own. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I wish Apple would make the cables longer. There isn't much of a reason to use this for things you would use a USB-C to connect to a computer because it can't handle that much data and it has a limited amount of power. The USB-A to USB-B cable seems to be much better for these purposes. I can connect a flash drive to this with a USB cable, so the extra length would be a definite plus.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was really excited to get this for a few reasons: -The battery lasts for months (it's only 3.2 hours) -The software is easy to use, very easy to download (I'm a college student) -I thought it would come with a few different sizes of batteries and adapters -I was wrong   My favorite feature is the "sensing" feature. When the battery is close to empty, you can press the button to start sensing, and it'll let you know if it's close to running out of juice. It's really great, and saves me from using the device that's not nearly full.   Overall I am extremely happy with the purchase, and I really wish there was a battery with a larger battery life!

She also ordered it with a rechargeable battery as a birthday present for herself. It arrived very quickly and she had no trouble with it until the battery died. The problem was that the phone and the charger were not completely charged. Once she had the batteries charged she found the battery would not charge any further. It only took about an hour or so for the battery to go from half-full to full and then the charge would stop. I tried to send her an email to find out what was wrong but she still has not gotten it or received a response. I thought I would give this company the benefit of the doubt but it was not only bad customer service but the warranty was also worthless. I am hoping that other customers of this company are not given the same bad service.  Review of 5 Bowers & Wilkins V-Moda Wireless Headphones - Black I bought this for myself because of how great they sounded. I have my headphones in a bag in my vehicle and would only use them when I was outside. The only issue I had was that there was an audible click whenever I moved the headphones from a low setting to a high setting. I got a warranty replacement on my headphones but the replacement did not match the model number on the headphones. I'm going to ask them to mail me another pair and also to send a new box with the replacement headphones. If you're going to buy these because they sound so great you should know what they sound like. They're ok
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________________  I have had my new Bose sound bar for over a month now, and for me it is amazing. I was on my Xbox One which is an excellent product, however when I went to get a game to play, I noticed the game I wanted to play wasn't running at full speed, and I found the game not playing well. I thought it was my cables or the game just wasn't going to run. So, I ran down to the store, picked up a new set of cables, and then after about 5 minutes of playing the game, the game was back to full speed and I was able to finish the game on my new gaming system. I just think that Bose did an amazing job.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great product! This product is simply perfect for the price. It can be used anywhere you have a signal, like an ipod or gaming console. This is a great product to have.  the sound bar works well with the sound of my sound system and tv, it is great for keeping your music or TV's volume up and not loud. I use mine for movies too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I used this for my iphone 7 and it works great! i also used it with my macbook Air and it worked perfect also!!!! The sound quality is also very good.!!! Definitely a winner!  This is an amazing speaker with amazing quality and performance. I really appreciate this speaker, especially after the huge amount of noise that I heard from a portable player, so I took the plunge and bought this. This works great. The sound is crystal clear, clean and loud, and it's built strong. I use it with the Beats Pill+ for a couple of songs from the newest album by Drake. You can hear every detail in his vocals, with the bass. Not a huge fan of wireless speakers but this speaker is a very good alternative if you have the budget. I highly recommend!  A great speaker that's light, small and loud. The built quality of this speaker and the quality of the sound quality far outdoes the cost. A fantastic purchase. I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Works great. I was looking for a decent small portable speaker for when I travel and the speaker is great, easy to connect to my ipod. I can also use it on planes by connecting it to my headphones. , I've had this speaker for almost 2 years now and it still works perfectly. I used it for my iPod and the only thing that gets in the way is the battery life which is around 5 hours max. I like it a lot. .  that little speaker is really good. I have it connected to my iPod. And my wife has it connected on the back of her car. And they are both on airplanes at the same time.    Great quality for the price and has a very big sound range.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this thing. Great for my work and great to take with me for on the road use. The battery is a tad on the heavy side but it lasts a whole day. I have not experienced any issues with my wifi connection or video stream. It has no problems streaming video either. It would be nice if it came with an ethernet port. The device itself is very sleek and well made, you would not think a $150 device is much different from a $100.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s. this thing is really awesome, very convenient, nice screen, very light, no rattle, i dont really know why it took me so long to get one but i did. i bought my first phone from apple, but i wouldnt use it now as the screen is terrible (just looks like a screen from a phone) but now i have this new one and it is awesome! ive had a hard time getting my hands on a 4S as well but i was able to buy mine from the netgear store for only $149. and i can tell you this thing runs just like a 4s and it still has tons of power and it comes with a sim card, so thats not even an issue as well. and the only down side to the 4s is that it doesnt come with wireless. but for a phone with so much power and an even better screen the 4 is still pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************* I bought this unit a week ago and it has been perfect! I really like that you have the ability to get the unit back in the house by remote control. Also, it is not a heavy-weight unit that would cause the walls to sag and move around. The noise level is much less than what I would expect from a portable but it does have its advantages. The unit is very durable and has had no problems with leaking, and is much quieter than a portable. I have the same one and my husband is excited to take it for a spin with his friends next weekend, he says it is the best portable he has ever had. I will be buying another for my daughter, she loves to use it and takes it everywhere with her. It's not a cheap purchase but you are getting a solid unit for an excellent price. Also the included battery is also good and you can purchase a solar charger as well to get it going all the time. It is great for taking the kids to school, camping and for when you are just sitting at home all day with your tablet and don't have a good way to charge it up!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my sony digital sound blaster z since it was released in 2012. im a very audio geek, and am very pleased with the quality and features of my unit. i have had it a long time, and i love that it is a high quality unit. it can be used on its own for sound editing or mixing. i use it to record audio of my daughter for audiotape to listen to during nap time, because i dont have a computer or a recording device that can record audio. the sound quality is very crisp. i would recommend this unit to anyone that has a sony sound blaster. the z comes in a nice box, and the only downside to this unit is the remote. because it doesnt have a remote, the sound will not work if you are not looking at the z. this is an issue if you don't have a laptop with a keyboard and track pad that you can use to interact with the z from the z itself. overall i think this is a great unit, and it is worth every penny. i highly recommend this sony sb z unit.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarusbud Hi, ikaruS BUD has a cool LED flashlight that can be attached to your bike for light on your night rides. The light is very bright, but not blinding to the eyes at all, as other reviews have stated. The flash can also be used as a spotlight for your bike at night. I got this because my friend had one, but it was a lot cheaper. I use the light for nighttime riding and the flashing red and green light it emits makes my bike look more interesting. Great for late night road trips, or the last bike ride before you have to head home. I have a newer bike, and the light is a little brighter, but that's not an issue, as I don't really need any more lights in my life (at all). Great item!  Works well for my needs! Bought it with a little hope that it would perform better than the $100 LED bike lights I had been using in the past, but I have to say the BUDs work great! I used it for my own lights and for nighttime cycling with the light on my head. It is quite bright and is not blinding at all (I'm 5'10 and 180 pounds). The red/green LEDs work well for a low-intensity light, and when paired with my new red/white bike light, it can provide a much better lighting environment for biking in the dark. I would highly recommend buying the light to any of my friends who are cycling, as it's a great product, and even more when you get the bike light!  was just what I was looking for.  I needed a light with some flash to use on the road. After researching and comparing numerous lights, the BUB was the light that met all my needs. The price was a little bit steep, but worth it. The battery life was also very good. Great light and super versatile. , but this light is way more expensive.  The light works well and is bright but the light flashes very fast and then turns off, which I think is the reason the light was rated so high.  the BUMB light is much better. I've had it for about a week and I can't say enough good things about it, I recommend this light to anyone wanting a bright and good light. . It's definitely the brightest light I've ever used and has a great white light. The only thing that can give it
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *************************** The Sony Walkman was a very nice device, and if you need to listen to some mp3s with the stereo speakers it works quite well. It is a very easy to use device and you can do anything you want with it. If you use it like the iPod, which I don't recommend, it can play a lot of stuff but there is not much choice and it has a very small internal storage (5gb). If you don't use it much, don't worry about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I can't believe my eyes. This thing is awesome. The battery is great for a power bank. It can recharge a cell phone to about 80%. I did a lot of reading before buying this, and I'm amazed at the quality of this product.  It's so nice to be able to charge and check my phone while still in bed. If you use it as a phone charger then you will get about 60% for a few hours, but with this you will not need to charge it very often.  in fact it really charges your phone and your tablet so you have a phone battery with no charge, no power, a tablet battery which will be full, and a tablet charger battery which is about a 50% charge. that's good!  The charger is very durable and a solid piece of kit.    It is the first charger that has a magnetic plug.   I am giving it 5 stars for this, as I don't have a magnetic charger that works as well as this.  of course it's possible that there's another magnetic charger out there that can charge my phone like this, but in my opinion the quality is outstanding.   (i love this charger)   i also love the fact that it works with other usb chargers like the one i had the original one (no battery) and the one I bought, the original usb one.  I used that one for about 2 years, and it worked really good.  .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I've had my sony a6000 for about a month now. My primary use for it is for taking pictures with my camera in my car and the sony does a great job at what I'm doing. I would have given it five stars, but I've got to give a bonus because it does have some limitations. First of all it is not quite as fast as the hd. I was impressed with the s1 as it was the first one I bought. My only complaints with it were that I found the mic input was a bit limited at times and I didn't use the mic well on my hd so i don't know if it was just me. Another thing I wish they would have done was to make the camera compatible with the sd card. I've read on other sites that this is the problem with a6000. I have an sd card with over 10gb so I've tried it on both the a6000 and s1 and neither worked very well. But I didn,t really give up on the camera. But now that i have it I'm very happy with it. I wish there was more support for android devices. You have to download the s-on app for your phone to use the camera on that. And this is what really bothers me. The s-ons app is horrible. It crashes all the time. I can't seem to get any pictures to come out and I'm having problems with downloading them. I guess it would work better on a phone. I hope they get around to fixing this problem because they are killing the value of their product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive just bought my first ecobee thermostat and it is amazing. Its so easy to use, has adjustable temp, and a digital display. You cant beat it. I have a 4th gen evo and this is an upgrade from my old one. I love it.  I am a first time customer.

My only negative is that the instructions for the remote are lacking and the picture of the remote is not in the manual, but that's my only complaint. I will buy again and definitely recommend it!    I have a 3rd gen and I love this one. It did not have a remote so that was very cool. The ease of set up was also a huge plus. Easy to set temperature and keep it. The remote is great as well. Thanks for having it on sale. I did purchase a replacement remote as well for my old 3rd Gen and it was also easy to put together.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris T - 4th October 2008   It arrived quickly. I can't speak to the product quality. I'm still looking to get this to work on my iPhone (iPhone 4S) but so far so good. I also used it with my PC to play music on my iPod. There is one minor flaw. If you put the device in the "on" position it seems to take a very long time to get the blue light to turn off (about 2 min or so). I would like to get rid of the blue, and then it will be much easier to turn the light on again. / Chris T  Reviewed by - 29th September 2008  , Chris, Thank you for the review, this device works like a charm. The blue light does not come on even after a few minutes of holding the power button, and the battery life was quite impressive. The only downside I see is the blue. This blue light is not very noticeable when your device is powered off, and it will only appear when you are powering up again. That is why I recommend to power the light off for the first 2-3 minutes of power up,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you, I love the device, it can play a lot of the sound tracks from your DVD movies. I just bought it yesterday and I can already say the device does everything the DVD player can do.  Great product for the money:  Yes  This is an awesome product for less than $10. , I've been using the RCA Cable from Amazon for the past few years and I thought I would give it a try. This is the first time I've used the RJ45 connector and am pleased to report that it's as reliable as the old one. It comes with a plug adaptor for my Sony DVD player and I'm sure that there are other adaptors that will work as well. Also, if you are planning on plugging it into a TV, the cable comes with its own remote. This means you won't have to find a separate remote for your cable and the TV. Overall, I would recommend the Rca Cables to others and I'll be using them for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I got a Lenovo Y700s and I love it! It is a little heavy, but I do not want to be that heavy. I love the way that the Y700 has built-in speakers (speaker stand). It has USB 2.0, an SD card slot, ethernet port, and a VGA port! I also love the wireless card that comes with the Y-series. The build quality is great and the display is fantastic. I have been a laptop enthusiast for a long time and my laptop has been my main device for business and entertainment. I would say that this device is a great buy for all types of professionals. The only problem I had was with the power management setting in the OS. It will only work on 60hz with no option to lower it. So I set it to 60hz and it works great and works well in my system! I did notice that I had to change the keyboard back to the original and all of my contacts and passwords were changed back to their original values. So if you want to have 60hz on your laptop you can change it, but keep in mind that it will make your system unstable and you will have to revert to the 60hz setting. If you have problems with the keyboard and the power manage option just remove the keyboard to reset and change it back. I also had the problem with the bluetooth. It only works with my PC (included with my purchase) and I only had the option to use my phone. But I was happy to have that option since I had purchased my Y700 with the option of connecting my phone in my computer and also using the Bluetooth. It is very nice to be able to make use of the computer's wi-fi for the phone and the blu-ray player, as well. I do recommend purchasing the Y800 if you plan on having more than one person use the device. I could not find a way to have the Y600 and Y700 connect with one another, but the Y900 will work fine for this purpose.Read full review

So easy to use. It is great for those long flights when you need something quick to read. It also looks great. We plan to take it on our vacation to Disney World this year. Thank you for making such an amazing product!!!  I bought this for my 16-year-old son who has been reading books on his iPad, and Kindle (which is what I used last night). This is a very nice product. The price was fair for a high-quality product.  For the price, the product is great.  to me is a great alternative to iPads. I can read books on my Kindle, so that's a plus. ,

Very cool gadget, very light weight and with great battery life I can fit a full sized micro sd card with a few hours of music playback before I have to replace it. Only gripe is that there is no usb port but I'm sure that will be resolved in a firmware update.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the most well made and robust portable players I've ever had. The quality is better than any other I have used.   The battery life is very good and is better when used with Bluetooth headphones.  My only complaints would be the fact that there is no LED display to help see battery life, but as a portable device it is a good addition.  , by  , by   I use it in my car on the road so I don't always have a spot to use it. I love the fact it's very portable and does what it says.   the only thing i wish it had is an LED display and a battery that would last a few more hours. I don' have a charger so that is the only issue i have with the device.  the battery life on it is very excellent  This device is wonderful! I can't recommend this one enough.  an excellent value and well-made portable speaker, especially for those of you that use Bluetooth on a regular basis. The remote is also very handy and works great. I also really like how it connects to my iPhone and other MP3 players through the iD Bluetooth adapter.  as for the sound, it is not as good as some of the other portable speakers I own, but it has a great sound quality and I'm more than happy with the price I paid. I've been very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.  a very well made portable speaker and excellent sound quality. / by  is very nice and it's a little bit larger then some other bluetooth models.  and great sound, I use it as my main audio device and I love it  I have used the iDROID-C1 for a while now and I absolutely love it. Its a small and light device and does the job it was designed for. The wireless streaming is a great feature and the speaker is a nice size. A few extra features like an on-screen display to see the battery status, but that was already in the device when I got it. Great buy.  on the small side but very well built.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have tried several different radios including the SDR-DSP-1.1. It works great. The sound is very clear and very clear speech is just as clear with or without noise suppression. There are some other programs that allow you to add an AM radio station in addition to the regular AM. This is great because there is no need to be a radio amateur to do so. I would like to try the ARD-1 as well, but its not currently available. I recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i think i'll buy this one as well, especially since it is so cheap!  I think it is more then enough for my needs.  And i'm still undecided about which one to get since these are so cheap. , but i think the price difference between them are just around 1$.  As for my usage: i have a MacBookPro15,2 that is running a 4.8.4.1, the latest i386 Linux distro, OpenBSD and is running with my USB-cable which was not really used at all. I use a USB-receivers, but i only have one and so i don't use it very often (but if i decide to buy an external usb port, it would be for my workstation). It runs all my software perfectly and i'm pretty sure it will last a long time (which is a good thing). This is an excellent purchase i must say, so thanks for the fast delivery and good customer service.  and now i'm wondering where to buy a 4GB usb cable. (btw, this is a pretty good quality usb 3.0)  So in conclusion, this one is a perfect value

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a month now and it is the best portable bluetooth speaker in the world. ive used other bluetooth speakers but nothing compares to this one. it is very nice and the sound is amazing.  My favorite Bluetooth speaker by a mile: ives been looking for a bluetooth to use on-the-go and ive finally found one. its small, lightweight, great audio, great features, and is easy to use. im also very impressed with the build quality of the speaker. if youre looking for an electronic device to listen to music or movies without carrying them around its hard to beat this product. it is also easy to connect to a pair of bluetooth headphones if you dont have a bluetone.  to everyone wondering about the best bluetooth receiver to use with the speaker: this is what ive found works best with my speaker: 1. the bluetones work well with the bluetoon. you need a bluetoone adapter with your blueton adapter. for more info on bluetona adapters check this link: https://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-Bluetooth-to-Bluetooth-Adapter-with-Built-in-Audio-Out-Connector-/13108716087  Worth Every Penny: I was so glad I came across this device. It is extremely small, light and powerful. It gives you an incredible audio experience. My headphones are great quality and the quality of sound I get is amazing for the price.  I am using the same model for about a month and so far it has never given me any trouble.  you also have the option to put bluetontones with or without the bluetooth adapter.    My only complaints: The battery lasts forever.  The volume is loud but it needs to be louder  Great for traveling:  this is the perfect companion for me while traveling.  it can easily be charged over the power source with a usb port but this is not an issue since the blueteons has a usb output. : )  I've been using my wireless speaker for months! by B. J. ,  You can't beat the sound of the bluetherone. Its great! I also have a wireless sound system that I travel with so I can have bluetooth devices playing in my car. It

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* I bought this a while ago as a backup for a MacBook Pro. I just ran a new SSD into the laptop and now use the mpsqc as my main drive. It works fine as a regular HDD. It also works fine with my backup computer, but I have no idea how the drives are connected to it. It's a cheap external drive and works as a drive, just like all of the other drives on my MacBook Pro, so I'm not too worried about this. It doesn't get hot and is silent so its good for storing media or whatever you want to do. It was only $29.00 (now on sale at $19.00). It's also really light and doesn't take up a lot of space. I got it in the "hard drive" section of Amazon for $19, and I don't think I could find it cheaper anywhere else. Great deal for the drive.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Michael in Florida from Great drive It has been two years since I last bought a computer. The price of these external HDDs has been falling steadily and when they were not available I bought another brand for my desktop and laptop computers. This drive came with all of my computer and work gear and is still going strong. I've used it for a lot and had to use an external drive to store my media. This is a great buy. If you are thinking about purchasing this product you are a lucky person.  (more)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using my Nook Simple Touch for several years, and I've never been happier with the performance or reliability of its new firmware (Nook HDF 6.4.2) and all its functions. I've also updated my NOOK HDF 4.5 with NOOK Reader HD for the improved search function. If you want an easy way to search through the hundreds of ebooks, magazines, and newspapers you have stored on your Nook device, NOOK Simple Touch is the right tool for the job.   If you have a newer NOOK device, you should also check out the new NOOK Camera HD, which gives you more features for free than many of its competitors charge for.   and check out other features of NOOK for even more information: http://www.nook.com/help/firmware/

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit is the right size and the interface is easy to use. It is a little more cumbersome than some of the cheaper units. But the price was right and that was the main reason I bought it. This is the first time I purchased a product from an electronics retailer and I am very pleased with the result.   Also I would like to compliment the person who was on the phone to make sure that everything was going to work out.  Great Unit!!! I was a little leary of the whole concept of this unit being used for the purpose of a remote control or control of a device over the internet. I was pretty confident that the unit would only work with one type of device at a time but it works with the majority of devices I have in my house. I just wish it was slightly smaller.   on a personal note - I have had the remote for about a month now and it is an excellent piece of equipment. I have already ordered another one. My wife has also purchased one as she likes the fact it is so compact. The quality of the remote is incredible, even though it's made in China.       great remote I use this for remote control of my VCR and am very happy with it. It has some very cool features. It allows me to play videos in different modes. You can control the volume and video content at the same time.  - it has three main buttons, a play/pause button, and a pause/play button. it also has a mute button. This unit has two volume buttons as well as a video/audio button. The mute is really handy if you have a video system that you want to block out the sounds but the volume is where it's at.   This unit is also very compact - it's the only remote I have that is small enough to fit in my laptop bag. If you have one of the newer remotes, the power button on it is in the wrong place, so you need to press and hold it for a second to get it to work.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it now for over a year and it has not broken. the problem with the iphone is you can't use it like you used to because the buttons no longer are in the same spot on the ips. they are all over the place! but, if you can get used to the new style and buttons, it is really nice and much more secure than the ipod 3's. the only downside of iphones is the size but that's just not a big deal because it can only fit one thing at a time!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a professional musician who frequently works with keyboards. I bought this keyboard to replace my old IBM Keyboard. It replaced the original keyboard in a laptop I have used for over a year. It has not only replaced that keyboard in my laptop, it has surpassed the original in every way. This is the best keyboard I have ever used, and I own several. My only complaint is that I wish I had bought it years ago when it first came out. I had a lot of bad experiences using the first version of this keyboard. The key spacing was way off, the key placement was far from the center of the keyboard, it was very noisy, and it was quite clunky to type on. The 2nd version was a big improvement. It's quieter, keys don't vibrate when the keys are pressed and when a key is depressed, the sound is much lower. My original keyboard had some issues. It is hard to push the wrong key, it is very clunky on the front, and on the back it is hard on the wrist. However, the other things it has that make it a great product are: It is so light, it doesn't move around. The back of the case is quite sturdy. The keys themselves are quite well constructed, and they're not mushy when depressed. The keyboard is so convenient to type with. The USB port is on the side, so it is easy to keep it in your bag, it does not make a big noise when plugged in, and when I first plugged it in, the USB port didn't work at all. I replaced that with a USB port on the bottom, and with that, everything works perfectly now. It comes with a great warranty, and an amazing customer service from B&H. I highly recommend this keyboard, especially to beginners, because it is so easy to type and so comfortable to type. It even has an on-screen guide to show you how to type each character. I will continue to use this product as I own it. I only wish I bought it at the time this review was published!  " Great Keyboard. The price is right. But I didn't like the "keyboard sounds" switch. It seemed to change the sound that was created with each keystroke. It was an annoyingly loud and annoying switch. This switch is not necessary on this product. "
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichimatsu_vii This is a great product. It fits the bill. It works well, its very well thought out and it doesnt leak at all. I bought this for my wife who is diabetic and it has been great. It will definitely make her life easier and more comfortable with the less amount of insulin on her. Also, it works well with the old, and the new type of insulin pump. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in having it. It is priced well.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mimi23 from Great Pump This pump is wonderful. I had been using my daughter's pump but had to switch to a pump of my own and was hesitant about a generic one. This one seemed a lot better. The battery life is great. If I had the time and money I would buy 2. If you have a child with diabetes, this is a must-have. :D  Excellent pump. Good price. . I am so thankful I bought the iCAN and I'll be using it for years.  in my family it's always a problem to keep the insulin pens full. This pump makes keeping insulin pens all day/night easy, and i can keep my insulin vials in it too. I can keep a full pen in the vial, and another in my pocket for emergencies or to hand out. I get up in the morning and no insulin vial is half empty. I just keep the vials with me, and when I need to feed my daughter and get some insulin for my own use I just take out the vitals and the pen from the pen and put it in the syringe. Then i do the same for my son for his vitals, and then i go to work. I also like how the cap that you have to screw on the pump, is so easy to get off.  The only negative I have with the iCan is the cap. I found it very hard to screw the cap on. , as far as the pump itself, it has worked out great for my needs, and I would recommend it to anyone. It's so easy and easy to use. My daughter and I love it. The only thing is I wish the battery life was longer.  I also love the fact that you can use this as an IV drip too. I do wish the vita clip was a little more secure than the one on the original

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* This is a very nice, very functional, high quality, compact, easy to use, good sounding, very comfortable speaker.  The sound is just right, it has a little bit of hiss in the highs and lows and is more of a bassy sound.   It is really great when you are looking for a good pair of headphones, not too expensive and not too large.  I do not find the sound too much like the HD668.  One thing I don't like is the volume controls are located on the top of the headset which is pretty much impossible to reach with gloves on.  If the volume was on the left side I would be ok with that, but it is on the right side and it just makes me not want to use it.

That's right...I am back. I know that if I had to buy this tv again, it would be a no go. I will be contacting sony for my refund. I have read the reviews of all the good reviews of this product and they all rave about the excellent screen resolution and the picture quality. However I am disappointed that I can't get it to work. The signal is really weak. I tried the remote and the HDMI output cable (with it attached to a Samsung plasma HD and a Sony HD) and it doesn't work at all. There is nothing at all on the remote control to tell you that it's not connected to a TV. This is a problem with all of their products. I would just purchase another Samsung HD/HD-SDI receiver and use that with the TV. I just hope the video quality will be better. This tv is a waste of money and time for me."

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, March 20, 2014  good product  by A Customer from CA USA  Pros: very easy, has a decent heat capacity  Cons: none  Review: After having the original one, I decided to give this one a try.   I would give this unit 5 stars if they made this one in a different color.  The price point is reasonable. It is great.  that being said I have not been using it for the past 2 weeks. The first problem I was having was when it came in to hot water. I was able to get the hot water out of the unit but the water was very hot. I am not sure why that is but I took it apart. I found that the plastic handle of the top handle broke off. I got a replacement handle with the same diameter and it worked fine.  in the past I have had the plastic handles break so i am concerned the hot handle will break in the future. The other thing i noticed is that the temperature readout was very high. I have to keep the kettle at the highest temperature i can and the temperature readings are usually in the 90s. I know I will get better accuracy with time as the temperature gets higher.  and i will give this a 5 out of 5 stars.  ,  Thank you for your feedback on the i kettle

Its not as accurate as I thought it would be but i have had a good experience so far with this product.  ,,   Very happy with it so far!   I have had the electronic tracking unit for about 4 months now and I am very happy with this unit. It is much more accurate than what I have used in the past. The batteries are easy to replace as well. I just wish that the tracking system had the ability to show you the current battery voltage so you could monitor the status of the battery more easily.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This keyboard is great! I've been searching around for a mechanical keyboard and finally found one. It's so much more satisfying to type on this than a laptop. There's a little bit of noise on the keyboard, but that's just to be expected.  When it comes to typing on the computer, the quality of the keys is much higher than on a keyboard of the same size. This is why it's so nice to be able to use this with my tablet.  The keys feel very solid.  It has a really smooth feel, so it's really pleasant to type with.    It's also nice to have the option of an extra USB port.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for about a month now. It has great features, but has a little problem i dont like. When you get into a game or a movie, the controls feel very stiff. Like when you get onto the couch to watch a movie it feels like you are going to throw the tv. That being said, if you have to use it when you are in front of a TV, it works great. Overall great device and i think a very well designed device. Highly recommend this device if you want great features at a good price. I own other devices but this is by far my best choice.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Advanced Quadcopter by Dave of Phoenix AZ on June 23, 2014. This quadcopter is one of the best I have flown yet. I have been flying for about 10 years now and I was using a Phantom 1 and a Phantom 2 for about 2 years each. I recently purchased a DJI Inspire 1. It is one step ahead of the Inspire 2. This quad is one smooth airplane that will take you anywhere. I can't believe that DJI will allow you to purchase this product in only 4 colors. I got this in the clear color, it looks like a regular Phantom. I will get the pink, black and white in the near future, if I can get the clear back in stock. Djigie has done a great job at making this quad so user friendly. All in all, it's a great quad, a must have for anyone who wants a fun airplane. My main reason for purchasing this quad was because it had 4 color options, I wanted to have as much control over it as possible so I can change colors for different things. I love it, and I recommend it to all my friends who fly quad.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This device has been great to me because it is very easy to use, is very efficient and has no moving parts that can cause any damage. It is also very quiet. I don't want to be without it in case I need it.  Write a negative review about the bad:    The device is very noisy and has a lot of moving parts. It was a little tough for me to use. The battery is a little weak. There is no power button on the front of the unit. It takes 2 to 3 hours to recharge, and it was very slow to do so.   After recharging I noticed the color of the screen was a bit off.   The batteries have lasted me over 2 years of use without any issues. The only issues I have had were the two batteries inside (one is a 3.7v Lithium-Ion and the other a 3v Lithion-I on a 6 cell BMS) I had to replace them a couple of times to keep the batteries from being damaged.  . It will be a tough sell for those who are not comfortable dealing with the battery issues.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus_2 This is the best thing I have bought. It has saved me from using my old ipad because it works just as good. The best part is that you can use it with most of my ipad accessories. I also can use the ipad stand with this. If you do not need a stand, do not buy this but if you do, this will fit in almost any laptop or ipad or ipod or anything with a usb port.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is awesome I use it for a number of applications, for one thing it was my first time using an android and it really helped in the beginning, also it is quite easy to program and change the functions of the phone on it.  I have been using a cell phone for 6 years and have always used a touch screen, and the first android was a little bit hard on my finger. The touch screen of the i-Phone was a dream to use, and i-Device was a good purchase. , and now I have a wonderful replacement for the phone which i never had any need for. It has many great features and I am so happy I bought it, thanks Apple I.  and if you use it right it will save you a great deal of time and effort.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â  It's an inexpensive portable MP3 player with a great set of features. It's not just a great mp3 player. It has the best built-in audiobook player out there. It works with any of the major audiobooks (including ebooks and audioboom) and it has a huge library of music too. I used it primarily for audio-books (audiobooks, audiobooths, etc) but it also works great as an iPod/iPhone speaker for your computer. You can also record and listen to your own mp3's while you work on your computer, too. It also has a mic so you can talk to yourself while you listen to music. It can play files of any size. It would be better if it could play mp3s from your computer but I didn't expect that from it's price tag. Overall, the device works well and it is extremely easy to set up.  Have you tried it?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price, it is great. I can easily get through a few hours with the built in speakers. The sound is better than some higher end portable devices (though still lacking compared to high end music players like the Pioneer PXW-V1), and the built-in speakers provide an adequate sound stage. I recommend this to those looking for an all-in-one solution.   I have been using this for almost two months and love it!   You can plug this into my laptop via USB (for video and music) and the USB is all I use for data.  -Steve   My Experience:   This is the first audio player I have used, and I am very impressed with it. I was looking for a portable player that would play my music from my laptop, and also a solution for music I want to play while I am out running errands. I wanted something that would last for years, and this player delivers with a simple USB plug and play system.   is a powerful player with an excellent selection of CDs and DVDs. I have an iPod but found that it can get very hot, and would be a real pain to charge, especially when on the road. It can also be a pain to transfer files between devices. So I wanted this player to be as easy to use as possible, and it does that and then some. For the price it does what I need it to do, and can be easily upgraded with the USB port I use it with, which adds it to my family's audio system.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've just received the e-cig and as a former smoker I was excited when I read the reviews of the new E-cigarette, but when I opened the box it didn't feel very nice. The box looked cheap and not professional. It was rather thin but that's because it's a small battery and it's in a big black box. When it arrived it was rather hard to open due to the box. I wasn't sure what to expect from this e-cig, I just wanted it to be ok, and I wasn�t disappointed, I was very pleased to find out that it's just a normal battery. I use a Nitecore C4 with this device so I have the exact same type and brand of battery. The battery has a blue ring around it that is similar to the other models. As for the vapor, it is not strong. It is not going to get you high (well it's better than the old e-cigarettes), but it will give you a nice vapor, and it stays on for quite some time. If you like to get really strong it will be the best thing you could get from this product. It's not really any better than normal vapes for this, but you'll enjoy it much more. The problem I have with this product is that it has a low power output. It will only give you 4 hours of use, but if you want you can buy a replacement battery for $8. I like it a lot, I wish they'd change the batteries so that it would last longer, it's nice to have a battery that last longer.

Did you find this helpful? 5 of 5 Found Helpful  Crisper and more precise than i thought it would be! by: Merengue from Las Vegas, NV on 6/16/2014 5 / 5 I just got the Ixvibe2-S. It's smaller and thinner than my old i.v.e.2 (2.0, which is a must-have). It has a slightly higher output, more volume. It also vibrates more softly, which works well for my tastes. The vibrations are great and not too hard. The head is also much more precise, which I enjoy. The i.e's are great, but for me, the I.V.e2 was a little too big. I am 5'8", 120 pounds, and it was way too big for me. Also, it's a little bigger than my I.O.I., which was the second I.v.'s I tried and I liked it more. This one seems good, but I will probably wait until they get this version smaller in the future.  the only issue is that it's not waterproof and has no built in charger. But then, I don't think it really needs a charger. other than that, a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this as a birthday present to my boyfriend. We are very happy with it, I'm going to send him one to replace one that has a burnt out circuit and is going to take over his TV from time to time.

This one is so much cheaper than the original, as well as better quality and better features. I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Write a negative review about an ok electronic device:(  This thing sucks. . I wanted a remote control to play my iPod (and my iPhone's music) from my iPhone. I got this for $35, so, I thought what the hell, why not. I had been wanting to use my cell phone as a remote to control my TV, but this one sucks so bad. The buttons are all over the place and they don't work at all, so no iPod play/pause or anything. My only good thing about this is I can see a big difference when I watch a show on my iPhone or iPod. It's not as bright as my TCL set. But when it comes to the big screen TV I still need a remote, and this one doesn't cut it. It might work with some older TV sets, but not my newer set (4K with a 4k picture). I'm giving it a 4 for not being good.  for $350 I could have gotten a more high quality remote. ,  Don't get this thing  It takes a very, very long time to turn off your TV! I got it because I have an older model Samsung that requires an in-line remote, but it will not turn off my Samsung. It takes a while to turn it off. I don't want to leave it on any longer than I need to. So, after all that, I don' t like it, and I have now spent more than $350 just on the remote and this thing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is the best price of any in-built remote you can find that will turn off the TV automatically. I have been searching for weeks. I am just going to get my Sonos Playbar now. And maybe the Sonos one with a built in remote. They were my last two choices because of cost and size. I'm just surprised that

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iced tea maker I bought this to be my only portable coffee maker. I read the directions, and did what they said. However, it will not brew a decent cup of coffee. I did the coffee maker and had to throw the cups away after a week. There is not a large enough wok for the pot to heat enough to make a decent mug. This thing is great for brewing hot water, but not good for coffee.  Works Great! I bought 2 of these with different sizes for different areas. The first thing I noticed is how well they are built. This is made by a large company. I think they would be hard to go wrong with. If you want a more portable device that can work just fine without a separate coffee maker, these are a great choice. The 2-cup size seems to work pretty well with my kitchen stove. I have bought other portable coffee makers but none have met my expectations. I will probably buy a couple more for the campground and car camping. I am very happy with these.  that is how we make it and make the most of our time. That is how it was with my grandfather. He had a wood burner that could get very hot and I could use it to heat water. My mom also has a wood grinder. The coffee maker works great with them. .    These are excellent! This coffee maker is very good quality, sturdy and compact. The brewer is good, but it needs more volume to brew more than one cup.  as you can see in the picture I got a 10 cup one but the 10 cup doesn't have a lid, I put a cup with a lid on a piece of cardstock and put it into the bottom, but I have yet to make coffee and use the lid, so if you are like me and just want a 10 or 20 cup brew with a large brewer this is perfect. The size of the pot and the lid are exactly as advertised. The only thing I wish it had was a small pour spout. But overall a great product. -David.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Samsung S3 (2.5g/16Gb) is great for my daily use. It has good speed and it has a very good build quality and is durable. I can handle more and more applications on this laptop. For the price I have not been able to find any better or cheaper laptops. It is fast enough and can also play the DVD without issue. There are a few problems with it. The battery has to be replaced after a year. The processor has a problem of having a hard time with applications that do not use all the resources. The hard disk on the laptop is a bit slow so that may slow down your computer a bit too. You can get a cheap new hard disk in the market and it will be just fine. But I would recommend the new ones because of the quality and price.

Rated 3 out of 5 by JT from Nice Price, But Not a Good Speaker I really wanted an mp3 player to take with me. This worked well for that purpose, but I wasn't too happy with the sound quality. I can't tell if the sound is being recorded or if it is just some other type of device being played back. It doesn't sound great from my car stereo either. I was going to give this one a 3 but it only got a 2 because the sound was too tinny and lacking bass. Also, the remote is easy to lose.    What is so great about it?  What's not so great?  The sound is a bit tinny, it's not even a cheap MP3. It's really not good. My favorite MP3 player is the Sony PXC-400. I love Sony stuff, so I was pretty disappointed.

The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no on/off switch. So you have to always listen to it for a few seconds and turn it on and off like every other iPod. Its so weird. Another thing I have an issue with is that the batteries go bad fast! Ive had mine for a month and my batteries have already died. So its a bit of a hassle to change batteries. -Linda  This is a good product, but not for me. I got the Iuwave. It is tiny. It fits on your keychain and takes up very little space. It takes some practice to get good control of the volume. You can turn the volume up or down by clicking and holding down the volume buttons on your iPod touch or iPhone. The volume is adjustable. The sound is good and the quality is high. However, I don' like that I can't control the volume when I'm not using my iPhone or iPod. I just put the headphones on to listen. The battery life is short. The only problem I have is that it doesn't come with an adapter to play audio files on my iPod, i.e. MP3 files. It doesn't have an adapter built into the headphone itself. So I have to buy an adapter for my iPod when I plan to use the Iudwave as a portable speaker, or put the adapter on the back of the Iuds and plug in my iPhone. I don 't like this, but I could live with it. :I bought this Iud Wave after hearing reviews

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using the wireless remote with the bluetooth connection for the past three months and it works perfectly. It allows you to control the volume of any of the six channels, and it has good voice command capability. There are a few flaws in the remote (no way I am ever going back to the crappy remote on my old cable box) but I'm happy that I found something else that works just as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the look, I love the function, and I love my ZEN5. It's a perfect tool for anyone who wants to have an extra tool when they are out and about. It is a little bulky for me because it's got a case, but for those with the same needs as me, I recommend it highly.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, September 14, 2009  very good product  by A Customer from Santa Fe NM USA  Pros: compact  Cons: none  Review:  Good for general purpose use and its light weight. The only thing that could be done better is a slightly lighter weight battery for when you don't want to carry your charger.  it does exactly what I need it to.  to carry a few extra items I carry a battery pack and usb cord, however this product has a rechargeable battery, and would be very good for someone just using this product for a short while.  the only downside is the size of the product which can make it uncomfortable to hold.  (for me it is)  the only thing i don't like is the charging plug being small. the usb cord is a standard usb cord  But overall very happy with it  (the only negative is this is my first ZEN model and i must say that i am very pleased) .  of course i will order more. ,  Very pleased with the product.  and the price was great. :)  to use for short period of time.  was the best choice i have made to get extra battery, I am very happy i bought it.  in the future, ,I would recommend this product to anybody who wants extra battery for their smartphone.  be sure to use the proper size usb cord as i have to my self. The ZEN 5 is great for everyone who needs it!  This product works great and will come in handy when needed. .

The first time I used this I didn't like it, I had already bought a different product so I was just testing it out and it actually felt very similar. I had it on for about 10 hours at a time and it only needed to be charged about twice (at the end of each session). It's really a great price for the quality of the product and is a bit of a challenge to get it out.

It was shipped very fast and I have it set up and running. It is easy to setup and run and I use the cable for my iPod. The only con that I have is that it does not have the memory port for the iPad or iPhone and I can't use the USB adapter but that is not a problem for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I just received my Apple Watch this morning, but I already love it! I have the Apple Music app which is wonderful, I just bought a new iPhone so I will have all the music I need on there as well as all the other apps I own. This watch does all that I need and more. It can do the basics very well. For example, I am working on a 3d project right now and have the ability to do multiple things simultaneously. I can control all of the lights on the room by just tapping the side buttons. When I put it on the night stand, I have all of my music and my phone and everything else on the watch and the apps on my phone. I don't miss having to reach up to my phone to start a project. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone. It's very easy to use, looks beautiful, and the battery is really good. The one downside is that the battery life can be a little low at times, but that can be fixed by adding a charging case. Overall, I'm very happy with this watch and would buy it again in a heartbeat!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********This is the first keyboard on the market, and it's awesome, it can hold a full size laptop. I've only had it about a month, but it has become my daily driver, I can type with no problems, it is easy to use and it works well with my laptop.It comes with a macro mode that I haven't tried yet, but I am told it can be fun to use. The keycap is also really nice. The build quality is good and the quality of the switches is good. I bought this so my hands don't hurt any more and I want to type more comfortably. It's pretty much a must have if you like to use your laptop on the go. I'd recommend this if you are looking for something that is portable and that won't hurt your fingers.  Rated 5 out of 5 by AussieBiker from Fantastic Product I've been using my K70 for the past few weeks and couldn't be happier with it. It does exactly what I need it to. This is my second K70 keyboard and my first full size one. I have been using other mechanical keyboards, but this is by far my favourite. The switch action is smooth and quiet. I was having a bit of trouble with my old keyboard so I took a chance on this one and it worked out really well for me. You can't go wrong with this keyboard, and I highly recommend it.

I use the device on my computer and have the same results.  Rated 4 out of 5 by GJL from Very Good I love this little thing, I use it as an external hard drive to a notebook. It works well, I have two of these now and I will be buying more.  a very good price for the good value  This product has everything that a laptop or external harddrive should have in a tiny form factor. For a great price, this item is one of the best that I have seen in recent years.   The unit I purchased was the standard 1 GB model. I am running Linux in this configuration and it works flawlessly. The product will run for a few years with minimal care, so a great value for the price.  The only complaint I have with this product is the cable that comes with the product was for a different unit than mine and it was a long thin piece of plastic that would get caught on anything in your lap. Fortunately, I ordered the correct cable for mine but the cable is still useless.  it is a great little product that works just like a regular usb hard drive and works just as fast. I've had it about a week and it has held up very well.  at $39.99, i do not know how this would compete to the "regular" external hard drives.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________ This is the first time I've used an iPod Touch and it has really improved my life in a big way. I used to have a crappy laptop computer but the new iPod is way better and faster than the last one. I had my old computer up for about 4 months. After I got the new one I had to take it down to be able to put it in the iPod but it works better than the old computer. When you connect it to your computer, you see a black screen that shows the songs. It just looks really cool. I use my iPod as a MP3 player and it makes it way easier to play music on my computer. I also use it as a scanner for email, but for the most part I don't have to do much on my PC and don't use the scanner all that often. The iPod is definitely a must have device.

I've been using it for months now, and have not found anything better. It's extremely portable, is so quiet, and the features are more than enough to satisfy anyone who wants to do a bit of mixing and mastering with it, no problem. The USB port is also very fast, and works great with a host PC. Also a very nice price too!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Sony e-mount camera (a Sony HX-NX900F) and recently I found out that the mount does not work well with my Sony a6000 (and with other Sony a6 cameras). This camera is the one with the external power supply (like in the Canon AE100), the USB cable (like Nikon and Canon AE-1), and the battery charger. I also have a Ricoh GR II and it works well for me. The camera itself is so compact that it is hard to use it without holding it in a tripod. But I have had a hard time finding a good case for it. Anyway, I finally bought a RicOH GR II case, so I was able to use this camera. I have to say that I'm really happy with it. A great price, very good quality, I've had mine for a couple of months, but I'm not even close to the end of the warranty period, so it still works like it should.   Was this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very happy with my iMac I purchased this because I wanted to have the ability to edit video on my computer while using a phone, so I couldn't have both. I was pleased that I can do video editing while taking calls on my phone and I also am very happy that it is easy to take the computer out and use my phone when I have work in the office. I have also taken my computer with me in my car and used the internet while driving.  -Mike   I have been in business for 20 years and have never heard of a product that actually does what it promises. It is a very reliable product and performs exactly as expected. I used to own a Sony a6000, I just switched to the iMac. I just couldn't stand the fact that my old a6000 did not do everything that my i Mac did... so I decided to replace it. I installed the i Mac Pro. Now this computer is even better then my a6000. And it does everything the a6000 does but better. No complaints.  it has 4 video outputs, 3 i-Mac and one a6000 and you can use either a phone or a camera. It does have the full iphone app which I highly recommend, the software is awesome. I also use my iphones camera app to take video. It saves me a lot of time and money. It also has 2 gig of memory.  at a low price I wouldn't trade it for anything.    -Andrew   My new computer was a no brainer. It's a very quiet, light weight, and powerful system. It runs my i7-2720QM processor, 16GB ram, and 512GB SSD (SSD not solid state drive, as originally advertised). I've run it in both my home and work environment, which is an unusual setup in my experience. I use it as my home theater, and with my wireless keyboard, mouse and Apple wireless keyboard and mouse combo, it does a fantastic job of handling my gaming, streaming, etc. I haven't found any reason why it wouldn't work in a professional environment. I love the fact you can change from a laptop to a tablet mode very quickly. The iMac has everything that I want in a computer. I think I might have to get another one for my wife. The keyboard is amazing. It doesn't have the tactile bump that some keyboards have. It gives it a

I had been using the camera with a DSLR but wanted to have a bigger screen and better zoom and image quality. I was not disappointed. It is so easy to use and has a very fast shutter speed. For low light situations it is excellent. It has good battery life and will work for a long time. I can't wait to add the camera to my Sony NEX mount camera.  (I was able to use the camera from an iPhone for a quick image of my car.)  It is great, but I wish I had known about this product when I first purchased my camera! The auto setting is set way too low! I have my own camera, and after a few pictures, it starts taking pictures that are too fuzzy! I turned the auto-focus off and set it to manual. I only set the lens to f/2.0 so I could use it with my own f/1.7 lens from Sony. I really like this camera, but need to learn how to use auto focus. Also, the manual zoom doesn't work on my own lens (Sony FE 55mm f/0.8), and when I tried, I found the lens was out of focus. I have to look for the manual setting, and manually adjust the camera's setting to compensate for the zoom (and the manual focus to compensate).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________  Love this tool!!! I just started with it a few days ago. I bought it because I can't really do without my old one and I need to be able to access the computer and do my homework. I don't really need the extra weight but I know how much weight it brings out of the box. The only thing I don`t like about it is that it has a screwdriver tip but you can't use it as a regular screwdriver as the tip gets in the way. If you buy the larger version you can use it like a screw driver. It really is a great tool.  Excellent Tool This is my second set of toolkits I've purchased from LIFX.

I have bought a lot of tool boxes and the lighthouse is my favourite!!! It is easy to open,easy to clean and easy to carry around. It also has the very cool "I know" feature which tells you if the lighs are on the screen and if they are not you have to open the box to see if they go on the lcd... Very good!!!

Review by Michael D. The quality is very nice for the money. Very comfortable to wear. My main beef is the batteries, which seem to die off easily.  Very good sound, not too expensive but the batteries fail every few months.  the sound is good and very comfortable  Great sound for the price!  the best sound for your money!! The sound is great and comfortable to listen to.. I have only used it for a few months so far, but I'm really impressed with the quality and sound quality.  is a good sound but is the only one I would buy this for. is also not as good as a sound card and has problems with the battery. I will update this review after a year! . . _________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichristoph - July 16, 2016 Very good for it's size and battery life.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 30, 2016  No Review helpful? Yes  by: Michael from New York  Pros: Lightweight, battery lasts a long time, works well  Cons: Very hard to adjust dials, no way to make it easy to turn on/off.  "Batteries last 2 years" is not a good marketing slogan. It seems like they have a problem and just never know what to do next.  the battery life has been amazing. I have used the device for several years, and it has never died. I use it on the road for about 20 minutes at a time at most. I am very satisfied, it is a must have product for anyone who takes a lot of travel. , by: Michael St. Pierre, from New Rochelle, NY,  Reviewers: Alan, A Customer from Ohio  The B-1 is a great travel device. It was the only one I was able to locate on-line when my first one, which was a Fostex, was stolen. I'm using mine to record music in the studio and a few hours later have a full stack of CD's. The B1 has made traveling easier.    The only issue I have with it is that it's a pain to adjust the volume up or down. But, that's just a minor complaint. :)  ,, by: Alan from Ohio, from Ohio Cons: The "batteries" last only a year, but are rechargeable, and they were easy to find on the web. - The battery life is extremely good! I have been using it for 2 years with no issues.  be patient, they are tough to replace  I have no problem with the buttons being hard to find. The first couple of times I found one they were in the back of the device. I had to do a bit of searching, but once I found them they were fairly easy to locate. They all look like little circles. That is a good thing because it saves you looking in that small space.   There are a few other things that have changed, but nothing major. The remote is a bit better. The buttons on the side that have the knobs are much easier to find than on the front panel
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikos I recently purchased this Ipod and it is absolutely great. I used it to listen to a couple of my favorite radio shows, and it was flawless! The first episode I listened to on it was the second episode of the Simpsons. I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family, I cannot believe the quality of the Ipod.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mr. I and a Mr. II from A really good buy I purchased this product for my wife. She uses it as a MP3 player and as a music player. She's been using a couple other mp3 players, but this one's so well built that it works just as well. It plays music really well. The only problem I have is that it doesn't have the battery capacity to last a full day. She can listen to music for about 2 hours without needing to charge it, but I can't wait to get an hour or two before I have to go out to the store to buy a new battery.  "Love this product"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my new computer! It comes with a couple of games I like to play and it's very fast and has great sound and graphics. I love the computer and I can't wait to upgrade to a more powerful one in the future.Read full review I've had this laptop for about three months now and I think I'll be replacing it with a new one for sure.  It was an excellent purchase, great value for the money and was able to handle my most demanding and demanding use cases with ease.  I had no problems using it, it is extremely well made and sturdy.   The only problem I had was with the graphics card.  I found that it constantly has a small blue light when there is any current draw on it (unlike my previous graphics card).   The graphics card is very quiet but it's really annoying to have to adjust it every time I want to do something with my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum keyboard to replace a much older keyboard which I had a few years ago and which I also found to be defective. It had a key that would jump to the next letter if the cursor was in the middle of the alphabet. I tried to move the cursor to the middle and the key would not let go. I have always had a high tolerance for things that will not work properly. After some research, I found that the problem was probably with the Logitech's keyboard firmware (which is proprietary). This keyboard would not be a good alternative to the older one, because you would have to buy a different type of firmware. It is definitely a good deal and I was surprised how much better the keyboard is than the old one.  Good value for money:   In my opinion, the price is right for a good quality keyboard. It's the same price as the older, faulty keyboard and it works with all operating systems and applications. It also comes with the extra function keys and the number pad. The only problem I have with the keyboard (and the one I encountered on this keyboard) is that you cannot install it with the supplied Windows driver if the Windows software is not compatible. When I first installed it, it took quite a while for the driver to install, and even though it was installed properly, it would not function properly with the Windows OS. A lot of keys:

I have yet to find a better one!!!!!!!  by J.G. on 06/21/2015 byon 06/13/2015 "  This is a nice little earbud. It can pick up any audio signal. If you want a little more audio you can get a more powerful unit from Audio Technica.  The earbuds are very lightweight and very flexible. The cable is very hard to break but you can break them but you need to use a small flat head screwdriver to get them to pop apart.  I do not think they can last very long but the earbuses seem to last the long haul.    Read More Reviews

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have the mf8a2 and I find the display a bit disappointing. The contrast is a little low but the color is great, and it does not have as much brightness as I had hoped. It also is not very accurate. I use the unit to take pictures and it tends to be a bit too cold (sometimes it will be too warm). It is also difficult to use while sleeping or driving.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, March 20, 2014  Great and useful  by Michael from San Francisco CA USA  Pros: Very good clarity. Can do all things without getting confused as to which unit is on/off.  is easy to use. , works great  Cons: Not so bright (a little more green)  Review: I have been using the mfp8a with my S9500 and mf8300. My only complaint is that the MFP8a's are not as bright as the S95's. You can tell if you use a digital camera. I am a photographer and I use both. The MFP's are a little more warm than the S-series. They're still very useful for photos, especially of birds.  I like the fact that I don't have to turn the unit on and off, or use the remote with my camera. Also the battery is easily accessible in my bag and doesn't take up any more space than my S90 camera.  the battery life on the Mfp8 is great I have a s9500 battery for it and I was getting about 200 shots a day. The battery on the mfm8a is a bit longer but still good. -Mike  From The Customer's Perspective...  It took me about an hour to break the mfe8300 in. I can only think of one issue I have with this unit. I was trying to calibrate the brightness of the Mf8 at night and as I was doing it a few times the unit would go into a looping motion and then go out of sync. After a few repetitions I realized that I needed to rotate the lens in order to achieve the proper settings. This solved my issue with the brightness. I am sure it will last longer but this is the only thing I have found that I can complain about.    Was This Review Helpful? YesNo Review was not posted due to prof

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.................................................... A well built, well thought out piece of equipment that does exactly what it's intended to do. This is definitely my first USB port driven computer and it's not bad for an 8 bit one. I use it for drawing, playing music, running games on it and I'm still learning to get the most out of it. One thing it does well is turn off my TV and speakers when it's off to save battery power and reduce noise. I just received it and will post my experiences once I finish it up.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I was extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Hifiman HE-500i. It is a simple, well built, and functional headphone amplifier. The sound quality of this device is superb. The bass sounds very natural and punchy and the mids are detailed and clear. It's easy to use and doesn't require any fancy tricks to use properly. I've used it for a while and the noise cancelling and the ability to connect to portable devices is very useful for work and pleasure.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned a couple of these units and the first time it worked perfect. Then my next unit had a very loud click and I thought it was coming from the remote. I opened it up and the battery tray was covered with black residue from the previous unit. After cleaning the tray thoroughly and checking all the components, all was ok. The next unit worked great but the power button had a bad click and the button itself was bent. Then I opened the case and found a new battery tray for it with the batteries separated.   This unit was cheap, but it works and it can run all the time. But after a couple months I found the power cable to be bad. I got the cable a second time. This time the battery cable was fine. The power cable is very thin. So the unit would be very easy to overheat on hot days.  Product reviews Images Dialog Product reviews Images  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

I would recommend it  Cons: nothing really.  Review: I love this little player, it has worked perfectly for my needs. I use it mostly for my music files, and it's been great.  the only thing i wouldn't recommend is to make the switch from "plug and play" to "hardware" - as the player is quite small and it takes awhile to charge. the only reason i gave this a 5.0 is because the switch between software and hardware took a bit of getting used to, but now it's the most comfortable.  The only other thing that I would suggest to make it easier for beginners would be to make a better adapter, since it is rather small, i would like a way to easily connect to an external keyboard and mouse (and keyboard has its own issues, I have it connected and connected, but can't access it, and i'm guessing it's not connected to anything)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********I had this about a year ago and I must say that it is really nice and simple to use. I have always used my cell phone and the new computer in my office, and this works great on my cell, not as good as the new ones but good enough for what I need. I just wish that they would sell the 2 pack for the cheaper price of $59, so that I could have two cell phone chargers in one charger for less than that. If you're buying this for your house or apartment, you don't really need the additional power cord that came with it, but it helps that you can charge it in the house, and since you can't do it out at a park or near some rivers, it's a lot better than charging your cell phone while you're playing computer games and such.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have purchased multiple Apple iPods and iPads, both iPhone and iPad.  They are very good products but i have to say they all have problems with the battery life.    I have always had problems with having no power when i needed it and it makes the phone or tablet stop working.  I use the iPad with my MacBook Air but it seems the iPad batteries just do not last long enough.  It is always a hassle.  Apple does not sell a replacement battery and i have had to do that myself in the past.  As for the ipods, i have bought them in the first place and the same problems with no battery power always occur.  The good thing about them is i do not have to buy the expensive adapter to use them on my computer.  All that is needed is a USB cord and you can have them both connected to your computer.   Good product but all the same if they do not sell batteries and you have to do it by yourself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought this with a 2 year old for her first PC. She can't wait to start programming. I had some questions about this thing and the answers were very clear. This thing will hold up for a long time to make sure you are happy with your purchase. I also bought an extra charger which is also very useful.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from A little expensive at first. But worth it! This is a great little thing for the price. The only downside is the micro USB cable. It is not designed to be used with your computer's USB port. The micro USB to USB converter is very helpful for these cables as they are too long to fit in the USB port of my computer. I was able to use an extension cable that was also about 3 feet long. It worked perfectly. 's compact size makes it ideal for any small electronic device such as a mouse, keyboard or even a camera! The built in USB adapter is nice, and the power button is handy. My only criticism is that the buttons are a bit small. I'm hoping that manufacturers will be able to produce a bigger version in the future.

The speakers are good, and the unit looks great! The only thing I didn't like was the buttons on the front. They just don't feel that sturdy. It was a real pain to get the buttons to stay in place. Still looking for that part to replace!  Good unit with some flaws:   This is the second time I purchased this unit. I love the unit so far. The unit is very easy to use. I only wish there was an option for an off camera shutter. This unit would be perfect for the home movies we shoot and the one drawback is the size. But that is a small price to pay for the ability to view our videos in full screen.  I think it's just right:    I love this unit! I use the camera for wedding videography and the camera is perfect for my needs. I purchased it as an upgrade over a higher cost camera, and I couldn't be happier. It took some getting used to to adjust the settings for this unit and the on screen display, but once you get the hang of it it works really well.

I was using my phone for most of the remote control, but after I get used to it, I like my own remote. The camera itself has the best quality. The pictures are clear, crisp and clean. The video is great, as well. I'm a camera geek and I LOVE the camera. . I would definitely recommend this product. -Jason. (Posted 4/17/2016, updated 6/25/2016, updated 6-31-2016)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the CX500 on a Sunday morning, and when I first plugged it in the power light came on but then it started to work without any problems. I did use my computer for 30 minutes and it started up OK. After that I had a little trouble with the USB hub (not the Cx500) which is not a problem I normally have, but in this case it seemed that it was not working for some reason. I then tried to put the C2 back in the hub and it wouldn't work because the power was not returning. So I unplugged the C200 and the Hub worked like a charm. I bought a new computer to replace my old one, but I really like the C650 and the C2000 so I am using both, and they both work perfectly.

(you might be able to get away with more),it is very quiet, i had to turn the volume all the way down to hear it. it is also quite power efficient, it only uses 3.5 watts..  (that is enough to drive my 1" HDMI monitor to 80 w.  and run 4 channels of my ipod in stereo.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the power supply has a faulty connector. i replaced that with a new one and it works perfectly.  be careful when you buy one because they will be around.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, June 05, 2010 I own an old model of the SDS-1000 but not the new one. I've tried to install some of the software programs but it refuses to do so. I even tried to use the software on my PC but it also has trouble with the SPC-DVR. I'm trying to use all of the free programs out there. I got this one so I might as well try it. It works perfectly for me, no problems. I just love my HD DVR. It is easy to install and use and the only thing I have to do is find a recording time that suits my schedule.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought several of these things and the build quality is great, I bought two of them to replace my old cell phone which i had to break after about a year because it was getting so hot. these are very light and are pretty easy to pack up and put away, ive never been worried about losing one.  My first experience with the phone: ily is very quiet and very easy to use. No problems.   I also got the "digital camera" (which is called "the camera with a case") I bought this one to take pictures with my iPhone and I am glad I did.   a must have in my bag!  i bought this thing a month ago and I love it ily comes in very handy when i am out and about and my phone is always with me   i can't say anything bad about this product  It's the best phone I have ever had   And now its my daily driver   It comes with a battery, charger, and case...   No more lugging around a dinky cell phone when i'm out and need to make phone calls, send emails, and play games.  with all of this i can not think of a better phone.   in the meantime, I wouldnt change a thing.  and i'm so happy i had one of these in my life to begin with...  I bought my iPhone 7 with this device and I can tell you that this is the best smartphone I have in years. The best part is I dont have to carry a huge cell phone around like I used to. I never have to worry about running out of battery while I'm out walking my dog, it is easy to store and takes only 2 hours to recharge the battery from my home plug. It works great when I am going to work. I love that I can stay in touch with my family through FaceTime and WhatsApp. I can also take pictures and video without having to worry whether or not i will have internet access. Also, it helps with finding a lost phone or a stolen one. I've gotten many emails from other users about how the device has helped them with finding their cell phones or helping them out when they have an emergency. This is the only thing that makes me want to go back to my old iPhone 5. I have a 5s and I was very disappointed. It does all of the things that a cell phone should do and I would not

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this product because i was tired of playing my iBook and then to use the wireless on the TV's (only to be locked on by the wireless receiver). I bought it on the 24th of October 2011. I haven't been using it that long yet and still have an external bluetooth headset for playing music and videos.  It's quite cool!  By: Jason S. - Houston, TX on 5/28/2011  Computers and TVs can be cool, but if you have a big screen in your home, it may be too big for your TV!   This is a big one. The TV's get cold when playing games, which is a problem for my wife's Xbox 360. However, the TV will be much more cool to watch when this computer plays games. This computer is cool, it runs cool, and the speakers are just right.   I don't have an audio jack on my computer, so I just plug the computer into the TV, and then use a standard sound cable to connect my headphones to my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this keyboard when I was in school. I had to use a paper, which I hated. I have to say that the first time I used this keyboard, I never felt the need to change the default font of the keyboard. I did, and I thought the font was awful, but I was sooo happy that I didn't. Now I only have to change a few letters. I'm soooo much happier now. It's the most efficient typing environment for me and I like it. Plus, I've used it for over a month and I have not had any problems. I will definitely recommend it. I didn?t realize that it can charge my phone. I always carry my cellphone with me, but this keyboard gives me the peace of mind knowing that I have it on me. I use it to type on my cell phone to send an email or text message. I don?t feel as though I have extra power when I'm using it like this, which is very important to me. Thank you for making a great product. This thing is well made, and even my mother who doesn't like keyboards is happy with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had a few units of this. They are easy to use and work. There is a little lag time between turning it on and it starting working. I think that is normal and I can live with it. The last time I had a power issue it was a problem on my computer and the power button would turn off but it didn't go back on. So I took it off and put it back on and then the computer power came back on without any issues. It is also an electronic device that may have the capacity to get damaged so be sure to test it before you put any electronics in it that are not your own. The product is easy to install but it's a hassle to put it away when you need it because it is so big. I also like the way that it is easy for others to work with because it has a handle on the side so you can have the device in your hand and others will have an easier time using it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product is excellent for my job. The main problem is that the switch is a little bit big, which makes the unit a little difficult to turn on.   I am a graphic artist and needed a good piece of equipment to use with a tablet computer. It is so far a great buy.  , and this is the review that has so far earned my purchase. I purchased a used laptop with a very limited warranty from ebay. I wanted something that was small and portable so I could have it with me for meetings or travel. I looked at a lot of other options but they were all too big and I was not happy with the controls. A couple of days later, I decided to purchase the XMate, and I am so happy I did. The unit is tiny and light enough to carry with me at a moments notice for meetings, but you get a lot for your money. The XMat comes with a nice keyboard and a few extra switches so you can customize to your heart's content. I had a chance to get in touch with ebay customer service, and they were very helpful in helping me out and even offered to return my product to me for an exchange. They also got back to me quickly with the replacement units. I would recommend ebay to anyone, no matter how small or old your needs.I'm glad I ordered the Xmate to replace the older laptop I was using. I use it on the plane for my company and it works very well. The price was right, and the product arrived in 2 days!I really wish I had gone with the larger XM-L2.The product has worked very well for me and I have a feeling that it will continue to work for many years to come. I will say that if you are a graphic designer you may not want the keyboard layout the X-mate has. However, this is a small price to pay for a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! My new iHome i3 3dTV is great. I've got a big wall mount and it is just about perfect for the size of the tv. I think it's about 5 inches off center from the wall. I love the tv! It's so much better than the one in my previous unit. I use it on the side table.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Solid, but not for everything I'm glad I bought this, but I would have liked some more features. It would have been nice if the video could have been upscaled to 4k instead of 1080p. If you plan on using it as a media center, that's a feature you'll likely use. If your use it as your main screen, you'll probably use the picture quality for the content itself.  in other words, if your on the fence about this one, then I would say get it, but make sure to use the features you need. It's not as good as it could be  Product has everything i need from a TV. It looks like new. it works great. it has the features i needed to stream HD. It is extremely bright and good sound. I did use it for a few days and have not even used the remote yet but i don't mind as long as the remote is in it i guess  The Best TV I have ever bought It was hard to choose this one. I am so happy. If i had to buy a replacement I would get this. I can set it up and use it immediately. The picture quality is awesome. You can see the difference between the picture and the screen. It doesn't get any better than that. The sound is even better. I have not had to calibrate it yet. I just got it and it works perfectly right out of the box. I'm sure I'm going to use it all the time.  (The only thing that is missing, besides a remote, is a USB remote for the remote control.)  i3 Remote iHome Remote is the best one yet! Very good quality and the perfect size for the small space. Also the remote works very well. I found it a lot easier to use and adjust than my tv. ,  good TV, very light, nice tv, good audio, very nice tv  I'm using the TV for my family and it's awesome. It works well and the picture is

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iklwf.com I have been using the Epson S310 for about a year now. Its been on for more than a week now and the picture quality is amazing! Its a very clean camera for its size. I can't wait to upgrade to the larger model.  What I like: Excellent image quality, great picture quality, very easy to use. I don't have to worry about my photos coming out blurry and blurry, every shot has great detail.  the E.T. is a great camera for the price. It has been reliable and easy to maintain  Great little camera but the buttons don't work properly for me: A-Z. My old Sony A7r has a "push button" mode button for changing between AF and AF-S. It works well in AF-F mode. I use it in AF mode because the "push" button works best when I am using a wide angle lens and the camera is wide open. When I use an A7 in AF, the camera often does not switch to the AF-A button (I can't figure it out). It also has "back" and "preview" buttons for switching to and from the back screen. These buttons have the same functionality and it's very convenient to have these functions readily available for quick access when you want to review the pictures. On the E-T the buttons work properly but the camera doesn't switch to them. You have to press and hold them until the camera switches to AF-C or AF-M or whatever. The Epson seems to work this way all the time. Is this an Epson problem or just a "Sony" problem? I'm hoping I don'st need to return my A7s.  in the last few days I have had trouble with the camera being too bright on the viewfinder. The problem occurs when I hold the camera close to the view-finder glass and the light gets brighter. I haven't had this problem with the other cameras I've owned and it seems to be a hardware problem with this model. It also causes the LCD to look like it has been coated with a black paint. This is not very desirable. I have not been able to find out the cause or a solution and I am afraid to return the camera. I am considering changing lenses to a telephoto for a while until I find out if I have a mechanical problem with it. Is it worth the risk?

I have it mounted on a shelf with the speakers facing down so that the headphones can be plugged into the 3.5mm jack. The amp sounds just like a tube radio - excellent sound. The noise floor is very low. I play a lot of rock music and the headphones sound great as well. I can hear every word even when singing. I highly recommend this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sennheiser HD5s are really cool. I got the gold one with the red cable and the silver cable. This is my first time ordering from this site and it was very easy to purchase. The box arrived in two days after I placed my order. I also received the Sennhiser adapter cable which works really well with the HD5S. I do think the adapter cable could use a little more length but it's only 4 feet. Great addition to my set-up. I'm really enjoying my new HD5 headphones now.

It's been an excellent piece of technology. No bugs, no glitches, nothing that would be a concern if it was any other device. The only bad thing I can say about it is that they did come with the original cable/jacks, which I'm sure you guys are more than happy with.

It was a little frustrating for me at first since I'm an audiophile, because it would drop or get out of tune, but now that I use it more than I thought I'm starting to get good sounds. It's also an interesting interface, because you have to turn up the volume manually every time you connect it and it's loud. Also it has a lot of settings to configure. The USB port is good too!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive just purchased a iphone 6s. i bought this for work, as i thought it was the right size for the job. ive been using it almost daily now, it does everything i need it to do. i really like it. its lightweight, easy to carry around, its just a very good phone for the price. i also thought it would be a little smaller, but i got my hands on a larger version, and it was just as big as i was expecting it to be. i havent had to upgrade it yet.  the only drawback i see with this phone is that the screen resolution is lower then the other models. the only other thing is that it has a removable battery, so i have to put it back in when i run out.  i was concerned that it would have a weak battery, as it wasnt designed to be used everyday. other then that, its a really nice phone.

I read the reviews and was really worried about this being a very expensive camera because of the size and weight. The size was actually the best part! I am a bigger person and this camera is great for me. The light is easy to set for my needs and the focus is nice. The only drawback is the ability to use the touch screen. I have to really squeeze the phone to do anything on it. This might be a good camera for people who are really big and want to make a point on their camera. However, if you are not like me and want more control over your pictures, this is probably not for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ixos-1 - Excellent product, better than a pro camera in every way. My friend and I took lots of pictures and the high quality images were clear and easy to process. The lens has amazing build quality. I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a great camera in this price range.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Jeff C from great but no battery cap I bought this a couple days ago and am very happy with the camera. But the main problem I've had is no battery compartment for the battery. It has a 2nd battery but no power. The camera will take all the light in the room and keep it on for a while. I have a lot of pictures so I can't be unhappy. I've always been a fan of DSLRs and this one really makes the price easy to live with.  the lens is pretty decent and has a pretty good zoom range too the camera is pretty good but i'm having trouble getting it to focus right. If there's a more useful zoom I haven't found it  Image quality was very good. I was able to take some good photos. My only complaint is the battery life is about an hour, which is about average.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichiro haruko - good product and service  I bought my first portable computer in 1998 when it cost less than 10 dollars. I can't imagine having to go to the computer store to get a new one. I had to buy two. One computer is now in the closet in my closet for years. The other I keep in my room and use as a USB printer. So I got this one at a discount price for a reason! I just wish they could have provided one USB drive for the computer. I will be buying an external hard drive to replace the external drive. The price is right. You pay more for the quality and features but for only $14.95 it is a very good deal. If you are in the market for a good portable computer and need to have one to use as your primary one it is an excellent product for what it is.  Best computer ever  It works like a charm. And I think it is nice to see that they have replaced that ugly square plastic thingy in the middle with this nice little thing. It looks good. It's a very solid and well made computer. The fact that it's portable is also nice to have. It takes a lot of room in my trunk. And if you have a friend that needs it and don't want to spend the money on one, it's an easy gift. And it's fun to have on the road because you can access it and not be tied up with your laptop. , December 31, 2007  Good for your kids and adults  i bought one a few months ago for my 2 year old daughter and my wife to take on the bus with them when they go to different places. i got the one that was designed for the 8GB flash memory. but i was told they had updated it to 16gb so i went for that one. it works just fine for the two of them. and they have gotten a couple hours of use out of it since they've been out on the trip. the computer is really easy to use. and i think that this one is a good price and it's good to have something to keep them occupied in the car for a few hours when they are taking a short trip.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought the iDroid because it was inexpensive, it's not only a great looking device but its so easy to use. I used to use the old version of the iPhone before I bought this one, and my friends say I'm a genius for buying this one since the new one is better. Thanks for having a great product I love it!  What does it do:    It allows you to take photos, record videos, edit them, and store them on the SD card, and the camera itself. If you have a new or refurbished iDevice with a microSD card inserted, you can do all these things. You can add photos, video, or edit them with iPhoto or with iMovie. You have many photo editing options. It's really fun to take pictures of things, as long as you know what you're doing.   Why I like it:   It takes photos, videos, edits and saves them on your internal and microSD cards. It connects to your computer, it will turn on with your computer.  How it works:     There are three things that are included: the microSD slot, the front light, and a camera lens. You also get a USB port and a 3.5mm input jack. You plug the microsd in, then plug it into the camera, and then plug your 3.3mm to 3.6mm jack into the port on the side of the camera. You connect the USB jack to your usb hub.  in your computer and turn on the camera with the camera's on/off switch on/on and your device's screen. You press the shutter button to take a picture. It takes up to three photos per click. You should have enough space for about 2,000 photos.  , which means that it's capable of doing almost everything you can with a standard digital camera, but without having to set up a special account for your digital camera. There are no menus or settings to mess with. In other words, you won't have to remember to turn on and off the lights or adjust the ISO or anything like that. It even lets you take photos with a flash. I'll be honest: I had an iPhone and used it as my regular camera. I was really frustrated because I'd always get photos and videos but I'd be missing the beautiful colors and textures. The iDock comes into it's own in
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using an AppleTV for about 6 months now and I love it. It's fast, easy to set up, and works great. I love being able to browse the web on it from my couch, or even watching a movie on it without having to connect to my laptop and plug it in, just like my old TV. I have to admit that it took me a while to get the remote working well, but it's not hard to figure out. There are some really neat features to the AppleTV too. It has a nice remote app that has all sorts of features, like video and music streaming. You can even pause TV shows, switch channels, etc.   The biggest downside to AppleTV is the fact that it is limited to Apple devices. If you get one that doesn't have a Mac, the app doesn't work very well. If they released a tvOS app, I could see using it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it. I just think that this is the best way to listen to music at home.    Great Sound, but the USB cable gets in the way:  The sound quality of this CD player is great and even though I have a couple of other players and a laptop with great sound quality I really prefer the sound of this little box. However, the USB plug that comes with it is pretty awkward for my taste. It was almost impossible for me to insert it into the USB port of my laptop or a different USB port on my MP3 player. The CD player has no buttons, just a power switch. Also, if you are expecting a CD player, this is not one, it is more like an MP3 reader. The sound is great, and it is easy to use. However the power cable that comes the USB version (not the CD player) is pretty thick and makes it really awkward. I am not a fan of cables either. In fact I do not like to have them, but I guess they are needed sometimes. And as I mentioned above, the CD sound is not great, but if I had to recommend one more thing I would say to find a cheap cable. Overall I like this player and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to play music at the office.  Sound: The sound of the player is decent. There is a high and low frequency bass that works well with my MP2 player and headphones. The volume is good and I like the ability to set the volume of my MP players and headphones separately and the auto volume feature which is very handy. This player sounds more or less similar to the Sony Walkman but better in my opinion. The play/pause function can be used to control music playback as well as playback of files from the drive. The device also supports the WMP music player which works well. Rear View: The unit was shipped with the rear-view display which makes it much easier for use as a monitor. The rear-side view is pretty good, but it is a bit small and the screen is a little hard to see. If I would ever buy another CD player I will probably upgrade the display and/or add a rear-camera. There are no buttons on the rear of the unit, just the power/lock switch and a volume switch. The player supports the iPod, iTunes and MP3 players.

There were no deadlocks or crashes while working with the UltraScale+. I am sure that if I use it to build a computer with a graphical interface, I will not have much trouble. " "The sound quality is amazing! It sounds so great, I don't even need to use any plugins. I'm using the full version now and I really like the way it sounds. It has very great features with very low power consumption. I don"t like how it has a USB hub, but I don,t want to remove the power source from the system. I just use it for a USB mouse and keyboard. It's super stable and quiet. If I'm going to use it without any pedals, it's quiet enough and works flawlessly." " I have never built anything with so many features before. I know that there are things that I didn't like, but they are almost all bugs in the system that were fixed, or are just a matter of making it more simple. I"m very impressed with the sound, the performance, the documentation, the ease of use, and the price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants an extremely powerful system for a very low price!"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this as my first portable mp3 player, the fact that this works well has made me happy for a long time.  This has been in my car with me for 3 years now, its small, not loud and light enough to carry all over.  a perfect size to fit in my jacket pocket.   this is also very portable,   it's not the loudest mp3, but its good enough for the commute to work and back. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's very easy to connect to a computer.   It has more features than any other electronic device.   it's a pleasure to use.   (Posted on 4/12/14)  A solid performer! Review by Michael I was looking for something to stream music from my MP3 players, and found this unit on sale for less than half the normal price. It's perfect for my needs, but I did notice that it has a very high sound output, but only for streaming music. I use my laptop for my audio and this just can't compete with the audio quality that my laptop provides. I found that it was better for listening to music that I would have had to use my Macbook Pro. For the price, it's worth a try. (Posted in Computer Specs on 8/26/14, Rating: 4.5 of 5 Stars) :  I was looking fo something to do with my iPod, but i decided to go for the apple portable player, and i have no idea how i got on with the apple player. I was having problems with not being able to play my mp3's, and after searching all over the net i was unable to find anything that was working. i searched the net again and found a unit that was compatible with my computer, and it cost me around $300. it came with everything i needed, but for $300 that was a lot of money. and after having used my ipod as a desktop, i decided that the apple unit was not for me. i used it to stream a song from my ipad to my macbook pro, and the song played perfectly, but the sound output from my mac was far superior. so this is a great unit to buy if you have an ipad, but it was not working for me when i used my laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________   It's the cheapest wireless charger I have found and it works well. I've never used it before but the quality of the construction and the simplicity of its use make it perfect. I purchased the blue one and it's nice.   Also, I highly recommend the $5 coupon code at the end of this review, the savings are incredible   I have a 5.2" laptop with a non-removable HDD and I always have to charge it using the AC adapter. I was looking for an easy way to do this and this is it.   I also have a 2.1 usb external hard drive for my phone. I always leave that plugged in when I go to sleep as I just don't want it to get cold and it gets pretty hot when I use it. The USB cord works perfectly with my laptop and the external hard drives.   "I've never been satisfied with the quality or performance of my previous wired charger. I needed an upgrade, so I decided to try this new product.  The quality of this unit is awesome. I only wish that the usb cord would have a longer plug. It's too short for my laptop."   --Kirk--   "I have been using my new USB powered charger and it has been the best investment I have made."
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the dn7i for a little over a week now and i love it ive used it mainly for my gps and it does a good job of it for the price  Rated 1 out of 5 by gordo from bad performance bad performance and the battery is just not going to last in this bad in quality  Rating: Bad Quality The radio/gps works fine in the gps dn-7i only in the winter and it doesnt keep a signal the next day. It keeps losing signal from around 9 am until 3 pm then it seems to be working better. i tried the bluetooth and no luck. so basically after a month the radio/ GPS/ bluetooth has stopped working. It was just a bad item bought because I wanted it but now just wasted time.  This item was delivered and received in a good time so I decided to take advantage of the 15% off coupon. However, my package did not arrive, I emailed the company and they said they would call me when it would be here, never heard from them. I was a bit disappointed but it's a free 15% discount and I figured I'd try to wait and see. But then a month goes by and nothing. I contacted the company again and was told that it's in Canada and not the United States. I really doubt I can get anything from them in the US.  theres some other issues. The dn will only work on one mobile phone at a time, that is not great for long distance trips. the GPS sometimes does not work. and it can be unreliable. This item needs to be discontinued or replaced. It could be great for people who do a lot of business around the house but for me, I think this item should be discontinued.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Awesome Product. The first time I have used this I used it on my car and it worked great, I was really impressed and would buy this product again. I have had several devices before this one, but this is the first one that I have been truly pleased with. Great product, recommend buying  Couldn't be happier... I am amazed at how well the G-spot works! I was very skeptical when I bought the Gspot, but decided I would give it a try. I've used my Gspot for a couple of weeks, and have had no problems. It is really great to be able to have it where you need it, and it's super easy to use. Definitely worth buying for this purpose. If you don't want to mess with a dildo or plug, or if you're worried about being exposed, this is a must have item.  great pleasure... I ordered the vibrator to try, but I bought it for use on my gspot. It was so great I bought another one to put in my ass for my boyfriend and I. I love the idea of the G spot having a power source to get off to, even better than my clitoris. I like to make him work for it and it works great that way. I'm really glad I bought this product!  Great product, but could be better! I bought two of these to try. One for myself and one for my girlfriend. These were extremely satisfying in both cases! The only issue I had was that they are not made of the right material. One had to be taken out when I wanted to be a bit more "full" on the gspot, the other one was just a bit too long, but it was easy to take out. I will definitely buy another one in a different material for this one. I was a little worried that the battery would drain out when used for prolonged periods. Not so! . ,,,,,.,.  and it just plain works. "The best toy ever." Love it. I bought a vibrator from my favorite website and found the GSpot is a fantastic addition. Not just for me but for many people too. It's a great little toy. I use it every time I am with my significant other. We don't get any orgasms yet but it's good to know there is a vibrating option if needed.  in addition to having the g-spot,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These things can be a nightmare to assemble at times. You have to get it perfect the first time and it can take 2 days (or even more) to get to the correct orientation. Then you have to use a screw driver (or something smaller) to insert all the little bits of plastic into the holes, then use your fingers to press them in, then push the little tabs into the plastic until they seat in the right orientation.  Once done, you can then remove the little plastic tab to remove the device and its batteries.  If you are going to purchase a few different kinds, do it as soon as possible so you can do the initial assembly of the units before the batteries fail.  It only takes a couple hours to do all this and the quality of the product really is worth the hassle.  I can't stress enough how much I appreciate their customer service.  You are always so responsive and prompt, making any issues you have a much more pleasant experience. The battery life is very good. It holds up quite a bit better than a Nexus 4. I've been running it on the 2G networks (not 3G) for a week now and have had no problems.  It's a great choice for people that like to stay on the go and get on with the day.  Posted by Steve J. Smith at 9:14 PM I received my device and set up the radio antenna and all is well. It works great for my needs.  The battery life has exceeded my expectations.  There are still a few days before I can put it to the test with actual apps, but so far I am quite impressed.  I'm a bit worried that the power button won't work if the device is tilted upward.    Posted by Mike B.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the best electronic devices I have ever owned. It has been well used and is still running. It is the most versatile device for the price you can buy. I love having it on me to check weather conditions, set timers, take pictures of the sky, talk on the phone, play music, watch TV, talk to my wife, or just use it as a digital camera to record my trip through the country and take pics of things I find. I just have to keep it charged. I've only used it about 10 hours but it never failed me. I have read that you can get the battery run down to almost nothing and then you will get your camera or flash working again, but I have not yet found that to be true.   It's also great for taking pictures when you are out in the bush, it keeps my camera from running out of juice, it makes it easy to take pics that have a zoom lens or the flash doesn't work, or it will work on a video camera and then play back to you. I do a lot of taking pictures of birds and I use my Sony a6500 on the fly when I can.  I also use it for taking pics of people and it's also nice to have in case of an emergency.  All in all it's a great device and you can not get a better one than this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just purchased my first digital device, this is a good little device. It's got good sound and has great touch screen capability. It takes only a few minutes to install the software and get everything working, I have a few other devices I'm going to purchase from a shop near me, but this is going to be my first for quite a while and so far so good. I love the fact that I can play music or surf the web on the computer and have a tablet and phone all on the same screen, and I can even make a movie or take a picture at the same time with a movie app. I really like that there are not too many restrictions or requirements, just download the software, connect to your tablet and get working. The other nice feature is that it can be connected to an old desktop computer to do what you want. If you want to surf the internet, or make a Skype call or even make an email, you can do that. It also is a nice feature to be able to play a movie while you do this.

I have a Nikon 1D X and the quality of the pictures has increased exponentially, and the control of the camera has been greatly improved. The 1D camera's sensor has more noise than my 1D mk3, so I have to make sure the focus is steady, and in my opinion the camera is less than perfect (see other posts below) but the images look great, and a 1D x sensor beats my old 1D3D. Overall, I would recommend this device. The only thing I have found is that the focus ring on the top end is difficult to use and takes some getting used to, but once you get it, it is wonderful.

I've had it for a couple of weeks and I really like it. There are times I forget my phone is there.  the only thing I would change is that the light turns off everytime I turn off the light on the other end. , and you could really tell it was a cheap item from the outside. If you really want a wireless TV and a smart dog you should look elsewhere.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for a way to send a photo to my father in law. I found this product online and was surprised at how good it works.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This keyboard is absolutely amazing and very easy to use. I just got my K70, first thing i did was test the software and the software is awesome. The keys are well spaced, I can hit them with no problem, also I love the red lighting, I have an LG G4 and I love it too but this keyboard has awesome red lighting also that makes me look more professional. My only gripe is the keyboard has no macro capability, but I don't need it. I bought this for the keys I need the most and for that it's a good buy. Pros: Great key spacing, red lighting and all. Cons: no macro keys Cons: I bought this keyboard from a good site here, there is a free software with macros which I love and would recommend if you are on a tight budget.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ This is an extremely compact little unit. I got it for use in a car as a backup system for my laptop (my current one has a broken hard drive). It is a good backup system. It will hold its own even against a computer with the same capacity as my laptop. It does have some limitations. It has no USB port and it is not a portable computer. Also, it has no optical drive, no ethernet, and no audio port. These issues are all minor and it will be fine for most applications. I did get an idea that the battery is not rated for use with the USB port in conjunction with the audio port and the ethernet port. You may have to do a little creative modification to make it work in that way. But it is a cool little device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this unit from e-buyer.com. I received the electronic device within 2 weeks. I am satisfied with the electronic product. It is very reliable. The unit works well for me. The only negative issue is the warranty will be voided if you do not follow certain instructions. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this product.  A great tool for learning and exploring... I have a 6.7 kwa motor in my small plane. I was curious as to how I would get it to work with a different motor. I looked on the internet and I saw many different instructions. I decided to try the directions from ez4hobbies and I was not disappointed. I installed it in less than an hour and it worked perfectly. The motor is very powerful. I used a 12 volt battery and my plane is flying well. It was a very easy install. You need to install a small rubber band around the wires as you install them to keep it in place. You will need to be sure to tighten it all the way down. The instructions were very detailed and easy to follow. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive, easy to install radio control system. The unit is very durable and easy cleanable! The only complaint I have is that the included power cable does not seem to be very long enough. However, after I used it to power my new receiver in my Cessna 172 I am sure it will be long enough for future use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product was very good. It's a good alternative to the other brand of headphone/headphones out there. The price is pretty good for what you get. The device is very comfortable and you won't hear any buzzing. It doesn't sound like a lot but in fact the bass is very good which is the best feature in my opinion. You will need to purchase a mic if you don't want to record the voices to sound good but I have a cheap and a mic and my sound is very clean. So if you want to go through your old tapes or recordings you can do this with this and you will enjoy it.  Have a good idea for a future answer? Ask the community:  There is already a good sound for a decent price. I recommend this to all the people looking to buy a new headphone with good sound. I have used this device before on my old computer which I bought a couple of years ago. I would recommend it to anyone who has a decent computer and a decent microphone.

I wasn't sure if I wanted something new, since the first one was so cheap. I figured, I can't say too much because I still have a copy of it, but it was good. It had a small display that I found very easy to read. I can see what it says and I know what the numbers mean, and it doesn't have to be plugged in to the wall, and all in all, it's great. Also, you don't need a wall wart because it's Bluetooth.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The unit works perfectly, so far. I'm pretty impressed with this. I have the AVR-2036-2 which is a great sound card and also has a built in amp. I didn't buy this for that because I thought it would require additional hardware for music (which is silly). I can't say this enough - I was going to buy a 2.1 amplifier but thought this was too good to be true. This is a real amp for real sound. I'd buy it again! I really don't understand some people. It's not a subwoofer. It doesn't have a built-in amp. It needs the amp and other things like that. That's it. What's the big deal? If you need a sub, get an amp and you can turn this on and it will do the same thing. That being said I did a little research and decided it was for me so I bought it. This unit is exactly what I was looking for! The built in speakers are much better than I thought. It makes a great surround system and even makes a little bit of a noise when I walk around. Great product, great value, and great price! This product is simply amazing. I don't care what it says it's a sub woofer. I bought this to go in my PS4 and put this in with a 2x2 amplifier and it makes a HUGE difference. I also had some old stereo speakers laying around that I decided to use. The sound is much clearer than they ever were before. Best subwoofers I've used to date. There are many reasons that this is the best subwoohaber I've ever used, but here are the big ones: I purchased mine at my local Best Buy a few days ago, it's at least $30 cheaper than the one at Best Buy. The unit is completely portable (although that could change after the warranty expires) and is much easier to move around with than the others I've purchased. It sounds much better. I had a pair of the PS2's for a year and had to upgrade to an RMX in order to get anything close to the quality of this one. Now I can listen to music that I bought on CD that was recorded on that format, or have some other old mp3 that was ripped and converted to digital format. It is also easy to connect to my PS3 and use as a

I was looking for a new computer and after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a try. I found all the things I needed and it only cost a little more than my old computer. I'm impressed with all the options. I bought the mouse on the recommendation of the guy who did the review and it looks awesome. I can't wait to use all these new features. I have no problems running any program except Photoshop. It still needs an update. I've been playing games for so long on a laptop and with the keyboard I've had for several years, this is a welcome change. It's really very compact. I hope I'll get some money back from Amazon for my money. I had a really good deal on this computer because of the discount but I am very disappointed with this product. The picture quality is very poor but the software has lots of features and the computer itself is cool. Thanks, for this amazing computer!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These were the first time I ever bought a keyboard. It had no keys, but I used it to type in a browser and word processor for some time. I bought these because they were so small and light weight (like I use it to write e-mails in) that I could barely hold onto them while typing. I used them on a laptop for a while and finally ended up purchasing a full size keyboard. I wish they were a little larger, but other than that, it's perfect. And the fact that the keys are on the left side of the keyboard make it easier to type with my left hand. I will buy another one after my other keyboard fails on me. Thanks for making such a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I've just purchased the iLife app on my iPhone 5, and it's great! Very well thought out and well designed app, it has lots of features and is well documented and easy to use. The photos are taken using the camera function, and so far I have used it with a photo of my son's head (and it's taken great photos!) and with my family in a photo album. I've used it on a Mac, and the interface is very much like iLife for OS X. I would recommend this to others as an excellent app, I'm sure you will be pleased. --------------------------- I had an iPad 2, and while I loved the interface and the design, I was very frustrated with the camera. I found myself constantly taking photos and editing them. I decided to give this app a try, and am glad I did. It's a very slick interface, very user friendly. I haven't had to take any pictures yet because of the way it works, but I will update my review if I do. ------------- Good, but not perfect: -------------- This app does not do as good a job as a photo editor does when it comes to adjusting and coloring images, as the app has not done that well, nor has it adjusted or colored many of the photos that I have taken. -------------- I use this app primarily for editing and coloring my photos. It has a nice interface, and is very easy to navigate. If you need to do more than that, then you are better off looking elsewhere. --------------- This is a great app, and I highly recommend it to everyone. _____________________________
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- The device has a lot of features, but the most important is the ability to have different functions and set up different parameters for each device, for example setting the temperature of the device on a different location. I like to keep one of the ovens heated, so I can make cakes or bread, and the other one cooled. The device is easy to set up, and even if you forget to set the parameters for your device, it will save you the hassle of setting it up, especially if you want to adjust the temperature on multiple different units. If I ever need to move the oven out of a high spot, I will take this. I bought this a few weeks ago and am extremely pleased with it. If you don't have any problems with setting up, just take your time and the unit will be worth the investment.  Rated 5 out of 5 by btfc from Awesome gadget This has really helped me improve my baking and cooking skills. Very easy to setup and use. I would recommend this to everyone who has a gas range or oven.  the only downside is you will have to put the probe in there to find your temp  Review of DJM20-4.9R I bought two of these oven timers after I got my old one down. They work really well and are a great size. The only downside I see is that they come with a piece of tape on the probe to cover up the small pinhole the camera is in. The one I have with the pinhole doesn't work when the timer is turned off, so that would be the only issue. I was able to get an extended cable to run out of the camera to run into the probe and the pin hole in the probe. This allows me to keep the pinholes open while I cook to use the camera and also to use my kitchen timer. I'm going to keep my old ones on the floor and add the extension cable when I'm finished. I do wish they had an option to have the extension wires connect out of one box and into the other. I don't know why they couldn't do this but I wish they did.

If you have a problem with it do not give up and go back to your old phone because the new software is a great improvement on what was already out there and it runs fine on my phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  When I bought this keyboard I was quite surprised, I bought a Kinesis Advantage, a full sized keyboard that feels just like a laptop keyboard. With a bigger battery than the Kinesus I was hoping it would be a lot longer lasting but in all honesty it doesn't last that long. It is quite good for the price but you can buy another keyboard for more than twice the price. I will be ordering a second one of these to have a second keyboard around to carry around. Read full review Pros: - Very good keys to type on, especially on the larger sized keys (including Dvorak) - The keys feel great to type with - Easy to setup - Works well with the Apple Magic Keyboard - Lightweight Cons: - You will need a mouse to use this with the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 - Takes up a lot of desk space if you only have it on one side - No spacebar, so if you want to use your mouse and keyboard together (which I recommend) you'll need to purchase the second one.  That being said it's still a decent keyboard to have around.   Read Full Review The first keyboard that i ever bought was this keyboard i bought from Amazon. it cost me around 150 $ and it is perfect for gaming, typing, drawing, etc. this keyboard is very good to play games, i think the keyboard is perfect to play video games like Call of Duty, Halo, etc... the key to these keyboard's is that they are so good that the keyboard becomes part of the game. the keys feel just as good as they sound. the keyboard feels great to use. i use it for typing, gaming, watching movies, drawing, ect. i also play guitar with my fingers. this keyboard has a big battery to last for a while. I really don't see a use for a separate keyboard when gaming. this is perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this device. I can't wait for more products from E-MU. I've used the E-M5 for about a month now and have had a really good experience. I don't know if E-H was just lucky because I got an original, or if there is a great reason why they are the only ones to have a great product. All the products I've had from EMU and any others that I've bought from other people have had bad quality and the return process is very complicated. I would say the return and refund process is one of the best in my opinion because of the good warranty on their products. My one negative would be the lack of any USB ports on the phone. I wish they could just put one on the back. The device itself is a good value, with the price of the phone and the number of functions and features the Eee M5 has, I have to give it a 4 out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The i5-7200u is very good. It has enough power to run everything I need. I have the 32gb memory module, and I use the 16gb memory to store the programs and games. The battery life is great. I can use it all day, and get about 12-16 hours of screen on time. This is a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my evga gtx 1070 and evga 1070ti fo my gtx 980ti and gtx 970 for 6 months now and its worked perfectly.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 29, 2016  Great card for the price  by Daniel from North Carolina  Pros: Cheap, reliable, very fast  Cons: Nothing major  Review: Just got mine today and it works great with the new EVGA Precision XOC software!  This card is great for those of you who aren't a fan of the noise and heat (or you have very quiet computer, like mine).  I had to upgrade the heatsink on my 970 because the older model was too noisy. The gtx 1080 is quieter than the 970 and I would never have thought that the new 980ti would be any quieter, but it is. It also does not have the thermal pads on the fan that the 970 does. I have a custom loop (no loop fans) and no issues. .  that said, I have been running the 980 ti for nearly 3 years now without having any issues. I don't know why everyone is complaining about the gpu overheating. If you use the heat sink pads then it won't. :)  A: I am running a custom made custom loop with no fans so that is a different story than the rest of you.  to everyone else who got an overheating problem. You might want to replace the pads/heat sink with a different brand.  is the gtx1080 ti any louder than a 970?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................ I'm happy to report that this is the first of many computers I will own that will run Linux. I bought this as a gift for my wife and it works flawlessly! We were able to play games and it was very fast. Very impressed!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from Easy to use and has been a great solution to my internet problems. I have used several of the previous Asus products and this one is by far the best. I had some issues with my cable getting into the USB port but I can see that there was an issue and that Asus addressed it in a timely manner.  Thank you!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This item was a very easy purchase for my older son. It was well made and very well priced. Thank you for a great product. I like it I've used a lot of these in the past. I've heard a lot about the noise canceling of these, but I'm not sure. I bought one after trying a few and not liking the sound. I haven't gotten one yet to actually listen to it, but my guess is it's a very good one for sound quality.  My one problem: It seems that my unit had a bad battery.  I'm just trying to figure out how it happened. It wasn't plugged in the night I got it.  It's still not plugged in, but the charger seems to have been doing everything it could do.  If there's a better way to do it I'd like to know.   I can't say enough about this item. It's great and worth every penny.  So far I've only had one issue with it: It will not charge when the device is sitting directly on top of it. You have to place it on the other side of it while it's plugged in.  And it doesn't matter if the charger is plugged into an outlet or if it's directly from the battery: Either way, it won't charge when placed on top.  Hopefully I get a better charge on that.

I bought two of these to control my lights and music while at the beach. It was the best investment I have made and was very very convenient to use.  in the summer and the house in winter. I also can control my alarm on my TV. I am happy with my purchase and will continue to buy for my family and friends.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- The keyboard is perfect, easy to type, quick response to pressing keys. You can not only type fast, but it is so easy.  I've been using it for a while now and it's still as good as the day I got it. The only downside I can notice is the touchpad on the touch screen isn't very responsive but that's not really a problem since I have the touch pad on a Macbook Pro.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best headphone I have owned, and I don't believe there's another headphone that can live up to it. I listen to music while biking to work and the sound is surprisingly clean and detailed with excellent bass. I really like the construction of this headphone. It doesn't make a lot of noise, and the construction feels very solid, yet still feels good in the hand. The only complaint I have is the cord which is very short, but it could be lengthened a bit to avoid making the headset "wander" in your pocket. The cord is also not attached very well, and when you move the headset around it can easily get in the way when playing sports. The volume control on the top of the headset is a bit too hard to use, as it's way to small for my hands to be able to reach. One thing I don''t like about this headphone is the clamping force applied to the headband. It's a bit firm, but not too much to cause damage. If you're looking for a good all around headphone that is comfortable, well built, and easy to use - this is the one for you. The only thing I really dislike is that this headphone does not have a headphone port. I have heard that this is because the engineers don't want anyone to be using it without a headphone jack - and I think that's a fair statement. I just wish it had one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used this device a few times over the last few days, to play some 3ds games and watch videos on youtube, and I love it. It has a nice, bright screen and is very quiet. I've not had to buy any adapters for it yet, so I haven't gotten anything else for it to use other than the wall wart. For the price I expect to be getting an excellent product for a long time, especially for gaming and watching videos.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my 3rd time trying this set up.  I love it!   It's easy to set up and has been for the last three times I've had to change my router.  to use it, all you do is plug the set up into an AC outlet, then connect the two router to it and change the router's IP.   I have a cable modem/router combo that I also use for my home network. This set up uses the cable modem and I only use the computer to watch movies and play online games. The router is just for playing video games online.     Also, the computer does not have a firewall or any security whatsoever.  the IP you set the computer with is not locked down. You can see the computer anywhere you go. It's just a router. I am also on a business account, and my business computer is protected by firewalls. I don't have an issue with my business's computers and the router. the problem is with my personal computers and my internet usage.   and the IP it gives you is NOT locked down at all.  and that's one of the best things about this set-up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using a new E-Gig for 4 days now. So far so good. I have been listening to music from my PC on this thing. I like the battery life. It's very good too. It has a built-in power supply (not power cords) and it charges with a 3.7V DC adapter. I've had no trouble with the battery. The only con I could find is that I wish there were more than two channels (so you can listen to different audio sources). Also there are some small things you can do with this thing (e.g. I can control the volume and/or change the signal output). All in all, I think the price is too good to be true. If you need a cheap MP3 player and don't want to use a power supply, this is an excellent option.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was on a trip last weekend when my phone went dead. My son in law in the other room called and said "your phone is not working". The lady in the office came out and said she couldn't answer the phone. I went to the computer and found out that the battery was dead. Then the lady in charge said, "your battery is dead, go get another battery". I couldn't get another one. I called the person at the other end of the phone back and said I needed a new battery and the lady asked me what brand I was using. She said a certain brand has better ratings on the manufacturer website. I told her and she gave me a new phone for free. It is a Samsung S7 Edge. Thank you to the lady and her colleague.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, March 02, 2018  Easy to use  by A Customer from Stroudsburg PA USA  Pros: easy to use Cons: no warranty  Review: I have no issue with the phone itself. It's just the fact that the company that is supplying the batteries (not included) is charging me for each battery I ordered. I asked for a replacement battery but there were none to be found in the store, no credit offered on the phone, and no information offered about who to contact. I'm so dissapointed because the phone does what I need it to do.  the problem I have with this phone is that it will not stand on it's own, I have to carry the phone with me. I bought the Edge version because it is so thin and light, but the screen is so much smaller. I am not using it much but its great for taking notes or just reading emails. I just can't make the phone stand on its own, it's just so thin.  of course, the battery life sucks, but it does what you need it for. The only thing is, I wish it had a built in keyboard, I bought one before it came out, but now I have a big and tiny keyboard in my pocket and can't find a way to use it. I had this phone for a couple months and just decided it was not for me. 's easy to setup  the best battery in the world  You can easily replace this battery for a whole new phone at your local shop.  you get what you pay for  I bought a brand
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I had the idea to make a small wireless receiver for my cell phone. I looked at several and didn't find any that worked well enough. One was a $12 part I found at Radio Shack. It was okay but didn't work well enough for me to use it. The other was a high priced part which was too hard to find in a quantity. I thought I would try a low cost item and this thing worked great. I can now watch my cell phones video, listen to my favorite music, or even make calls. I don't have to worry about my wireless router not working because this thing can handle all of my wireless needs.  Style of electronic device : Connects to TV  : Connects. Price: I had some money to spend. I'm sure this product would not cost much in the store but for $15 it is a great product and works flawlessly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a good device, very simple and to use. Works very good. Just wish there is a way to add volume to it. The only problem was that the volume button only works on mine with my wireless keyboard connected. I'm running an HP laptop and when I turn my wireless card off, my computer won't turn it on. But if I connect my keyboard it will. So, I have to unplug the keyboard and plug in the keyboard when I want to use the volume control. Not a big deal.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

It was a no-brainer, I'm a total nerd for controllers and controllers I think I'm gonna be addicted to this for a long time. I can play games without the console on and I just can't wait to play more Zelda. It looks great and feels great in the hand. Definitely recommend buying it for someone. The only thing is when you're buying a controller like this, it's good to know the differences between the Wii Classic and this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this camera about a month ago for personal use, and I'm very pleased with it. My girlfriend and I have a couple of videos I'd like to share on our blog. When we first got it, the pictures were so small they were hard to make out, but as we used the camera more, we soon learned how to take good pictures. I have my camera set to 720P. The video is crystal clear and crisp. My favorite feature is the ability to choose what resolution you want to capture at. The resolution will allow you to capture an exact size of your subject. You can also select which area you want your photos to cover. The picture quality is good, but not the best. I use it a lot for photos of small items I have with me. For small items, there is not a problem taking the photos at the smallest resolution possible. However, if you were to use the camera for video, the quality could be much better. The only downside is that the battery runs down quickly, but it's nothing serious. I plan on using the camera as much as possible.   Was this review helpful to you?

It takes a little getting used to but is definitely worth the effort.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have just bought a PicoBlaze HDTV, and I must say it's a wonderful product. It's small and light, but does what it's supposed to do. The picture quality is superb. I would recommend this product for anyone wanting a small and easy to use TV. It has a little delay in getting started if you don't know how to set it up, but once it gets going it's great! Also, the price was a great deal, especially if you factor in the extra features that come with it. This is my first time buying anything electronic, but from now on I will buy more gadgets from Amazon as it's easier to get stuff for very little money. Thank you for offering a great product at a low price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was able to use a Sony Handycam in my home for my wedding. It is perfect. Review of this product  - I got this camera in late 2009, but have had it for over four years now. I was hoping to use it for a few months and was a little disappointed in the first few days. I needed a picture of my family on a trip and I was trying to take a couple of good photos at the same time. I found that there is a time lag between when you are trying to move and when the picture starts. So in some cases it took me several minutes to take the picture. However this can be a good thing because it gives me time to think about how I am going to approach the photo. I still wanted to have a couple good shots of the wedding because I do not want to be in a hurry and not get the shot. The other thing that I like about the camera is that the software is very user friendly, if you are used to video cameras this might not be for you. One other thing I would like to point out is that there are a lot of apps available to customize your camera and to add a lot more options. This camera is for people that like to take pictures and have a good digital camera, not for people who want to play with different apps or create new ones. Overall I give this camera a 5 star rating because it is very simple to use and its software is easy to use. I can give the other ratings to other features such as image quality, quality, battery life, picture mode, picture settings. But all of the features are there, just not as easily accessible.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the VPC-600 because I was wanting something that was low-power. I am in an attic which doesn't have AC power so my only outlet is my ceiling light. I was concerned when I looked at the manual that there was no way to plug the USB jack into the wall to charge the phone. The phone itself will not go to sleep so I didn't plan to use it all the time like a PC. But with all the features I like, I don't think this could get any better.

I got it as a gift to a friend who was looking for a new car stereo for his and she absolutely loved it.

Needs a little work on the battery connections and the little tabs are hard to tighten. Other than that its a great battery  Review: Excellent. Seems to work great. I've never seen so many different batteries before. The battery life is great.  It's also nice that it can be charged on the go.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)  Yes No Wednesday, November 30, 2012  Excellent battery . . by Anonymous from Stony Brook NJ USA    Review:-   This battery has worked very well and lasts forever! I bought the 1A version, 2AA and 3AA (I am also a dealer and have some). All work well and do what they are supposed to, and I like the fact that the cells are interchangeable and can be used in other devices too. I have mine charged to about 10% capacity, works great, and can also be used to charge another device, such as my old laptop (still uses AA batteries), phone (I still use AA batteries) and most of my tools. I would recommend this battery to any one who wants to keep their batteries topped off but also be able to recharge them when they run low.  the tabs at the end of the tabs aren't a problem, and they tighten nice and tight  (This reviewwas collected as a part of the "I bought it as part an "I like it, but..." campaign.)  to charge an iPad, you would need to add a USB power adapter for each battery as that's the only one that will work with that model. (This was collected during the "Is This review helpful?" campaign.)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first bought this device, I had not expected it to do anything special. When I plugged it in, it sounded fine. But when I played with the remote, I could not get it to work. So I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and still could not change the volume. I tried plugging it into my computer and it works well but I can't hear any sound. But I guess I was lucky since I had to purchase this after a number of other cheap mp3 players that gave up after the first hour of use.   So I am giving this product two stars because I don't know how to change the music on my MP3 player.  I do not recommend this product  by R. D. on Oct. 15, 2007  Very good mp3 player that was well made. Works perfectly. It would have been better to have some kind of a remote so you could control what music you wanted to play. But it does play music on your computer.  it worked perfectly  great purchase, good sound and easy to use!  Great mp3 music player. Great price.  a little small, but I have an old mp3 and the controls are not the greatest. But for a beginner like me, I'm very happy!  a friend of mine uses the same unit and he thinks it's very good for his computer but for the price, this is the way to go. , by jb on Mar. 08, 2007

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device has been a great addition to my life! The way it does it is amazing, easy to use, and reliable. The only thing i would have liked was an option for a micro usb cable, instead of a mini usb one. The charger for this is great, but the micro usb port would have made it easier to connect to my ipad.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................................A+I'm happy i found this product on here. I'm in my 40s and have only been with my boyfriend since about 10 years. I got this thing in the mail this last Thursday. I used it as an emergency alarm. I put it on my phone. I didn't hear it. I went to turn it on. it was still on. When i went to check it, the battery was totally dead. I think i am not getting the battery out of it. i'll be calling the company..............................................................I bought this one with the intent of using it for my car. I found out later that I can use it for many things, but my car is a little too small. But, for other uses, it has performed perfectly...............................Excellent device. I did not want a regular alarm clock, but with this one you can set it up so it sounds a short alarm so you know when it is time for the kids. You can also set the volume at the lowest setting so you never hear the normal "beep" when your alarm goes off. My only complaint is the design of the remote. You have to get a really sharp knife or you can't control it. But if you can get it to work, it is perfect for what it is intended for..........................................................................I really like this product, it really helps me relax. I have insomnia and with this alarm, the sound is still annoying but the vibrations are just enough to get me to sleep.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony Walkman  (WMP1000)  which has a built in tuner and I was amazed at the sound of my old Walkman which had a cassette tape player.  It had a really bad mic at the back which I removed but the audio is really clear and just a joy to listen to with out a cassette in it.   The headphone jack is small and is located on the right side of the headphone jacks.  I really liked the sound and the build quality of this device which I am using to listen the new James Bond movie and for some reason when I put it on my Walkman it played it without a problem. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  When my Sony Vaio laptop screen stopped working, I found the old one of these very handy. I've used these on several of my portable computers and a number of laptop/tablet computers as well. They worked just as good as my Sony laptop, but I didn't have to pay for one for a spare screen.  The batteries last for a long time and there are several different types so you don't get too bored with the same old one.   A nice way to get some use out of the old TV:    A lot of times you get rid of the TV you have in your house, but in the future you might not have any of these old television sets for a while.  This way you can use these old ones as a way to watch a little bit of television at a time.  The batteries last a long while and there is a little option to purchase a screen protector if the screens do get scratched.  How to get started with these old TVs:     These old televisions are really simple to set up, but it's good to have a picture of what you'll need to do, since you may not have all the parts on hand.  First, you'll want to check the model number for the type of TV you'd like to use.  Next, connect the cord from the TV to the AC adapter for power.  Once connected, you need to connect a monitor and a set of speakers.  Now, you may need to check if your TV will support HDMI.  If you can't use HDMI, you can still use the analog audio input on the TV.  In addition, you must connect your computer to the television, if you're using Windows or OS X.  These models can't support a VGA or DVI connection.  Here's a link to the list of TV's that support HDMI:       If you're running Windows, you might need to change the video settings to something like 1280x720x24 to make the picture look right.  There's a great link that shows how to set the settings on a PC:  http://www.geektutorials.com/forums/showthread.php?t=303765   Now you should have your television connected to your computer and all your components running.  You'll need an audio cable to connect your speakers to your TV and you need a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen is beautiful and responsive but the battery is very weak and the battery life is very small (2 hrs 10 min.)   It's also very hard to use when the screen is upside down, it's a pity. The battery life when using the device is good for a 5in screen, but when you have to go to your other screen or something (like on a phone screen when you are talking to someone else) then the battery drains very quickly.   One more thing: I wish it had a camera button.   the screen seems to be very sensitive and if you touch it it seems to explode or something.  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The sound quality is wonderful and the quality of the music is amazing. I use it for my PC and iPod but I've used this with a Sony PSP also and that sounded very good.  I bought the MusicOne because I was in need of a soundboard for my computer. I'm using this for my 3ds and this is absolutely perfect. Thanks!  The MusicOne is a really nice device. I have been using this as a sound board on my 3DS for the past couple of weeks and love it. The only problem I am having is that it doesn't hold a charge well. I would recommend the charger for this unit.  "Excellent, with some caveats!" This device is great. I used it to do audio work with my laptop and it works great. One problem with this device is that the mic is pretty sensitive, and the bass tends to be too much for my taste. I've also noticed that the volume and balance controls tend to move about and that's a little annoying. Other than those drawbacks, I would definitely buy another one of these and recommend it.  I was very excited about this soundboard, I've been looking for something like it for years and finally found it. It is a little too large for a 3ds, but the sound quality that I get from it is excellent.    Good for casual use... I've found that the sound board isn't very suited for serious use, but I have found it to be an excellent, inexpensive way to get a small portable music system up and running. The audio quality isn't great.   In general I'm not really a music person. I don't use music very often, though it is a very important part of my life. The soundboard was purchased with the hope that I could use it on my iPod (I had an iPod 3G for several years, and I've recently lost it), and I'm very happy with it so far. , but with only two problems: the noise floor and bass...The noise floor is the loudest thing about this thing, and it seems to be quite a bit more than what the manufacturer claims for the product. It's also hard to turn off. The bass is better than any other board I've ever used, and is far superior to any other portable sound board I can think of. The unit also has no problem with batteries that run down (it will run out of power even with

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! You know the battery is dead, or the charger has run out or some other issue is occurring, but you simply cannot get past the "power down" button because the screen is off? This device, by the way, has a micro USB port for charging (even though its a "tent" that has a little pouch to hold it). I find the size and the design very neat. I have been using this for some time, it has worked flawlessly!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this device last week, and i love it!! I just bought a different one, but that was in a store, so it was easy for me to get it. If i had a problem with it i could always call the shop and they'll repair it for me. I was worried because of the other reviews saying the screen breaks quickly or something. But if you don't care about your stuff getting damaged, get it, and you won't regret it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this with the intention of using it as a monitor on my computer. I've been wanting to try the monitor for about a year. I really like it. It is very bright and I love the ease of operation. It works great for movies. I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Have no complaints about the monitor:  The monitor does the job it is supposed to do, just be sure to buy an appropriately sized cable. There was one problem with it for me. I did not purchase the "battery extension" cable. It had some black plastic around the base which was bent. It was no big deal. After unsoldering the black plastic and replacing it with the proper cable, it works great. So, that was a "not so good" for me personally. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my phone today, it's a LG G3, the first one I ever bought, but i still use my G2 because I have a lot more money and more freedom (no one telling me what to do) and a better battery life for the same price and that is all that matters  I love the new software it came with, not to mention all the cool extras that LG added, and the way it looks, which isn't bad at all   When I get around to buying a new phone, I will use this one, and a G2 if i can get one, but not now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Good sound with a decent price  The volume on this stereo is not loud enough for loud rock, but it is nice.   The sound quality is not great, but for the price its not bad. The sound is clean and clear, the bass is a bit lacking, but its not noticeable if you turn down the volume or increase the treble. The highs and mids are good. The only thing i would change is the input on my computer. Its a 1/4 in jack, which doesnt sound nice, and my speakers dont have any input.  Overall a great stereo for the money!  I've had this on my desk for a while now and it is awesome. Not only are the speakers good but the bass and midrange are very clear and the highs are very high. You get an amazing amount of quality for the dollar  It's amazing for the quality of sound  This is a very nice stereo. It has nice highs. The bass is not as deep as the rest of the car. It does have good mids. The treble can be a bit harsh. The quality is good for the cost and that's why I got this. It was not too big to use for an iPod. ,  -  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works and I love it! Great price. Very good quality and good value.   Works great and the warranty is great too! No complaints, great seller!   My 2nd Sennheiser. This is the best. I've had a lot of Senn Hifters. I really like these. They are a bit heavy, but they are very solid. The sound is great, the quality is amazing. They will last forever. I use them with my headphones, and I'm never happy to put them back in my bag.   I'm new to the forum. I bought my first Sennhofer about a year ago. I have no complaints about my first purchase. They're great for what they are! I've owned them through a very wet winter, and now through a mild winter. They have never let me down. They keep up with my listening for hours. And they are so much more comfortable than my SennHifters, it's hard for me to not take them off.   is good! I use my S-650 for music and it works great for my job at home. I'm not a fan of the large earpads and I wish they were a little smaller, but overall, I can't complain about this product.   the quality of these is really good and I have yet to hear a weak link in these headphones, which is a major plus for me.   for about $100 I can spend all day with these and not have to worry about my headphone getting a flat in the middle of the day.   The only thing I would like to see is some sort of silicone seal to the ear cups. There's a lot going on and the noise around my mouth makes the seal loosen up quite a bit.

I use this to keep my computer in a "office" and can see both my monitor and a small laptop (which I use for my homework and documents). I like the way the cord is secured to the wall with two cable tie wraps.  a nice feature is that the cord attaches right to the front of my computer.  to have this monitor close to your monitor can be great  Cons: the only con I can think of is the fact that the monitor doesn't have an on/off switch, that would have been nice.  it is very easy to use (I've been using it for about a month now) and I'm very pleased with my purchase  Review: As an IT guy, this monitor has become a necessity, especially when I am using my laptop as my primary computer. I needed a monitor that was very bright and had great image quality. This model is great and gives you everything you need for your needs. It is also very easy for me to connect to my desktop with the included cable. Overall, great buy for what it is. .    Was This Review Helpful is this a good monitor for the money?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The VV-11000 is a well made and excellent sounding unit. I use it in a bass rig with the VV series guitar, and I have not heard a better sounding pickup at this price point. I don't use a lot of high gain and the V7-12 have made it a breeze to achieve a clean sound in the bass channel. I did have the opportunity to use it as a high gain booster in a couple of amp configurations, but it's really not necessary and I can't understand why people think it is. I'm really impressed by the quality of the body and the neck. This thing is a ton of fun. It sounds amazing, and it's a joy to play with.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The  Dell XPS 13 is a terrific machine. It is more powerful than a full size desktop PC (though still not the fastest) and has a more refined, user-friendly interface. The only thing I didn't like about it was its high power consumption. But, I think Dell is doing a good job at designing a well designed and affordable portable computer. I will always use a desktop PC for many of my daily tasks and this is good enough for me. If you want a PC but don't want to spend a lot of money, consider this Dell XPS-13 as a good value. The Dell has the full HD (1920x1080) display, so it is as good as you can get for this price and performance. It has a very good processor (dual core with Intel HD 520 graphics) and it supports up to 16GB of memory. The built in camera can do 720p video. I'm a PC user, but there are a few things I still like to do on my mobile devices that can be done on my PC. The XPS is very easy to use and I like the keyboard and touchpad. It's very responsive and I don't feel any lag. The camera is also very helpful and very helpful for me on capturing shots of my children. Read the full review:    Dell Xps 13 Laptop
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iM7 has a great feature to make it better when you are using it with another device. I have two different phones. The first one works with my iPad and another device, and the second is my iPod Touch. I always use my iM5 for my iPod but because my iPhone does not have a headphone jack, I need another device for music. The iM6 worked very well for my iPhone 4 (I was using the iM3 for that device). But when I took it back to my iPod, the i3 did not work with my iPhone. So I purchased the i5. It worked fine and I just put in the 3.5mm jack to connect to my iPhone and I am back to where I was with my i3. The only complaint is that the i8 is more expensive. If you want the same features, and you don't mind a bigger device, it is an excellent value.  on May 11, 2015 - 10:28 am: This iM is one of the best products I've purchased. , and, you can't go wrong.

The only thing I don't like is that there is no feature that allows you to have multiple inputs on your TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive tried a ton of different sets of electronic parts for this rig, and i've found that the iMAX is the absolute best. the i7 processor is extremely powerful, and the 8GB memory has no problems keeping the rig running.  My only issue is that the memory slot is located right under the computer which means that your computer is getting hot and making noise. This is no issue with my iMac however. .  of the three iMAX models i've bought, one is in perfect working order. i was very pleased with the way they put the i8 processor in the i9, and was also pleased with how they put in the internal drive (which is the only problem i've had). i like having the option to upgrade in the future.  is my main rig. i have been looking for something like this for a while, but i was always limited by what i could find for under $1000, and this iMAX i9 is that price. its the exact package i was looking for. i also bought this for my son's son with special needs. and he loves it. the only thing we don't like is the memory, because the memory slots are on the bottom. if you have a computer that has a slot underneath the motherboard, you may not be able to insert the memory.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** I am so happy I purchased this for my grandson. He is in the 2nd grade and I was afraid he would play with it more than once before he started using it. It has a bright light which is great for nighttime play and it is very easy to use with the touch panel and controls. I will be purchasing one for him for sure. I like the fact that it is battery powered so he can go to sleep and not have to plug it in at all. The batteries last a very long time. The price is great as well! *********  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I received my e-reader today. I'm loving it!!! This is a great device to read your favorite books. My only suggestion would be that there's a better way to read books. It has a built in battery that keeps it from getting warm after sitting for a long period of time. But, at least if you leave it in your car, you don't have to worry about it charging on the side of the road. I am an avid reader, so that's an added bonus. I also use it for school reading. My classmates are going to hate me now that they know how many books I've read. Thank you for making a great product!!!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this monitor and its very nice. i've had it a few months and use it to watch my son and his school play football and it's awesome. it's great for my son. i have another monitor and they're not very good for watching football with the children. This is the best. i would recommend to anyone who has a tv that doesn't look very good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive just installed my new ew1000 in my car i can get around the city easily and on the highway i feel like i have more power i was buying my ew100 because it was the same as the ew200 and i was looking for a good value but when i got the e500 i can tell they spent more time and effort on it than the e100 i was very impressed with how well it all works together it is very smooth and i am glad i chose it ive had it for a few days now and i can say its the best ive ever used i would recommend this ive got a couple ew101's as well but im still waiting on mine to come in ive heard the e-100 is better but for me this is the one i would buy it again and again just got mine and will definitely be buying a hundred more of them
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a while now and i am very impressed by its quality and functionality. i find myself running a few things at the same time and with no trouble at all. i also love that it has a built in cd player with a lot of space for music. i can play a little while the tv is on and then it will go into sleep mode when the tv goes off. the only thing that i could make the buttons to do is to make it easier to navigate up and down, and give the option to change channels. that would be better. and i wish it came with the cord. but then the cord should be included as well. and for $30 is a great deal, im sure most people would agree. i would definitely recommend this device to a friend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************* This has been my most used electronic device since I have it (almost 6 years). It has worked perfectly for the past 4 years. If I had a choice of any of the electronic devices on the market today, I would pick this one, if I could get one. I do recommend it to my students who are interested in learning to program. It's really easy to use and once you learn how to use it, you'll learn how fast and how easy the software can be. I really like that there are many programs for programming, not to mention the built-in graphing calculator. Thanks to the software, I am able to do all of my math works in my head, not in front of the calculator. You must get the software to use this device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device I bought is a "smart" lock. It allows me to control the locks of my home. It has worked great. The only problem I have is that it cannot detect the motion of a doorbell (it was never loud enough to detect). I think the alarm was set up wrong but there is nothing I can do about that.   I recommend this device to everyone. I have tried a lot of locks but this one is the one I use the most, and I have no complaints. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good and cheap solution to a security problem like door locks. I love the product
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I got this and it is so great!!! It is like the sound from a big amplifier!!!! Love it!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 by Mikey J. from Great amp for the money. I have been using it with my Zoom H1 for a few months. I like that it has two channels so I can split it between my laptop and my stereo system. I am not going to comment on the sound quality because I am new to amps.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had a problem with the original wireless remote, but i did not have to take it back to Best Buy, because they have sent a replacement.   The new remote is awesome, but when i get it the cable is in bad shape.  It takes several trips to the repair center to get the new cable and i cannot get it to go through the switch or a computer because of the cable length.  A cable in good shape is the only thing i am not happy about with the new remote.  The best feature on the new wireless remote is that it is touch sensitive.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 28, 2016  good quality  by David from St. Louis MO USA  Pros: Good quality  (good sounding)  Review: I like the fact that it has three tones and can go through a range from warm to harsh. It is not quite as loud as a transistor radio, but a nice enough noise to use in the bedroom.  I like that it is small and small enough to be concealed  (cons: it doesn't have a rechargeable battery like the radio) - only negative would be the battery compartment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive got an evga xf650w (which is a super amazing laptop) and its extremely fast with the integrated geforce 660 card. it feels really high quality. the only downside is that the usb 2.0 ports are in the front (i got it for 2 games on pcportal) i would recommend getting a usb hub though so you can have 2 at the same time on pc portal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my laptop. It is very good in every way except the sound quality. It's hard for me to listen to music at the computer because the speakers are not loud enough. So, I bought a good stereo headphones and I was happy with the sound! I am very satisfied with the product, and it's been very helpful and a pleasure to work with you. Thank you.  Product Reviews Images Dialog Product Reviews Images  Review by: Dina from Florida on March 15, 2018. I bought these because I love them. I love the fact that they last for a long time and are durable. I've even thrown them away once. I have been using them for about a year now. I use them with the iBook laptop and I really like the sound of them with it. I do recommend these. I like them a lot. I don't really like them with a smartphone. I think they are too bright and too loud for that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this thing about a month and absolutely love it. I have to turn it off before I sleep and wake up and use the power while asleep and I love that I can set different hours and turn it on and off on my own schedule. I can wake up on my way to work in the morning with the house to myself and be on my feet for at least 45 minutes if I want. I haven't found anything wrong with it. It is quiet when you turn it back on. No more annoying background noise. It charges quickly and when I was out of juice I didn't have to wait 5 minutes to charge. It's so convenient.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thanks I like this product. It gives me the option of being able to hear the baby at night while my baby sleeps. I find that I need to have the sound turned up, for me, and the baby, as she is so noisy and the sound is a good alarm. I have also been able to use it as an alarm for my baby when I wake up too. I was very impressed with the price. It was the best investment I've ever made in my baby and I have the baby on it now for almost 6 months now. Thank you for a great product!  Great feature for newborn sleepers:  I bought this alarm for a newbie sleeper (6 mo.) which is also a pacifier sleeper. It is super easy to set up and works GREAT. It has multiple functions and is quite inexpensive (about $15). A lot of things can go wrong in your crib but this works GREAT for me. I sleep VERY well at night with this alarm! It has a good wake up noise and wake up light that is very easy to use and a few settings to add to the wake up settings. I highly recommend this for any newborns! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this before and ive had to replace the battery twice now, once for about 3 months. both times it has been due to a bad battery. so if you are going to get this, ive got bad news for you. if the battery isnt bad then get it, otherwise stay away from this unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ When I first got my AO-2 it was really cool and I was very happy with it. But then I got tired of the low quality audio and then the battery life. Now I have a better AO 2 that I used to use with my old laptop but I'm just a tad disappointed with this one. I am back to my old AO II and I can't wait to get the new one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I had some issues with this device at first, i was told that this model was no longer available for sale and i have seen several others on ebay but i could not afford them. I contacted them directly but they said that I was not a genuine customer (i was very happy to find this out). So i sent a mail back saying that it was a waste of time for them to contact me again. However when i received a message asking for more information about my purchase, i had to return it. However i was pleased to find a better model from my old one that works just fine. I just ordered another one for my other home.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i use this keyboard for all kinds of different electronic projects i do at home, and i think this is the first keyboard I have ever used that is so accurate with my fingers that i don't even have to do anything other than press keys with the right-hand finger that is on the computer, and this is a big part of what makes me happy!   this is definitely a great keyboard if you like to do all sorts of things with your computer keyboard, if you have a computer with wireless connection and you like this one because you don't want to get the regular cheap one you can get at the hardware store, the only problem is that this keyboard is a little bit tight at first, but then after you get used to it, this keyboard doesn't have a single dead key (except if you are unlucky, which is why I love this keyboard so much!):)   if you are looking for a great cheap computer keyboard and you need to keep it in working condition, this is definitely one you will want to buy!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The VST effects I am using are: The HU-1A (with the old firmware) and the  BFD4  (with the new firmware) The BFD is in its final version now and is the best in the world at this time. I use this unit as a digital effect processor and the best sound I've ever heard. The HU1A uses its own buffer and the new HU firmware has added features to the HU, especially buffer management. This is one of the best sounding compressors I've seen for the price, although I'd love to see a compressor with a more dynamic range but for the time being this is great. A nice feature on the HVHU is that the BFD can also be used as a pre-delay, which I really like, and the sound of the delay is very nice. Here is a clip from my collection, it is a drum track and the B&W effect is there but the bass is a little over-driven in this track. This track is from my new book on  drum samples, but it could be used for anything.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been looking for a better, safer solution for my electronic devices for years. when i tried out the sony smart tv for the first time i was amazed. the remote is incredibly easy to use and works amazingly well. even with the tv set to 'off' and in a small room, the smart tv is always on. for a home office i also have a hdmi and ipod that are always connected. the most annoying thing about having to keep two devices connected to your wifi is the fact that the ipod always has to be connected. after reading all of the positive reviews and looking at the price point i picked it up. i have to admit that the smart set is much cheaper than a hifi dac which has a much bigger remote control. the ipad is great for my kids who like to play games on the computer but cant bring it with them. the wifi is amazing too. i never have problems with the connection to my phone or computer. the sennheiser m-80's are great for gaming too. ive got a new one of those for my ipod. the other reason i got this set is because i bought the hd version of the htc vive. i was very surprised when i got it. i've always used the s3 dac for my gaming but i thought maybe it was the sound card or something. now that i have this set the sound is better than ever. i also really like that i can play the music on my ipods. the tv is amazing, the vive is great but i'm looking at getting the htxvve for sure. i can see myself using this for gaming as well as a tv with blu-rays and podcasts. for what the set costs and works so well, it is definitely worth the money.

I am not very familiar with the software because my laptop only has a DVD drive, so I can't watch youtube on it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have to admit I was a bit leary of buying a tablet because I have never used one before and I never had to.  But I am glad I did.   It has all the functions you would want and it is very nice to use.  I can do most things I did on my phone on the tablet which is very handy.  It is also a very nice screen.  If you have an Android or an iOS device then you will appreciate the keyboard and other functionality on the touch screen as well.  Overall it has a good feel and quality feel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!The A/V receiver is perfect for my new stereo system with a Pioneer HDJ-2000H with 6" LCD and Pioneer BDP-105 CD player and speakers. No power supply issues like before, and the audio is just right. The sound is so clean and clear I think the audio quality will last a lifetime.

It's an excellent player, good price for a good player, and a great sound with good detail. I just need to buy some cables to connect this to the BCDM1 so I can connect it to my iPod or other portable media player without worrying about the BX3's audio cables getting in the way. The quality of the audio was excellent as well. It really sounded as it should. So far, so good. ...  Read full review

I do a lot of graphics/video editing and this thing can handle it all and more.  The only thing I wish was better was the keyboard. . ,,,,,,,,,,,  I love the Gizmo!  .   I was looking for a good portable media player and this one works great. It has 4x sound and has a full size disk drive. I use it for watching movies, playing music, downloading stuff and I use this for my family on the road. The Gizmos have a nice screen that is very readable. It is easy to operate, and the battery lasts. It can power the G-Power for 4 hours with no problems. The only downside is that the sound isn't very great. You have to have a good headset or speaker system to get good sound. It's a good device though. I will be purchasing another one for my son.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with my new Vostok 1M V1.  - I used it extensively from April to October 2007 with my PC, which was built about 15 years ago.  - It's quite simple to operate.    In addition to its well-designed hardware, the Vostoks provide great service.  There is a good range of warranty options.  It ships fast.  I love the low-profile mounting plate (3/4 inch) and the integrated mounting bracket.  The electronic controls are very easy to operate and I use them most of the time.  In summary, I am very happy with the VOSTOK1M. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      This is a great product and is one of the better products I've ever purchased from ecigarette.com.

It does not make your cigarette taste like it does with the regular cig. I am very happy I got it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is amazing. For it's size it plays music really well, especially in my car. I am not the biggest fan of the car stereo but my kids love it and I get some music out of it on my phone.  There's a remote on there so you can play music from the phone but it is not super convenient.    I really like the sound of the speakers on this thing!   I do wish that it came with a remote like the other "Bass" car audio devices.  My kids are getting into a little rock band and I'm not really sure how to use the remote to control that without being able to see what you are trying to do.

Write a negative review about an unpleasant product: u-blox  It was a very interesting product, and is the best idea i've heard for a 3D printer yet. Unfortunately it is in fact crap! I didn't want to give it a 5 because it is a 3d printer and I use 3d printers all the time, but i'm just disappointed that it's a bad product. I thought it was a bargain. , it does work, but not with a pro 3D Printer.  in the u-Blox is a software that is great for modeling. It has an auto calibrate that seems to get it close to the actual printer. But even that fails to print on my iixr. My guess is that the u Blox is too weak to accurately print with a 3rd party pro 3d Printers. I guess you'll have to wait for the pro 3m printer to get the u blox off their backs and start producing the u blender, and it will take a while. Dennis, The ublox is very good for the price for printing a lot of small objects, with no support material it also works pretty good for small objects that are fairly tight, for example small car body parts and such. I think a large printer, or one that can print on very thin materials could be a better fit, I would be happy to purchase the printer for printing the parts of my new truck. I can print very well, I printed the nose piece of my steering wheel, and then made a gasket to fit it, and that worked, but it looks like the front of the steering wheel is really wobbly because it wasn't printed with the proper supports. You have to get really careful when printing things like that, the prints tend to be very delicate and fragile. The only negative about the ubloxtr is the printer does not come with the correct support material, but if you order the printer from ebay, you will have to make your own. Logan, It would be

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The RCA jack is a must have in your system. The sound quality is outstanding. I'm listening to my TV (LG Electronics 38", 1920x1080 60hz, S-Picture), the CD (MP3, 320Kbps, 6.1) and a laptop computer (IBM Thinkpad, 16" LCD, Intel Atom N270). I use my S-Jack with the CD player (CDM-SX9D). The sound has much clearer clarity. The iPod/USB audio output works well. The TV is able to receive S-sound even from a remote control. I also have an AppleTV and can easily receive both S- and S-HDTV via S-jack. The RCA jacks are very convenient to use. I only wish that the AppleTV was built in to the TV. I use the Apple TV to send audio to my computer to record, edit and mix for home video. I prefer that the cable is connected to a wall outlet rather than my computer, since my computer has no sound output and no remote control to turn the volume up or down.  Write a negative review about an unknown item:   Purchased this to convert a VCR into a DVD player, which would allow me to record and play TV shows on my laptop computer with S-video input. This is a really nice box with nice audio and video inputs. I like that I can use my computer's built in speakers or any other sound system I may have for a remote. I haven't tried to connect a sound system to it, but if I want to connect the VCR to my sound system, it would be a nice addition. I haven't seen any reviews that mention the RCA inputs on the bottom and this seems like the ideal way to attach the VHS tape player or cassette deck to this unit. The remote control would be nice too, but since this unit is so inexpensive, it's a minor inconvenience. I would like to add a "smart" switch that could switch between S- or S-SAT, but I'm not sure if this will fit with the RTC/DTV circuit board. The box seems to have no way to "control" the S-AT or SST outputs. This unit does have a USB output, but it does not play the SST/SSTV format. To get the best use out of my unit, I need

I have never had this type of connectivity before.  This device is well built, but it's a little too tall and the cable can be a little tight.  It's great!   Just got it, but its been so cool since I plugged it in!  I will say I am a little disappointed that it has not yet detected my old wireless keyboard.  My old keyboard just works fine, so I will have to check to see if that is a problem or if I just need to do a little adjustment.  The buttons are a little mushy, but I figure that's just a function of the product I bought.  One thing to remember is to always keep it plugged in and it should last for ages.    This is a great product!  It is great to see that these new wireless keyboards for computers have finally arrived.  Since buying my original wireless keyboard, it was really annoying to constantly have to switch to my laptop to type or do anything.  Now that I have this new keyboard, I can type and do more than I could before.   I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a wireless keyboard that is very easy to use and allows you to keep your laptop and tablet connected with one keyboard.   WOW!  This thing is amazing! I was so excited about this product.  When I picked it up at the store, I couldn't believe the price.  However, it is well worth the money!  Now, this thing is so easy to get to work with!  The only thing is, I wish it would come with two extra cables.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had one for about a month and it has worked great since then. The unit is small and very lightweight and easy to operate. The only thing that i have had to adjust is my volume when im in the studio and its not that loud. I just have to adjust the setting on my mixer before i mix anything. i hope to get a few more uses out of this. ive been using it in my home studio for recording guitar and bass.  its not loud and not bright and can be used on the stage for music too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using my  Warm Up 2 to play a game I'm trying to beat (Hexic 3 and the Guitar Hero games, and Rock Band 2)  and the  quality of sound on these are better than my old  HV500's and this  is not an exaggeration.  The low end of my guitars is still very high and not very clear, but that's not to say I don't have the best low end on these.  They are quite powerful which can be useful with certain songs, but the high end is really nice and clear.  I think the amp sounds better in my studio but still great on the road.  It's a good all-around amp.  As others have said, if you need a good sound then these are good for your money. I think I'm going to give them a 10.5 on the sound quality.  So in conclusion, if I could make any sound good I'd choose these. I haven't had a chance to go back and give the amp any feedback.  If I did I would say they have pretty good sound, I think they just need better drivers and a better amp.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had my first go with the HOG a couple of years ago and have just now got around to installing the new model. The unit is a lot smaller and more stable than my previous unit. The control panel is a real joy to use and has a huge number of functions. I've had to use my mouse to change the audio level a couple times because the HOF is not responsive enough. My current unit has the same problem. A lot of people are saying that the interface is very finicky, I have not encountered this problem so far. Overall, I am very pleased and highly recommend this device.  If you don't have a high end digital recorder you need this:    I have been using an Epson Stylus Photo Studio (I'm on my fifth model) for almost 10 years now and I absolutely adore it, but I have now found an even better way of handling the footage (or even just the images taken with it): A GoPro Hero 3 Black 3D Camera. I can't believe how good a device it is (and I still can't get rid of all the old SD cards I keep, as I cannot be bothered to get another one). The quality is great and the software for processing the photos is wonderful. Also, it has the advantage of not having to sync with the computer.   I am only using the camera when I'm out for a shoot but I can just about use the camera for any other job I have coming up and am absolutely loving it. If you're on a budget but still want to capture a good video, this is the best option!  Just don't take it out in water: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using the Apple Watch as my watch since March 2015. I have the latest model and it is a nice watch. It is small and very light. I am able to check email without looking at my wrist and it has some other functions. I wish they would have kept the watch as a watch. I use it as a wrist watch and I don't like the size of it as an on wrist. This time, I bought a second hand with it and it looks nice. I will recommend this watch to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm really happy with my Samsung GALAXY S3. It's much better than the Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The mouser is an excellent mousetrap for finding wires or cables on the floor. The moustache, which is attached to the device and is not actually a moustachio, allows the user to see where the wires are.   My only complaints about the moustaches are that you cannot get a third moustached mousette so there are only two moustaing mousettes and when the device gets dirty, the dirt comes out through the mousettos.   5/5 best of the best!!!!! by David on 03/04/2013  Recommended by: Michael from New York.

It's not the best performer by any means, but if you like to fly a quadcopTER, you'll love this one. , it's not much bigger than the DJI Phantom 4. The controller has a simple setup and intuitive features. The camera is very bright and you can see it from a long distance. It also comes with a wide-angle lens so you can shoot from any angle without a lot of distortion. Also, there's a LED on the top that flashes when the camera is recording. In my experience, the Spark can be pretty finicky, especially in windy

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had a few of these units over the years and they work very well on a regular basis. the key to keeping them operating is to make sure your head is on the right track when you use them. if you start to think theres something wrong, it could be too hot (make sure the unit is not running cold).   i also use a remote to operate the unit. it works great when i can get the unit up to temp quickly.   other than that, the unit runs like a dream. i wish i would have bought one before i had a kid and it wouldnt have cost alot to buy one just for my dad, he is the one i would use it on most of the time if my wife wasnt there, because the remote is so handy   keep up the great work guys, keep up the good work!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I bought this to add a 3-4" subwoofer to my home theater system.  I did have to cut down on the size of the bass port to fit the driver.    The box it came in was small, so I had to take it apart and remeasure the port holes to make sure the driver would fit.  I then installed it and played a movie.  The sound was not bad, but just not as loud as I would like.  You could hear the music well enough, but the bass was too much for me.  My subwoofers are big and it took a bit of work to get the box to fit. However, with the right amplifier, I could make it work.  It is small so it can be easy to move, but not enough room to put a bigger subwoo...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I have used this radio for a couple of years now, mainly on long runs, and it has served me well. It's a great asset to my back pack. I use it for GPS and I can use it over a long distance as well, as the battery is large and doesn't need recharging when I have to stop and turn around. It has a great receiver. It was easy to install and the instructions are very well written. Overall it has worked great and I have had no problems at all. The only problems I've experienced are that sometimes the receiver won't talk and sometimes when I try to get it to talk, it won't work, although the problem was very brief. I hope this helps.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   i love it. and i have never had any problems with it. i just wish there was a usb input as well.  Write a negative review about something that didn't work properly:  This is a great piece of kit. I had trouble with it in two ways: 1) I plugged it in, then turned it on and nothing happened - I had to turn the plug off to turn it back on - 2) I took the old battery out (as I had a new one in a different set) and plugged it into it and the batteries did not fit in (the wires seemed too short) I didn't know that at the time I bought it, and it took me a bit to discover that.   I had to buy a new battery after this and the new one is now the last one in the box. The only way to get a new replacement battery is to send the old one back to them. So, not a big deal for me but you should know the battery is defective!   Overall: I like it. But be aware of the batteries.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an amazing tool for creating sounds. The only negative thing is that it is quite expensive. The product works really well. There are plenty of features, but you have to be careful about the input voltage level. In my experience, the voltage level is too high for it to work properly. I'm happy with my purchase and will be sure to use it again in the future.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Joe from It's a great way to make sounds. It does the job... It's just a little more expensive. However, for the price it's worth it. I like the idea of doing electronic sounds with a musical instrument like a guitar and having a keyboard that also plays like an electric guitar. You can have any combination of notes in your song and be able to create your own music. It can also be used to control the power to a stereo or tv.  (more)

I was so excited to take it out to my garage and start charging my toys. My mother was right! You can't go wrong with this. It charges very fast and is very compact.

It has a nice throat hit and it's quite a strong flavor. I really enjoy this product because I will be using it with my new mods! Great product and I recommend it to others!  5 / 5 Best vaporizer i have had The best vaporizer ive ever used ive had it for about 3 months now and ive not experienced any problem at all. Im using this on my new vaporizer as well and no problem at the same time. I will definitely be purchasing more ive been using this for a couple of months now ive really enjoyed the flavor and the vapor production ive gotten with it  3 / 5 Great but... I'm a newbie to vaping. I bought the KOGAN at the recommendation of a friend. I can't wait to order more. I was expecting a subpar vapor production, but it's been great. I'm trying to make it to 6 days of vaping before I get too tired to continue. It's a little expensive, but I think I paid for what I got with the extra quality of mind. As for the flavor, I feel like I have to be careful about inhaling too far into my stomach. Otherwise, the flavor is awesome. Just wanted to let everyone know how well it's working for me so far. I think it would also be really helpful to get some good cloud production and taste, but this is my first time using it.  4 / 5 Amazing! I had purchased a sub-par "starter" cartomizer and was ready for a real upgrade. I've used several cartomizers and have to say this is definitely my new favorite! It's so smooth and flavorful. You really can't go wrong with the Koozer. .  and now  i've used this in 2 ways, with a RDA and with a sub ohm tank.   both have been amazing! I have had 2 sub ohms before and both have left me disappointed.  This Kogan has taken me to new levels of vapor production with it's awesome flavor!  on the go I love it! You can even vape it while on the move. It will even work on your smart phone with bluetooth, just make sure to keep your battery charger close

So far, I've used it for my daily commute, a trip to the park, a quick evening with my children and a couple of play sessions with my kids and it just works.  It also takes some getting used to because it's so large. When you're on the move, it's easy to just hold it in one hand and not worry about it and then when you turn it round, it takes a lot of getting used too as it is a bit large for one hand. .  and the batteries last so long! I am currently using the 12v and the 3.7v and I'm quite amazed at the battery life. They'll last a while and you'll forget you're even using them.

I'm still on my 2nd camera with the new camera, so it is worth buying the camera if you don't like the 6 (the 6 Plus does have extra features).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is simple to use but easy to use properly. My only complaint is it isn't as bright as a digital readout and there is very little feedback for when the battery is at or below 10% so when using a low capacity battery the unit shows a big green "warning" light when the unit is low. I can live with this if it is not an issue. I am a heavy computer user and this is a perfect device for me. This is a small, portable, portable.  I was skeptical about buying an e-cigarette but now that I have, I am not sure I would not buy another one in the future. If you are thinking about it this is the best purchase for you.    I have been using it since I received it in the mail on March 6, 2016. After a month or so of heavy use I am now extremely happy. I have been running my mod on 80% to 90% power the whole time. I've only been using mine for about a month and it still works as advertised. I would say it is on the lower end of the e-cig prices but the quality and features are well worth the cost.   Would recommend to everyone to buy one.  and yes it does work and it is cool and looks cool too  So far so good, the ego battery is so much better than the li-ion. I don't even like that they are called ego, they look like mini e-cigs.  (this review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to get my mom on the telephone. So far so good. The phone itself is really nice. I'm not a big telephone user and never have been, so this is a real good change. I do have a few gripes though. I had a few issues getting the phone to connect to my computer. The first is when I called the house phone it said it could not connect, but after I switched the computer on and plugged it into it, it seemed to connect and I was able to talk to her. The second is, once I got on the phone it seemed that it did not do a very good job of recognizing the caller ID. I can't seem to figure out why it was not recognizing the person who called when it recognized the name, address, etc of the caller. If I call the house again it seems to remember, and sometimes I get a message that says someone has called, but it's not from her. I think if it had known who the caller was it would recognize who it was. It would also have remembered if I was the caller or someone that was calling her from another phone. Overall, this phone is great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A really nice product and a very well made one. The quality is second to none and the value for money is amazing. I am a hobbyist and I needed something to use on my computer as a media centre. I like the fact that the device is built into the computer and can only be removed with the right tools. It allows me to use my pc anywhere from my sofa and TV stand to the top of the fridge. I really like the ability to add my own software that I like, I can even add it to my existing software and the only thing it needs is the DVD drive. The only down side is that it is a very heavy piece and to get it off the computer is very difficult. I use this as a music player for my ipod and laptop but also as a PC. It is very light, very easy to carry and when it is all done I have a nice clean PC, which is what I wanted. It doesn't have a front facing speakers but you can use the usb ports on the side to connect an external speaker. The fact that you can do this means that you will get all the sound in your house, so it will sound good if you are in the living room, or use it for watching movies. It only has the 4 USB ports, however I have used a USB hub and it is very easy and it has just the one port in the bottom so you can plug in any device that has a USB port. I'm very happy with the device and the quality of the workmanship.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this phone for about a week now and it is very impressive. i am a very heavy user and i have heard of many other phones having battery problems. the phone is extremely lightweight, very compact and feels so nice in the hand. there is no problem with getting to the top or bottom of the phone which is nice as well. the camera is amazing on this phone. i could not believe the photos the phone took when im using the flash. and i love the sound quality. the software that comes with this phone is very good. there are a few things i would change, but that isnt the phone's fault. i bought this phone to use on my tablet which i use to take pictures and watch video and it works great for both of these purposes. im sure this phone will last me a very long time because it has a great battery life and its very small so the battery can last a long time. i would suggest this phone as a nice cheap replacement phone and as long as you do not mind the smaller size and lightweight, you will be happy with it.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for the iPad2 a few years ago and still love it! It is much faster then my previous iPad2 that i had and it still does not suck up any battery at all. Also  you can do all your gaming and other multimedia with it with no issues.  The battery life is great too.   It is small so it is not going to get in the way of anything and it is still light enough to be carried everywhere and put in my bag. The battery does last forever so that is a plus.  Overall    I am very satisfied with the purchase of the   Pro 1.3  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used it on the job site, for the camera that my son needed for school work.  It's a perfect size, and my camera lens fits easily into the hole, so you can't put any filters in there.    I've only had the device for a week, but I already have to put some new filters on it every month or two to make it fit right.  I would recommend this product to any person who is looking for something simple and useful, but don't want to spend lots of money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've bought several of these as a new owner. I've had the old, and the first thing i noticed was the fact that it could not be moved. No one had bothered to upgrade the battery for it. The new battery, however, was fine. It was very smooth and accurate. A few things to consider, though, when upgrading the battery: 1. If you buy one that's a year or two old, you may want to buy a spare battery. I just found out that the battery is not replaceable, but you could always purchase the same battery. 2. The battery does not come with any extra wires. It's got a USB cable, so it must be plugged in with one of the usb ports that you plug into. I don't know how long it takes to charge. It took me about 15 hours. 3. When you are charging the battery, it does not stay plugged in unless you manually let it stay plugged-in to save power. It does have a very low power when it's charging and a high power when you first turn it on. So I can't see how anyone can charge their phone and have it turn off the battery on their phone. You can't charge it while in airplane mode. So, if you want to charge it on your phone, I'd just put it in airplane-mode. But I can just forget it on and not worry about the battery running out on me when I try to charge my phone.   Overall, I have had this phone for about a year now, and it is an excellent phone. If I had to give it another star, it would be because of the fact you can not leave it in the case. I use it as a flip-phone and have to have it in a case when I travel. You do not have to be locked into any specific network. You are able to do things like call and text the international landline. I wish you would have included the case to this phone, but at $130, it's hard to complain. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my first e-cigarette in the mail a few days ago and have been using it daily for the past week or so.   It was a little slow to start and didn't have very great battery life.  This has been corrected and it now lasts me all day and the battery seems to be well charged.  The vapor is very good and the price is very reasonable.  I plan to purchase a second one soon to expand my collection.  Recommended.  Awesome little device: I have tried about a dozen different ones and this one is my favorite one. Great flavor, vapor, and long lasting battery.  Its very portable and the included charger is amazing.  It is perfect for me when I travel to a friend's house for some serious vaping.    Great battery life:  The battery lasts on a single charge quite long, about 5-6 hours.   Great Price:  (5-6 hrs)  My only regret is that the battery has a short life. :  for the price you get what you pay for.  in my opinion, this is the best e-cig for the money.  to me, it's not even close  It's just a very cool looking little device. I have never had a bad one, and I have bought quite a few from all different brands and I will continue to use them.

's lighted' and "stays on" with the new firmware upgrade. /2  Review of: Ice Eazy 3  I purchased the Ice Eaz 3 for my husband for Christmas for his birthday. He is very happy with it. The Ice Eazz 3 is not heavy at all and it is light. It has no smell at all. The unit works great for his job. The ice eazy does not require a constant power supply. It also provides enough power to operate in the basement during the cold winter weather.  The unit is easy to maintain, it will run a few days until the fan starts to spin up. It will get up to temp without any problems.  it also heats up nicely in the winter.    Overall a very good unit and a great price.  to order you can go to ezeezy.com.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I have had a couple of these for over a year now. I do not use them much, but they work. I use them mostly for keeping my work place working. The thing that makes it great is the fact that it does not drain batteries like a computer, it does charge them, it even charges my cell phone without having to use it. I love it. It is a great product, highly recommend  no more mains plugs! ----- My problem was that my mains was broken, and I wanted to plug a computer into the wall to use my laptop. So I bought the wall charger for my laptop and this one. So far, so good. One morning while working on my laptop the battery on my wall charger died. I plugged the wall charging into my laptop, and the computer would not work. So, I bought a new battery and plugged it into the new wall charger, but the battery would not charge, so I tried again. I thought it was just a bad battery, so when it worked the first time, I thought I'd give this one a chance. Well, it wouldn't charge and I had to buy another battery. The bad battery was the new one. This one works great. The only problem I have encountered is that the phone charger is on the top of the wallcharger. The wall charger seems to be held in place with some kind of glue. I think the glue is so thin that it makes the phone charging easier. The phone charging is so easy that I don't even use the wall chargers. I just plug my laptop into the laptop and the phone into the phone. That's it. The whole process is so quick, I've never used a USB charger to charge my phone. The charger is so simple, and works so great, I can't believe I ever thought it would be a problem. The product will work for a while, but it's still going to be broken and useless.  This is my first time using this product. It works great for my needs. I was able to use the wireless keyboard and mouse without the need for a keyboard/mouse adapter. I am so happy with the product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Rollei RF-S5, the RF-5 is an amazing unit with fantastic video and sound. The audio was better than the S2D's. Also has a micro sd card slot that is handy. I also purchased a Rode VideoMic for the Rollexic but only used it once since I had the Rode and it was just for background noise reduction. I really think this product is worth the price tag and the extra features and the sound it gives. I think all the Romex products are excellent and this one is no different.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "Just received my new iphone 6s and it works perfectly. It is the thinnest phone I ever owned and it fits perfect in my hand. I am a computer repair guy and I used it for a week and a half today. So far, no dropped calls or battery issues. The photos that were taken were great, my wife liked that I could take multiple photos at once without stopping to move my camera, and it is really thin. I will say the battery life sucks, but at least it can still get through a full day with heavy use. I just wish it had a micro SD card slot, it was really hard to get the battery out of the phone.  I am going to return it for an apple one because my 5s had issues in the same area."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this phone as an upgrade to my Sony Xperia T. It is a good phone, it does not have the latest features, but this is not a matter of money, if you want a good camera, this phone is a must buy.  The only thing that might not be good, is the battery. I have tested it out, and it will last about 8 hours, which is not bad. .  for a great camera  My phone has been a Sony Xperia S for quite a while. So I decided to get a new model with the latest Sony specs. I was looking for a decent camera but wanted to spend the extra for something extra. This is perfect! I was expecting the best of the best when it comes to camera but it actually did not disappoint. In a word, amazing. With it's f/2.4 aperture it is not only fast, but also has a wide enough aperture to take good pictures. And not to mention that it's fast and stable enough to be a good video recording tool.   It is a bit of an odd phone but not a deal breaker. I will keep it and use it for a while to make sure its good for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used it since i got it and it works great its not just another cheap gps, its really useful  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, January 21, 2016  Good but not perfect  by C.C. from North Kingstown RI USA  Pros: Easy to set up, GPS is accurate. I really like the way you can set your elevation and heading with one button. It is a little more than a GPS but not by much.  Cons: It does have a few downsides that I wish would be resolved as I was getting ready to purchase the GPS with my iPhone. 1. The Gs does not have a GPS antenna as I wanted. I found a local GPS antenna that worked as well. 2. I wish they had another button that would take you to a list of your saved points. This button also works as an altimeter. This would allow me to set it like the other GPS but to just take you there, not to the map but to a saved point.  (It has a lot more features that I just don't have the time to use them all, not including my daughter, but I will learn them eventually.)  Review: It is great, but you have to be very careful of the range and accuracy. It has to be set to your correct setting and for some reason, it won't work when it is not. It also will show the position and bearing wrong. It takes a lot of effort to set the right bearing and distance and also keep it accurate. My wife and I just went with the GPS as it was easy. I think it would have been better if they had a better button that allowed you to do things like altitude adjustment. I use my iPhone as a map and not a GPS so I find the map navigation on the device easier than the GPS. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking at the Philips Hue light bulb and the Hue smart lighting system since they were released and finally decided to get one after searching online and on ebay for about a month. I decided on getting the compact light fixture with the timer. The first thing I noticed when I got the light was that it was much brighter than I thought it would be. It was actually very useful in my room. Also, it is much quieter than the traditional dimmable ballast bulbs. This has been a big selling point for me. I also have to say it has been incredibly easy to install. I did some research before I got one and it was very easy to put together and adjust. After setting it up, I had to wait about an hour for it to light up and then it lit up nicely. It can be controlled via an app, though it is not the most user friendly. It is a pretty basic app, but you can choose the light color and brightness and it will keep it on for you. It did have a glitch in the installation when I didn't have the app installed. The bulb came with a small screw in socket that did not fit perfectly so I had a bit of trouble getting the bulb to actually fit into the socket, but it was still easier than screwing the bulb in with no head. If you are just looking for a very bright bulb, I think you are going to be very happy with this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Great, affordable, very fast and easy to set up!!!   I bought a digital clock/timer about a year ago, and I have been very happy with it. I like to track my personal time. I also have a PDA, and my "personal" clock will always be the top of my "to-do list" on the PDA.   The only things I would suggest, and they do help, are:  1) When the device is first turned on, set the "Daylight time" to 12/24, and then "Brightness" to 15.2. Then set "Power" to High.   the more you read about this item the more I like it. Thanks for making it possible to track your time.   a.   in my house we have a kitchen counter that has a "digital" timer on it.   "Ding" every 12 minutes it is time for breakfast.   The only problem with this is it is pretty large. It needs more than one counter top to fit. But I can see a kitchen timer on top of another counter top if there are not enough counters.   of all the timers in the house, this one has gotten the most use.  .  ,   2) The "Calendar" setting is a little hard to use when you have a lot of calendar entries. If you just put the clock on one of the calendar lines you can see the numbers and you can make a list.   to move it to the other line you have to scroll back a line and then put it on the correct line.  -2) I wish you would have a small display with the numbers or just show the minutes.     All of these are small issues and the clock has proven itself. I am always happy with this product.   I have a "computer/digital" alarm clock that is working fine with my iPhone 4. The only complaint I have is that it only turns on when I set it to alarm. It has to be set by hand. If that problem was fixed, it would be a 5 star product. Thanks   by Anonymous on August 27, 2012  I use this for tracking my time. The app is a must! You have to be on the right track with your time to keep it accurate. It is worth the price.  's just wish the display was a little larger but so far it has been fine.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, March 06, 2015  by Adam from New York City  Review: I had been looking for a USB cable to plug into my car stereo for a while, and my car already had a USB port, but I wanted to use the USB port instead of a standard RCA cable. The D-sub is a great little device that's small enough to easily carry and plug into your car's stereo.  It's great for watching TV, listening to music, and even doing internet searches.  I've been running two of these things in my car for a few months now, and have yet to see any noise from the USB connection.  The only drawback is that I have to use one cable, because the other one connects to the car's auxiliary output, and since I'm driving I prefer it to be the last cable plugged in.    I got this because I wanted a USB connection for my smartphone that could handle more than one connection (which is what I want).  The cable is quite stiff, and I find it best to not stretch it so I can use both my iPhone and iPad at the same time.  This will not do what a normal USB cable will do (unlocked audio and video), but I can still use my phone (and a few other devices too), and I can do a few searches. It's also nice to have a USB socket on the other side of the car, so if the phone is plugged into the car stereo but not into the dash, the D-Sub is handy.  For now, I'm not sure I'd buy this as a USB stick, but with such a small connector (only 3/8"), it is small enough that I don't need to carry another cable around.  Yes, the noise that the connector produces is audible, but not enough to be a problem.  If I were to buy this again, I'd get a 3.5mm jack. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this thing. The volume is a bit high for my tastes, but that's probably because I am using it as a music player, and there's no headphone jack. I have some other electronic players, and the quality of their sound is just as good or better. The display is simple and easy to read.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Good purchase but a little difficult to install the screen. I had to cut the wires in the video input. That might not be such a big deal if it had just worked. It takes a little longer than the instructions say to get the screen set up. I bought the kit as a "second screen" for my laptop but didn't need it at first. Then I realized the laptop had a built in monitor. I would have liked to have used it if I had had the time. The screen is very good. It has great picture and crisp and clear display. And the software is very well put together.  Rated 1 out of 5 by James from Poor Quality I purchased this TV a year and a half ago. It is my only TV. I have been using it as a TV since then. The picture quality is poor. It appears as if it has "washed out". I'm not sure if it's because it has been so long since I had it on but I'm pretty certain it is because of the low quality picture. It took two months to get this unit fixed and it is still not quite right. . The tv looks great but it doesn't give you the "full picture" that I was told it would. I think my TV was defective and I have not been able to fix it. This is probably not a problem if you are a big picture viewer like myself but if you just watch the shows that I watch (COPYATL) it's terrible. The quality is worse than the other TV in my room. The remote is easy to use but I use to use the remote on the first tv, that one was great. I got it for the price of an Ipod but it is not a quality product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first thing I've used that I don't think of as just a "tablet." It's a device I would recommend for any kid or adult. The app is easy to use, and has the feature to scan barcodes, which would be really helpful to me as a disabled person. The apps is also the only app that does not have ads.   I'm currently on the fence about this purchase. It's $25 but seems like it will last a long time. I'm not really sure what else to say about it. I am glad I bought this as it will save me a lot of time and money in the future. I can tell you that my kids would be very excited to use this.  /M

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s. I use this thing all the time. Works well, no problems, and very quiet, like my old model. I have a lot of apps and music on it, and it works perfectly. I wish there was a 4th button, but it is only 2 buttons.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is the best thing I have used. I have been using it to view videos for a long time. I can view the video in the dark and the sound in the car with great clarity. I would recommend this to anybody that uses video for long periods of time. The camera does not need to be charged very often. It will charge it and start up in the same day or the next day. --------------  Positive review of a good product: --------------- I had a very high end Canon camera and the battery lasted for several years. I bought the BMPCC and I have no complaints.  Great Features, Great Quality and Low Price. 5/5  The BMPCE is a great, inexpensive way to start capturing photos with a GoPro. While it has no GPS (so there are no images that can be used with a Garmin GPS unit), it does have a full-HD camera and 1080p video recording capability. It is waterproof, shockproof, and can take standard Polaroid camera bodies. It works with all cameras. The only negative that I have found is that the battery tends to be dead a few days after the GoPro unit is connected. I've not had this issue with the Sony A7S II which seems to last about six months. A battery replacement is needed for the BCPCC unit, which is cheap at $75. This may not seem like much of an issue but it's a major factor when you are constantly out on a mountain with your GoPro.  of the most durable and useful camera you can get! 5/7  I am impressed. My first purchase, and my third, the B-Mount is my first choice for any GoPro or mount. It's built like a tank, and has the best features of all GoPro cameras. I use the A7 with my GoPro HERO4 Silver Edition to capture videos. It was a breeze to mount it to the rock in the first place, and it took only 3 minutes for me to use it as a backup cam.

Yes No Thursday, February 21, 2011  Works very good for the price  by Dannie from West Monroe OH USA  Pros: Worked as advertised  Cons: Nothing  Review: Work as advertised, works well. Not much to say other than I bought it for my son to give to the kids and their friends who are into music.   Was it Helpful to know the unit comes with a remote so that you can charge and play music wirelessly? Yes.  "best product ever!" by jerry from maryland  My kids love it  By Michael from Boca Raton FL USA ,  Fits well, good sound quality and power...  (Posted on 6/5/11)  It Works!!!  In a sea of cheap knockoffs  Reviewer: Jim from West Haven CT USA . :  After some time of tinkering I finally got it to work. First I had to set the units to the same output mode (this was the first time it was programmed with my remote). Then I plugged in my portable sound device and went to work! This thing produces some very good music. It has more than enough power to run my sound system and the remote is quite useful when you want to play with different songs or groups of songs. I have found that if I connect my remote to a battery powered USB adapter, my unit will run on batteries for about 15 minutes. I can use my sound device at any time I want, but the remote can be used to control the playback (if I want) or control the sound volume. There are some really cheap knock-off units out there that just won't play music properly. I am very happy with my purchase! I have a stereo at home and this is a perfect fit. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap quality portable Bluetooth stereo. ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I got this amp for the purpose of getting back into it and it worked great. Great quality. I had some serious problems with the previous amp but this one seemed to have much better sound and had no problems at all. Also, the sound of this is so clean and clear even my friend could hear the sounds that he had just hit on the amp while he was recording. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good sound. I also recommend this amp to anybody who is having problems getting the best sound from their current amp. Great product, good price.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mike from It works, but.... This is an excellent product for the price. I was a little skeptical at first because my original amp was a Yamaha RX3 which is rated for much more than 4 watts and this one isn't, but it's really not. It does provide a great sounding speaker with very low distortion at moderate volume levels (it does have a few small overshoot issues at the highest volume levels). It does not have the flexibility I was looking for, but that's a minor complaint. This amp does provide good sound quality at moderate listening levels. I can't comment on its durability, since I haven't had a chance to use it long.  is is not an especially rugged amp. The power jack doesn't require a lot of protection or screwing. You just need to be very careful with this thing as it will blow up quickly if you screw it incorrectly or if you leave it in a hot car for an extended period of time. I replaced the battery after 6 years, but I did not tighten down the plastic screw threads (or anything like that) and it did blow up, and you can see it in the picture. Also it is very loud. It really makes a lot more sound than your stock speaker. It is a great deal for a great price. So far it has performed flawlessly. You get what you pay for.

I think the one small thing I do not like about this device is the cable has the little wire clips on it to hold it on your phone. When I use this device to send a message I have to hold the phone in my left hand with one hand and press the cable with the other hand. Then the message is being sent from the phone to the pc. The reason I do like it is for my friends who is very new to this technology.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently bought this as a replacement for a broken iPad 2. I had to buy a new battery because the one it came with didn't work with the one the computer it came in was running. The iPad 2 is great, I love that I can connect to my TV and a computer on the same device! The only thing that bothers me is that the screen has too much bleed, and the screen is not as crisp as my older iPad. I also think this is the first device I've owned that doesn't have a stylus. I'd love to buy one and have a real one. The sound quality and music playback is great. I've been using it a while and I like it a lot. It has a nice size for my little hands and the fact that it has a magnetic charging port is cool. Rated 3 out of 5 by joshuaz from Not the best at all The iPod 2 doesn't sound the best but the battery life is actually better than the original iPod. This new one isn't as bright as the original or as clean sounding or as beautiful as the newer iPod Touch. But it works great and does the same thing. I only gave it 2 stars because it's not a perfect device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I really like the sound of the Yamaha's, I'm not a big fan of the sound coming from the AEA. The bass is a little muddy in comparison.  But it does a great job on the keys.   The speakers do get a little hot but that goes away with a good warm up.  The buttons on the back of the instrument are extremely simple and easy to press.  They just stay on when you press down.  This thing is good for playing chords and basic jazz.  It's great for getting into the keys and improvising.  I think that the AFA is a solid alternative.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little device, I'm not a fan of a keyboard and was looking for something that I can use for reading and writing on the go. When I received this device I was impressed that there was such a range of writing and reading apps and software. It's very easy to use and does a good job on the basics of text input, like text encoding and formatting, for basic stuff like email. I'm also very impressed by the ability to connect to my home network so I can easily access my files and connect to printers. I will recommend this to all my friends and I know it'll be a great investment for many years to come!  Rated 5 out of 5 by DY2P from Excellent and Fast It is good! Easy to use, easy to connect.  Review of DJI Spark:   I have only flown the DJI Phantom 4 for about a year. This is my first Spark and first quadcopter. I've read several reviews on it and have seen plenty of great videos on youtube. I have flown with it in a variety of different weather conditions. I also fly it at the beach to get some footage for a beach video. This has been an excellent addition to my flight equipment. As I fly my Phantom 4 in the wind the Spark does not have any trouble maintaining the hovering position or hovering distance required to get the shots that I need to publish for this blog. It also has a nice easy to handle design. It will hold you steady and give you a good flight without the weight of an engine or propeller. For someone who is very experienced and knows how to fly a motorized vehicle this quadcopters is the first of it's kind. I don't see myself buying anything else. The battery life is pretty good for me (30 mins -1hr and 25 min for a flight). It is a little slower than I would like but I would imagine it would be similar to that of a much bigger unit. The Spark has a lot of great features which I haven't gotten to use yet. I am using it in my yard to get a nice image. I need a very high contrast image so the camera is pointed to the ground. I hope to get to the drone flying again later this week. If I am successful I may be able to do some aerial shots of the local area.  a few things to note:  When you first open the box you will

This thing is just a nice little gadget. No problem connecting it to a wall outlet and plugging it into a portable battery for me.

The adapter has an adapter for 2.2 mm and 3.0 mm so it is too short to use. Also it is a little heavy and bulky.  (from the USA)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- It was a great device and I've been enjoying it for a few years. It's small, light, and good quality, and works great. It can't be beat for the price. (Posted on 10/20/12)  Awesome product I have to say that I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I have only had it a couple of weeks and have already made it a permanent fixture in my office.  This product works great as far as the screen goes. It is very easy to install. The button on the front of the unit is easy to push, even if you are not used to electronic devices.  for the screen, it is just an LCD screen. it is a little bit small and the backlight is very poor. I do not have a problem with the LCD screen but I'm a computer person so the backlights don't make sense to me. it would be nice if there were other ways to view the screen other than using the back light. Overall this is a great product and I will certainly purchase a second one in the future. (Reviewed on 8/22/12 )

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My new X50 is the perfect size for home recording. It fits easily in my bag without taking it out of my pocket. With a pair of headphones (Sony MDR-XB90) and my computer it works perfectly. The microphone works well, but the sound is a bit muddy when you turn the volume up. I can turn it down to get clear vocals from my wife, but it is still not very good. The battery life is also not great. It is about 2-3 hours of recording, and usually lasts less than that. However, if you keep it plugged in at all times it will last much longer.   I am using it to record vocals for a movie. I am able to put on a little guitar over the background noise and the vocals sound very clear. You can hear how much the song is over before the microphone goes out. I also plan to record in mono to make the recording sound better for the movie.   the X50 did not come with a USB cable, so I bought the XLR to 1/8" adapter from Amazon. Works great and was a bit cheaper than the original.   was really happy with this purchase, it is much smaller than I expected and has better sound quality than the iRiver X50 I used to have. Was this review helpful to you? Yes (0) No (0). Report this review  Best home recording microphone I have ever used.   of my five microphones in my home studio, I prefer the X40X more than the X90X. My only problem with the X60X was that it had an auto-gain function that made the microphone "wobble" when recording - but I can live with that now. All the microphones that I've had so far have been solid and this is a keeper. Was able to get great sound from my X40 and the X120. Was even able to record a couple songs with the Sony MDR XB90!   All the mics have been placed correctly and they are quiet. I bought a new computer and a few USB ports to connect the mikes to so I can get great recording results from my iPhone.  , and it's been more than 5 years since I have bought a microphone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It was a really nice experience to use the bluetooth controller with the pc game. It was easy to set up and use, but there was one annoying thing; once the games started running they would lag in and out of the game.

I use my unit when I am going to or coming out of the gym and I have not had any issues with it. I would not recommend this unit for indoor use, but the unit can be used for it. Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works Perfectly Well Made It's a very good product. I was amazed at how well built it is. It is very durable and is light enough for your shoulder to carry. I carry this with me everywhere I go. I am very happy with it and it does everything I need. It comes with a lot of extras too. It even has a flashlight! Rated 4 out of 50 by David from Good product at a reasonable price This is a pretty good product and comes at a very reasonable price. The only negative is the charger is very light. It takes up a lot less space than the original chargers.  Rated 3 out of five by dasmanz from Works, but it's so cheap! I bought this in the hopes it would be as durable as I wanted, but after about one year it's finally falling apart and can no longer be used properly. It has a USB port for charging, but there's no USB cable or power adapter with it, which makes it unusable for anything but charging. It's also super flimsy-- I can't carry it on my shoulder with my arms, and it's very easy to damage and the case doesn't really protect it either. My only other option is to take my old model of the unit with the 2xAA battery pack, but since I'm used to my old unit's design, I can no more carry that around with me than I can the cheapo cheapo from the same company. The only thing I have to say about this is it was a good quality product. But at a price of less than $100, it was just too cheap to be a good buy. If you want a very durable unit you should buy a new model. I don't know about the warranty. But the quality seems to be good and the price is right.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a very good device and its easy to operate. I like the battery that is easy to replace and is not that big. My wife also is enjoying this device and uses it for her business. It is very good, good value and the features it has make it worth the money. I have used a different portable printer over the years but I always have the same problem: I always wish the ink cartridge was removable because the ink doesn't last very long. This printer is great! I haven't used ink on a computer since I got this machine so I can't compare to my old printer. I can say I've printed over 1000 pages of my son's reports and his college applications so far. I love the print quality and printing speed is perfect for me. Thank you for selling the portable printer. It was very easy to use. This is the first portable printer I have ever owned. It has exceeded my expectations in all aspects. It prints beautifully, the pen input is great, the printer works great, and it comes with the necessary accessories. I have not had to use any of my current printers in over 6 months now. Excellent Printer - I like it! My old printer died on me, so I was looking for something new to replace it. My new printer looks and prints just like the old one did and is the same price, so that was a huge plus. Awesome Printer The printer works really well. It does exactly what I wanted. Good printer, but I am a little disappointed The printer prints fine. The pen input has a nice feel to it but doesn't fit well with the other pens (the kind with the plastic heads that you press down to write with), so you have to force them to be aligned, which is not very convenient. The ink cartridge is not replaceable. I've used it for a couple of months and the ink is beginning to get dry and it is really difficult to remove the excess. The only good thing is that I can still read what is on the paper. Great Product, Fast Shipping. Love it This printer has been fantastic! We're able to print our reports without having to lug around multiple portable printers. The quality of this machine is outstanding and I've been really happy with the printing quality and ease of use. It's especially handy for printing from our home printers. I would highly recommend this to anybody who has a portable printer and wants to take it on
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had bought a new desktop computer and wanted to upgrade. I was looking through the internet for a "good deal" so I could afford a brand new laptop. This PC had very few issues and it did everything that I had hoped for. The only minor complaints that I found are that the graphics driver did not load correctly. The other issues were fixed or at least resolved. I would buy this product again if needed. I hope that the next version does not have these issues, as I believe that this model will last a long time.Read full review The best of the best from all the major manufacturers - a great machine for the price I'm an engineer, and was looking for a workstation and wanted it to be very low power and quiet. This is the only one that I could not live without. This machine is quiet, well-built and extremely powerful. I have a dual core AMD Phenom X4 980 with 32GB memory and the system runs at over 7 GHz using the stock CPU and memory. It is my first system and I have only had it for a week. I'm extremely impressed and I can't wait to upgrade to a new machine. Read full reviewed This is the best choice for a system that meets your needs. The power to do it all, is the difference between a good computer and a great computer. This system is awesome. You can run the latest games, watch HD videos and have everything you need to do whatever you want on your screen. You are limited only by your imagination. For me, it came with everything I needed, but I did purchase some additional upgrades. The audio is so quiet and I was surprised with the performance on my dual core Intel Atom processor, so I wanted to get more power. The 4 GB RAM is good, but the fastest SSD I found was the Seagate 2TB model for around $80. Great storage. My only other complaint would be the power supply - it has a bad plastic cover on it. The cover has no clips, and it can not be snapped on the power strip. It requires a lot of force to put it on and it doesn't stay on the back. I ended up using some electrical tape to hold it on. Other than that, if you are looking for an easy computer with an amazing system then this system is for you!Read full Review I recently purchased this system and was very pleased with it. I also purchased the extra storage

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have purchased one of the very first Nitecore G-Cards, a Nitecicle XM-L2.  The flashlight was well designed, very good battery life, very bright and it is very easy to use.    This is my first flashlight and I do not know how to rate it other than an "excellent".   I just received another NiteCore XM flashlight.  This one has the same great features of the G-Card, but much brighter, and I have not yet tried to charge it.    It does work well with the USB charging cable, although it will not charge using that cable.  Read full review Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, March 26, 2014 Great product with a few issues 1 out of 1 found this review helpful I got this as a gift as a Christmas present and it was a huge hit. I purchased it with a new CR123A battery. The battery works great and is well built. I haven't had any problems with charging, yet, and it charges quickly. But it was very strange because the battery charge gauge only shows 5% at most when the light is turned on. This made me wonder if it was defective. After charging it a few times and taking pictures of it to show it charging, it came to life. At first, it was really bright, but after about 30 minutes of continuous use it started to dim down. When I went to turn it off and put it away, it began to work perfectly again. This was a bit surprising, because after I left it in the car overnight with the door cracked open, I didn't think it would be able to recharge without breaking something. I've had no problems with the light working since then. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ---------------  Great product! This is my third iLife computer from iMac. First, iMac i7, and lastly iMac Retina 5K (all new)! The only issue with these new iMacs is that it takes about 3 minutes to connect up to the Wi-Fi network and 2 minutes to sync my iPhone and iPad with them. The 2 minutes will be the last time your new iLife computers make a difference to your life. And then they're gone! But don't get it twisted, these iLife products are a good buy and really are worth the price!

The camera also lets me keep an eye on my wife who has a history of seizures.  in addition the flash is extremely useful if I'm outside on a hot day, and I know the camera won't freeze or glitch.   I would not recommend this camera for outdoor use unless it has a decent ambient light sensor. Also, when on indoor settings the flash will get very bright and sometimes not be visible.  .  with a great camera and flash   .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very impressed with this device. I was working on a computer for a friend and wanted to have her feel like I was really at her side. So we took this and it made me feel like the people I work with were looking right at me. I have the bluetooth option, but I can't say it makes me feel much different as the others have said, but it does make me feel that I'm there. It's easy to carry and I love how discreet the light and sound are. The only thing I would say is that if you are a newb to this kind of device, you might want to pick up the blu ray for some extra fun.   No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great tool, I just purchased it from Amazon. It takes me out of the "I have to use a computer" loop. I use it every night and night and have it working when I get up in the morning. It does what I need it to do! The only drawback is it takes so long to turn it on and I have to keep re-calibrating it to get it right.   I would recommend this product and Amazon to anyone who needs to make an online purchase and want to ensure they are doing it right the first time.

It worked out great. Just put in my order today. Shipping was prompt, delivery was very quick and i love the time and date display. I can see the time at the top of the dial and the date at the bottom. It takes a bit to get used to. The watch can be charged through the USB port.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great price and it works great. I bought this because it can do a little recording and a lot of processing. When I was using the computer, I didn't know it was recording to my camera and I was really amazed when I saw it when I took the picture. I do like that I can use it on my computer and not worry about getting the cables out and messing up my setup. The only thing I did not like about this product was it only came with the microphone and not the audio interface. I just ordered a different audio interface and it is going to be great!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am now the proud owner of the iMac (2nd generation). The first thing I noticed is that it is VERY quiet. I can't even hear the fan.  I don't hear any buzzing noise with it either. I was really looking forward to getting this computer because my old computer only had a DVD drive and I wasn't looking for a full size computer to replace my Mac.  But when I got the iBook, I just didn't love the computer.  iMac 2nd generation iBook 2nd Generation - picture of the keyboard. I also found that the power button on the back was too close to the mouse button.  It was also way too far forward on my keyboard.  I would need to move my right hand to hit the power on and off button.   iBooks 2nd Gen - I can hear it when I open and close the lid.  The only real feature I like about the iBooks 2G is the size and portability of the computer and the fact that it has an internal hard drive (the only other computer that has that feature).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have two of these and they are great for all my electronic needs. I have never had problems with them. I put them on all the computers and the older ones like my older Mac 7.5, my iMac 6, iMac mini 6 and iMac Pro 7.   When I put it on my iPad, I can't get the thing to do anything at all but scroll to the bottom. When I put the screen on the iPad, it's much better and I can scroll and get the next chapter. It makes me wonder if the problem is on the iMac.   a new favorite I have got one for all of my computer, it is a great device, I got a second one for my other computer. I use these everywhere I have an iPad. I never get it to do the things it's supposed to do like browse the web, email, or anything, its much faster to just get it off the machine and go to another one.   is a very durable case for the iPad 2. I really like it, I am going to get one for each of my iPads so I won't have to replace it.  by JAMES L. on 03/26/2012 byon 03/02/2012
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is one of the best devices I have bought, it really is the best and i use it as my main music player. it has a cool feature that i love it. it does not have to have an external microphone to use your smartphone in a music room, it just connects to the sound system it is plugged into. the microphone works great. it plays mp3 files without any problems and i like it when people use their phones to talk and they just talk through the built in microphone. the speakers are not as loud as most people think but it gets the job done. -------------- I would buy this again. ------------ Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The best product!!!!  It's a small keyboard, but you can type quite fast if you use the correct keyboard layout. I like the sound and the layout, even though it's small. I have it in a small (but nice) keyboard case. The keyboard case fits perfectly. The sound and lights are nice. It comes with a USB cable. It's a great product.  I do not need a keyboard with numeric keypad, so I was looking for a portable keyboard to use while traveling. I was very happy with this model, it has worked well with me. The price is good and it is compact. I just wish I could have used the built-in numeric key pad.  I'm not a big fan of the built in keyboard, because it's way too small and awkward to use. But for the price it's a good choice, very small, and simple to use, but a little less comfortable than the old style laptop keyboards. I use it on my laptop as my standard keyboard, which I like. The built in keypad is not very nice. But I can see why you would buy this model if you were looking for one. It is small and light weight. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, and have only had to use it about 2-3 times. It doesn't seem to have a lot of battery life so far, but I'm sure that it will get better as I use it.    I have the most basic set of features I could think of. It includes:  Keypad: A built- in numeric keypads.  the builtin keys: No, this keyboard doesn't have the built IN numeric key pads.  and 2-6 function keys.  as I have mentioned previously, the keyboard is small but it does work, and the built ins are great for getting a quick set of keys.   This is an excellent keyboard, and it's only a $5.00. It would be a great buy for a beginner, and a good alternative to the IBM Model M and similar keyboards.   for more information about this keyboard, click here  for a good review on it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the sigma s35 for about a year now, and i love it. It was a bit hard to assemble but that was probably just me. It comes with 3 different color lenses and a nice rubber case. it has a built in mic which i dont use yet but i will. it doesnt do that much for sound quality but its very comfortable to hold. The build quality is top notch, i could never break this thing in the time i have been using it. its battery is the same that i have on my sigma 50mm f1.4 for 4 years. it charges fast and its very sturdy. i have had no issues so far but i plan to use this thing for awhile.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  it took the guesswork out of my lighting. I have light controlled ceiling lamps in my bedroom and in my office that are all over the place. I bought this unit and the unit itself is excellent. There was a small problem with one of the light bulbs but that is minor. I am looking forward to using this unit for years to come.  I am really pleased with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive got mine for Christmas and I LOVE IT. It's the best and most versatile camera/mic I've ever used in my life. The picture quality is amazing, I've been able to see faces I'd never be able to, hear what I'd previously just be able't (when i was using a Zoom H4N) and hear all types of things around me, even if my ears were sealed up from being in a car for hours. The mic is very quiet and very flexible. You can use it to do everything from taking pictures to recording a podcast or voice recording, and you don't have to worry about running a cable to get to it (because it has an adapter cable). i'm so impressed with the product and so far i've had no problems.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Easy to use and setup I just bought this camera. It is pretty simple to setup and use. I was having trouble getting my SD cards to recognize my camera, so after some googling I found this setup guide. That is very helpful for me since i have the USB cable for my camcorder that uses this connection. This is a great little device. I am really happy with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I just received my DAW from my supplier, and I was a little skeptical to see a "no key-in" model. I was really excited to get it home, but after having it for a week now, I've found a few things I don't like about it. 1. A few of the keys are a bit too soft. 2. The volume control is really sensitive. It can go up to a whole 2 dB. I've already replaced my volume knob, and have started to replace the other keys. 3. The key-out is so flimsy that it falls off and breaks on my desk. If I need a new keyboard, I can't get it out of the box. I am also very sad that I can only record in one place, instead of being able to put the keyboard wherever I want. 4. I don´t like the small USB cable that they used for the keyboard. 5. The audio jack is not on the USB port, but on the back of the case, where the power jack would be. --------------- Well, I must say that this is a good product. A little cheap, but a good solid DAW. It is nice to have such great options, if you don't use any software. I can´t really say that I would buy another one, just for the same reasons. I just think this one is not that good as the ones from my main supplier, because of my issues.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Awesome I bought this a couple days ago and it is the coolest thing ever I bought the 3.5mm jack for my guitar to plug in some audio equipment because I can't find any other way to plug it in. My guitar has a 3.0mm jack so I bought a 3m jack and it works great in my guitar but my guitar isn't the type that has an analog input. Now I can plug my headphones and my guitar and use the same cord. Great product great customer service.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device : --------------- Poor build quality, poor design, poor value, bad sound, not the best out there.  in short, this jack was made as a poor man's version of the better jack that is available. The design is bad. The construction is poor. The connections are poor. I got it to plug my amp into my computer but I just plugged my headphones in and my amp is now out of sync. I did get the replacement connector but I think it just needs more effort on the part of the manufacturer and more care from the manufacturer to ensure that it is in good working order.

This device has worked out great for my friend and me. I like the convenience of being able to connect to my phone to listen to music on the go. They also have a great price for what I bought it for. I would definitely purchase from them again.  5/5 best investment ever The sound quality, size, and ease of use are excellent.

The sound is loud and clear and is the equal of my iPod touch. The price is also very good for the quality of the product. I will continue to buy ipods from them!  Works great for me My friend recommended this device to me and I tried it out. I've since purchased one for my wife, and we have both been very happy with it! I don't have a car so I use it while in the car. It's so easy to set up and use. If you like music then this is a great item to consider! .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If the first generation iPad is not the device you want, then this second-generation model is for you! My wife and I were very pleased with this device and bought one for ourselves. I have not had the time to install the app on the original iPad so I did not get all the features of the new version of the app but the most significant feature of the two is the support of wifi. The other new feature is the ability to download the videos from iMovie in order to make a short film. I do recommend this product.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, March 11, 2011  Great but needs the "iMovie" feature  by DENNIS from OMAHA, NE  Pros: Easy to use, works as expected  Cons: None  Review: This is my first smart device and I am very pleased. It does everything I expect a smart device to do. As I use it, the built-in camera and the built in speaker will come in handy when I shoot a video. I did run into an issue, when using the video camera, the flash that activates the LED display (to indicate if you are taking a photo) would not activate the LED on the camera if the flash was on. I had to turn off the flash. This was not a problem with my camera, but I have had other flashes that would not fire the LED in the camera without the flash on. .  the camera can record both standard-resolution videos and the high-res HD video which is really neat. - I am using the built into speaker and I have no problems using the speaker at a reasonable volume for the price point. The only thing I am not sure of is if the video recording will play back in the background without the LED displaying, if so, it seems like a simple thing to fix. The sound quality is great. the only issue I had with it is the remote doesn't work on the iPad. , I have only just now purchased an iPad for my office and have been using a wireless remote.  that's why I bought this iPad. I thought that would be the reason I could not use my iPad to record my home movie. So I was surprised to find that this works just fine. I don't think I will upgrade this one very soon though. I've had it for only a few weeks.  and the video quality is
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the original iMacs for 6 years now, i use them primarily for editing video/music and also play some games on them. I love my iMac. The first time I bought one, the screen was a little green tinted and the screen would freeze on occasion (i was on a newer version of OSX, i think). It took quite a few tries, but eventually i got it to work. After i did, i bought an external monitor as i wanted to be able to see a little more when playing games on the iMac, i got a 120 inch tv in the mail, and it was awesome! i had never seen such clarity in my games. Now the monitor is old, and the new tv only shows a small area of my games, but im pretty sure i still have much to learn on the tv as well.   Overall, I love this product. I have two iMac's now. I wish it was available in smaller sizes, as i still use the same laptop for my work. But I would have had one, even before i had a laptop.   and I'm not just saying this to brag. I'm saying it to show you how much I love the product.   the build quality is amazing, and i love the new design. it has a lot of great features that you don't get with other computer monitors. like the 3D picture mode, which looks amazing in games, and also makes a nice little TV for me, the speakers are really good, and they don't distort, and even a bluetooth connection was really good on it. I also love the fact that you can just plug it into the wall, and use it anywhere in the house, without using the computer.   at first i was afraid to use it because the screen is a little different than i thought it would be. but in all honesty, i have been quite impressed with it, and so has my family.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichthyosaur - This thing is an awesome addition to my car stereo. I've only had it about 3 weeks and it works great so far. I'm listening to music, but I also use my MP3 players. It also makes my car a lot more comfortable. - It is nice to have a little control over my volume while driving. - This will be nice for driving with my ipod plugged in. I would suggest that the controls for the volume control be a little better thought out, but overall I'm very happy with the purchase.   Best Bang for the Buck I have only had my ipad 2 about a week and am very happy. There is nothing on the market that does the things I needed it to do.  Works fine but need to look more at the buttons on the back.  If you look closely at the left side of the ipad there are only 4 buttons for volume, one for play/pause, one to turn on the torch and one to put the phone down, which is not ideal. ,  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great accessory. Very good and versatile accessory for iPhone/iPad. My wife has it in car and I have it in the car while i'm driving. We love it. We have our iPhone 8.1 and our ipad 13 and iPad Pro in our vehicles. I can now listen to music and talk on it without looking down to my device and with my headphones on.  the thing just looks so cool. I don't have an ipad mini so I didn't know about this but I love it  I used the flashlight for an hour and it was a great addition! I have an iPad 10 and an ipadh 8. It's a little small, but it's small and it's powerful enough to illuminate my way. The battery life is great. I'd like to see it come with a charging stand that it can stand on.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________  i have had my iphone 4 for 6 years and i have always liked it but recently i got this iphonelink and i love it!!! i love the way it looks and the sound quality!!!  This is a great upgrade. I used to listen to my ipod with headphones on the bus and I could not be more satisfied. The sound quality is clear and crisp. I was never able to hear sound from the ipod in the dark without having to turn off all light to be able to see at night.  I am a big iPod user, and this is a major upgrade. It's so comfortable to wear that it doesn't even need a case for me.  the screen is much clearer and better to read. i just love the color display and the size is perfect.  is it going to get any better than this? no.  of course the quality of the sound is a big difference, but not a huge difference. 's great when I want to listen with headphones but my ipods are small and i don't want to take my jacket off when i am out in the cold  As a music fan, and also an avid gamer, I have an ipod 3g, which I use all the time (all day). This is a fantastic upgrade!

I am in a new home so I am not sure what will happen but I have no fear of the electrical shocks from the old unit so far and I have had no issues since I have been using it. This is my second battery in a very short time and I am happy with the purchase, I know that I am taking the risk and this is the only way I will be able to get it from now on. ***********************  Excellent, durable, long lasting battery: __________________________________ I purchased this battery over 5 years ago when I had my first one in an old TAC-DC15 Radio. In that time the battery has been used only 3 times. I would not hesitate to purchase another one in the future. I have also used the Battery Pack as an AC Adapter for a computer to power my audio interface. It works very nice and the design is nice too. The best thing is that if you need to get out of the house, you can do so without any trouble.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Rated 5 out of 5 by AJ from Works great! I've been wanting a video recorder for some time and finally purchased one. This unit does it's job perfectly, the image quality is superb. The quality of the recording is excellent. The one thing I have not really liked about it is the fact that it only records 1080p resolution, so even if you had your computer with a 1080p display, you would have a problem recording it. However, when you're on your laptop, your HD video will still be up to 1080p and the recording time is still very good.  Customer Testimonials  I've had this unit for a couple of months now and it's been working great. I like the fact it can be set to record 1080p to your TV for a TV set up, I am very happy with this device and will definitely be buying more in the future.  and i do agree!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Iphone 8 is a great device with tons of features. I do not use all of the features but I like how it handles my tasks. It is not as fast as the iPhone 8 and I have not had it longer than a month but I am happy with it. The only thing that has bothered me is it can be a bit loud when it is in use and sometimes I do want to take a call from it to let someone know I have got home. The speakers are also loud and annoying. I have had it for about a month and I can say it is great with the exception of those two things. It could be an upgrade from the 6. I really do not like the way it has changed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for something simple and reliable that would be good for my wife. I found the Panasonic digital camera for her and the picture quality is good, but my only problem is that I have a small child. This camera gives her a great view and is much more reliable than the computer I would buy now.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 19, 2014  Very nice and easy to use  by: Anonymous Person from Colorado Springs CO USA  Pros: Easy to use, lots of information, easy to view on the TV  Cons: Nothing  Review: I needed a compact digital camera that I could use at home or when I was out for a run and not have to carry a big bulky camera bag. This unit met my needs and more. The picture is great and it is easy to set up and use. I did have a slight problem with a battery life of maybe 2-3 hours on average, but that was with very little use. It was a bit noisy, but it is a digital camera. I would highly recommend this camera. -Mike  Works great, but battery life needs to be better  By: Jason W from El Paso TX USA 's review of the LG digital camera   Great picture quality. Great price. I am satisfied with this camera and it works great. The battery life can get a bit long sometimes.  and there is only one major drawback.... the built in battery doesn't last forever, but you can replace it for free at any camera store.  an inexpensive way to add a little more value to your family's life.   PS: You can always use the battery clip and place the battery between the camera and the lens, then use the clip with the supplied cable to re charge the battery. .  to all you Panasonic geeks...   -I'm sorry...but you're right. the Panasonic "L" series is still the best value in the digital camera business. :)  Awesome  If you are looking for a digital point and shoot that's going to last, the GH4 is it. This is the only camera that comes close to the price and quality of the G5. This has one of the best screen resolutions and you can view it on a TV. I really wanted the G6 but the G4 is a better value overall. I will be buying this camera again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "This product is absolutely amazing. I have a Sony Vaio laptop that was a little rough for me. I had tried to get it to work a number of times but it just wouldn't connect. I took it to the local computer store and they said there was nothing wrong with it. After I got home I opened it up and saw that the power button had been replaced with an HDMI one. It instantly was connected and started working. The screen was also very sharp. It is definitely worth the money, plus it works with my laptop and I don't have to worry about it being damaged. If you are looking for a new screen or a new PC for your laptop, definitely try out this one."   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- --------------- The iLX7 is very good, very easy to use with my iPad mini.

Yes No Monday, February 16, 2012  It's a good little portable mixer  by Joe from St. Cloud FL USA  Pros: easy to set up  Cons: none  Review: I own both the iL X7 and the HDX-P2X, I find myself using the iX7 more. The sound quality is excellent for my purposes.  I was surprised to find that the i7 is capable of up to 24 channels of signal, which is the number of channels that are allowed on the HD-P 2X.  in use:  the iL-X7 has a USB connection to the iPad mini, so it is possible to connect an external mixer without a connection cable. The connection is excellent and there are no problems in connection.   the HD-X-2X has a separate input on the iPad, allowing use of an external monitor or headphones. The built-in speaker is loud and clear.   the HD X2X can be used with the iLR-X5 or iLR X5.  a very good unit for home and studio mixing  By James from California  Price: $299.99 (32% off)  Works perfectly with my iMac! -  What does the iLSX7 sound like? It's nothing like the $3,000 Yamaha Mixer or the $400 Korg Polysix, or even the $499.95 iDas Mixbus, or any of the other high-end mixers from Yamaha, Korg, Pro Tools, and others, including many made by Pro Tools itself. The iLS7 and iDAS sound about as good or better than the Yamaha-made units. For example, it's the best sounding iL line level system in my apartment and in my home studio. It has more flexibility for the user than those two companies, which have separate outputs for mono and stereo inputs, which means that you can get better sound from your computer using the iPad Mini.  the built- In Speaker is a huge plus  i have been using the new iLS series mixer for

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using these for two weeks and i am very pleased. i used these for recording my son's school and we got to make it sound very professional. we have the pro 10.1 and they sound better. we used to use the $25 mp3 players. its a great deal ive paid $24.99 for the pros and now we have a good system for less than $30 ive also bought an ovation 12 and it sounds the same. they even have a remote if you have a vtec. if youre on a budget its a good buy, if you are looking for a good mp3 player and are tired of the shitty ones then get one of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this mouse for about a month now and I have to say that it has proven to be a good investment. i didnt think that the battery life was that good, but its better than my last mechanical mouse. its great for playing fps. i have the x360 and the xbox one, and im always able to move the cursor pretty fast and if you are playing a game like co-op it feels so good because the other player doesnt feel like they are doing as much. the only con i have about the mouse is that it doesnt have a light that is always on, and in some games you have to take the mouse off in order to see the map because the cursor is very bright, but i really dont think this is a con, because i havent had to take it off since i got this mouse. overall its a great mouse for the money, and i think its worth buying it over any other mouse for its excellent sensor, battery life, and gaming features.  Rated 5 out of 5 by K2K2 from I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. I bought him this to replace his old mouse which is an old sony wireless one. I was really impressed with this mouse and how it performs. My boyfriend really likes using it and it's actually one of the better gaming mice he has ever used. The only con I can think of is that there is no lighting, which really bugs me because the previous one that he bought did have that feature. He also mentioned that it is a little noisy with the lights on but I have had no problems with that. If you have any concerns, just take it to the store and they should help you out.    Overall I like this mouse, it is super lightweight and is super comfy. The sensor is really good and is easy to use. The build quality is great, the grip feels nice, and it does have that nice feel to it that you feel is more expensive. I would recommend this mouse to anyone.   I bought this mouse with the intention of using it with a Logitech G502 and a Razer Deathadder. I have been pretty pleased with that combination, but it does need some fine tuning to get the feel and speed where I like it. Overall I've been very happy with this product and would highly recommend it.  in my opinion the mouse needs a red button on the mouse pad to give it a more arcade feel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I got my Sony DSC-T3 as a gift last year and it has been a pleasure. I use it a lot when the radio is not in use. I think this is one of the best things I have bought.  -Derek  Followup August 11, 2007 - 05:50 am:  So I use the radio only on AM and occasionally at night, and when the car is off the radio will just go to channel 14 if I don't turn it on. I haven't tried the ATC button, but I am sure that's the same thing with the radio. I tried turning the radio off and on again, and it won't go to the AM channel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this device for the last 4 years, and my opinion is that it is one of the best portable speakers/headphones for the money I've ever had. It sounds great, and with my music playing at normal volume and my wife's singing at her loudest she can, I can feel it. I bought this because the speakers on my iPod were too quiet, and this speaker can reproduce better sound than my iPhone 4. I wish I knew about this device when I got this iPhone. It has been a good investment.  Write a negative review about the same device:   The iM1s is a nice sounding headphone for the price. I have owned a number of audio devices, and the iM5 was probably the best all around unit I've used. I would recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a great sounding headphone that has good audio quality and the ability to connect to their computer with a good USB cord, it does that quite well. It's also quite convenient to use. A little more volume might be helpful for some people, but you can turn it down easily enough. This is a great little device, and I would not hesitate to purchase another in the future if I run out of these.  the i M5 is a very nice sounding earbud. I own three of them, and every one of them sounds fantastic. This version is great for those that want a great quality headphone for an affordable price and don't want the weight of a traditional headphone. The sound is more balanced compared to the other versions and has much less background noise. The bass isn't too much, and isn't a lot to listen to, but for the most part, the sound is wonderful. The volume is still not that loud and a little quiet, but it's not overly so. I'm sure this is a product that would be best suited for a very light use, but I've not had a need to make it that heavy with my work and home listening. The i M4 and i M6 have the same features and sound as well, just smaller in size and price. The only downside is that if you get the i7 version with the M7, it can get very loud and very loud, which I don't think would be good for the purpose of a portable headphone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- --------------- This is a very good piece of technology. My son can use this for many things as he can speak, listen to the radio, and read the paper with this device. The battery lasts long and you have to be careful with the charging method but for the price, this is great. The only problem that has come out of this is when the battery will not fully charge. When you unplug the device and wait a few minutes the battery does not fully re-charge and the device shuts off. I had to buy a new battery for it. I can see this being used to run an Internet modem or an external hard drive. If they continue to improve this device and make it more affordable, I will definitely purchase more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been wanting an Apple Watch since early 2012 when I bought an iphone 5 but it was only used for a month then I bought another iphones because I was tired of the crappy battery life. It has saved me so much time because I don't have to constantly look for my phone which takes up my pocket.   In this day and age there is no reason to have a phone for at least 12 hours a day. I have a smart watch and that works great and I use it every day. The watch is very good and I only wish that there was a way to get the Apple Pay functionality from the watch into the phone. I've had a few problems with it but it has gotten much better. I just wish it would be more convenient to be able to send money to someone that is not connected to my debit card with this watch. I had to send a bill to my husband who lives across town with the watch and the Apple App on my iphon. If there was some way to send payments to my bank account without the iphono I would highly recommend this product.

This is my first 3dprinter, and I'm already using it. I don´t think it´s small enough for a desktop printer. When using a laptop, i had to use a larger mouse. When you have a computer screen, it is so big, you have to use more force and work at a much slower speed. The small footprint means it can be placed on a desk.

I was looking for something that would have a built in speakers, so I could listen to music while I surfed the internet. My search led me to this device and it seems like it has everything I wanted! Very sturdy and well built. The buttons are all on the top and not on the bottom. I am not a big fan of the screen on it, but I do like the fact that it looks like the real thing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing that came out of my e-cig was a great, satisfying buzz. I tried the vapor and the taste was great. The best part was the price. I'm happy I tried this product. The battery life was great, as well as the price and the fact that it will be very very long lasting.   This is the most awesome thing I have ever seen!   It works just as it should and is very efficient at helping me not have to think about the amount of juice that I want to use every day, but also can be used as an occasional vape.   is the best e-cigarette I have used   When I got this device, I was surprised to see the price was so low. The batteries lasts longer than I thought, it's extremely portable and it's so easy to take it with me.  . I really like this product and will buy one soon.  , The unit is light weight, battery lasts for a long time and it has all the basic functions needed to be a very portable e-smoker, but a small step up from the ones that have come out for the last 10 years.   an excellent, lightweight unit   You can buy the same battery for half the price of this unit and still get almost the same number of hits. I would not buy another cig style device and not this one. It is well made, very well packed, and works extremely well. It takes me less than an hour to get my battery to life and I never worry about running out of juice.   at this price, you can't go wrong, and the battery life is excellent. the one downside is that it takes a long to get the battery to fully charge.

Rated 5 out of 5 by brian from Perfect for my family I have 2 of these now. One on my desktop (which is my main work machine) and one on my phone (which I use as a secondary work computer). Both run great, no issues, and are easily replaced by my older model laptops.  to anyone who has issues with the battery, this is what I recommend. If you don't have the latest model, replace it with the one without the light. It was running at 4-5% at one point. My only advice is get the one with the usb-c port (as the one I had doesn't have it) it makes things easier and the power output is much better. If anything, the usb port is probably the weakest part. ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichabod_scoop i have been using this app to control my ipod since I was in 3rd grade. It has worked well for many years. My wife loves it and uses it almost all the time. I have now upgraded to the ipod touch and my old one is still running perfectly fine on my iphone. I only have one complaint about it and it's that the buttons aren't in the right positions. The left one is a "tap" button and the right one is "swipe" button. Both of those are easy to do, but you have to hold the screen just right or you wont get the right amount of time between swiping or tapping. I really wish i had gotten a second ipod before this one so I could keep it going. I recommend this app for any ipod.  Was this helpful?  was this helpful? yes no  Thank you for your feedback
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just received my new Sennheiser 4x9 in 5.1 (and have had it for several days)   The sound from this system is very good for the money, and not a very expensive way to upgrade from a CD player. I like the fact that it allows me to control my iPod through the headphones, and I'm sure I will get used to it.   Great value!   Pros:   - The sound quality is excellent, with a very good range of tonal variations and subtle changes between songs. I can listen to something and enjoy the differences very well.  'sentrance' is a favorite song for me on this system, and it sounded very good at low volume, with very good sound quality, especially with the built in subwoofer.     Cons:   I have not tried out all of the settings yet, so I cannot say whether the sound of the 4x8 is too loud for my room, and how well the sound comes out of my built in TV amp.   in other words, this is only a preview of what I hope to hear at a later date.  I love this system!   The sound is really great!   of all the people I know that have a system like this, they all seem to have very good taste in music, which makes the sound even better.  .  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My FSP-12 is a fantastic device! It does the job, and does it really well!  The only thing I would change is that I think the battery life could be better, maybe 1.5 hours more. I've been using it for 6 months now.  It is extremely durable, has a great sound quality, and has a beautiful look. I love it!  for only $20 I think it's amazing  -J.M.   Excellent sound, durable, good battery life and price.   a very nice stereo sound, and a really good value. , November 2015   It seems to have been discontinued!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great product!! I bought one about a year ago and it works like a dream, not only did I save money on my cable bills, I have never had an issue with it once it is fully charged. The instructions on how to properly set the settings are clear and concise. I am also impressed with the fact that it comes with a charger. I highly recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an amazing little device. Very easy to operate and plug in. I've never had to change the battery in a remote before. The price is well worth it. I will continue to buy it as long as I can afford it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ You can find the best reviews on this app in my app store profile. I have it, and have been using it everyday for some time now. There are some bugs. Some are very annoying. But I have been able to solve these issues. This app is very convenient. I just keep my headphones plugged in, and a USB cord attached, and then I can just use it as a bluetooth speakers and a blu-ray player, in addition to my PC. This is definitely a good app. _____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ I've heard many of the above quotes, but to me, the most powerful quote in the book is "Don't worry about things that can't be changed." I have always believed that the best way to change something is to do something about it. I can't wait to see the outcome of this app, and the way this company can handle such a critical release in their lives.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very pleased with this unit. It's quiet, the sound is good, I can record videos on the go. Good battery life.   I really love the new version of this unit, the battery life has been improved and it's now capable of recording 1080p video!   No more lag, no more buzzing, and no more loss of sound or voice recording. All good things.   and just like with my last unit the sound quality is wonderful and its a pleasure to work with.  -Steve B.  Write a negative review about an electronic device :   .     The new version with the 2 inch screen does not work well with the old version. It does not turn on, and there is not enough light. Not recommended to me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone5.7 In my opinion the best i phone ever! If you are looking for a reliable and powerful device this is it. I have it now for a year and i can say that it does everything that i would ask from a smartphone. i cant tell you how long i have been using it because i have a huge schedule that keeps me busy but it does it all perfectly. i dont use the camera alot but the video quality is awesome and the camera is super sharp so im totally amazed at it. the camera on the iPad 3 is pretty good too but not as good as the iPhone 5!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ Love my iMate 2!! I purchased an iMATE 2 about a year and a half ago and I am still using it today. It has been on my wrist almost non stop for almost a year now and I can't imagine not having it. The battery life is amazing and I have no worries about running out of battery in the middle of a day. I would recommend this device to anyone who wants a great smartwatch for about half the price of the more expensive options.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my v4 since october 2013 its a very nice laptop but its still a laptop. the screen is very sharp and the build quality is great. a lot of other laptops that ive owned didnt have a screen that was this clear and good. the keyboard is a little wobbly for some people like me that like big keystrokes and the trackpad is okay its not perfect but it gets the job done. ive also had it for about a month now and the screen hasnt fallen apart yet so im happy with it ive gotten it for just under $1000 ive been able to put alot of miles on it with no problems ive even played some games. ve had it mostly with windows 7 but with some windows 8 and 10 so its a solid laptop to have ive always preferred a laptop with a full size keyboard that goes with me everywhere i go as i have to write papers in this machine.  the only thing im not too impressed with is the battery life on it but im going to buy another one in the next month or so when i get my ps4
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Pono Player is a great product. I really like it. It is an excellent value for what you get.   It is very easy to set up and use.  If you're looking for a portable digital music player, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this product with an expectation that it would be perfect for the price. Boy was I wrong.  I was able to get it to turn on but I can't get the buttons to turn off.  After a quick email to e-tek.com I had the problem fixed.  The other problems I had with the product that I thought were the reason I bought it was that it didn't turn off when I went to sleep and the battery life was short but I was told this wasn't a problem.  It's hard to believe that e-tek would not know if this was a problem with this particular product. I'm sure other people might have the same issue.  Overall I'm glad that I got this thing and was able get my wife to use it, but I would recommend this product to someone who wants something good at a good price but don't want to pay the big bucks.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "I think that this is an excellent product, as well as a great price for the price. I have it connected to my iPad 3 and it looks and sounds fantastic. The only thing I think I would like to see is a little bit more adjustment for the sensitivity." "I think the new Apple wireless headphones are just awesome, but they have some serious flaws. For one, there is no built-in mic, so you have to buy a microphone. I didn't want to spend that kind of money on a headphone, so I decided to buy the $12 external mic for my iPhone and use that. The mic works fine for calling, listening to music and just generally speaking. You can adjust the sensitivity as you'd like. I think the built in mic is just as important as the external one. It makes calls a lot more natural, and you can't hear people whispering if you're not listening on a higher sensitivity setting. In addition, the built-into mic is better quality than the one that came with my iPhone. If the external mic didn't work, there would be no issue. But it does, so it's a pretty big disappointment." "They're great headphones, but when I use them with my Apple iPhone I have to turn it all the way down because they don't really have a strong bass, which I like. Also, there's not a lot of air in the sound that comes out of the speaker and you get kind of a muffled sound."
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have just received my 2nd iPad mini. It is so much smaller than the first one. I use this to control my home theater system and I love that I can use the ipad mini as a computer to read my email, play games and watch tv! I have not seen any better iPad mini in terms of design. It even looks more like a small ipod. I can do all the things that a ipod can do with the small size, so that I am using it on the go. I am not a big tablet user but this device will be my primary computer for years to come!  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this unit for several years now. its is very handy, and i use it almost every day and it just works very well. I use this to read the time on the clock and it is very accurate.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Neshaman from Easy to Use I purchased this to control my dishwasher. It is pretty easy to use, the instructions say to take the time from the display and put it on the dial. My problem was that I couldn't find a way to put a number in the dial, I went back to the store and bought a remote, and it works perfectly. I like that I can turn it off by pressing the power button. I would recommend this if you are looking for a clock for your dishwasher  Customer Testimonials
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I bought this as a back-up battery because my battery is pretty much dead. I was able to set the time, time zone and alarm on this thing and it works like a charm! I wish I had this before I upgraded to the new iPhone. If it weren't for this thing I'd have to use the iPhone on my old phone for this reason. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a nice alarm clock. ***********  Good battery. However, no way to set alarm: ************ I bought the unit last year for my new phone and for a few months, I was on the phone. Then I was told my battery was dying and they were selling replacements. So I called. I called last week to see if they were sending replacements. They said no. I'm now out $50 on a brand new phone for no reason. So what does that say? I just want my new battery, or I want a refund, or something, just a reason to send them a bill. **************  Very happy customer, but I'd love to have a way to change the alarm from one alarm mode to another. *******************   I have no reason to return this product! ***************** I don't even know how to describe it. I just bought it, put it in my pocket, and I'm getting a call. I put it back in the same pocket and I got a notification on my phone that it's being triggered! Now I'm sitting in bed in a dark room, but it's too late! The phone rang off the hook at 10:15! The battery is dead.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device works perfectly, very fast and easy to use. A nice addition to my home stereo and will be using it many times over.  Review of DJI Inspire 1 by Mark J. of the United States on January 28, 2015 :  I bought this with the intention of being able to add a radio system to my new drone. This is the second time that I purchased an Inspire. I bought the second one about a year ago. I have already used this to fly over 10 minutes and got 3-4 good hits with a DJI Phantom 3. This time I put it in a small cage and it flew very well.   The drone itself is very solid. The propellers spin very fast. The battery lasts for about 5 hours depending on how fast you are flying. The drone is light and small. It is much quieter than the Phantom. The video quality is fantastic as well.

I have my phone on 3 different networks. This is the only device in its class and it's great!  Rated 3 out of 5 by Dan from Great speaker but it gets noisy I used it as a speaker when i had my tv on with a DVR on it. It gets very loud and not very clear on a TV. It's really noisy so I have to use headphones. You can make it louder if you buy an amplifier

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very happy that my new TLE2460 from mVentures came with my new camera and works flawlessly with the Canon 60D.  Canon has a great reputation and I'd buy their products again.   A bit of bad news...The battery life is rather good, around 10h of continuous use with moderate use.  There's also an ambient light sensor which shuts down the light when the room gets too dark.  I found a bit of noise with the battery, but if that's a problem for you, don't buy it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very good piece of equipment. It does the job. It is easy to use, very reliable. I would recommend it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jcg from Excellent little kit for the price. Very easy to set up and works as advertised.  "Easy" is an understatement. I had my unit up and running within two hours. Easy to use. I could not be more satisfied with it. I wish the display was a bit larger. It was a tad difficult to see what was going on at the time. I have a small LCD monitor, but the display on the new unit was much larger, so it was impossible to read it. That is not a huge deal, since the display is very easy to read on. . It's an inexpensive product with a high end product. So glad I bought this thing. It works so much better than the old one I had. I'm a computer/graphics designer in Chicago and am very pleased with it as a replacement for the old X-64 Pro, which I still use for work, but never took it with me on vacation. Now I can be on the road with an X-1 and never have to worry about it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My iPhone was on the fence for a long time as I had so many other Apple products. I have the iPod Touch and iPhone, but the iPhone never had enough features for my liking. With the 4, I was pleased to find out that the speaker is on the bottom. I also have no problems with the battery life. I can do the calls and the music and all without thinking about it. You can also see what song is playing. It is nice that you can put your iPod to sleep, but if you do, you can wake it up without getting a bad feeling from it. It also has 4 gigabytes of storage, which I never knew the capacity of a phone could get and it has a wireless charging feature for the phone.   It is a good phone. If you have a large family and need to be able to use all your friends and family. My 4 is for my children, my wife and myself.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the touch screen. I'm only using it for a few things at the moment though, but it's a very good addition to my setup.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The battery was working when I had it and I'm quite happy. The screen was very bright and clear.  I had to put my sunglasses on to see the screen at times, which is the reason I didn't put it up high enough to be able to read in the dark.    The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's a bit expensive.  It's more like an entry level unit and should cost less.  If you want to listen to a movie or something on your TV, this is a nice option.  If you want something that does it all, I would highly recommend this.  You get what you pay for.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always been skeptical about this device. I am not sure how I got this product as my first, but it's been a fun toy to use. It works really well and I am very happy to have one.  I'm sure it will last a very long time. I'm sure I will replace it several times, but if it lasts I will be very happy. -L  A great little toy I have only tried using it once but so far I'm impressed. This thing is a lot of fun. I really appreciate that the buttons are tactile and not just switches. I've also seen others complain about the size, but I don't have to worry about my hand getting in the way of the toy, and the way it's designed means it won't slip from my hand.  in a world of cheap masturbators this is the one I want to play with  love it. /end  Great quality and usability! I like that it is made of plastic. It is a little hard to clean but it has been good enough so far for me to be able to use it regularly. My only issue is that the button doesn't work as smooth as it could. The second button has a strange clicking sound that I find distracting. Also, it does not rotate the tip the way I would like. The last two stars are for the ergonomic design. It does make my hand feel slightly smaller, but not by much. I would love to have a larger cock head or a larger button. If I could make a small version with a longer shaft, it would probably be the best cock I have ever used. I don 't know that the big size of this product makes it any less enjoyable. .  is my favorite for beginners and it works.  and now i'm done... i never wanted to spend so much money for a toy that was just going to be used once and thrown away. i was afraid this was all it was ever gonna be. but wow. it's great. i wish you would make an adult size version. i've tried it but it is really good. i use the smaller size for solo use. i am only about 6" so it's too small and i get pain in my g-spot. i think it is just my anatomy that way and i wish i could get it larger. i don't mind the sound, and i like the tactile feel of it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   First of all i am using a Samsung Galaxy S III with the HTC Sense.   I was looking for an e-cig but the one I have doesn't have a battery and I am trying to find one.  -I bought the bluetooth for my phone.  -I had to put my phone inside my body so it could fit in the mouthpiece. It fits.  as of now my battery is full.   of course, I was disappointed that it didn't have the bluetoothing, I thought I was getting a bluetooth.   to my surprise it comes with a battery that is pre-charged.   I really like the way it feels. It is made of a metal body that is almost too thick for my mouth.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought one of these, I was a little skeptical, I've been through so many different type of computer and this one was new to me. My first impression was that the screen wasn't very bright and didn't seem very big, but I didn't have enough of a clue and didn,t need to pay attention to the details. The video was great. I didn;t read the instructions before I installed it but I'm glad I did. My computer ran without a hitch. It is nice that there are many different ports to plug in and the ports are pretty good. You really do need to be careful in the installation process. But overall, the quality of the device is great, no worries for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "It's so good I would do anything I can to get a box of them and use it.  It's a wonderful piece of gear, the sound is really warm and clear."   The sound and sound quality are superb, I could listen to this without any headphone at all (no monitors, no headphones, etc). It has a very warm sound, not like some other sound systems and it's very easy to get the tones that I want out of it. I was not impressed with it's bass though, maybe it has a little less bass than I'm used to but it doesn't really matter since I was using with a pair of headphones. The sound is warm, clean and detailed. I used it with the P-7's and they were very much into it.   I'm really looking forward to hearing what the other reviews say about this. This may well be my new go-to audio setup.   (I didn't like the sound on my Mac because of the speaker configuration and my setup is different than most people)   Good job on the packaging.   I'm now looking for another set of these.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great little unit. Works great. It was really simple to put together. It does not give you all the info you might want to know. But, it did the job. The only thing I did not like is that there is no instructions for putting it together. But that is probably my fault since I do not know what is going on inside there.  One of the better gadgets. Does the job as it should.  the only thing that i would suggest is if you're using it for the first time make sure that you read the instructions. there is a guide which is good but it might help if you do use the unit before you purchase the unit.  I can not believe what i just put into my new digital watch...
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the new USB cables. They are thinner, but not floppy and they're good. Also, I think the old USB cables were a bit too short for me.  The new ones are perfect.   The new  USB-A to USB-C cables, like the one you have here,    are great!   This cable is better than most other cables that I have,  and I use it every day.  Posted by Peter C. at 9:04 PM As I noted in my review of the iPhone 7 last month, I thought that the headphone port would prove to be an impediment to good headphones. But no such luck. I have the iPhone 8, and I have several pairs of earbuds and a couple of wired headphones. I find the iPhone's headphone jack is perfectly adequate to my needs.  I think it's good enough for my use cases; for instance, the use case of working in a noisy environment.  Also, because I use a wired connection and I rarely listen to podcasts, I don't even need an external DAC to boost the signal to my phone.  But I will say I'm disappointed by the iPhone earbud adapter.  The adapter itself is fine. But I really expected a little more.  So I won't recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I recently purchased an iphone 6s and had a couple of my friends try it out to see if they would like it. We started out with the normal battery. My friends told me the next day the battery was drained to 50%. Then we switched to the 4k and it worked perfectly. The 4k was more than enough and I can use it for work or for home entertainment. We will be buying another one and getting the iphones 7 and 8. ********  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had purchased this camera for a job that required a lot of handheld camera work and was very pleased with it!  The only issue I have is that the lens tends to fall out but that is easily repaired with a small screwdriver.  It is a great camera for it's price, very fast, has a large 1.3 megapixel resolution, fast auto focus, great high ISO, etc.  My only suggestion would be to have a few extra buttons.   If I had this camera at home and I was shooting for my own entertainment I would buy this camera   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my first PX4 a few months ago. It is a solid performer with lots of features and it does all of it very well. The only negative thing about it, if I am being honest, is that it requires an external speaker in order to operate. However, you can just use the headphone jack and it functions the same. The sound quality is great. I did have the first generation that required an external power source, and that was also a problem. However the new one comes with an adapter that is very convenient. You do have to plug in your headphones, however.  If you want to go the extra mile, get a soundcard, I recommend the soundcard supplied with the PX2  Have you tried a Raspberry Pi 3?  I don't know of any people that have used a Raspberry PI 3 yet but I am sure it would work just fine.    Is there a way to convert the Raspberry Pi Zero W's into a USB WiFi dongle?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've only had my new Samsung Galaxy Note5 for a week now but I've already put it through its paces in a number of different tasks. The performance is pretty good. The screen is really bright. The phone is very compact and the display is a nice size for using on a lap. I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I've found the Note5 performs better in the tasks I use it for. However, the battery life is less than ideal. Even with 4 gigs of RAM, my Note5 will only last me for about a day. And it will die just as quickly. However it's certainly worth the money, even with the battery issues.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________________  This is a good device. A small problem I found on the first use was the battery drain when connected to a car audio system. After doing some reading and testing on the web, I discovered that the charging circuitry is not as high voltage or as well protected as I had thought it would be. I had my charger on for two days and the battery was running at 3.2 volts at 10 watts. The charger did not show any signs of charging when plugged into an AC outlet. It still has enough life left in it and I will have to test the charging circuit next time I charge the device.  ____________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's not the most powerful of units out there but it's so much better than the original iMac that I've been using. It's the only one with the option for 4k content. The video quality is great, especially for a device in this price range. The sound quality isn't great but for a $399 product it is very good.   If you are thinking about purchasing the iMac Pro and want to know what to buy to go with it then the i7 6600k is the way to go. I've owned many high end graphics cards in the past but I think the only reason I was able to justify the $699 iMac is because of the quad core i7.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iced-elite I received my device two weeks ago and so far I like it very much. This is my first and only computer for the gaming. It was very easy to set up and install. The keyboard works very well and I like the function keys a lot. The game and music play perfectly, the mouse is good and the game is fun. I will get my second one to play with my girlfriend.  Excellent! I bought this machine as a replacement for my X51u and it's amazing! The best bang for your buck for gaming. All my gaming rigs are in use right now, but my gaming rig is the only one that was built to run a 4k monitor, and the X51U couldn't handle the power.   The only thing I have to say is that the keyboard was a bit hard for me to learn but the mouse and joypad are really good. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to improve their computer or just gets frustrated because all their friends have bigger computers, but you can easily get used to it if you don't get overwhelmed.     If anyone's thinking about getting this machine, get it you won't regret it!  Worth It Just got it and so pleased I already bought a second one  Great Computer I bought a X51 at the end of 2011. I have had it for about 2 years. It has gone through many upgrades, and for the price it is still very competitive in this field, especially as far as gaming goes.   of course I was worried I would not be able to upgrade my graphics card so the best I could do was buy an AMD A10-5800K but I also got an AMD Radeon 7870 in there to play around with. The graphics card has been a great addition. I think the processor is the best it has ever been. I also bought an 8gb memory and it is perfect for the machine, for what I wanted to do.   a bit disappointed that the back cover does not cover the hard drive. I guess that is expected in this price range.   on the positive side, it has never froze at any time on any game, not even when running in 4k. I haven't seen the performance of the system get better than what it is, but I can't complain because I have been using it for over a year. I know it is not for everyone and if you are not a gamer,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been very happy with the Zagg Micro. The battery life is fantastic. It has plenty of battery life to work for days and it does the job. It can charge through the micro usb. I've been using it with the screen turned off for about a month now and it is still functioning. The only thing that I don't like about the device is the screen. I like how easy it is to use and I find it to be very bright and very readable. However I did have a problem with a small light being left on for a while. This was a new problem for me, it's just very difficult for me to put it down when I need to. Other than that I would recommend this device if you are looking for a good all in one computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ________________________________________ I bought a brand new iMac with the Retina display to replace my aging Macbook that now only works for me if I hold it flat in a car. I love that the display is very bright even in direct sunlight and the keyboard has very nice, clicky keys. This is also the first iMac that has Wi-Fi (the 2.0 model has only USB). For the money it was worth every penny and i'm glad I got it. I can't wait for the next iMac! This was my first computer purchase and I'm glad that I bought the Retinas, no doubt. This was also the best deal. I went with a mid-range processor and it performed flawlessly! The screen is very nice and I even went to Apple to get a bigger one and got it at half the price. This iMac was a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have to say this is a great product. I can't believe I was so sceptical about this when it first came out, but I couldn't be more happy with it now! There are so many other features I don't know where to start, like the ability to take pictures of my plants, I can even add a video to my photos using the phone app. The device comes with a great case and I've always wanted to use it for the camera but was afraid it might fall out in the rain.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The computer screen works for what i was doing... but the key on my computer that makes it all work is hard to find and can't be found by a simple search and i don't want to have to buy a new keyboard because i can't find it. The other issue i had was when i put it in the computer it was hard to turn it on, but the computer would go on and off several times trying to get it to start. And then the screen would not work, but that was easily solved by just turning it off and then it would work. It took me about 15 min to get this to work, and it is not that hard to put it on and take it off. I like this computer and use it every day so i am very happy with it.   Overall I am very satisfied with this computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the KVM switch to replace my old one. This device is great. There is a lot of information about switching devices online and I got to reading more about it than I have in the past. The switch is easy to setup and to install in the wall. It is also very quiet. I had no problems getting this to work. I love the new option to choose between hot and neutral or off. It will allow me to switch between two different channels, a home tv and a Blu ray player. I can't recommend this enough! Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent quality I bought this switch for my home theater PC system as my primary power source, it allows me to power two PC's off of one outlet, while allowing me to run two 1080P monitors with my AVR with only one power outlet. It also makes my home entertainment system more reliable with the added redundancy. The included power cord is more than adequate for what it is. Very quiet and efficient. I am a very satisfied customer.  Rated 4 out of five by Anonymous of Portland, OR from Easy to set up, but need help on the back panel I bought a power strip based on the other reviews. It was easy to install and has worked fine so far. But it only comes with 1 wire to the outlet. This is one of the reasons I didn't buy the KVMO switch. The wire that comes with the switch is for neutral, not hot. So I had to change it to hot (2 wire), and I can do that myself. Also, I didn`t really realize that the back of the power strip is not attached to the unit. I tried plugging in the back end, but nothing works. My cable is too short and it is not connected to the back properly. My only complaint is that the remote is hard to push the button on the switch. It just sits there. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product because it was the cheapest and it did what it was supposed to do. I use it in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a pair of stereo headphones. This little device will take up a lot of space, but it works and I can tell that it works. I was able to make a video in front of my house while it was recording. I also had the audio come out of my stereo headphones right in front so I was recording what was going on around me. I had no problems using it and I was not worried about it messing up the signal and I'm very pleased with it. I recommend this product to anyone wanting to make some audio material. If you want to make more than one piece of audio material you can always put together a larger unit.Read full review I got this product for my husband. He is a musician and has a digital recording system that does all of the recording. It is a great quality and I use a mic and recorder for each of us. It was not very big and I had to put it in the back of my truck and it was not much bigger than my small pocket. He does use a digital mixer on some of his instruments and a mixer for his drums. The volume of his drums on his system is not that big. I have had this unit for two weeks now and I am very satisfied. I do find it a little hard to set up, but then again I have never had it set up for my system before. But I do not mind because I'm used to my other mic and mixer. I wish that they made it with a USB input and not only does it come with it but a mini USB hub too. Also the USB has a slot to plug in external audio sources. That would be good as I am looking to take some sound effects home from out of town. I got it at my local RadioShack.Read Full Review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She loves the look and feel of the device and how easy it is to use. I have a couple other digital watches so this is a nice addition. If this watch were a bit cheaper I would give it five stars. My opinion of the unit:  Overall I am very pleased with the product.  I have to say I am a bit disappointed with the "pinch to zoom" feature of the watch.  This was very useful when viewing the time or the calendar.  My biggest frustration is that the unit is way to big for me to carry around, so I have had to buy it on a separate card.  For the price I will get another one.

I have been using my computer from my iPad which I use to watch TV on and this gives me a way to play games on the big screen. I wish that they made it a little smaller so I could carry it with me and not have it take up so much space. Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Just OK It is a great device but it doesn't look like the others that have the same style. I would buy it again but it's just a little too small for my needs.  Rated 5 out of5 by Anonymous by B.A. from Best gaming keyboard ever I've been using this keyboard for a year now, I was never a huge gamer but the comfort of typing on a great keyboard and having a light weight is amazing.  to those complaining about the weight. the weight is the same, it isn't going to be that noticeable. it isn t that light. but it sure is comfortable to use. the only con is the cable it came with broke in 2 places when i tried to plug in my second monitor. it cost me about 15 bucks to fix it. so be careful with that cable! and i've bought other keys and cables for my keyboard.

However, it took only about 5 minutes to get working.   So far, so good - I am using a small computer to scan in the data I want and to view it on my LCD screen   This is the only thing that I have ever bought that I didn't find myself using the very first time.   to a reviewer that said this is a nice toy but you cant see the information on the display - this really is not the case at all. there are some great tools for viewing and analyzing the data. and the software is easy to use.  , this is the case in which you cannot use this for some of the most difficult data processing.  This item is very light weight and the LCD screen is quite nice. I like the program that allows you to do various tasks as you go along, and the data transfer is pretty fast. The USB port is also an advantage to its portability. It allows easy connecting to different computers. All in all, I'm very pleased.  . There are other items of this type out there that will do what this does, but they are not quite as simple to use and they don't have the LCD display. I give it 4 stars.   in a review by a previous owner:   i have a few of these to use for small projects. and I use them to transfer my photos. the problem is, that the USB port breaks and they break after a couple months (the plastic casing of the USB end is not hard). i am going to buy another one, that has the USB ports on the other side of the body of the device.   "I am not sure that a cheap $30 USB flash drive would have been able to read my data, but it did write my data to the USB drive.

But this is not a good quality flash drive for data transmission. This review is based on the version I bought. I would

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* I have had this device for about a month now and have been very pleased with it. I have a Sony NEX-5N and I have to admit this thing beats the Sony at least when it comes to features. I love that it has a microphone. I also really like the fact that you can connect multiple cameras (2nd one has a flash). The microphone works really well. I think it would have been better with a battery. Also I don't really like that it requires 2 sets of batteries (1 battery for the light, 1 for the radio). If I am out in the sun for a few hours the radio stops working. But again that's just a personal complaint. I'm a big Sony fan so this was a very easy purchase for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I bought this because I have an iPod and a tablet. I was looking for a way to listen to music on the go, without having to plug my music in. This thing is so good! I don't like having to constantly plug my headphones in. If I have to go anywhere for work, I have the option of connecting it to my stereo, which is an advantage. The music is clear and doesn't distort when I listen to it on the tablet. You can't play it loud with headphones, because there is no volume control. The best part of this is that there are no restrictions about the size. It's huge and perfect for a purse, the car, or an office. The battery lasts for ages on a charge, so you don't have to worry about running out of juice. I've had it for 2 weeks now, and haven't used the power button once. I really love it. Highly recommend it if you want to listen on the move.  What can I say....Great product!!!! I purchased one of these, my first, because I've found my other iPod Mini's are all too big for me. I love this. The size is perfect, it doesn't take up any space, the battery stays strong, I've been able to play over 500 songs with no problems at all. I'm so happy I bought a Powerbook for it as well. I have my music and photos on it, plus the other things that I do with it! And it's very lightweight, great for traveling and such.  (Posted on 4/20/2018)  Great product! I purchased this and an external keyboard for my iMac. They are great products. I do believe the iMac has the better battery life, but the battery life on the iPod Touch is about the same, which can make a difference if your are running a few songs at a time.

But I use my iphone in the car, at work, and in public and it is my only phone and I can't live without it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the screen does not come off very easily. I've had the screen replaced a few times and I still need to put the phone in a special case. And the screen and case are not very sturdy, which is unfortunate. But the battery lasts longer than most people think, and the app is very reliable, so I would recommend this iphoner to everyone who wants an iphonelike device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â We are using the iDAC-1 to convert the sound of a Yamaha MPC to a more "computer friendly" format on our computer using the sound card we purchased to do this (a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2). Â It works amazingly and looks as good as a PC to me! Â If your looking for a great sound card, and it doesn't have the USB port and keyboard on it that iDac-1 has, you should get that instead!!!! Â Â iD AC1 is by far the best sound card for the price and Â if you do not need a lot of USB ports or do not want to deal with it when playing on your computer, get that one!!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My iBEC was my first purchase and it saved me from having to buy more of those cheap-o car battery adapters that you'll find in stores. For a while I had to use a 10 watt adapter because the iBENCO was too big. The iBEMO is much better quality, less expensive and works better than the 10 watt car adapter. The only problem I have is that the charger doesn't fit my car perfectly, but that could be because of the small size of my car. I have yet to see the light bulb and hope it will work better.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this since it came out. I use this daily for my car stereo, I love it and it has never failed me. I was afraid to give up my stereo until I discovered the other reviewer that said it was not perfect and needed to be repaired, but after that I went back to it. This is a great product and the only one I would go back to, in a heart beat!   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use the H1 wireless headphones for a week now and I am totally satisfied with their comfort, quality, design and performance.  In contrast to other wireless headphones I've tried, H1 headphones are quite comfy, don't overheat or sweat and their frequency range allows them to be used on both a mobile device as well as your desktop or laptop computer.  I am really happy to have found these products. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this thing! I bought it for my son, he is in his second year of college. He has just had his first computer, a iMac, and he loves it. The price was great and he loved how it looked in his room. It was a great first step into computer technology and his room looks like the real deal now.   A little bit annoying is that you have to plug in the device via USB. The power cord does not have a USB plug at all so you have two options, plug the cable in and run to the outlet or plug in and wait a few seconds for the device to power up. Not really worth the trouble. The rest of the devices have power cords that are much easier to use and can handle a little extra power.   the only thing that is missing is the remote to turn on/off the devices. Maybe this will be added later or maybe not...   The only downside is that the computer is too big for my room, my son uses it in the dorm room next door. He still has not gotten used to how big it is. If I could I would love it even more...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a college student who owns a MacBook Air.  There are no external drives available, and I wanted to replace them with an external hard drive.    I purchased the Seagate external drive from ThinkGeek for $40.  There are a few downsides of the drive, but it's still a cheap way to have an external drive in your laptop.  The hard drive is solid, but the speed is quite slow compared to other external drives I've had.  However, it's a nice quality hard drive that will last a long time if you care about that.  Overall, I like the drive. It's inexpensive and it looks nice.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   When I got my XBox 360, I did not expect it to be so good. It has made me an XBOX 360 collector for life and if it ever fails, I will find a replacement for my collection. It will always be an XBox gamer in my house.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, February 20, 2013  Fantastic  by John from Lakeville MN USA  Pros: Light weight, simple to install  Cons: No games work  Review: I have the XB1 and used the one in my basement for a couple of years, and decided I wanted to get something bigger and better. I got this and never wanted to use it again. It's too big, and it's too heavy. I bought it as a replacement because I had my eye on a larger Xbox 360 unit, but I can't see why anyone would buy this when they have the better one.  at first, it does the job, but then, there are no games. I have a 3ds, and my XBONE doesn't work. I use to play every games on my XBOX, and now, none of them work. No more games.   The only problem I've found is the fact that there is nothing to do. I can play my PS3 games but I won't have access to my 360 library of games. No big deal. but it will be a problem when I need to install games on the XBO.  and the only reason i gave this product 4 stars. The 3d tv/blu-ray disc drive. I don't want a bs disc drive with my XBO, or any XBOX in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first electronic device in my life, I am new to computers and computers are hard to use for me because I have no hands to grip the keyboard, which is very hard to play the keyboard. The device that i received did not come with a mouse, I ordered one and it arrived at my door in less than 2 days, so its great that the keyboard and mouse work together so well with the mouse. This is great for people who want to use a tablet and a computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works great, no problems at all. I'm impressed with this thing, especially for a $10 price point. Thanks for making it, as always.   By using it with my Sony PCM 5118 I'm able to get really good sound quality. It's pretty cool to have it with this receiver.  -Jeff  Nice and cheap Nice and cheap It's not as good as the one I had before, but for the price it's a good buy.  :) Thanks for the review Jeff  Best cheap headset I ever owned! Best cheap headset ever owned My first pair of buds had a horrible boominess. This one is amazing. I would definitely buy another pair if I can afford them.  .  great product and price great product and good price. great headset.  the sound quality is not bad, i bought two and it fit me great, the bass is decent for me, the treble is great, and the noise cancellation is good,  it's a great product, i use it on my pc with my sound cards and its super comfortable  Great! Great! I'm using these now with my HP laptop and I love the comfort of the headset. I really like the sound of this one. I've had a pair of the old Beats which were a bit cheap but these are a much better value. I can't hear as much in my house when using these on my laptop but it is great. The sound is clear and clean with very little distortion. I was very skeptical about getting these but now I'm very happy that I did. Thanks Headfonia!  Awesome! Awesome! This is my first pair to try out and I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is very nice and the sound is very clear and I can hear it even when standing close to a speaker (good for a smaller space). It also works great with my laptop. This headset fits perfectly with my headphones. Thanks headfonia.  a must have. 'sound is amazing!  the comfort and fit of this headset is just awesome!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________I bought this for the XBox 360 a few months ago. When I received it, I was really pleased with the screen resolution, the sound, and the buttons that work well. However, I had to return it because it was defective. The top button on the console was stuck in the down position. So I just took it back, and it seems like it works much better now. __________________  "All the technology is in the hand, but the finger is still the master of all, and its very wise." - Leonardo da Vinci
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you for a great product. I was able to record and store my son's birthdays on my phone with no issue.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just finished upgrading to this thing. I've got two iPhones, and one was an old phone I had from the 90's. It was fine on the 4G network, but I wanted to be able to stream music from my iphone to my computer without the app being loaded, as well as download songs directly to the ipad. I thought this would be a good solution. So far, so good, great battery life, no need to open the apps and load new versions. I'm very impressed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second electronic device and first battery-operated one. The first one lasted about 2 years on a charge and I was very happy. The last one that I received was defective (which I didn't notice until a few days after I had it). This one is much better. The battery lasts much longer, and the LCD screen is easy to read. I'm using it on a phone that I have for several years. The only negative is that the charging unit can't handle all of my smartphones and tablets. I've had mine for about a month, and I still have about a half a charge left.  Rated 5 out of 5 by karlie from Best buy out there I own several of these. They are very reliable and the battery lasts for a long time. I recently bought another one and love it. I also like the fact that they fit into an iPhone pocket.  in addition, the LCD is easy on the eyes.  The only reason I give 4 stars is because it takes some time to get your batteries charged. I charge the batteries in the morning (I don't know why) when I get home and have to manually crank the device on every night for several days. I think it takes a lot more time than the other reviews mention. If I had to do it all again, I would have purchased an AC adapter. Otherwise, this is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's an amazing piece of electronic art! It takes hours to set up, and it's extremely accurate to the original (a lot of thought and research and testing has gone into its construction!). I have been wanting to play a game like this for a while, but only had the money for the prototype. I was totally blown away by the result. Great quality, great game play, a fun game for kids and adults alike. I'll definitely be buying more.  Report this review Pro Privacy ON (login to see reviewer names) on October 3rd, 2011 I'm not a huge fan of "e-games" per se (which is why I bought a game from Amazon instead) but this one was super easy to setup. It took me only 3 hours to assemble and I had to give my dad a hand since he didn't know how to use a soldering iron. It's not as detailed as some other games that have been in this category but that isn't a bad thing.   It did take me two games to understand what was going on, but after the first game I got it. And it's really fun!   Overall I'm happy with my purchase. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the game is not very hard to get going. I'm sure it could be a lot harder. And some people may find the game too easy. Still, I'm super glad I bought it and it got me through the first few games.  I would buy it again!     And here's my review on Amazon...  A couple of months ago, while playing a game with my son (yes, he's old enough to know better), the topic of a digital "game" came up. After a few minutes of discussion we decided to build one in my basement. It was a quick and easy project. I think a lot of people would agree that these are a great way to pass the time between meals or afternoons. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. I also really like the amount of "tricks" that can be done with this device. My son is excited to try some of the games. It definitely fits into our "games" category, and we're hoping to build more of them.   it is definitely not easy to build...and requires a lot more skill than playing a computer game...and I've got to say, it is fun and I would
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have this on a new Lenovo m3, on my first day of using it, I was able to set up my home network on it by using a wireless keyboard. For some reason that was not working in the first time I did it. I had to restart it to get it to work. The second time, the first attempt, it worked. Then I had the option of doing the network setup for it in the netgear vyvanne. When I set it up on the m3 I had no issues. It is fast, is stable, and has very good range. The one drawback is that the remote is just a mouse and keyboard. It does not have a mouse pad or anything. The other is, the remote, when the system is on, and when it is on the TV and is turned off, the touchpad is not mapped correctly to the remote. You have to hit a key on the remote to turn on/off the TV. The remote on the other hand, is mapped perfectly. It works perfectly. I was very impressed with this device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! My friends and I used the new mr. paulson guitar to teach the guitar lessons at my church. The instrument is great for people that have never played an instrument before. This guitar has great tones and is very affordable. The price of this guitar is excellent, and you get so much more than just a guitar with its great tone. If your interested in purchasing this instrument, I recommend the guitar. The staff at the local store were very helpful and friendly. My guitar was returned when we did not finish and my friend was able to buy it when he was ready for it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dman from Good sound, easy to use I bought a PPS3200 when I heard they were available. I really wanted one to put on my lap for home concerts. I purchased one because I love the sound of this model and I love having it on my desk, but there's no place to attach it to the desk without drilling into the desk. With the included accessories I thought I'd be ok. I've been using it for 2 weeks now, and I've had great luck. It's not very loud, but it's clear. It works great and I haven't had to turn the amp down too far. If you want to listen to a song and then move on to the next track, you can without turning the amp all the way down. The buttons for volume and mute and the 2 knobs are easy to read. One of the coolest things is that you can set the volume by changing the volume slider (which I found very handy). This also works great for making recordings. One other nice feature is that, even though I have a P90, the PPS works great. I love how it fits so I can sit down and not worry about putting it on the desk or around my neck. . The sound quality is awesome. I'm using it with my iPad and my Sony Walkman. I think the sound quality, especially if you're going to use it in a larger room, would be better if you had a smaller speakers. What I really like about this amp is that it doesn't have any pre-amps and the sound comes from the amp. The volume is good. This is a great choice. If you are looking for a small portable amplifier this is the one. It does come with an included 2x12 cab speaker, but I'd suggest that you get

The quality and performance far exceeds the sound that I had with the Sennheiser HD 250 and Senn HD 590.  in addition, I'm a big fan of the included remote control which allows the user to turn the volume up, down, play/pause, skip forward/backward, and even adjust the level.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to replace my computer for work. The sound from the speakers are great! They are the most clear and loud sound I have ever heard. The only issue I have had is that it keeps going off when using it on my wireless computer to play games. I do not use it to watch tv, but the sound does not sound good on my computer either. If you're looking to replace your computer for an upgrade, or to improve the sound quality of your computer, you cannot go wrong with the sony xd-750.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Joe from Worked just fine I had a few problems with my new xd750, but not really bad. The unit started working after I connected my old one's power cord. I had to disconnect the old unit's power cable to get it to work. I did have to install a fan (or two), but it is not a huge deal, and it did make my new unit warmer. , but it's no big deal,. I installed the new xD750 in my older desktop computer, which is a much slower computer that can only use 3.5mm jack (so the dvd connection has to be upgraded to phono). The sound quality from the xd drive is much better on the new system, but also on a new computer with this drive. So, the new machine will be more than fast enough to play my DVDs (although it won't play Blu-rays just yet).  Excellent Purchase. Very happy! My first computer purchase, and this was an excellent purchase. Installation was easy and the sound was a little weak until the power button was pushed. Still a great purchase.

My dad wanted this because of how easy it is to use, its the perfect size, and its light so you don't need a bulky one.

Rated 4 out of 5 by MrW from Nice small portable speaker This is a good portable speaker. I found the built in speakers too weak for my taste. I have a Sonos which has a much better sound and the price is much better but I prefer the bass and clarity of this speaker.  Customer Testimonials

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a Sennheiser e936 at the end of 2008. It was my first digital device and it was amazing. It saved my sanity when I was listening to heavy metal music, because the sound was so intense it made my ears bleed and it drowned out the music.  When it comes to digital devices, this is one that deserves its 5 stars, because it has been the only digital device that has ever saved my ears from heavy metal. I love my e9.

I've had a Samsung T2310 since early 2011 when I got a T2210, and then finally a T2730s, both of which were pretty good. I was able to get the iMac to perform to the level of my Samsung T27s with a simple hack in software. I did the same thing with my old MacBook Air.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is one of my favorite tools ever. I use this for everything from programming my keyboard to changing the sound of my music, it is also great for finding small hidden details in my music. I also use it to change the settings on my PC and it changes the color of the icons.  The best feature to me is that I can easily view the program's memory and make sure that the files I am working on are still intact. It's a great program! I've never really had a chance to do video editing and I'm glad that I have now. I like to do it in one sitting and when I come back to the computer I have the video ready to go. I love this program. I have used many programs for this purpose but this is the best. I've tried many others and I still use this everytime I use it. The only problem is that this program doesn't allow me to have more than 50 video files open at the same time, but I don't care, I do it. My favorite program for making video is this one. It does everything for me. Another great product from SoftMotions, the most useful for me is the keyboard. This program allows me to use it both as a keyboard and a video recorder. It can save and load my programs to memory to record audio of anything, with the possibility of editing it on the fly. The program allows you to record up to 1,000 words of audio at a time. This software is just a must-have. A software to save and save your programs. I bought this a few months ago. I find myself using it to edit videos to get the best quality. I never use the software as a stand-alone product but rather on top of another program. It works for me with my programs.  The program is great, a bit expensive, but the good stuff outweighs the price difference. This is a very versatile program.  It is perfect for anyone who likes to use video to make videos. It allows me the flexibility to edit my own videos using the built in editing tools and allows me more power to create my own video editing software.   The program comes with many effects and filters that can be applied to any video you want.  One of my favorites is the Time Lapse feature.  My biggest drawback is that there is no way to have the audio and video be synchronized and this is a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikon.it's the first device that i use daily. it's a very nice phone and i only wish the software that came with it (but there are so many alternatives, that i can't complain about it) works good. i have a few problems though. the first problem is that the camera has a problem with low light. i don't use it for that, so i didn't even noticed when the screen went out. but it happened a few times. but if i used it during the day, it's perfectly ok. it has a microphone, too, which is a nice bonus. the screen on the ikona (the one with the battery) isn't very good, but the ikea is a lot better. but the screen is really sensitive to the light. but there are some apps that work very well. there is a good selection of them in the iken appstore, and the iphone appstore has a very good variety of stuff too. the second problem is the lack of sd card memory. it can be used for phone calls, but it's not very efficient because of the large amount of data it needs. for this, ikonenetworks offers a usb cable. the price is really good too, about 5 euros. but i would buy the ikaon, if the software were updated (i'm using the ikeda) to use the USB port more efficiently. the ikinga does have that ability, but ikono has none of it. in conclusion, i like it. the software is great and the price very good. if i could improve this a little more, i would, but in the end, it is perfect. i hope ikoni changes the software. the only bad thing about the ikkona is that it gets hot when it gets cold. not a big deal for me because i take it with me most of the time and it works fine. the good thing is that ikons are sold pretty cheap so you can always buy a new one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a couple of these devices for my two dogs and I love them. They are so easy to use and have a huge range of different features. I have bought one for each of my dogs for Christmas as they were both going to be new dogs, and they both love them! I would highly recommend them if you are looking for an easy to have electronic device for your dogs.  Love them! : The i-Tight S2, my first I-Tie, arrived on the very day ordered. It has worked wonderfully and will always be my favorite. I love how I can have the option to charge it via USB cable or wirelessly via the I-tie app to control it remotely and have the app do the rest. Love it.  to much to tell : So far I have been quite impressed with the I Tie and am loving all the features that come with it. I just ordered two more! It's great being able to set alarms that can be done remotely with the app and can be set to remind me of certain things. It's a great way to keep track of what I've done. Also I LOVE that they can be used to control your TV, which is pretty cool when I work from home.    I love it!! : I have used a dog tie since it came out so was very skeptical about this, I love the flexibility of being able the the I tie to control both my TV and my alarm clocks. Plus they are really easy to set up, you don't even need a cable to start. .... Great device......I was in for a surprise when I received my I Tie. This device is a winner. I am so pleased with it I even ordered two extra I ties just for use with my dogs.   Great product, fast shipping : I love my i-tie. I use it all the time and it is very versatile. I've had it for three months and have only had to use it once. The quality of the product is great. The product is well made and easy to put together. I will continue to order these.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is an excellent computer, which does not get very hot on the lap. I'm satisfied with the purchase and will be using this again.  The only thing I would add is to use the supplied software. You have to select which device is for which network and I am still not sure which one to use (My wife has two devices and the other is on the same network). It would have been nice to find that out before purchase, and to have a link to the manual so we could do it ourselves if needed. - Mike  Was this review helpful? Yes No

I was not expecting to get it working with the G5 Play and I also didn't want a phone with a backlit display so I was a bit wary when I decided to get this phone. I am glad I did as the T-mobile G5 is a great phone and I am pleased with it. I've had it running since I got it and I do feel I am getting something more for my money. I have a feeling this is a new phone model so I plan to use my G5 for the next few years before I replace it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my cj200 for over a month now and I must say that I am very happy with this little device. It fits the purpose that I needed it to. Its very portable and doesn't get in the way when traveling. I dont carry a phone with me on the plane as I do my work. This means its always with me and is always with my phone. ive used this device to record a tv show and it works perfectly. It will take me more time to do this but its worth the wait. Its great to know that I have this tool in my kit and that I don't need to be a tech guru to use it. This is a great little gadget. Thank you.  Best portable, tiny camera This is the first of several small cameras I'm purchasing for my travels. This one's very small, portable, and easy to use. I like that it has two buttons, one on the top and one on top and bottom. I'm still trying to figure out what all the settings do. Once I figure out which is best for me, I'll have a much better idea of what settings to use on my main camera. I find myself using this camera to take pictures and video of my pets and other wildlife and I think it's a fantastic tool! If you are planning on buying one, I highly recommend it!  Good for everything I own This is by far the best camera I own, and it was very easy to put together.  not a lot of noise and great for travel  Not as good as I hoped This camera is good for it's price range but not as good in terms of resolution and exposure control compared to my other camera (I am very picky with my cameras). For example, it doesn't have a zoom. In the past I've bought several small compact cameras and had no issues with image quality, but I found that on the cj100 i had to turn down the ISO from 1600 to around 1000. .   . ,   I have my eye on a few other camera that will fit my needs better.  the best small camera that I own for its size and price
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little monitor I have 2 of them it has a very good picture and color.

I got mine with my xbox 360  The picture was ok for the first few hours. Then the blue hue would come on when it was dark. It was pretty annoying  So I uninstalled it and went with a non-blue light monitor. I used a non blue light monitor  And it's the best monitor I've used.  That said, if the monitor were any longer, the red might be a little annoying.  the picture is nice and big for the price,  of good quality for a little money  A+++++,  It's a great monitor. A little too large for my taste. : ) I've been playing video games for 20+ years and this is by far the best of any monitor I own.  in a very dark room. The picture is great. The color is great, too. But the blue lights are too bright and it does give me that "blue glare".  Would definitely recommend!  Had my old one for awhile but I thought this one would work better. -Rick R, Houston, Texas  Great monitor  and price!  the price is great for a good monitor. it's perfect for my x box360 and i love it. i am very happy with it. and the picture quality is great! i am glad that i found this monitor. good price too.  on the bottom it says: "Blue light". if you want to turn this off, you need to use a special adapter. if you don't know what you are doing, you will probably mess up the picture.    
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a good way to play my favorite songs from my computer with the sound going to my amp. I have used earbuds and my ears are burnt up. I got the sennheiser e201 and it is great. It is comfortable and has a very good sound. I am very happy with it. I really enjoy the fact that it is cordless, I just pull it out of the pack and it works great. I love that the batteries last for a long time. This is a good device for the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great quality product I bought this at the last minute with the intention of using it for some video recording purposes.

It was fairly easy to set up, and once it was working I really couldn't imagine going back to my old portable video recorder.

My son's response:   I just used this phone as my primary phone.  It has been amazing.  The screen is great, the design of the phone is great.  You can pick up the phone without it getting all soggy.  If you get this phone and get it out of the box, you will get a perfect phone.   I'm impressed with the build quality of this device.  Its nice that it has a micro usb charger, but there are many other great options out there. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This little beauty is a very good compact electronic calculator. I have had mine for over a year and it is just as it was when I first received it in February of 2001. The most exciting thing about this calculator is that it has been used for the most difficult math problems to calculate. It does an excellent job, not only for general use, but also for applications in physics, chemistry and other areas.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for a few days and its already saving my phone from many a battery drop. it is quite a good battery life and I have a large battery for the device so it will last a long time. ive tried a number of chargers and they all work fine but not as good as this one. also a nice touch is the included USB cable and charger. ived never used one before and its great to have. iven the few other problems i did encounter i would say it is really a good product. only complaint is the usb plug will not fit into the usb connector. ives tried the other usb plug and i just didnt fit. but other than that a good buy ive got 2 so if your having issues it might be worth looking into.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had been looking for this thing for a while, I heard about the Voodoo Voodoo 3 (a portable PS2, and Voodoo2). Then I found the Voodoo Voodoo 4. After a long time I have got it. I have not yet used the 4 port (which is 2 usb, 1 usb/2 ethernet) to play games, just a couple of movies. But I can get the picture very good. Good price for the VOODOO 4. It is very good product, great quality, it is so easy to use, I will buy this again. I've been using this for about 3 weeks and have not had a problem. I was impressed with the speed of this unit when it came out and now that I've got one, I find I've actually been using the VIVO-2 more. It's definitely a worthy upgrade. The 4 port USB 3.0 hub with 4 USB 3 ports is very cool and is a great upgrade to my old one. The price was reasonable. Excellent product. This device is much more powerful than my previous computer and has been great since I bought it. One more thing- this thing is so fast. I can do my job of looking at emails/screenshots all day without having to download anything (it even saves them to the sd card in the sd slot). Just wish that it was faster on my older computer. My friend's computer had this too. He said it was super slow. This unit has been my goto. It plays all the movies I've rented from Netflix, DVD-a-GoGo, and Amazon Instant. It works great with Netflix HD. I use a USB to Ethernet adapter and the Viva64 HDMI cable. This unit is super fast, fast, and very very fast. My only complaint is that it runs a bit warm to the touch at times. A good deal for $100 bucks. I like that it has a nice little usb hub. You can hook this thing up to all sorts of devices and use it as a media center or desktop PC. Great product. The only down side is the 4 ports. I'm sure that this will be changed. I had to wait for it to be available at a Best Buy location. It came with a few games that I can't remember the names of. but I do know that it's a bit of a pain to install a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     5 / 5 5 out of 5 Best Purchase Ever   I have a brand new Samsung Tab 4.2. This thing has made it so much easier to use my tablet for work. I used to buy my tablet off ebay with my old iphone 4.1. I found it hard to carry around, it was too heavy and too bulky. Not anymore. You can get a tablet for almost nothing and a great deal on the software. My old tablet had a hard time with work tasks and even my friends said they had to hold the tablet in the air to see what it was doing. The new tablet has great battery life, runs smoothly, has a great screen, a good amount of RAM and the interface is so easy to use. This is an amazing piece of hardware. If you're a computer person, this is for you.  4 / 5 4 / 5 Fantastic   This is a great device. It works better than my old Apple laptop, even my MacBook Air. The best part, the screen works great! My previous tablet was slow, it just would hang at times. I had no idea how I was getting the screen so dark, but then I discovered the power saving feature! No more slow down. Great job Samsung!  2 / 5 2 / 5 Great product   The screen has a lot of customization. It is a tad smaller than the retina, but it is also smaller than my retina. The screen is the same color as the retina which is a nice touch.   I was a little apprehensive at the start due to the price but it has been a great purchase. The tablet can easily replace my macbook, even without a retina.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Best of the Best and very good value for money, easy to set up and operate. I've been using these lights for years and they get great reviews on here and on YouTube. This has been my first light that I've ever used and I've just switched to the blue ones. I'd recommend these to anyone.  Good product for the price :  Great price for the product. A little noisy, but that was expected considering the price.  and I do have two of these, one is a constant and one is on standby (wink wink). The constant gives off a cool blue color and gives off cool white light while the standby (standby) one gives off warm yellowish/orange/red light and I am using it as a light over my desk to help me keep track of a project on the computer. So far I have only used it as an alternative to my office light and it does look great. I did have to add a 10w LED bulb to the main light bulb for it to work properly. - - - -  Quality Product, Nice Price.  to use the white one, I need a high current bulb (2.0A) and the blue one needs 1.2A, so I can use the blue on a dimmer (low)  The red is a little too bright for my liking. It's nice in a pinch, but a bit more blue would probably be a better match. . - - a bit of the blue LED is too much.  the one on standby gives off yellowish light, as does the constant.  is a cool looking little light. Not sure if the dimming function works with dimming mode on a high voltage transformer but is a nice light  - to use any of these lights you need a dimmable power transformer and one of those 9 volt power packs for your 9V transformer to plug in. these can be bought at any electronics store.  it takes a 9 volt battery or 2 AA battery packs and a dimming transformer, I use a 9v for both  I bought these lights to replace my 9v LED lights on my computer table. These were very nice looking lights but they were way too bright. I ended up putting a bright white and blue LED on the other side of the table. The constant is good for general use, and the standby light is good if you want something to go on in the dark
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little headphone amp. The sound is crystal clear, and the amp does a good job driving the amp. It does make it sound like a good amplifier, which it is. I have a lot of noise from my laptop, speakers, and phone, so it was nice to finally have an amp that has a built in compressor to help the volume while you are using it. The only thing that I don't like is that it requires a 3.5mm to 3.1mm cable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________  5.0 out of 5.0 stars  The AVR Studio 2 has all the features that I look for in an analog mixer: I don't have to use my laptop for sound production anymore and can easily take full advantage of the computer's audio software, and the quality of the sound is great. I'm also using the mixer with an inexpensive USB audio interface, and I couldn't be happier with the sound quality. It's nice to have the built-in headphone amp, which I've only been able to use on the laptop. It helps me get a more full-bodied mix that is more immersive than a laptop. I'll definitely be using the AVR's on my next project.  Write a negative review about an inferior product: _______________________  3.8 out of 3.8 stars .

I am also not happy about the cost of the product.  was great so i just bought it cause its cheap and that is what I expected from them, but there are a few things that should be fixed. the buttons are not easy to operate. i got it to work and its still hard to control. I just thought the buttons should not be the way they are. there is no remote control, which is nice because the sound comes out of the side of the AVP. the volume is a little low, but its not that bad and it just happens with the cd it comes with. it is just so nice to get the cd for free, but with the digital version.

The VX 500A has been my main entertainment piece for my 2 story condo, and also my business computer. I'm impressed by the sound and picture quality of this unit. This unit easily gets the job done for both of these.  , I am amazed at how little this unit weighs. The size of it is really big, and this unit is not the biggest at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very small device that is very good. The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because the USB connection is on the bottom right so you have to be really careful that when the switch is in the up position you can't accidentally short-out the port. I have a USB connector that looks like the one below, and it's actually the wrong one. It looks so small and I didn't know that until I got it. (This one is for my old Panasonic RZ1.)   The camera is really great. I've had it for about two weeks now. The interface is very easy to use and I'm really happy with it. I just wish the flash didn't have an auto-exposure setting (though it does) or a video function. I don't need that functionality.   I also have the camera adapter but I've only used it once. I'm not sure what it is because I can't adjust anything. I'll have to look into it, but it doesn't look like a problem for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very good monitor. It is a good screen size. If I want to read from a tablet or laptop I will use a laptop. The best part is that I am able to have my entire computer screen on the monitor. For me this is the best of both worlds. I can use a phone with a monitor, or I can have my computer as the screen. The color looks great too. The monitor is heavy and does not need to be touched to use the monitor properly. I use it in my office so it gets a lot of use. The battery life is great as well. I had a laptop that I was able to charge from the wall while I am at work. With this monitor I can charge the monitor while I'm at work and it is great that I don't have to buy a charger for the laptop while it is on the wall charging. It has not broken yet, so I think I will keep it for another year or two. If it had not broken I would have given it 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s - awesome phone with amazing camera and music player and really good keyboard and software too. It's been like 5 years now. i had been a loyal customer since the first version. i have bought two 4s since i got my first one (in 2008). ive even bought a few of these new ones as ive seen good reviews and liked the design. ive bought a second one as an upgrade to my 3g and i'm so happy about this. ive only had it a month now but have been enjoying it more and more. it feels like a normal phone and its a lot more stable than my old one. The only issue i've had is when i go in to use the phone and turn the battery off, it won't turn back on. and i can see that it's charging now but the problem wont stop. not sure what to do now. but it's only a 3g device. not a very big problem. and the 4s has the same issue. not really worth the money.

Great for all types of radio communication.  Rated 4 out of 5 by JH from Easy to use - works great I have two of these and both have worked as advertised. The antenna is a great fit in the upper-right corner of the rear of the radio. When it is used, the antenna comes up and out of the side of the plastic housing, and the device is easy to hold to my ear. The battery life is good. A recharge is about 30-60 minutes, depending on the type of battery used. A power failure is always a possible concern. I would recommend this product to anybody.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this keyboard. The layout is very comfortable and I get the idea where keys are on the top and bottom row and the rest of the keys are in the middle column. I also really like the ability to move the keys around easily and the function of the backspace button. I use it on a desktop and with a mouse, it is easy to type with and is a great typing experience. Overall I am very happy with the keyboard.   My only minor complaint is the keycaps. They are a little bit on the stiff side and they are almost too stiff to feel at first. They aren't too bad on a keyboard, but it takes a few days to get used to them. I don't feel the need to go with a different brand of keycaps, but I would recommend a good case for them as they do not look good on the surface.   in other words, they feel better in the hands than they look!  Have a good experience with this product:  My last one was a little scratchy but this one is fine, I've only had it for about a month but I've gotten over the initial bumpyness.  Just a bit too long for a single keystroke.  (Not the best way to describe it though)  But at least I didn't buy a "keyboard" just one keypad, which would probably be fine for a lot of things but it's just not the right keyboard for me. I really wish I didn  t have to have a computer at all.  the only thing I miss is having my old keyboard back and I can easily move it to my other laptop.   at least the function keys work well  Great product! :D:D:  (I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it if it wasn't this one!)   (It does look like an old school keyboard, which is cool.)   This is my third keyboard of this type but it is definitely my favorite. The keys have very little give to them and I've found myself accidentally pressing keys accidentally. The only problem I've run into is the arrow keys and the back and forward sliders are a bit stiff. They're definitely better than what I'm used to but it would be nice to have an option to add in a clicker, which I think would go a long way in making it a very customizable keyboard.  was
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus.com I have owned one of these for many years and it has been a reliable unit. It is great for recording and playing back audio. The sound quality is great and the unit has always performed as advertised. It has worked great with all kinds of audio files, from live audio to old movie soundtracks. The one drawback I can't find. This unit is designed to work with a laptop, and there is no way I can run a stereo system without this unit. Other than that it's a great product and I will recommend it to others.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Sound Quality I have used this unit for over a year and have been very pleased with the sound quality of this unit and the ability to use it on a PC. You can get some great recordings with it too. I am using it as my primary recorder/processor for my audio project.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! i use this to charge my portable hard drive! the only thing is it needs to be plugged in the usb connector, not the power supply! and it does not work well with a micro-usb charger that i have. the one in my computer was perfect! i used it and it works great! i have no complaints.  This device is really great. It's small, has a power cable and a USB adapter.   The only problem I had with this device is, when I plug it into my computer it always won't connect to the computer! I don't know if this is because it isn't working correctly with the computer or if it has a problem with the laptop power supply but it won't work. This is really annoying.   be sure to check to make sure the USB is plugged in properly and that the USB adapter is properly plugged in!  Works as advertised, USB-powered battery charger - great product  I have had this thing for a few months now, and I am very pleased with the product. It is small, very portable, and very reliable. I've plugged it into a wall socket and it worked great, so I plugged it in the laptop and it was great, but then I got the laptop out and it wouldn't charge. So I unplugged it, re-plugged everything, plugged it back in, and now the laptop is charging like a champ. Great product! .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the original unit for over 5 years and had never had a problem. the battery and the connection are just as I would expect them to be, the sound is great and the controls are simple to operate. very pleased.

Easy to set up, play and clean up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this unit from B&H Photo for $500 for a 50GB hard drive for a camera and a tripod. This is the best price I have found so far and the unit has been rock solid. It takes a good amount of pressure to take the camera off the tripod and it can hold the camera steady during shooting. I used this camera on the beach and the exposure was perfect.  This is the fastest video camera I have used with a long lens (14-28mm) and I have the Sony F55, a great all-in-one video camera, but the Gopro is the real deal and has all of the features and capabilities of the Sony. If you are looking for a really great small camera this is it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________________  I don't have a good reputation for buying new gear. I can usually find some quality stuff that I find on sale. I bought this microphone for a great price and got it before the new iPhones came out. I've had mine for a week now and it's great. The thing I really like is that it has a really good balance of signal. I have it at a high volume and it sounds really nice. _______________________________________________________________________________  this is a great product for your recording needs ______________________________________________________________________  "I can't say enough good things about this microphone. It is a little more than just a boom mic for me... The sound is really good and the mic has really nice controls. I would recommend it highly. " __________________________________________________________________  What a difference a day of use makes: _______________________________________________________________  for my first time I wanted to get some vocal recording but couldn't find a mic that was well balanced for vocals. I picked up the Pultec and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It didn't sound cheap at all, it sounds great and I love having an easy to use boom mic. I'm in my first year of studying voice and this mic has come in really handy. It's still a little too loud but as I've become more experienced and comfortable with it, I've started to reduce the volume. ________________________________________________  If you're looking for a reliable boom mic this is the best option for the price.  The boom mic is a nice addition to my mix. I like that it's easy to set up. - Steve from UK ________________________________________  It is very well balanced, but a bit loud. I use this with a cardioid mic for vocals, and it is perfectly balanced on both sides and produces very clean vocals. It has a lot of gain and is very easy to drive into an amplifier. I highly recommend this mic to anyone looking for an easy and well balanced boom mic that you can use with a condenser mic and a dynamic mic.  (Not my mic, but it sounds the best in my opinion.)  This mic also works as a cardioido microphone, and is more affordable than the other booms I have tried. __________________  in the box: a 3-meter cable, a 2-meter extension cable and a rubber stopper  - Jase from Canada ________________________________________________________________  Good mic, it is very low
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I got this thing I was so excited to have a computer for the first time in ages. I bought the iMac i7 64 and had only really used Mac computers when I was younger. I had always liked what I had and was very excited to finally get a computer. The computer came very promptly and I had been using it for 3 weeks and it ran really well. It is quiet, cool and efficient. I have the Mac Pro and have never used a PC or even a Mac. It just works. I'm planning to get a PS3 and get my gaming fix on this computer. I love my new computer.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a iphone 5s, the samsung device i bought in january of 2014. I've been using it ever since and really really like the s4 better. I just had to change the batteries in it, and I don't know if it was because of the phone, but it started making funny beeps and noises when i was trying to connect to my computer (i have an ethernet connection to it) the beeps are so weird!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have one of these things, and it's not broken! So if you are a collector of old audio gear, and want to listen to your collection with ease, and not have to pay for it to be converted to MP3, and have the ability to change the recording quality on the fly, this is a must have. What I like: Easy to use. Nice sound. Plenty of control over the amount of audio you want on the system.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is my 3rd of the "Odyssey" series and I am very pleased! As the last two were on a budget I was very happy with the choice in the price point. I have been using it for some time now with a USB 2.0 hub. The keyboard is very responsive and it gets a little hot to the touch but I think is because of the light weight design. It is also pretty quiet in operation. This model is now my only USB keyboard. I was originally looking into a Model S and the "Dongle" to get around the $70 cost difference. I can tell you this is not a cheap device and I was so pleasantly surprised. The unit arrived today. I am not sure how I will spend the money but I hope it goes into a bigger project and I will use this as a backup. I know many who have had it for years and have no complaints.  I'm new to this hobby and this is my first foray into purchasing one of these keyboards. I'm very impressed. It has everything I need from a keyboard - to a mouse - to an all in one usb hub. This is definitely not a keyboard for beginners, but for a bit more advanced. I used this to replace a laptop for a year, and was never disappointed. It's very well designed, is very portable, and the USB-C is very convenient.  the keyboard has a nice key cap set. It comes with the red and black color versions, and red and blue versions with clear keys. It includes the dongle. The dongles are very convenient, and it doesn't take much of a space to add one on the dolby hub, as well as to add a mouse on the hub. If you use all of your external devices from your laptop it will take a little space. The usb port on this device is not large, and if you have to charge your device from there, it may not be as convenient as a normal keyboard. It would be nice if there were other port options, like an optical mouse port, or an ethernet port. It does have a small usb hub for your other devices though. This keyboard does have many settings for all of it's inputs, including media keys. There is no volume keys though, but you can add them if you want. There are a couple different buttons on the keyboard, the backspace one is a backspace

Was this Review Helpful to you?

Review: I use the device when we go to a friend's house and then take it with us and record a podcast while out and about. I have had it since 2006. No problem with the battery life at all.  a great product, just wish they would have given the USB port as an option for charging and recording. :)  to be continued.

Yes No Wednesday, August 27, 2008 by Robert (USA)(retired) , great price and the batteries last for a very long time. I keep both plugged in at the same time. the only issue I have is with the charger. I can get it to work but it's a little annoying to have to connect each time and then use up two of the four USB cables you get with this product.  and to top it off, the usb cable that came as the included item had some tiny pieces in it that didn't work when I plugged them into my computer. The ones that I purchased on my own are not of that quality.  of course I did get an extra usb cable for free. But I would give them four stars instead of five if the quality of these items would be identical.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like my HP Touchpad for Windows because it's easy to use. I can enter addresses from the mouse and have my e-mail address in the address field without using the touchpad. The Touchpad is also very responsive with very little lag. I also like that the buttons are located on the left side and that it has an option to turn on the trackpad when the touch pad is not in use. Write a negative review about an average electronic device  :   The HP Touchpads have poor battery life. I tried to use the touchpads for two days but only had one hour of battery life left. I usually use the screen and touchpad for up to 10 hours and sometimes the battery will last 3-5 hours. I've owned the touch pads for a couple of years and have yet to have an issue with the batteries. I think this will be the main reason I will be replacing my computer with a newer model.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first Ipad but I am still enjoying it. Great screen quality, excellent battery life and lots of apps to try!  I'd recommend it to anyone.   I have a couple of issues with it, however:   1) It's just not very durable for my use. For about 1 month I used this with my laptop every night and the battery would quickly run out. I have two Ipads in different rooms and this one just wouldn't hold a charge at all.  2) When using my ipad the audio becomes distorted if you keep the volume up really high. It works ok with headphones though but it just doesn't make any sense to be using a speakerphone with a microphone. I tried using ear buds but they made it worse. ,  Click to expand...
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very happy with the  Tecsun PL-380R. I use it to monitor my household temperature and I love it. It is also very quiet and durable. I bought this to replace an old analog-style thermometer. I am an engineer and can appreciate an accurate temperature reading. The PL-388R has a nice accurate readout. The only thing that can be improved upon is the ability to record your data to an Excel or CSV file.  This is a really nice item. The analog readouts are easy to read. I was able to use the PL-400R to display some simple charts to show my family's progress. It has a large enough LCD display to be useful, even without a backlight.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great gadget. I have several of the same ones. They don't always work properly, but when they do, they are powerful, powerful tools. It took a few years to get the battery back in, but I finally did. It's still a great tool, but it doesn't always stay at full capacity.   I used a different brand of rechargeable batteries, and the phone died shortly after a month of continuous use. So I was hesitant to buy this new version. But once again, this phone will run for a while and the batteries last the full battery life of the phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!I just got my M-Audio Oxygen M8i. I'm a big fan of modular and that's what this M-audio has to offer. This modular works like a dream. When I used it on my Roland, I didn't find that the modular was any less effective than the one that was in my old modular. The Roland sound is great in my opinion. I just need to know if it would be possible to connect the modular to my soundcards for that great sound. The modular is awesome! The volume on my system is so much better and I can't believe how much I paid for this amazing module. The Oxygen is a perfect match for it. This module is a total bargain and I'm so happy with it.

It's a big improvement over the Xbox 360. I was very pleasantly surprised to see the new controller come with the TV, it's so nice not having to hold a controller up and look at the TV while playing.

It's nice to be able to plug in headphones and have a nice sound while watching tv, I also purchased the Dolby Atmos package.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have 2 of the "Hercules" for playing drums and they have been a great addition to my kit. They are extremely durable, don't get me wrong. They just fit like a glove. Just remember that you have to wear gloves when you are playing in the studio with a live band because there are no protective covers in the case. It does get hot, but it is a bit warmer than my old M-8/M-14 drums that are mounted in an enclosed cage and sealed with a layer of felt and carpet (I am using the same M-10 with the rubber coated M-14 case).

The reason I give it five stars is that the keyboard keys are made of plastic, and when they hit the keys they make a rattling sound. I think they need a thicker plastic. Also, the USB cable is not the most comfortable.   in general, I like the keyboard better then the Trito.  , the keycaps are thick and not too squishy. The keys feel very good, and the layout is pretty good, especially if you are used to QWERTY keyboards, it still has that feel.   - Pros: The Kostners keyboard is good to work on. The key caps feel good and have a good typing feel. The USB cable has a good quality. This keyboard works as well as any of the other QWERWERTY keyboard but has a few things that I don't like like the size, or the price.  The C2 keyboard is a great replacement. It works as good as a Kostka keyboard or a Korg Typalux.     - Cons: It's a keyboard for someone that works in a small office. The keyboard feels a little squishy and I have a hard time typing on it. I was hoping for the keys to be a little thinner. The rubber feet would be awesome. Also the keyboard cable needs to be slightly longer than the USB cables.  and there's no microSD card slot, so you won't be able to transfer music to your phone or anything like that. That's all.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is just amazing!!! After using the app for a few weeks i can't believe it works so well! My son has used it too so far and cant get enough of it. He goes for his walks at 5:30 in the morning and he can hear it right through his head. It is a perfect way to get our two sons to sleep at night! The app is just too great! It does everything i need it to do and more. No complaints here!  Read more
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item to replace an old one, i found that the old one was defective. the new one works perfectly and looks better.   It's a good product, it's just that the price was higher for it to be used in my car as a remote.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus i2c USB to I2C converter (the cheapest) and it worked flawlessly when paired with a Arduino. Also, you can get an arduino and I2c converter. Works great.  Review of DJOY2 Review of DJO2 by DJOY  I was really looking forward to get this thing as I am a big fan of the DJOY brand. I have the DJO-S4S-I2S but when i was buying this, I was looking at other models of the same brand, like the DJoy S-I and so on. So I was a bit worried when i opened the box, and i was amazed with the quality of this thing. It comes with a nice carrying bag and all the parts needed to complete the build. The only thing i was disappointed about is that the arduino board is not compatible with this arduino, but it doesn't really matter, you should be able to use it anyway. Also the i2C connection is a little finicky but not that big a deal, just be careful and use the right ones. The arduino is a really good one, and the i 2C works flawlessly with a Raspberry Pi. Overall a great little piece of kit. . ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.........................................................   I had a chance to try out a 3D printer in my high school. It did a decent job printing some very fine details. Now, I am at my local store, wanting to try the same printer out, but the model they had was the second generation. It will do much better than the first generation. I am not sure why there are so many older printers these days.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This item does what it is supposed to do. The screen looks good, it will charge my phone, and play my media with ease! I've had this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with the product.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Nod3 from Great quality This is a nice device that charges quickly, has great battery life, and looks cool. I have only used it twice and it seems to work well on my phone.  (my review)  Review by: Nick from Los Angeles, Ca. I purchased this to use with my Sony Xperia Z1. It works perfectly with my phone and the audio output is excellent.    I did have a couple problems with it:  1. I don't like that the power button does not work on the USB connector (it's hard to tell if the power key is pressed or if it's in the middle of the power/sync button). This is because I don not have an Android device and didn't know any different.  a. I believe the USB port is the same type as the one for the 3D projector which means the power port should be easy to identify. I can't find any information on how to adjust that. - b. There was a slight problem that I was able to solve by going into the settings menu and changing the display resolution to the lowest setting. This is only a little problem in comparison to other problems I've experienced on this device. , but the device still works fine without the problem. I'd like to have a larger screen, but I have plenty of room on my desk. I was going to have to buy the iPhone for this, but it's not out in the world yet. . This item was very well packaged and came in a reasonable amount of time. The user manual is very detailed and easy to read. It is a good idea to read the manual before using the device. If you have any other questions about the product feel free to ask!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 28, 2015  Great product!  of the day for the day of the week it works great.  the only thing that i dislike is the power and sync button  i would have to say good luck and keep up the good work  was this review helpful to you or a friend?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best phone I've had so far! I've been through 3 other android phones, all of which have had major problems. This phone has been absolutely perfect. There are tons of settings to tweak (including which apps you want to allow). The design is gorgeous. The screen quality is amazing. And if you want a good music player, this is it.   Product Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This item came on time and as advertised.  If you are the average consumer this is a bargain, if you are one of those who live to pay the top dollar for the best you should get this  This is the perfect item for the home lab and for home office as it has built in power to all three USB ports, this lets you connect all your gear on three ports to it.  and I like the easy to use USB power source which can run 24/7 and have 2 amp current output for 12v DC and 15 amp output for 24v DC. the power supply unit has a LED screen on it which lets you know if there is a power supply connected to the unit and it also has an on/off power switch.    I had read some of the other reviews on here and decided to buy this instead of the $300 mini one that I have that has two USB ports.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The MPR300-2 is a good stereo microphone. The only reason why i bought this is because my wife is a videographer and she does not like to be recorded in a group. When I picked this mic up it seemed a bit on the thick side but the sound is great and i will use it for some videos.  I use the microphone as a source of recording for a computer based production. It is a great way to get a little more control over the sound as the settings can be adjusted remotely. I also like the fact that the mic is fully discrete and very easy to use with the built-in headphone. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the fact you have to use a USB interface to plug it into your computer. It would be nice if you could use the internal microphone as well.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars is becuase you have t hree USB input options as a USB to audio adaptor. The other two USB connectors only work as an analog in output or a mixer input. In the middle of all the other USB ports are the digital I/O options. : I recommend this mic to any audio professional looking to record a voiceover. I'm using it as an additional mic and it's perfect!  This is my second mic with the Shure brand and I am pleased with both. First one I received has an issue where the mic picks up the background noise from the computer. That can't be a good thing. So I'm replacing it with this one. I like the way it feels in my hand. It's heavy duty and I'm getting a lot of audio. I'd rather have a mic in my laptop than in my backpack.

This is the first of many times I will purchase this product because it is so easy to install. It is easy to use as well, and the fact that it has a cordless feature is just icing on the cake. If you are looking for a product that is easy and inexpensive, the moto z2 pro is perfect for you. I have used it with my laptop and tablet for over a year now and have not found anything to complain about.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* After months of researching my iPod, I ended up getting the XO3. I am glad I did. It's an outstanding piece of gear for the price and is the best device I've had the privilege of using so far. The touch screen is great, the music player is fantastic and the battery is plenty of time. I'm a very early adopter when it comes to technology, so I didn't think I'd like it much, but I was blown away by how much I actually liked it. The build quality is top notch, the sound quality is pretty good, the battery life is great. The battery is rechargeable, so that's nice. I can't say enough about this device. It doesn't need charging (which I found is pretty rare), and the quality of the performance is pretty fantastic. It is now my primary audio device and it makes me extremely happy. I would definitely recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great device that does exactly what it is supposed to do. If you want to watch TV without disturbing the family then this is the device for you. This is the only electronic device that I use that keeps the TV off. The sound is also very nice. The only drawback is that you have to be careful if you place this in the kitchen. You can cut yourself on the cord, but I just put it in the garage and it stays out of the way.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When i was looking to buy this unit i looked at it on amazon, walmart and the local big box store but they all had the same price so it just made me decide to buy it at Best Buy and get a better deal.   If you can find a better price at another site then by all means go ahead and buy it there and get the better price but when you can buy it from your local store that is what you need.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas because she likes to be "alive" (i.e. not in bed all the time.) And it was a good buy. It has worked really well for her. The only thing that is a little annoying is the remote. It's not as easy to use as a TV remote. And it gets lost all the TIME! (The remote is always near her, and she's always looking at it to find it.) However, it's a great purchase for the price and definitely worth a try.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I was going to get this for my iPhone 3G but I was thinking about my iPad mini 2. I was a little skeptical but it's pretty good and works great! I really like the built in mic and the way it fits in my bag. It also has a really great built in headphone/speaker jack! It's my first wireless charger so not very good about it but it works fine.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Kc from Nice and light I bought one of these to charge my new iPad Mini 2 from my car's cigarette lighter. Works fine, not to loud but a lot quieter than a normal wall outlet. Just about any power outlet will work.

A must have for any Xbox owner.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- My device is very sturdy and works very well. I've used the device for a few days and so far so good. I have an older iMac and iMac Mini running Ubuntu and have used the same device for about 6 months. The iMac has been on and off a lot of the time and the Mini had had a few hard drives replaced with bad platters, but so far, this is my first hard drive replacement. I'm very pleased with the workmanship and the performance of the disk drives. I didn't see an option for a drive that could store more than a few hundred songs on it, so I have more music on my devices now than I can play on one of my CD players. I'll see what the prices go up to. You can tell you're getting high quality drives from this company.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________________________________________________________________________  Just got the N2 2 years ago. I have never owned an electric guitar before this, but was so excited about it that i had to get it. I had been playing my acoustic guitar since i was 15, which had its good points but i wanted something to really rock. I was nervous about buying this guitar, but it arrived and i tried it out immediately. I can't believe it took me 2 years! Its a GREAT guitar. The quality is great and the tone is excellent. For the price, i am amazed at how good it is. It comes with 2 tuners and a pickup selector, which is very handy, I use both a Stratocaster and an SG with this. I don't have to switch them up all the time, which saves me lots of time. When i went into the store the owner said it would take me 3 days to return it. But i didn't. i returned it after 5 days. After playing it for 5 days i am still extremely impressed with it. i dont recommend buying this at the first place i got it. It took me quite a while to get used to the action, but its soooo great now.  Got it on the 7th of December 2016. I got a good guitar and i was very happy to buy it. The instrument is in excellent condition and the electronics work great. I am a hard guitar player and it makes a difference. Thank you!  Had to order a replacement after 2 months. Had to send it back to Amazon for a replacement. The guitar did sound great right from the first time I played it, but after a month of playing it, I have a huge problem with the bridge. I really love it and I would recommend it to anyone. But the bridge is so thin. I will most likely not buy a second one because the one I already have is so awesome. :)  The guitar itself is good, the action is ok but my main complaint is the quality of the pickups and how they sound. the sound is not so good and makes me want to put my old jim burton Strat into a p-bass.  The electronics on this guitar are good, i have the black one with the humbuckers and an alnico 2. The sound is good. The only negative thing that I noticed is that the wiring on this instrument is rather messy. So if you are planning on having any electronics
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a great little piece of kit. A great tool when you need one. The sound is nice for the price.   One thing, I do have to say that if you're going to do the whole thing, get the 2 in 1 version and not the 2 player version. You'll never be able to get the buttons in place for the 2 button mode.   of course you can change that, but the 2 players are a lot easier to use.  .  Click to expand...
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The T-3 has great features, and I can say that I have been happy with my purchase. I am using this for a light reading machine. I like that I can turn the volume off with my finger, and it allows me to use this while I sleep or while I am doing things like reading on the computer. I do love this book reader.  Rated 4 out of 5 by mike from It works, but... I'm very pleased with the T-2 book reader but I've got two complaints about this one: The light switches have very little resistance, which makes it difficult to switch from dim to bright, particularly while reading. There are also a number of the light switches that do not close properly. I wish there were some way to control the lights more securely. I also wish the touch pad buttons were a bit more sensitive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device over a year ago, and it still works perfectly. It is great for watching videos. I have had it on since I got it, it only gets better with use. It gets very hot, but that only occurs when I use it for a long time. I recommend this product. I think you can make it hotter, but it will make it much easier to see if you're reading something that is small. The battery also lasts very well, at around 4 to 5 hours. I am also pleased with how well this works with the original Apple USB charger.

The fact that it doesn't drain batteries is a huge plus, as I sometimes forget to charge it before using it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I purchased an apple watch as a backup to my ipad. This is a really nice watch and seems to be waterproof. I did have it on and off once when my iphone got lost but the battery just died. After searching and talking to others, I found out it had been the watch, not the phone. I bought an Apple watch 2 and had great success with that. I do recommend getting an original watch or replacement battery for it. ------------- A good addition to your electronics wardrobe: --------- When you buy these things it is pretty nice. But be aware that these do not have the power you get on your ipads, and the charger is different. It is pretty hard to turn on because it only has 4 buttons. The good thing is it is very durable. I've been using it for a couple of years and have had no problems at all. ------------ One of the best investments you can ever make for your electronics! ------------- Excellent. I would buy this again, if I could : ) ------------ If you have one of these and you are buying it for your daughter, then this is your thing. The ability to tell her where she is in time and she can control the watch. Very cool

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm not a huge fan of Apple products in general but the iPod has done me very well in terms of its sound quality and features.   Just wanted to share the good things about the iPod that I've found helpful on the way to becoming a better musician:   1. This is a very easy to use electronic device. Very nice and clear for recording/looping and playing live with the iPod.   in the past I found myself having to use my computer and computer cables, just to get audio.   the cable/cables I use:   the cables I use are not included in the package but you can get them at your local music store. the cable I use is the KORG Audio Connection Kit from a local store. The KOR GATE K1 is very good for a price point.  I did a little bit of research and found the Audio Connection K1 to be the best. I love the sound of this cable and have had nothing but success with it.   and the sound quality on the iPod is so good I feel like I'm sitting in front of my computer recording.  :)  2. It has a lot of memory. I use the iPod as a music player for my home theater system. I've even used it as a backup disk for my server, which has a hard drive. I also use it for recording vocals. So it is well suited for a home system.   on the road the iPod works well with my Mac. it's just an iPhone with all the apps I need to get my computer/software/software on it.  of course I use iMPG/iCd/iWidgets/etc as well so the music and video files all get on there too.    I also have my computer running with a laptop, that I use to play the iPod and also with my laptop to record and mix. the iPod gets the best signal out of the computer/laptop. The only drawback is that the computer is slower than it was a year ago, because I'm still learning to use it more efficiently.  The iPod also comes with a great set of "skills" like "scratch" which makes it easy to learn the songs. It can also be programmed to play songs based on a phrase you say, which is very useful. It even comes with an app called "Amp" that lets you turn your iPod into a speaker

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used this device for about 2 months on a 3 yr old HP desktop computer. I wanted a programmable keyboard so I was able to use my mouse and trackpad on the same screen. The key travel is excellent and I like the volume and function keys. My only complaint is that the battery life is poor. I had a 2 month old laptop with a better battery life and it still lasted much longer than this one. You can only charge the batteries in your computer, so make sure you have a dedicated power supply with a power port. This one needs a laptop charger. This is a good keyboard and I recommend it.

I've recently been running Arch Linux (http://www.archlinux.org/), and I'm looking for a good, stable and easy to use alternative to Ubuntu. I was wondering if there was any chance that I might find something to replace the optical drive on my current Arch install? I just bought a Toshiba portable hard drive, and I had it in the case of my laptop, but I wasn't going to buy it with the optical disk drive in it just for an Arch system. _____________________________________________________________ Hi there. I bought an Acer Aspire R7-380SE laptop a while back and I've been very pleased with it so far. I have not used it for any serious work yet (as my primary job is a freelance software developer) and I don't even have the optical CD drive yet. I would really appreciate some suggestions about how I can get the optical to work again on this laptop. The previous owner told me that there were a couple of reasons for this. One was that it's a pretty new laptop and that the optical drives were not working at the time of purchase. He also told me it was more difficult to get the CD-ROM driver installed because the optical was not plugged in at the same time as the CD drive. He said the DVD drive was working fine until it overheated the first time it was used. _______________________________ _________________ My main laptop, a Tosca Pro M58 (a very popular brand, and one that doesn't require a CD-Rom drive). It has a DVD, optical and CD-Drive slot. I am running Arch, and the optical is a problem. The optical drive doesn't work at all! I had the same problem with the Tosca. The laptop runs well on my old Dell Optiplex 730, but no CD, no DVD. The problem is that I have to manually plug the optical into the computer every time I want to use it. _______________________ __________________________________ I don'y own this laptop but i have one. It is a Tosatti S55. I had an Acer. My computer runs great on it. But now i have a Tosant I had on my first computer, my sister gave me her one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikone's x5s - I got the x5r (with the battery) to go with it. I have had it about a month now and love it!

And I love having a good quality phone for the office too. I would suggest that if you are in a pinch to get something for free that you get the xfone4.

I can't say enough great things about this device. I wouldn't even use it if it didn't have the ability to be connected to my laptop. I also like the way I can use my phone on the go without my computer in the way. Overall I give this product 5 stars, it has become my backup to my computer and my cell device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just installed my new KVM switch and I was very happy with the product and price I received it for free from a fellow that ordered it from you. I have a KVM and I found the price and installation time to be really good. I am also very pleased with the quality of the product. I hope that they make another model for my computer since I am sure I will purchase more. Thanks again. I just ordered this switch and had my friend pick out what I wanted. The switch has a lot of options and a lot to configure. The installation was easy and only took about 2 hours. After having used an old ATX switch for years I decided to try this switch. It was very easy to install. After hooking it up, it didn't matter what type of cable I used, this switch would just work. You can adjust the speed, set up the switch on your computer, and it just works. I can now hook this switch to my ATX PC in the basement and have my desktop in the main room. I also hooked it up to my old TV which I bought from the local big box store. It works great there. I really like the easy to use switch. Highly recommend this product. Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from Great switch. I used this switch in my living room which was connected to my TV. It came with all the cables you needed and was easy to hook up. When I started using it, it made my tv seem to be on, but the tv wasn't. It seemed like it was going to run and then suddenly stopped. I figured it was just the picture that wasn't going good. Then it seemed to work fine. I ended up having to re-install it because I couldn't get it to run. I thought I had messed up the install. I decided not to have any cable going to the TV (cable coming out of the switch) because that seemed to be the problem. I would recommend it to anyone.  Rated 1 out of5 by Anonymous from Very slow I purchased this switch on May 16, 2017. The night after I got it, I went to turn the TV on and the TV wouldn't turn on, even though I had the power cable plugged in, and the box was plugged in and plugged in. It also didn't turn off from the reset button. After researching the problem I found this website and wrote to them on May 21
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this as a personal remote control for a variety of equipment, including a small tv, remote control, and bluetooth phone. The feature set is limited to "record" and playback on two input channels. Unfortunately it also has no "playback on multiple" feature, so if you record on the one input, playback will be on the second input channel. This is a real pain when using it with a multi-input device like my bluetooth TV. It works really well as a backup remote, and it's not that heavy. I only have one complaint: the battery only lasts a few hours. It runs well for about 10 to 12 hours of recording. I have only been using this for a couple weeks and have already been running low on power. I will be purchasing another one.  Was this review helpful? Yes No  Posted By:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!This is the first time I have used this thing. I have a desktop PC that is still functional. I was having a tough time getting it to run properly. I got it in the mail just as I was about to head out. This thing was so easy to use I have been using it since I got my e-reader about a year ago. The software is simple and the display is amazing. I read through my books in about a day and a half on the book I read. The price and the quality are good and worth every penny. It comes with a small notebook and pen. The cover is great and has a large back pocket for storage and writing. It is so easy and fast to turn on and off the battery. It takes 2 batteries and a micro USB cord to get it going. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a very easy and portable device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  My Sony C3-A has been running since 2001.  It has done everything I have asked it to do over the years.  This will last as long as my old Panasonic DVD player.  I don't even need to worry about replacing the power supply every 5 years.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is the best gadget ever, if your on a tight budget but love your car's radio. My car's air bag has been fine on this and my car has a very weak FM radio but this works like a charm. It takes a little practice to get the hang of, but it really does. It's quiet and cool to listen to while sitting in the car. It gives me back my freedom of choice of how much of a hassle I want to get on my car. I highly recommend this gadget. I had no idea this even existed before I bought it and I would gladly pay extra for it again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A very nice product. The device does what it is supposed to do. You get a large selection of files with high quality sound. If you have a hard disk, you should get one. This one has a removable disk to hold more files. I love the new digital sound quality and the ease of use of the unit. It is a great purchase.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product I have a large collection of files, and this unit is great for a portable solution. I use it in a large room with lots of lights. It's a great solution.  The best. I had purchased a pair of these for my studio in 1997 for a small monthly fee. I never use them for any recording of music. I have about 30,000 audio files and I use them just for backup and to help me prepare the next day's work. The quality and flexibility of this unit exceed any other portable audio device that I have ever had the privilege of having. It has taken me two years to save up the $600 that I paid for the unit, and it's still going strong. You simply can't beat the sound, the price and the ability to be used as a backup machine. Just don't get one when your music is in the process of recording. It will waste your money.  I had bought two of these and never even had one fail, which is why I was so impressed with it and I purchased 2 more just for backups.  a really nice portable unit to have for backups  I am a musician and I would buy another.  for backup I use the iMac  This is my favorite portable music player for its flexibility, portability, sound quality, and ease of operation. The volume control is convenient because I can adjust it by hand or use the "adjust the volume" function on the device. The unit can also be used to record and then transfer those tracks to a hard drive. I can listen to the files on my computer with a hard drives connected, or I can plug the i-mac into the iRadio, turn it on, connect the hard drives and listen to it on the iTV. The built-in speakers are great and give the audio some oomph, even in my room with no AC or AC power. : I am a singer, guitarist, singer-songwriter, and producer.I use portable audio devices to record vocals, instruments, and
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!  I just got this and it's exactly what i wanted for my first DJI product. It was exactly what I ordered and i am very pleased. Its great for people with limited time on their hands. If you are looking for a little more speed then the quad copter would be great for you. Its a little heavy but its a small item and i don't think you will notice any difference. I would definately recommend this to someone who wants something that will get the job done with little to no time.  Good product, bad price:!!!  This is a great product! It's very lightweight, light, and maneuverable. You don't have to be a stunt pilot to fly this thing. It can be very easy to fly and you can fly it like you are riding a regular camera. I'd definitely recommend it for someone looking for something that is small and fast. I used to fly a DJI Phantom 3 Professional, but this is pretty close.  in my opinion, you get what you pay for!  great for first drone  this is a good device for first time drone users. it is not very powerful but its great for someone that is new to drone flying  So far, so good  In my first attempt to fly with a quadcopter, I can't believe that it was so easy to use. The quality is top notch, and the flight time is about 10 minutes. I will have to spend a little bit of time learning the flight parameters of my quad before flying it, but I expect to be able to learn it easily, and do my first flight in about an hour or so. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I'm still a noob. I was going to buy this a month ago.   I use it every day and it's the best. The best thing ever!!!  -Dale   My husband has been using this for many years, but it was only in this case that I realized how powerful it is. It's very clear and easy to use.  It is very simple to set up and uses very little power.  I only wish the batteries had a larger capacity so I could store more music. This way I can keep my iPod and my Walkman and never go out of battery power. I recommend this as a great addition to anyone's home. .  -Holly  Thanks to the iPod touch I'm a better music learner than before. I'm not using it for long periods like before. However it has definitely boosted my music knowledge  ...  .  in my books.  it's a great device and is very affordable. I hope my son will buy one too, as he wants a small digital device to play his music on, and for his homework.  on the other hand I think I may have to put my Walkmans in the junk heap, for more storage capacity.  of course I would have preferred more storage and more choices to select songs, but that's just me  on the other one this is a simple, clear way of looking for a replacement to your iPod, just buy this one, and I'm sure he'll appreciate the savings over having to pay thousands for a used one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had a hard time setting up my computer (with all the cables) without it being connected to a monitor, and then tried to set the video mode (which was already on) to one of the built-in modes and it didn't work. This thing is super easy to use. Very powerful and powerful fast processor. Very nice to read from it. I have a very small laptop (1.6in screen), but this one looks like a full size monitor. If you don't want to use it in your main computer, just add a monitor. I like to have multiple computers that I can use at once. I can watch movies in one, and play games on the other. I use this on my desk, and when I sit down, my computer is sitting in my lap. That is so cool! The review is on the "BX7"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased my iphone on the 16th of February and I have been using it since. Its super handy to have a device to play with, its super fast, its pretty and it's so much easier to control than my older iphones. It makes me forget the small things that are so frustrating with my old iphons. I am so happy with my purchase and I hope that they do not change the specs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like this. I have a Sony Vaio XZ1 which is a very nice device but not a perfect one. The sound is not very good. However, the speaker is very good, the audio is crisp and clear, and the video is good as well. I also like the backlight. It's a very good backlight and is a pleasure to use. I would recommend this to people who can afford it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from Great sound at an affordable price! It's really easy to set up, and I've got it set up on a Windows 10 computer now. I've also been using it on my iPad and my Apple TV. I love the fact that it has an aux jack and headphone jack. The audio on the audio interface is really good, and if you want more high quality, then get a sound card. I am impressed that this little device has 4 stereo sound sources and I can have a different audio source for each room. The quality of sound is really great. I just wish there was another way to turn the volume off. The only thing that doesn't quite work for me is the "auto turn off" feature on the remote. I'm not sure why you have to turn it off, but it just doesn't seem right. It does a good job of controlling the TV and the TV volume. It does a great job of the television volume control. In all, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this sound card for the Sony XZs series.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a nice product that does its job. I was disappointed when the battery died within a year. If the battery did work out there would be better battery replacements. If it's a low battery indicator it would be nice to have it go off when you plug in a new battery. All you have to do is touch the battery to see if it's about to die. That would save a ton of time and effort.  I love this battery. I use it to charge my iphone and to my e-cig. I am very happy with it and the great price  Great little battery, I have two of these, one is for my ipod and one for my ipad, both work well and are very powerful  One of the best batteries i ever had...great price and the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i don't like the way it looks. I have three other batteries of different colors and they look great.  at the price the batteries do last for years, i use one for a few weeks, it works fine, and i buy one for the other battery because i have 2, it will last at least 6 months.  and that is with me charging the batteries on a daily basis.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product is pretty much what you get with every new laptop computer. I like it for a couple of reasons. First, the screen is awesome. It's very bright, and I'm not sure if it's LED or LED LCD, but it's awesome. And the built-in speakers are loud, and they do a good job at producing a good sound. I think they are even better than my iBook's. The speakers are also adjustable, so you can get the sounds perfect for what you want. I am very pleased. The size is great, and it's light and sturdy. Plus, if you need to charge it, it comes with a mini charger. I've gotten so used to charging with the old-fashioned wall adapter, that this was a welcome surprise.   The only downside is the battery life is a bit weak. There is a lot of power in it, and if you don't play video games, it will last longer. However, I haven't noticed any degradation in video or audio quality. The only thing that I don't really like is the way it plugs in. It doesn't have a magnetic connector that I can easily stick a wire or adapter on, but you can't really put the laptop anywhere without it having to be unplugged and replugged.     You could get a better, more power-efficient laptop, but if you're just starting out in computer repair, I don,t think it's worth the money. If you want to buy a laptop and play games and watch movies, I'm sure you can find something better, but not when you're on a tight budget.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a big fan of the HP EliteBook 840 G2 and it's very impressive it can run Windows 10 with out issue. Its an amazing laptop for $1,049.99 it can replace my 15" HP Elitebook, the EliteBook 8570w and now I am considering the HP G2 Pro as my desktop replacement.   The thing that I would like to see on the HP, is a back light option. The back light that's on now, is really dim.   and the fact that this laptop comes with 1 year warranty, and the only thing that it got worse with it that's HP and I am not a big HP fan because their products are not as good as Dell. I do not know that the HP is worth it for me, but I will get one for sure and hope it gets better.  I will update this review when i get another one to compare.    If you want a laptop that is a high quality with a high specification and it comes with a warranty, but at a cheaper price, the HP should be in your list. 's review:   i have the HP ProBook 430 G1  which is also my main work laptop. It has a lot of features including the HP TouchPad which i like it alot. it has a very good display, great keyboard, and a nice and quiet sound. the main drawback of this laptop is that it is a little heavy for me. so for me it is still a good product.  the only down sides of this product are that: the battery only lasts for 3hrs when it is not in use and there is a hard to use usb port.  and one thing is that when the laptop is not used for a long period, the keyboard gets a little hot and that it's a little hard to type.     Overall i am very happy with my purchase and am still looking for a better product.   I recommend you to get one this year and for sure buy 2.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price i recomend this to anyone who is just getting into the hobby of electronics and the need to add/remove components at will. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that the unit can be very difficult to use. The power switch is very flimsy. I can't say I don't understand the logic behind it, but I know I could break it if i don't pay attention to it. I just bought another, which is supposed to be cheaper and more reliable.   I would definitely recommend this to someone who is in the process of doing the first project that will require the use of it's many features.  I also purchased the Bios Flush. .    - - - -  Was this review helpful to you?

I'd like to see this one on a Mac and not a Windows PC so it would be even easier to use for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________________________  It has been a month since I received this thing. The first time I used it, the first time it worked properly, it was a great deal. The second time, it did not work at all. I had to use my spare computer and a keyboard to get it to work. I would recommend this to people that like to listen to music and use internet. However, my main gripe about this is the price. At $89 (I got it on sale for $79) it is pretty expensive. I am very happy that I got it for the price that it is at, but the next time I would not buy it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________________________ This product does exactly what is says on the box and more. I bought this unit with the goal of adding a new set of buttons to my Arduino project (i.e. for a touch screen interface). With the Arduino IDE I can use these buttons with a USB cable and make a remote control. However, I wanted the buttons to work with the touch screen, so I had to build a custom case for my Arduino. The buttons fit great in the case. All I have to do now is program them and connect them to my phone. Thank you!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had my Fx3 for almost a year now. It has performed flawlessly, for me at least, with very little use. I use it on my computer as a stereo headphone output, and as a headphone recorder. The mic is very effective for capturing voices very well and recording drums very clearly. I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a quality portable headphone/mike.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this with an 8 bit audio interface and the software it comes with. This was a very good choice as the software is good and I had a few things to test out. I used it as a basic multitrack recording system and for the sound quality it was really good. I had some trouble getting some software to work with it. I think that they made a mistake by putting it in the box as it is not a standalone unit. After setting everything up I realized it would take more than 8bit to get that much of a sound out of it so I had to buy more software for it.   This thing is well built and very nice sounding. The only thing I did not like is how much it costs for what you get. I bought the interface and software for the price I paid. It's well worth the price but they should add a mic input or maybe the same price for an audio interface. This device should be priced more to be an affordable recording device for an intermediate musician.     The only complaint I have is that the sound only comes through once per track. I use 8bit Pro as my DAW and the sound is so great when you use it as you should be using it as your primary recording system. This is not good for a second interface that you might add after the first one is used. I wish the sound came through on every track. It would be nice if I could set this as a mixer or I could use this as my computer.  :)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my new sony p5. It is so easy to use. I will recommend to my friends I have had a Sony P5 for 5 years. It worked great with my cell phone and Sony camcorder. I was a bit hesitant to upgrade, but I have finally made it! I have two questions. 1) Will I still have to purchase a P5 remote. 2) What is the difference between the P5 and P1 remote. This is the only remote that works with all versions of the P4 and P5. The Sony P4/P5 remote and the SONY P1/P2 are very similar and use the same buttons for many functions. The SONY S-ON button that comes with the P1 and P2 remotes works with the Sony P3/P4 remotes as well. Sony S-OFF is for the Sony S3/4 and S-CON for the P3 and P4 remotemotes. The best way to see what remote you have is to press the button and it will display what buttons are being used for the device. The P3 remote is a small and compact remote. It has the P-ON, P-OFF, PEX, and P-CON buttons for the main functions. This is a great way to turn your P4 or P5 into a great remote for your camera. The only time that I think you will need to purchase an additional remote is if you have the P2. If the PEX or PEX+ remote is more to your liking, the SON button is available on the Pex remote for those that have the extra money. I'm happy that I have found the right remote and I'm excited to start using the new Sony P6. Read full review I am very pleased with my purchase of this remote. I use it on my P4s, P5, and the P6 as well as my P3. All of these remotes work fine and are easy to program. The buttons on the remote are responsive and are very easy to navigate. I would like to point out that I am using a Sony DSR-20 (which is an excellent remote, but it's very different from the Px3). You can also use this remote with any Sony digital camcorders. The remote on the DSR doesn't have the best buttons for all functions, but that's not the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am currently using this for a TV (as well as audio). This is the best remote that I have ever used. I like the fact that it has many different functions as well as the remote and buttons and how it is easy to use. The sound quality is excellent and I can connect many different sources to it (i.e. cable box and satellite). The only negative thing is that the screen doesn't always work the way it should. I tried everything to make it work and it is as good as when it came out in the store. However, when i am using my cable box (with HDCP), the TV is always black, and I always have to use the remote to adjust the volume. I am going to try some other companies and hope this one works, but this is a great product for the price. Also it comes with some extra cables.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my vp since last year but i love this little unit. I bought a ipod nano for my laptop and i needed to use the audio port of my vpad. I had this on the go. the wifi works perfectly with this little device. the camera works great as well. just wish the battery lasted longer. you will be pleased.  by: Mike - 01/28/2012  i have had my x5 for about 3 years and it is still going strong. the only problem with this unit is the battery life. if you are using the camera to record video and sound and the camera is turned on then it is good. but as soon as the camera or sound stops, the battery will die. i have 2x's in my home but if i ever have to go away to have to charge them, i want a backup. it is also hard to use if the battery is too low.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't know if anyone has tried the Triton, but I do and I'm very satisfied with it. It works very well. It's very easy to set up and has a very nice, clear sound and the buttons are easy to access. If you've already got a CD player, you can also play CDs with the Trito.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought the RMA from sony this past January and now the first thing I do every time I turn on my new unit is to check my local phone company to see if it is any cheaper. I have had the unit for less than a month and the price has dropped from $499 to only $399. I'm impressed.!!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ________  I'm not saying this is the best device out there, but I bought the first one and had a very good experience.  Pros:  Excellent sound quality  Great build quality  can't beat that for the price  Won't break down with constant use  Cons:  in the last month I've gotten so much more use out of my second one (not to say there aren't good things about the first)  Only issue I've had with this device so far has been the battery. It's a 1,200 mAh battery so it isnt exactly a big deal, but sometimes it does start to drain a bit quickly. So far its not a big problem, but not great either. I know most people like to have a little extra battery power, so if you're concerned that might be a problem with you I'd recommend getting a bigger battery. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********** I got this item for my son with special needs. He had a very severe speech delay and speech problems due to a stroke. It was very nice and easy to adjust to him and it's easy to speak to him with the speech aid. The fact that it has 3 settings (baby mode, adult mode and talking mode) is helpful as well. I was also happy that they included the speech-to-text mode, so you can get words and sentences by just looking at a word and saying it. Overall, great buy!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Biff from Excellent baby monitor I was really surprised at how great this baby monitor is. The voice guidance works great and the voice guidance is very specific for my daughter.  Review of XO 2 Baby Monitor I was looking for a device that I could use with my son. After searching the market, I saw this. The unit is very nice, and easy on the eye, and he says it works great. I don't have a lot of experience with baby monitors, and the one that we have, is a good one, and can be used for a lot longer. I would recommend this product to everyone.  to all of my family and friends who want to have a monitor for their child, I would like to say this is the best choice. If you want something that will save you alot of time and effort, then I would definitely recommend this. , I just wanted to say thank you for making this product. We have had it for over a year now and it has made so many things easier. My husband has an aphasia and he was able to talk to his child via the screen. It is very helpful when you need to know what was just said or heard. The child also can see their mom if they want. It's really helped us when we were trying to plan a trip. It helps us plan our day and I know my son has learned so many useful phrases he has to tell me while we are traveling. Thanks again for making a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The most amazing device ever made!  by Andrew M. on March 27, 2014   This little box is incredible. I got this to plug in to my computer, but then I got the idea of using it to control the lights from my house with a remote. I am hooked. Thanks Bowers & Wilkins. The only problem I have with this device is it's price. I was originally thinking about buying a B&W light switch for about $100, but they can sell this little thing for $199 with all the extra features, which I do like (as long as you have good speakers).   I am really impressed with this product. I recommend it to everyone.   Rating: [5 of 5 Stars!]  By Mike R. on January 14, 2014

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â A very nice set of speakers that I use with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. They sound amazing, the sound is clean and clear, and the overall sound quality is great.  Good product, needs to be better:  The product is great as is but if you were expecting a piece of art with this piece it is not quite there. It is a bit small for my ear. I am very impressed with the sound quality and performance, however, it does need to be an option to add a headphone jack so that one can use it in a quiet environment. The included cable has a really rough surface to it that will take some getting used to but it is very well constructed. Overall the product is very solid, the only thing I wish this product was is an option with a headphone port so I can hear the music while working at my desk. The sound quality has very good, there is no distortion and it is easy on the ears. I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently got this device for my wife. We had been waiting for a while for our cable to work. I finally bought one and was extremely pleased with the price and the ease of setup. The only thing I would have done differently was to get the adapter for my cable so I can watch tv in the same room as my wife while watching an episode of her favorite show.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of the e-cigarette really exceeds my expectations. I was skeptical about the eCigarette until I purchased it, after using it for a few days I've come to the conclusion that it's actually one of the safest and best options for a healthier and clean smoking experience, it does everything you could ever need to achieve that result and then some. The quality of these is second to none and I would recommend this to anyone who is a health conscious smoker, or just wants a healthier alternative to smoking.  4 out of 5 Nice little unit I'm pleased to have one of these to share with my buddy who's looking for a good all-around vaporizer. I do have two issues with the unit though: 1. It's hard to control the temperature, it heats up and cools down very fast. I have it set to 200 with a max temp of 210. 2. I'm really not a fan of the flavor. It doesn't really taste like anything I've ever tried. Overall, I'd recommend it. .  and there are lots more great reviews!  Customer Testimonials

I can now do everything I wanted to do with my old laptop. The only thing I can say is that I wish the screen wasn't as bright, the keyboard is a bit big for my taste (not my fault, though).

Yes No Monday, February 27, 2011  Very Good Computer  by Andrew from Ontario, CA USA  Pros: Fast & works well  Cons: No USB port  Review: Works just as advertised. I upgraded from a Dell laptop & it took some time to get used to the layout but it is simple to navigate. I like how I can customize the software. I have my windows desktop set up to have my program icons and icons for music.  Great product!  a plus  The only cons I have are that the usb port is only two ports (1.5 and a USB) and not the four that I wanted and that the USB port is on the bottom. I wish that it came with the USB version of Adobe software.  and the other thing I am trying to buy a replacement screen for.  to make this computer really work I would recommend you get a screen cover as well and that you get an additional USB to ethernet adapter.  is the same price as this computer. It is my 5th Mac, the only bad things is the keyboard does not come with it and the screen does not cover the bottom of the device so when the laptop does not stand up on it's own it falls over.  in the end I still like the price.  a big plus . ,  was this review helpful to you: Yes No Friday, February 23, 2011

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I use this at the computer for my son's math classes. He always gets frustrated with how the kids do not learn at the same rate as the other students in his class, so he tries to incorporate this device in class as a learning tool. My son is able to learn faster, and I feel like I am getting the best of both worlds. He will be very happy if I can keep it. Great product, I would buy again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is by far the best portable mp3 player I have used. It has a decent sound quality. I am a huge music lover and this has more than adequate playback capability and is the perfect device for taking the iPod or other mp3 players with me. I had a few problems getting it to work, but when I did it was flawless. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has the patience to learn it. I only have to update the software on my phone which is free and has a better device for playing music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She's very picky about toys. She has no patience with anything that won't move. This thing moved like nothing she's ever seen before. I didn't have to touch the buttons on the front to turn it on or off or turn it off. It just started up instantly and turned off when the box was closed. So far it's been about 2 weeks and my daughter loves it. It's perfect for my child to take on the road and she still has plenty of room to play with. It has everything she needs for a great first experience.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichthyol batteries I have been running these for a few weeks. They charge slowly, but that's ok. I use them to power a computer and my cell phone. I've always wanted a cheap electronic device that didn't require you to plug it in and leave it charging all day. It's a huge help with the battery. Also, it's easy to switch out batteries in an emergency.  Excellent Price on Electronics Bought this in response to the cheap plastic cases that my wife used to have on her Apple laptop. Now, I just plug it into my phone to use it as a Bluetooth keyboard. I have purchased all the Apple electronic items and have yet to find any that I don't like. Thanks  Great value for money!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ This device has been amazing. It has worked flawlessly for the past two years, and I've never had any problems with it. It is so quiet and has saved my family from the annoyance of listening to my neighbors and neighbors who have cats. I recommend this to anyone.  Noise is great __________ I'm not really sure why some people are complaining about the noise, it's a very slight hum and if you are in a large room like a living room you wont really hear it. When I use the headphone I can barely hear the noise of my neighbor's tv and computer speaker but this is just a slight distraction for me. I have never had problems with interference from this device. I've been using it for many years and it's just worked. If you are sensitive to noise I would say this is a good solution. ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first digital device. I used to play with my old VCR's. I did it once but just couldn't stand the noise. I wanted to be able to use this device without hearing the noise, I just couldn.t. It's not loud but it is loud enough. I like it and I will keep it.  Rated 3 out of 5 by James from It was ok, but a couple things I didn't like. I just bought it to have a backup video player, but I wanted something that didn't look like it's from a $200 video rental store. So I had to take the thing apart to get the guts out. So there are little pieces that are not easily separated, and they tend to be all in the same place. One thing that I would like to see is a way to eject the batteries. They're very difficult to get out.  and it was too loud. I had one issue with the camera, I can see it's the light and sound sensor. I would not recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This product is fantastic. The only problem I had was getting the usb plug to work. It's a standard usb plug so I thought I would just buy the proper one. But they had to reorder it because it was never there in the first place. Then I had to find a different plug for the back. They were nice enough to make a little USB plug of my own. The sound quality is so much better than the stock speakers. I didn't expect much but for $150 you would expect a better sound quality. It took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to make it work with the stock amp and speakers. It also doesn't use battery power like the stock model. My son has already bought one so now he has the best sound system. I will never buy another sound system again!  Was this review helpful? YesNo  9 of 9 people found this review constructive

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i bought this keyboard because i use it as a second keyboard and it's not the biggest but it fits my hands perfectly, its not that heavy and it feels solid and works great with my macbook pro.   the one negative is that the keyboard can't fit both my mac and my windows pc side by side, but if you hold the mac like it's an i pad (with its keyboard in your hands) then you should be good to go.   is it worth it? well it's a cheap keyboard and theres nothing really special about it but it's got a lot of features, and it does the job well for the price  i'm very happy with my purchase. i also got an eurorack module for it.  I had a few questions and it answered all of them. Thank you guys  The product itself was excellent and shipped quickly, The only drawback is the fact that the battery doesn't last very long, you will want to charge it at least every 2 weeks.  (it's like buying a pair of sneakers with a broken running shoe)  It's a very nice looking keyboard and i'm very pleased with it. I had to order a bit later than anticipated (in order to get the eurorback module).  If you are a Windows PC user who's tired of the keyboads you have to have on your Windows laptop, this one is a must-have, and I highly recommend it.  -John  Love this Keyboard i bought this for my MacBook Pro and it works great for that machine  Nice keyboard, good price.  and the mouse works great  This keyboard is great! The only con I could think of is that it doesn't have the most premium materials, but the price is good and it should last.  at this price range it should get 5 stars for me.  .   I'm a Mac user who has to use the mouse for a lot, and having the option of not having to use it all the time is a great thing. I don't use my laptop for gaming, but I really do use it for everything! I would definitely recommend it to any Mac user!  Great keyboard and mouse but... My wife asked me to buy her a computer so we can use our Macs.    I bought this keybord for my computer and as I said in my other review...I don
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A very nice looking device that was easy to use, the only thing I wish was a better battery life. Also had an issue where the battery was loose but the instructions said to give it back to the service department, I took it back and had them send me a new one. Also the batteries were cheap as it was the last time I used them so there was a little bit of capacity left, it's not worth it. All in all good product. I would highly recommend the X1 to anyone who wants a decent small tablet.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, October 08, 2010  Good price and very good product  by Mark from San Jose CA USA  Pros: Compact and good display  Cons: No case  Review: Purchased the X-100 and used it while traveling as an in-flight laptop computer. It has been working flawlessly for me in an economy class plane, so I'd recommend it to anyone. The battery is a little on the low side for this application (2 hrs 10 mins on my battery), but I expect it to last a few more trips before I need to recharge. I think it will be more useful for traveling at lower altitudes in economy, with the larger battery (and maybe the case) since the battery life is a bit slower than on a larger tablet. It is fairly heavy for a 10" tablet, but in my case I really like having something to hold while I read, watch, or work on my laptop.  the only con I have is that there is no case. I was happy to find a case in the US Airline section of my local electronics store. The X-101 has a hard case, but it is a very light and thin one. 'slight and thin' is very generous, as it can be easily seen when closed. It will fit a 10.5" laptop with no problem, but the width may be too small if you are a tall man. I am 5'8", but there is quite a bit of space to squeeze in there.  to be perfectly fair, the battery capacity is a great 10" of power, and the display is good enough to use with it. -  It is nice to have it in the bag so I can take it with me when I go somewhere, but I wish it came with a case. A good deal of money for the display,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great portable recorder. The ability to get it into my car and back is very convenient for me as I work from home. My only wish is that it had built in microphone for better voice recording!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ---------------  This is the first battery to do it for me. It fits in the back of my phone and charge from any port, even a USB port. It gives enough power to my phone without changing the battery on my other phone, it is small enough to fit in the pocket or bag without having to carry the phone around. If you are a gamer this is perfect, and if you are trying to save money on an iPhone and still need a battery. This is the perfect solution.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is incredible.  You have the ability to be very involved in the story and really follow it through to the end.  It's a very good plot to follow through to.  I really loved this book.   The characters were also pretty well done, they are believable.  They were likeable.  The main character even had a few cute moments which I really liked.  Overall, a great read.  4.0 stars
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________ I bought this because of the nice reviews on youtube about this app and the price is really good! The best thing about this is that it's not just for the PC, you can use it on Mac and even tablet with the iPad and Android. I also purchased this to use with my old Nintendo Wii, it was easy to install the software on my computer, I just needed to download it through the wiimote website and then copy the.apk file onto my new Wii (this was easy for me as my computer was running Windows 7). I use it in my TV while watching TV shows and movies (all of my Wii games have a web browser, this app allows you to browse the Internet from your Wii console. I haven't had a problem with the internet as of yet). Overall this is a really good app for the Wii!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The XB3 is great! I like how there is no moving parts. My only problem is that the battery life is a bit shorter than I would have liked. I have had to put a lot of drain and charge cycles on it, and I really wish I bought the 12V charger. However, my XB2 lasted a long time without a problem. I was worried about it, but it's great if you just want to get it done. For all the money, I think I would save a little money and get an XB1."   Review by John of Wisconsin  I wanted an Apple smart device and looked at a lot before I settled on the XB. I had some problems with the X, but when I got the X the battery would not work. I called Apple and after a couple weeks the new X worked fine, I was happy. I am going to upgrade to the latest model when I get my money back from Apple, I am not going to buy the newer model now because of the battery issue.  Review of XB-3 Model: XB10K  "I purchased my first Apple iPhone in 2008, and have always loved its features and the user friendly interface. I upgraded my X and took on my mission to be the best user of my X. For me, this means finding apps and software for my iPhone that work well with all of my other hardware.  I like the intuitive user interface and the ability to search for apps and get more information about them from the Home Screen. I've also enjoyed all the apps that I have been able to add to my X- I think the software selection is the best I have ever had, especially with the iPhone 5.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the Zyxel ZX3 over a year ago to replace my old computer that died. I found out that the old computer was very powerful, but also very slow. I had a friend build a computer for me to replace it. I also had to get the RAM and hard drive. I wanted something that would be able to handle the high resolutions and fast hard drives. The ZX2 gave me everything I needed, and more. It is great. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device and its shortcomings:   I bought this over a decade ago. The product worked fine at the time. It has a nice size. I loved how easy the controls were and I just couldn't find the buttons I needed. I bought another one a year later and it did not work as well. I was able to add extra RAM and I could get better performance. I wish they would make this one out of metal to save cost. Also, I wish that it could be adjusted with buttons or keys to make the computer more comfortable to use. I just got another one about a year after that and it works well. Why would you buy this:  The Zyxels are really great and work like a dream. The price is just right, the product is well-built, and the customer service is superb. Review Details:  I used the ZX4 over Christmas break of 2012. I replaced my  4 year old computer with a ZX7 (I am using a Zaxxel Zax3. The zax3 doesn't do the thing that the zx7 does well, I just need that extra power and extra RAM). I did not realize that the Zax7 didn't have a USB ports, so I used the cable from my zaxx to get it up and running. I used some cheap flash cards to give me another 100 megabytes. I tried a few games and they were all very buggy and difficult to run. I did play some of my older games on my xtend for about 15 minutes and when I played one game, the game crashed in less than 2 minutes. I looked for other solutions but was unable to find anything that I thought would work (but it worked for a while, it is possible to install windows on a Zx7 using the usb cable, it does not boot directly into windows). So I decided that I could not afford to spend the money

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ik-gene-sensor-plus-mini-pc. I was looking for an alternative to the IK-Gene-sensors (great for monitoring) for those who want a mini PC with everything they need. I love having the ability to see temperature and voltage in my house, and the LED lights are great to watch them. Great job. You did a great job.  Reviewed by: Eric L. from New Orleans, LA. - 2/24/2013 5 / 5 I was extremely pleased with this item. I installed it on my door after having a door latch that had a small hole punched in it and that could only be opened with an 8mm or a 6mm key. I used the same keys to get it open. I needed a small LED light and the miniPC gave me exactly what I needed. The LED light is bright and very visible even under thick sheets of plywood and even in my dark garage. The box it came in was a nice addition as well. Great product!  Rated 4 out of 5 by BOB from The package was very well put together and packaged. The mini pc arrived without the case. I found out that the plastic cover was not the one that came with it. It was a different cover. Very disappointed that this was the case the product came in. However, I took it and added the case to my package and it works fine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just purchased the new Sony SmartWatch 3 this month, and I must say, i am completely satisfied with it. The price was very good, and the features are very nice.   The only thing I would like to see is a small battery charger. I was able to watch my YouTube videos on it for about 2 hours and it was a real hassle when it was running low. It's like my batteries run out very quickly.  . I also purchased the Smartphone app that's built in. It works very well with my iPhone. I like it because it has the option of viewing my Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and E-Mail as well as Google Maps. All of them are great for showing me the location I am at.   this is a great product and I would recommend it to others.   that's the end of my review, for now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this gadget!! The price was very fair and the battery lasts longer than any battery I have found. I will buy again when I need another battery. I have only two complaints and they are minor : - The cord is not braided. I would have thought that would make a difference. - There are no tools in the package to change the setting on the screen. I don't care if this is an issue with my unit it would have been nice to have the adjustment tool. - The buttons on the side are a little difficult to press. I know it's possible to press them but the button placement could be improved.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The device is small, small compared to a phone, but the design is perfect. It has all the functions you need and nothing you don't, but it's big enough that I don't use it every day.  Positive reviews: ************ I bought a samsung galaxy s3 with a micro usb cable and the moto nxt was perfect. The phone charges in about 5 minutes and I have no issues with the battery.  the phone also has a micro sd card slot that makes it ideal for my ipod and it can be plugged in and charge the ipod.  a few things that I like about the phone. the volume control works great the speaker is great and the phone charges fast it does have a few bugs. The wifi isn't too fast the mic doesn't work great but I have a sound bar and it's still better  The battery life is good I get 3 days of battery. You can see it if you check the battery life on your phone. I use it a lot. It does a good job of keeping my phone charged. It is light but I do use it all the time so I don' need it to be heavy.  at this price it was a good buy I would recomend this phone  I like the phone The phone works great, just like it should, a little battery in the back makes it slightly harder to use for some, but that could be because of the battery compartment being too small for it to charge, no one has had a problem with that, I think the battery is probably good for 1-2 days of use at this rate, I would recommend it, it is small and easy to use, the sound bar is also nice,  great buy, but.... ******** I bought the samsung s3 mini 2 and it has a really good camera, good speakers and everything else that it has, but if you take any of the apps on your s3, which are the ones that you use every day, then it will NOT WORK.  for example you can't download, view or upload files from the web page, you can only download files from your computer or a file manager that's built into your phone, no app store, no music player, nothing, you have to download a program to view all of your files, then you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I own 2 of these units. They are excellent and are very accurate. I have bought a second one to replace one that died and I'll keep buying more as they last a very long time. I wish they had more settings in addition to 5. However, you can program these things to do everything and do it very well. I would definitely buy one of these again. The only thing I do not like is the battery life. It seems like they make the batteries last forever. I can barely get 2 hours out of one battery, and I have several batteries in the unit. -------------- next part --------------  Identifier C2M3e7x00d2 Identifier-ark ark:/13960/t7wq4t2q Location Central Illinois Run time 7 years, 11 months Copyright-evidence Evidence reported by scanner-ian-scan-1112182052 Copyright-region US Identifier c2m3e0x00dh2 Scanner internet Scanningcenter uoft Year 2008

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this keyboard since December 2006. it is the best i have ever owned ive used a dvorak, dvorach and pinyin layout. i have to say the qwerty keyboard is absolutely the best. ive had it since i was 10. i use it to type out all my email. iving been typing on the qwertty keyboard since it came out. it allows me to do so much more than i could do with my old dvor. ives been working on computer and other computers for years. the most important thing about the qwd is the price. ive got mine for 5 bucks and i have been typing for the last 6 months for my whole company. ively done for you to say a keyboard was great. my computer is on 8mbps, and i can get about 3 or 4 messages a minute. i will say i use a wireless keyboard for this to type on. ived never had a wireless model before. i used the keyboard that came with my computer. i love it. im buying another for my home. i want one for my laptop too. iven your input on this i will order a second for my next computer. thanks. _________________________________________________________ (11/27/2011)  Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (06/29/2011):  I was looking for a new keyboard for a long time. I got it a year ago, and was very happy with it. I was so amazed to find the price on ebay going down with each new keyboard I purchased. Well, I was looking at this keyboard, and I realized, this is a perfect replacement for the old keyboard I had on my computer since before it was a Windows machine. I use this keyboard all the time, it is so good that I even used my old one for the first time in a month, and this keyboard didn't lose anything in terms of function. I have a very small keyboard, so I wanted a size that would accommodate my fingers, which this keyboard does. My husband and I have been using it for a while now, and it is very comfortable. I will definitely recommend it, to anybody who needs a new computer keyboard. ______________________________________________________________________________________ (01/29) , by A Reviewer from West Jordan, UT USA I love this keyboard! It is exactly as described in the other reviews. I also think it fits perfectly
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have always been a fan of the iPod and this one is as good as ever. I have also played a number of CD's and am now using the iPhone's and a lot of these work really well. I recommend these for the money.  The best portable digital music player on the market: I have a number one and now a 3rd for Apple's iPod Touch. These are not just portable but the best. The sound quality is amazing. The size is perfect and it comes with all the functions you need. The only thing missing is an LCD screen but I am sure that will come with a new model in the future.  and so are: the best of portable digital audio players  I got mine at a great deal at Best Buy and I've been enjoying it for about two months now. I was very skeptical about a portable digital player but am glad I purchased it. I've had the player a couple weeks and it's performing just as I expected. I haven't had any problems with it so far, although the device does not come with an AC adapter and that's a bummer. Overall I am happy with my purchase and will continue to use it as my primary device. I would absolutely recommend this product. I own a second Apple iPod Touch and I found this to be the best portable player for my purposes. It has just the right features for a portable player.  for my purpose  great for the price The player does what I need it to do for the average user. I don't use it that often, but when I do, it's amazing how much better it sounds. The design of the player is great. You can hold the player in any position to the ear and it still plays beautifully.  is great for the job for the casual music user I use this player for watching YouTube videos and some other stuff. Its amazing how fast this thing goes. I really like the built in speaker system. I can't recommend this enough.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had a bad experience with this product. After I bought it, I noticed that the buttons and controls had a slight plastic feel. This was very unappealing. After a few weeks of using it, and a few more when I put the speakers together, I figured out that the speakers were not working properly. I fixed it with a little bit of heat and pressure. Unfortunately, the buttons were still making the sound louder and more distorted, and the microphone was no longer working properly when the buttons weren't pressed. I had to return the product. I would not recommend this product for anyone to purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It took the pain of having a flat tire. I've had a few flat tires before but was usually able to fix them without having to pull over. I'm a bit of a computer geek, and I'm looking for a portable way to access my digital library and a bit more of a music system.  I'm happy to report that this is the perfect way to do it.  The Sound:    This thing is a beast.  It has plenty of power to crank up the volume.   A built in aux input lets you plug in headphones to get some of the best stereo sound I've heard.  I've used it to watch videos, listen to music and even to listen to my computer on the go.  The sound quality is pretty good, though it does have some distortion.  One small but annoying problem is that the volume control goes from low to high pretty quickly.  This means that you'll often have to raise the volume on the remote to get everything at full volume. The Size:  It's smaller than most portable players and does not feel very heavy at all.  For the price, it is a great value.  While I prefer to be able to access music via a mobile device, I can't go a day without my smartphone.  As a result, I am not able to really use this device all that often and only have it around when I am going on vacation.  In summary, it's a solid portable player.

It has some nice rubber diodes under the arrow keys for the arrow speed mode. The keys have a little clicky feel and have no mushy feel like a lot of other keyboards. There is a nice weight to it and it feels really solid. It can be very loud at a high volume. I am very impressed and will never go back to my mechanical keyboard.  to top

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikomotox   What it is: ikep-05b is the new model of the IKEP-05a, which is designed for home use and is designed to be used without any kind of power adapter. It comes with a USB cable and power adaptor. It has a built-in speaker, mic, and digital audio input. It works with my iGrill i3 and my eGrill 2, and I'm sure it would work with any other grilling grill.  What works: ika's excellent build quality is apparent, especially in its quality of materials, and it's ease of use. ike's included power supply is very powerful, and its ability to be switched on and off makes the device an easy choice to have. ika also includes a standard-sized USB to UART cable for all my cooking needs. The grill itself is small and thin, and you don't need to worry about it taking up a lot of space in your kitchen. In fact, ike is such a compact device that I found it very easy to transport around my kitchen.  The only thing I did not like about ike was the size of its USB cable, which can be inconvenient when I'm using it in my car, for example. It also made me wonder if ike would work in an RV. As far as its performance, I've used it for a week in the kitchen and it has performed exceptionally well. ikomi's grill is easy to assemble and use and it comes with some really helpful instructions. My only minor complaint is that ike only comes with one USB port, and the other port can't be used to power the device when you plug it in. This was a bit of a letdown, but it's possible to change the USB cable to allow you to use the second port for powering the device, so you'll just have to learn to use it on the fly. At $70, IKEp-06 is $20 more expensive than ike, but the advantages ike has over ike are its smaller size, ease of assembly, and more USB ports. IKE p-06 What this product is not: imee

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the third time I purchased the Alesis Ipad Mini. First one arrived very fast. This is a great little little device. I use it when I am playing guitar at home and when I travel. The best part about this is that you have no need to worry about batteries. I have used the battery and usb cable for years without any problem. My only complaint is that I wish the iPad Mini came with a microphone so I can use it to capture the sound of my guitar.   I have been a long time user of a Zoom G2 and the quality and convenience are unmatched. However, I wanted a smaller, less intrusive device that could still provide all the functions I needed.  . I can't find any reason to use an iPad without an amp. And since I don't use my iPad in public (it's a car) I didn't want to invest in one. The AlesIS device is perfect for me. I don`t feel like having to put on my headphones when I drive my car.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the keyboard for the amount of travel it provides. I have not tried the mouse as yet, but it seems to have the same travel. I don't use it all the time, but my only complaint is that the touchpad has a tendency to stick to the bottom edge of the screen when it has a lot of weight on it. Write a negative review about an average electronic device :  The touchpad is really good, but I do wish it had more travel. 1 out of 1 people found this helpful

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This item is very well built and well designed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is building a new computer or just getting a new PC for their office. If you use a desktop pc for your office and are looking for the best performance and features from a monitor for that purpose then this is the monitor to get.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Best monitor I have purchased for my laptop PC. Very good, very easy to use, I am very happy  From the description it is easy to set up. The features are great. , so I bought this for my computer workstation. I wanted to have the best monitor in the office. For some reason the price wasn't as good as others online but if you have an extra set of eyes or a set of hands, this monitor is a no brainer to get, buy it. I will buy this model again  We bought this monitor because we wanted to put one in the car to monitor the interior of our new truck. It worked great and looked great in the truck. We are now putting one in our new house with other new equipment to monitor our kids activities and entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive just started to use this gadget and i love it, it is so much faster then using my keyboard, it even does all of my work easier.  I got this to get away from the keyboard I was using and with the keyboard out of commission for two months, the keyboard back up feature in Windows 8 was the only option to keep my work up and running. I had to take my PC with me on road trips and i had to keep all of the work on the computer. Not to mention I would often spend long periods working on the keyboard and the keyboard would stop working when my PC went away on a road trip.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am so thankful for this device, and have saved hundreds of bucks on my cell phone. I was really reluctant to buy the iPhone because I was afraid of Apple software, but this thing worked great right out of the box. I have a very small tablet, so that was a bit of a problem for me. However, the speed of the wifi works great for me, and my iPad screen is also much sharper. Thank you for making an affordable option to be a more mobile and easy to carry. I will be a repeat customer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Excellent product, I would recommend to my friend and everyone  I used this device for two years now and it works very good and is working at its best now.  The only thing that i would do better is a bluetooth headset with a mic which would fit better to use with the device.  it is very nice and easy to use.   A++ Excellent product  This works great! I use it for a business and I am very impressed with its performance and price. The only downside is that it seems like it is always overheating.  -The only con is the only thing I would change it for is a wireless one that has a mic. The one that I have has a headset, and I use that with it. The reason I like the one with the mic so much is because it has a built in mic.   The good thing is that you have to download the software to download your settings from the cloud. , I use this device to connect to the internet and use my computer, I can't find a blu ray player that supports blu ray play so I bought this because it comes with it but I would love a bluray player for this device it would be very handy.  of the software that comes with this device that allows you to download settings from your device and save them. I would still buy this product even if the software was not included. The wireless blu ray works great and I don't want to use my cable that comes out with my PC and the blu ray has the blu rays. The blu ray that came with the tablet worked for awhile but then one day the blurays stops working, now I have to buy another blu ray for my PC just to use blu ray. . A++  Pros: Works great, great picture quality, good speaker, built-in mic.  I would not recommend the bluetooth connection, it is too noisy, not always stable, sometimes the connections fail after a while.   Cons: I don`t recommend using the microphone. It is not very good quality, doesn`t always stay connected, is not the best for chatting.  -The only negative is the fact that it is so loud, it disturbs the sleeping of my 3 year old. He has to use a sound machine in order to sleep. I would have preferred to be able to connect a blu-ray player but it is nice to have a blu rays to

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was a little skeptical about buying this, but was pleasantly surprised by it. I have 2 of the 3 i ordered, one for myself and one for my wife. The device worked just as it should on our wireless internet connection, but there was a slight delay in the audio, which was also noticeable during video. The screen is very clear, and I find that I have to use the speakerphone on the phone more to enjoy the sound. It is an overall good purchase.    Was this review helpful to you? Yes No  (5 /5) 80%  Great buy!

My only complaint is that the quality of the speakers are way down compared to the sony, but i'm a new player in this game.  I'm not sure why you would need a bluetooth speaker though. It would be just fine. .  it is also nice that it has 2 ports. Was this review useful to you in any way? YesNo  3 of 3 people found this review constructive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* I just received my new HID lamp, and it is beautiful. It's not bulky, and is very easy to use. It is powered by 1 x AA battery, and comes with 3 connectors (3.3mm to female adapter, and a 3.5mm female to male). I really like this device. It fits nicely into my space, and works as advertised.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for about 2 months now, and im extremely pleased with it, the sound quality is very good, very clear and not muffled, the ability to choose presets is awesome, and the presets are very useful. its very convenient that the settings can be saved, i also wish that the battery could last longer, but i love it! the only con i can think of is that there are times when the device will start up and stop, the device keeps getting warm after this, but this is not a big issue, i would only buy this device again and again!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iced coffee maker I have purchased this coffee maker twice, I really like it and use it everyday. I think the reason I am giving this 5 stars is the fact that I am very happy with the fact you can choose to have it set for 4.5, 5 or 6 cups. The only reason I gave the 4.8 stars is because of the lack of cup holders. The design is a bit too small to make cups and if the cup is too small then you will have to have someone else make you a cup every few seconds. I have tried multiple cups in both plastic and metal cups and they are fine but for a cup holder this is not good enough. I am not sure if I should change it because I have to change out the batteries every couple of months, but I just have to live with it so I try to make it work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this monitor as an anniversary gift from my sister, and the picture quality is just amazing. I also have a samsung monitor, and this is a far better resolution and overall quality. It is so easy to take notes on the screen, and very accurate. I have used it several times and it has held up. Great monitor but with some limitations (for me) Review by Matt Quality Value For the price it was hard to find a better monitor. I've only had it a week but the first thing I did was install VESA mounts to the side to mount it right next to my old monitor. It has a lot more space and I can use a couple of different applications for the most part. For me though it's not enough because I don't want to have to go back and forth between these two monitors. My problem is the mouse button. I like the clicky buttons. I want to use them but when I open a spreadsheet that requires you to scroll and move it down I find myself having to press down the button. The buttons also take a long time to press. The only way to get around this is to either use my mouse with the mouse pad or get a wireless mouse. The monitor is also very big. It's not much bigger than my old 1080p monitor, but there's no real difference. This is one amazing monitor Review by Chris Quality Value I got this as a gift for Christmas. I was not disappointed, it is a great monitor. A few issues are that the monitor is only on by using an HDMI cable, which is a little annoying as I wanted the ability to plug in a mouse. This is a nice little thing, but for $200 I think I could have bought an AOC. I wish the software was available to switch between inputs. The other thing that makes this monitor is that it is the only monitor with HDMI output. It makes for a nice setup with the PS3 if you want to connect the monitor to your television. Overall I think this is an amazing monitor for the price. Not bad for a gaming monitor. Review by jim Quality Value Pros: Cons: -------------- Picture quality: I am not a gamer and I haven't tried this out myself, but I am impressed with the picture. The image is sharp and clear. You get a lot of colors and some detail in some areas. There is a difference in brightness of some textures and shadows. For the average user,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  As with any new gadget the first couple of uses are the most crucial and this is so with the  X-Bass. As with all  laptop speakers the ips and pops are more apparent and I feel that the icesound software (as I described above) is what is making it so pleasant to the ear. As I use these on my desktop I was a little surprised to hear the audio come through so well at the laptop speaker. I would recommend  this to anyone who wants a really good sounding laptop speaker! The best thing that I can say about this is that it's actually better than the iphone one (and yes, i have used both). It's also a little more expensive. I was really hesitant to buy this one. I just don't have a laptop with a decent laptop speaker and I wanted something to listen to music on my iphones and I was on a budget (I'm a software engineer, don't want to buy a ton of audio gear). However this one is the perfect iphony!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great electronic device for recording audio. I have 2 of these now with a Sony TC-X100 recorder. Very easy to use and it can record almost anything.   I use it with my Canon G5, and it works great on that camera too.  .   a good, inexpensive recorder/recorder   If you are going to buy this product and you're only going to use it to record audio, then buy a professional recorder. If you are a hobbyist, and you plan on using it for everything but recording audio, go for this. The quality of this recorder is great, with excellent high quality audio, no compression, and the features it provides to record both audio and video, such as timer, and a microphone input, make it worth purchasing. The only thing I would like to see is that they made a recorder that was like this in the late 90s and the early 2000s, and I believe the quality to be excellent. Also, if you're wondering why it's such a great recorder, you should realize that it will take any kind of analog or digital source, and turn it into a high quality digital file.   on the plus side, there is not much to get in the way of the audio quality, and its easy to set up. The two settings to change is to slow down/speed up the audio during recording, or speed it up/down as well. The recorder can record audio at either 24-96 or 24-176. I would recommend this recorder to anyone looking for a great alternative to the expensive professional recorders, the Sony TC100 and Rode Podcaster, and others.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is my first digital audio recorder and I'm so pleased. I'm going to use it every time I go on a trip. The quality of the recording is so good that it is almost as if you could actually hear it happening on the other end of the telephone. So much easier to take notes than with paper notes and it is great for taking notes on long car trips. I bought two of these in different colours so I can see exactly which one is my favorite. They are very easy to use, very secure and very durable. They will definitely stay in use for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I was just looking for a small portable amplifier I could use to play my music at a bar or concert and I couldn't find anything. Well I just bought this last month and it is FANTASTIC. The quality of this is outstanding for the price! You won't be disappointed!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Michael from Great product, I have a few. This item is well made, it is the one I have used most often. I have had to replace a couple of the knobs in the past year so the rubber cover on the back is now gone. The knobs themselves are durable enough to take a beating. I've had mine a year and I haven't had to put it down for more than a day. It is quite versatile. I use it for my ipod and my mobile phone. There is no need for an additional audio output.  From: Mike S. from Austin, TX.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got it I was excited to see all the good reviews for it. I used it to test the latest 4K video format on my laptop. The resolution is a lot better than 1080P. I think the HD support is a good idea. The only problem is that you don't have access to the settings, you have to dig out a USB cable and go to the menus and change the aspect ratio for yourself.   It works fine for me, but I wouldn't want to use it in any other situation. It's a decent device, but there is a better and much more powerful one that costs less.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is very good, it just doesn't sound as good as some other devices, the bass and low end is a little dull and harsh.  Write a negative review about an evil gadget:    I just received the X1 Carbon, and I couldn't be happier, it's a very well built, very fast, easy to use, very well balanced device and the sound is excellent. I have a pair of the XM1's, and the X8's are more bass-oriented, but I prefer the X4's for gaming, they have great sound quality and are super fast. I don't use it for a lot of music and movies, but for gaming I can't think of a better device. . I also purchased a couple of the FiiO B1's and I have no complaints, they are very good for an entry level DAC. So far the only thing that really bugs me about the X5 is the sound quality, it was supposed to be a very good device, and in many ways it is. The bass is very balanced and has a good amount of rumble. It's easy to get your head around. For gaming I would probably recommend the X2, but the X7's sound quality is way better for games. It is a shame though that the X3 is a terrible device and won't be replaced soon.

The top shelves are well organized and the other shelves are just left to their own devices. It is very versatile and I find myself using it more and more.  Review of DJG from Great for my garage! I had a lot of stuff piled in my garage so I needed to keep it organized and IKEAHolic solved the problem. I was able to easily move everything from my bedside tables to the front of the car when I don't need anything, as well as getting a nice little space for books and other things, and it holds it all securely. I like that it does not have the large knob on the bottom which can be easily lost if it gets moved or bumped, and the two handles are easy to grip. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first device, it works perfectly, only one minor annoyance is the battery life. When I get on a plane I like to use the internet for a few hours, and then go to bed at a decent hour to avoid jetlag and fatigue. I got it in the morning so it's pretty dead by dinner time. The phone calls are great though. This is my second Apple product, the first was an iPhone 3G which I really enjoyed, so I'm not surprised I liked this one, it's similar but better. I'm going to be buying a 4G LTE iPhone (it's coming soon) and this will make it a good deal more than just a smart phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this in my car for a Bluetooth radio/speaker that I have.

The remote has an easy to reach input and it is very easy to use. The speakers are very clear and crisp. I can also easily stream music from my phone. I will continue to buy this product and I recommend it to anyone who wants a simple, inexpensive bluetooth speaker/radio!

The color is very close to what I wanted and the sound is better than I had expected. This is a very small and lightweight device that does everything I need it to do. I listen to music through it all the time, and it has always done a great job. The only drawback is that it's very hard to keep clean, but it gets clean eventually.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- A great piece of electronic history. It took me years to get the original in a good working condition, and I had to go through some pretty serious struggles before I had the guts to repair it. I'm glad I finally did!   The most impressive feature of the original is the battery, which is an original NOS Lithium-Ion Battery which has never been charged. The internal workings of the unit are completely identical to the original but have been re-designed to suit the needs of a small electronic gadget.   I'm not entirely sure if it will last more than a few years, but the best is yet to come with this little machine. This unit is also fairly inexpensive, with the original price about US$1,500.00 and with the replacement at about US $2,000.00. I think it would be very difficult to get this unit into a store for less than the original. It's a bit of a "wow" item to behold!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a fantastic addition to my toolbox. It makes quick work of the 3 bolts that hold my 12v to 4v converter in my old Honda. I have a different one but with this one you can use both converters. I am going to get 2 more for all my cars, it makes all my tools so much more convenient.   I have been very happy with this item. I love the simple layout and I can use this with my old ratchet and my hand tool. The only problem is that the tool is just a bit too big for my hand but that has been corrected with an aftermarket adapter.  great product, just got this yesterday! Very easy to use, fits great on a ratchet, perfect for adjusting my air compressor. , great product, Just got this last night. Very simple to use. Easy to use in the rain too! Just needed the wrench for the air pressure sensor. All good.  be sure to adjust your air pressure gauge. It has to be accurate to be used properly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this monitor, which was designed to be used as an extra monitor, for my son's 13" laptop, which I bought second hand.  The display is really easy to operate, as it's easy to flip through windows when you need them.    The resolution is actually 1080p at the highest supported resolution and the display is of decent quality.  I have to say the price has gone up and with the price increase has gone the quality of the unit.  The monitor is very small.  It takes two cables to set up the monitor as an additional monitor.  As a whole, I am quite pleased with this purchase.  It's hard to explain the concept of a 3D monitor.   It's quite confusing for the first time user but once they get used to it, it's really nice.  If you're looking for a 3d monitor, look no further as they all look good, the color saturation is amazing and most of the monitors have a very good picture quality.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound was really good! It is so loud that you have to raise your volume to hear it. There is a feature called "Sound Lock" which lets you control the volume. I like that. The volume of the bass and treble is good. I used the bass boost to raise the volume of my favorite song that I love - Radiohead's OK Computer. It worked well. It was not a perfect solution because I had to go into the settings to get the bass up. My favorite part of this DAC is the interface. It is really nice! I think the way it works is really useful. The interface has a 2 input section that works really great. The main inputs let you select music files and convert them. The other inputs are USB-inputs. You can use the two inputs for a CD player, a portable media player, etc. It has a CD input as well. Also, it has a digital-to-analog converter so you can directly connect your portable music player to it. It also has a power jack. The only downside is that it does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, so the audio from the portable media players is not amplified. The headphones can be connected using the mini jack. That's not a big deal, it is just a little inconvenient because you have all of your headphones with you, and the USB jack can only support one set of headphones.

My first use was to replace a cracked screen and the first time I used it was to watch the new season of the series "Breaking Bad". The screen was still cracked at that time. I used this device to watch my movies and the only problem I had was to adjust the volume control to the max. The best feature of this device is that it has a rechargeable battery. With the new screen I am very pleased to say it has no problems and now can watch all of my movies in HD without any problems. This is now the only device i use for my movies. I am now looking to buy a replacement for my previous device. Thanks!!!!!!!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------ I am very pleased with my purchase and it does exactly what I wanted it to do. I'm a fan of these type of devices because I can run them off a computer monitor as well as a TV. I can also use them as remote controllers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This unit does everything I want it to do. I bought this because of the reviews on the X7 and was very pleased with it. It is a lot more convenient to use and easier to setup than the original X7 that I had. I use it to control a few lights in my garage and work space. It does a great job of controlling my garage lights. I have only been using this for a few days and have already made some new friends. I will say that the battery life is pretty horrible when running on a USB. It has to charge every hour or two, so that you don't end up wasting battery life while trying to use the computer. I haven't had any issues with the display or touch panel. Good product: The unit does what I need it to, very simple to use. I love having a USB port at my desk to make backups, etc.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I have been using an old Macbook Pro with an external monitor and an external keyboard and mouse for the last 8 years or so. When I started, I didn't really use external monitors or keyboards and mouse because of the way they worked on the computer. You have to connect the monitor and keyboard to the computer via USB and that is a pain. You need to plug the keyboard and monitor into the computer and then turn the computer on and off, and then it goes into the OS X boot mode. The problem with this method is that when you start the computer, you have to keep the keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected, so that you have access to the OS. This has to be done every time you want to use the computer so it's always on. The main problem is that it's annoying, especially since the monitor needs to be plugged into the Mac in order to function. Then when you're working, you just can't use the keyboard or mouse for anything but scrolling down webpages. This all goes away with the iMac Pro. You can now use the mouse with the keyboard. The keyboard is also backlit which is great since the mouse is always on in this mode. It makes working with the computer much easier. You'll notice that the keyboard is quite a bit larger. This is to fit into the space between the keyboard dock and the screen, as I said, but since the screen is so small, there is a big space in the middle of the keyboard that you can easily fit the i Mac inside. Plus, you can see all the keys in the dark and it's much easier to see. So I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________  I used this device for about a year for all my cell phone calls, but in the last month or two it has not been able to make a single call, I can't get the phone to make any calls, no texts no anything. It's really a waste of money for something that is almost useless. It makes phone calls very quiet but it is almost worthless if you can't make a call or have a good call set up. I am hoping that I am wrong and they are working on the problem
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like this little thing.  It makes a great low-power, very small digital signal generator (SDR).  You can control it with an external software program.    I also like that this is a very inexpensive device.  A couple of other reviews were saying that it was $50, but yours is $10. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is wonderful.  I am using it to record my guitar playing for my album and I am very pleased with the sound.  I get the best results from it and it seems that the quality of the recording is better than the original recording.  It is small and I just feel it is well worth the price. Overall, I think it was a good purchase for my purposes.   The unit is very well built and I think its going to last.  The instructions were simple and easy to follow.  A great product! I'd recommend this item to a friend:  I'm really happy with this.  This is an awesome little machine.  Just plug it in and play.  And its small.  As well, the sound quality is so great.  With just a little EQ I can get some awesome effects.  My main use for it now is my band and I want to make sure that it can record the sound so that when we play live I will be able to record it to a CD. I bought this because I want a decent portable recorder.  You will get great audio. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The light is nice and bright, it is super quiet, has a good beam pattern and the beam is very even and wide. The color is really good too. I am very impressed and I think I will use this light for many years to come. I also love the compact size. I love the fact that it is the only one in it's class.  Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device (lights or batteries):  I tried this light, first I did it for about a week to see how the light would perform and was pretty impressed. I read online reviews saying it was only bright, and I wasn't disappointed with the light as it was bright. So, I decided to test it out a little longer. The first few times I had the light on, I would have to turn it down before the light went out, and that was a problem. I then decided to just use it during the day. About the time I was finishing up a 2 hr job and my daughter asked me for a book, the light shut off. I was really confused so I read some reviews on how to get it to come back on. I found one thing, the power switch needs to be turned on, if you turn it off it will keep turning off every 20 seconds. I tried it off, on, off, then on and still the light was on. But after a while I noticed I couldn't even see the light. I thought I should get a refund, but after looking at the battery, it looked like it was a low discharge, so I returned it for a refund. After I returned the light to the store it still wouldn't come on. They told me that the battery needed to be recharged and that it would be back on when I did. So I did and the light is still not working.    The flashlight is very bright but not too bright. The flashlight has two modes, one is off and the other is high, but I found it is better for indoor use, it has a wider beam and more evenly distributed light. The one downside I had with the flashlight is that it uses the same batteries as my flashlight but a different color (yellow) it is not the same colors as the flashlight.   Overall I think this flashlight is ok but I am not a huge fan of using the same battery and the battery has low voltage warnings, the battery is a low discharges, I found the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using this for a couple of weeks. It works really well. I'm using a Canon EOS-M, a 24-105 f/4L IS, and an EF 85mm f/1.4 L Macro. The L macro is used to get close to plants and insects (I've gotten close enough to pick a butterfly off of a plant. The macro image quality is pretty good for a zoom lens. The 85 L IS is an excellent lens with excellent performance, especially when using the macro mode. The build quality is great and the AF is fast. The images I've captured with the EOS have been good. The only drawback I have found is that the autofocus may take several seconds to lock on to the subject. This is only a problem with some of the images I have taken with it. There is no AF delay when using a slower lens. In my opinion, it has worked very well.  Also, the autostereoscopic capabilities of this lens are awesome! I think I will be purchasing the AF-S version when the time comes.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using this for awhile. I purchased it as a way to make my iphone more portable while still having the music in it. I can carry it in my bag for trips and it can play all of my music with ease. I do not know if i will purchase the digital version, but i have the 3rd party one and it does not work as well. I would recommend this product to a friend. This iphones earbuds is a great iphony. I have it for several years now. I use them in my car and in the car or at home on my headphones. The earbud is great. The sound quality is just right. If you are looking for great earbuddy in a compact size, look no further, these iphonies are it. The best earbibbs i've ever owned. There's not a whole lot to say about this. This is one of those earbuddys that I bought mainly because of it's portableness and ease of use, and it has worked out great! The one big con is it's plastic, but it does provide protection from scratches. I don't use them very often, but they do hold a charge very long! For an earbod, I'm quite impressed This earbob is great for carrying and I love how portable the unit is. I really love having this earbuzz in my possession. It's great for traveling and on the go. Awesome earbabe This is probably my favorite earbab I have ever bought, i have a lot of them. They are super portable and do a great job. I recommend them to anyone. I love the ability to carry and listen in my purse, the noise isolation helps me to relax and take in the music. A great earphones that will last for many years! I can't say enough about my new iphono headphones! They are very good and I recommend iphonocaps.com to anybody looking for good earphones! I bought these headphones because I had been looking for an earphone that would not break the bank and would allow me to listen to music on the road. The comfort is great, and the sound quality was excellent. I would recommend them!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just received my unit and have used it for the first time and I am so happy with it. The sound quality is superb, as good as some full size stereo speakers, the unit feels solid and there is plenty of volume and bass. It is a great way to listen to your digital music. It also has a USB port which means that it will be easy to transfer your music from your iPod/iPhone to it. It's also fairly easy to charge the unit as well and I don't think you would be missing much by having a portable charger like this. You do need to be careful when charging as the battery will easily die if it is not given sufficient charge. But overall it is a very nice device.  A really good portable stereo. By R.D. from Canada I'm a professional sound engineer, and this little thing has really revolutionized my work-life. I had heard some rave reviews about it, but never had a chance to try it out until recently. So far, I love it! It's easy to set up, and with an iPhone 5, its very easy to listen through the headphones. I'm still looking for my next portable audio device, but I've found my new portable stereo!  Very impressed! By Michael S. from Atlanta, GA I bought this set about a month ago and was so impressed by the sound quality and versatility that it got my highest rating on my iPhone 5 review! I was so pleased I went and bought another set for my wife for Christmas! The quality, sound and versatility are all top notch and well worth the cost. Great purchase. , I used my new soundcard in my wife's old iPod Mini-Player, so the sound was perfect for listening to music. This set has a great sound quality, great soundstage, and a great portable nature. My only complaint is the batteries get pretty low within about 20 hours of use, but that is a function of the sound card. For a portable stereo, this is an excellent product.  (iPad 5 and iPhone 5/4S) The iPod version also works very well as a background player, it's only a bit too small to really listen to music without headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this to replace a broken iPhone 4 and was delighted with the ease of use. I have a few books that I'm working on and this is ideal. The phone looks great, and the case is well made. I was a little concerned that the charging would get hot quickly but it is very quiet. There are a few issues: (1) the speakers are very poor for loud music. The audio quality is mediocre. However, for podcasts and some audio books I can get on the web, it works perfectly. (2) I have two chargers and the second one is not included. I bought one for my car but I was hoping for a second one to use at home to charge my phone when I'm not in the car. This is disappointing, especially for the price of the phone. I'm sure they can come up with something to solve this. (3) I had to order a second charger to be able to use it as an external charger. I think that's a little strange that you have to purchase a second chargers. Perhaps they could bundle the phone with a USB cable so that the phone could work in both directions. Overall, it's a good product and I am happy to have it. I don't have any issues with it and I'll be recommending it to others.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The TRS-80 Model I is the only computer I've owned that is as good as the Model 1. It has so many features that the Model I has but the Model 2 has. The Model II was good, the Model III was better, and the Model IV was the best computer ever made. I love the Model V and use it in the garage but haven't touched it since I got my Model I.   The Model I was made in California and I haven't heard of any of the other versions being made. So that's a positive.   the Model VI is the best that we will ever have.   he Model VX has a few problems but I have had none since I bought mine. The only problems I have are that the original keyboard has no anti-ghosting, so any letters that are typed will be typed twice. But with practice, these problems aren't really a problem. I find this model is easier to use because it's easier to type letters without hitting the home key to change to the function key.   I don't know how they were able to make a Model VI with such a small keyboard but the VX is perfect. You will be happy with it.  -Kirk   I recently purchased my TRS 80 Model I and have been very pleased with the computer. I found the price on the Model II TRS was about double that of the Model X, so I went for the Model 3 and have had no problem with any other version. I have a number of games, both text based and graphics based, from the 1980's.   of the three versions, the most impressive to me is the 486.

Now the adapter is also made to go between the stereo, so you can use it on your computer as well, and even on a iPod/iPhone, that is pretty neat!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great sound! I have had this one for a month now and it is the best portable music player I've ever had. The headphones are very nice and the battery charge will last a month if not more. I don't have a car or a phone with a charger or the battery life might be a little more because I don' t have a charger for it but for listening to music for hours it's good. If you like a little portable it's worth buying!  Rated 5 out of 5 by TheWarpedOne from Super-light and light for my needs! I've only been using it for a couple weeks, but the first day I listened to a lot of music on it, it was impossible to use my phone or music player for anything else. I couldn't get the phone to take a picture with the shutter button because it would not hold it, and the music player only played audio. I think the size and light weight are a big plus! ,  Great sound, I think, for a price you cannot beat it! I thought my old Sony HXA1s for $20 was the best sound system out there...but then I saw this...it really blew me away, the sound quality is just the best I've heard! It's definitely the right sound for the price (and the small size too).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________  I purchased this for my wife and I in our garage. It is great for storing information. Our kids used to just go through the pages with their fingers. After the first time using this, I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. My wife was really unhappy with the design. She kept wanting to look around on the table, not sure why. After a couple of months, we have switched back to the old model. ____________________________________  This is a terrific piece of kit. I have two of these in the garage and use them in our shop. I put the printer on the floor and use it as a desktop. It saves time. The one major problem is that it has a tiny battery so don't use the "charge" feature for too long. It will blow the batteries out. ____________________ .  The first thing I noticed about the printer was that it's really big. At around 4' x 6' it's a little too big to use on a desk. But as you can see by my comments below, it works well. The second thing I found is that the printer is built pretty solid. It takes a good amount of pressure to print with it and it takes more than that to blow the motors out of the spool. I was impressed at the quality of the printer. It really seems to work well.   .   I use it to print out a list every afternoon at work. When I start printing a page with it I do a "check and print" operation. If there are mistakes I make them immediately with a piece of paper. I love it because it's small, I don't have to put my hand in the way when printing and it's easy to wipe up after it's printed.    I bought this printer as a replacement for my Prusa i3 and I love the ease of using it. It has some quirks I will be working to iron out and in the meantime I can make nice things. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this mp3 player for a few months now, and it is just as advertised. very nice for a first timer, i like the sound quality, the buttons feel nice, it charges the sd card easily, and the sound is excellent. and the usb port is great, i love using this in the car with my ipod and it charge the ipod as well, so no problem there for me. ive also used it as a portable player at home, so it does a great job of not messing with my car stereo. so if your just starting out in electronic music, i highly recommend this device. ives had it on a 4 hour flight and it still played without any problem.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! The best of the best!!!!!!!!! The battery lasts a lot of hours and the power is a lot on demand!!!!!!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Thelma from Great Features with Great Price! These batteries can be a bit tricky, as you can't put them in the socket as they come in. You have to either push them through a small hole into the top of the device or put them between the battery slots on the board in order for them to work. The good: - The built in charging circuit makes for a very long run time. I only get about 3 hours from a full charge. - The battery also has a nice solid feel to it. It doesn't slip around on the plug like some batteries do. I do wish the power button was a little bit bigger, as it's not easy to press down on it. Also, the power switch is a little hard to find in the dark, which is the only bad part about this product. The bad: - There's not enough light to find the battery button, so you have to look under the case for it. Not very hard to locate in the dimly lit case, but still a little awkward when you need to pull out the plug. - Sometimes the battery gets a little warm, making the battery look a little "dirty." That's not a big deal, it's the first thing that comes to mind when you look at your battery. But it could be annoying. - They sometimes don't have a charge indicator on the screen when the unit is being used. If it's plugged into an outlet, you might have to open the power connector to check it. - When charging over a long period of time, the battery will not last very long. I've tried to charge for at least 30 minutes, sometimes up to a couple of hours. The bottom line: the battery can last a lot longer, and is more convenient than buying a separate charger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________ _________________________________________________ I was surprised to find a quality, inexpensive remote control with an external control pad. I had one of these on my older CRT TV and it really worked well. I found that with an optical cable, it was possible to set it up so that you could control the TV from the remote. I used to have a VCR and this was really helpful. I was amazed at how well the VCR functioned with this. I've since bought another one for another television and I can't wait to get a better remote for it. I will use this remote and control pad for years to come. _________________________________________________________ __________________________________ A bit of history of these: -------------------------- ------------------------- --------------------------- ------------------------ It is not clear how this particular VCR worked but it seems that it had some sort of a video processor. You could select an input from a menu but other than that, there was no way to select an output. It was also a rather large box so it was a bit difficult to use. It also had a very high resolution, perhaps as high as 16 bits per pixel. It would have been great if this were a little smaller but that might have been my only complaint. The output was just barely enough to drive a normal TV. ------------ ------------ ----------------------------- VCR A review: -------------- -------------- I purchased this VCR in the late 1970s from a company in Chicago that was producing a new line of VCRs, the JVC-VCR, which had been launched the year before and had a small screen. The new unit had a different name, the VTR and was advertised as the "all new" model. It used an interesting technology called "digital" rather than "phono". I was quite excited to try this new technology but unfortunately, it did not last long. I started it off as a "video recorders". I would have loved to have found a way to use it as a normal VCR. It did not seem to be able to display a single channel, the other end was connected to a reel of videotape and the VTVR was recorded on the other side. I did have some luck with an old TV I bought from a garage sale that had a single audio channel. But I quickly figured out how to convert it to an audio cassette and it worked well enough. I didn't see a way around using an external cassette recorder and then converting

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is my third purchase of these. I love my iphone. The iphones screen is awesome and is always on. The new one is much better and the battery life is about the same. I was looking for an iphon and found one and I love it, I can download more movies or games. I want to buy an ipod but it was so expensive and I think my wife has them also. The only thing is that the battery on the iphonen has gone down to a 4 and the ipod has a 5, so I can't take advantage of that anymore. The iPad is better and cheaper. My son has an iPad and I'm trying to get him a iphoni.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- If it's possible I love this thing and use it all the time, I don't use it every day though but when I do I like to make up for lost time. The light is great but there are two issues, it is so bright that it blinds and also it's hard to operate the buttons. Also, the battery last me only 3-4 days at a time. I think the first issue is because it's a small device and I can't see over my hand for much longer, the second issue is that I use the same button to click the light up and down a lot. You should add an on/off button that is larger in size or maybe have a slide out menu to select mode, for example, "on" mode, "off" mode.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was so pleased to have found this item because I have been trying to find the perfect electronic speaker in my new Yamaha S800. The quality, sound and price are great and it really does sound fantastic.   So what I like the most about this unit is the simplicity of getting it set up for my music. You simply place the speaker on the stand and connect the cables. It's that simple!   The sound quality is very nice as well. I have a Yamaha S300 and this unit makes it look and sound as good as the new one.     Also if you don't want to use the remote, you don.t have to. It really is just a simple cable that goes into your computer to control it. It just adds a few more steps to the setup process but not so much that I will ever regret it!   the best part about this speaker is that you can connect it to a television with the HDMI cable or you can plug it into the computer through the USB cable and you have it right there. It even works with the Sony Blu-Ray player   Another great feature is the ability to play your music through your TV to a set of speakers. You don't need the speakers, just a screen.   in my opinion, I don't have to use it very often. My new S800 is on its way and I think I'm going to use this for the next month before I buy a new one!   to the manufacturer's credit, they are not pushy about their warranty. I was told by one of their techs that the product was shipped on the same day as the order was placed and that there were no problems or problems with it. I just wanted to let you know that was the case and that I did not have any problems with this unit. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!  The S-Flex USB 2.0 Flash Drive is the best flash drive you can buy! This was my first flash drive. I have been using the S-Flash for years. The quality is top notch. You will not be disappointed. The price is well worth it. I would recommend the S Flex USB to anyone that buys a flash drive for their personal use.  I bought this to put on a laptop. I was concerned that the usb drive would not fit. So I bought the 3.5 inch version. It was too small to fit in my laptop. , it is very reliable and very well made. The drive does take a little while to write so get it in early in the morning. The drives are really small (about the size of a credit card). I used the drive with an external hard drive (with a 3.77in hard drive) and with a laptop (with the USB2.0 version). I couldn't be happier. The USB drive does not take up the entire external drive bay like the previous one did. It does take up less space than the flash drives I had before but you may still want to use a hard drive if you want to keep your data on your computer. It is nice to not have to have the external hard drives attached anymore.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the first version, the battery lasted only about an hour, then the power light on the unit began flickering, even with the fan on full. My only concern is that there is a lot of "grubbing" on the sides when using this unit in high temp situations. I can't remember what the power settings are or how to make them more aggressive in low temp environments, but it doesn't do a good job in my opinion.   If you use this for the low temp environment you will be happy. But if you need high temp performance, you need something a bit more reliable.

The buttons are easy to use.  a couple of items that would be nice to see is some way of displaying the volume control and a way to see which game is playing. Also, I was told by a friend of mine that you should get the monitor, but I haven't found one at any of the local stores so far  Is this review helpful? Yes Yes Friday, October 07, 2007  i like it  By rick from tucson AZ USA  a  great  and nice to have  I bought it to use in my classroom. I am very pleased with it. I had purchased a second monitor from another company and had to return that monitor to the store because of the terrible picture quality. The picture is perfect on this monitor. It is a lot quieter than the other monitor I had, and the screen is much bigger. The video display has 4 color levels and a brightness control and has several picture adjustments. I have used it for several hours per day for a few weeks. I love it. The only downside I have is that it takes a long time to get the system going, even though the computer comes with a cable for an AC adapter.  of course it was much cheaper on ebay.  as for the sound card, i am a little bit disappointed because i had no idea how much the sound was going to be worth and its not very loud. the audio that comes on the TV is a bit like that of the sound on the sound bar that came with my computer. i hope they fix the sound in the new version of the system. this monitor looks really nice and seems like it is going to last me a long long time. i am very satisfied and hope to see the system
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this device to control my digital camera using a wireless remote. I wanted to be able to control it through my computer without the computer using a wired connection to my camera. I did some research and found that it works, but there are a few limitations. I found that in order to get the wireless remote functionality, I had to buy a device called "The RaspBerry Pi Zero". Unfortunately, it did not work as well as I expected. While it was working perfectly with my camera, it also had problems with my iPhone. The software on the phone was still showing the same picture as I had in my camera and not changing it to fit my iPhone's screen. This was even more problematic if the screen was turned off. The device was even unable to switch from the video mode to the still mode. This device is a great addition for some users, but I would not recommend it for a novice who is looking for a wireless control device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product about a year ago. I am a very active member of the ham community and my main radio is an external USB that is in a radio shack for "use" by the community.  My problem is the radio is not powerful enough to drive all the stuff i run from this computer and i have to buy the big external external computer and usb and set it up.  When i got it I was excited.  Then I got it home and connected it to a computer in my ham shack.  The computer is only capable of running one application and the audio quality is really poor.  But this computer is well built and the power is nice.  This will probably work fine for a little time but i would not buy another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I've had this little device for over a month now, and am extremely happy with it. Â It's a super-cool way to get that perfect sound, with a super nice volume.  It's also a cool portable speaker, especially if you're just going to be in the car or out and about.  I purchased the Sennheiser e15 for my wife who recently moved to a different state and I live about 60 miles from our home in Michigan.  I originally was going to get a car speaker for my Jeep but found out that Sennhesier had just released their new e15.    I love the product and I am excited to purchase one for my jeep.  It's awesome to have a nice speaker with no wires running to my car!   My only issue is that it's only 10 watts, which isn't too bad for an in car/phone speaker.  If the price were around $40, I would definitely consider it. I have the e15 in my car and it's just like a phone speaker, only better!  It has the best volume I've ever heard, and a clear, accurate sound.  The only thing I would say is, that it seems like a little more work to get the speaker to work right, as the wires are all the way on the back.  But if you like the sound of your phone/mp3 player, and you want the convenience of not having to pull out wires for it to be on/off, this would be the perfect addition.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikdawg   This is the first e-reader I've ever bought. The Kindle has always worked for me. But the new Kindle Touch was a bit more difficult to use with the larger screen than the original. I had problems finding the page I wanted on the page. This problem has been solved by the touch screen. The ability to quickly access to the menus is very convenient, as well as the ability to use it while sitting on a bus or the sidewalk, which is a plus. The battery life is also impressive, especially for the size of the device. It lasts about 4 hours in my case. And it is very easy to replace the batteries. I would have given it 5 stars but the reader does come with a small antenna that could catch the signals from a cell phone. In case you are in a crowded place you may want to keep it away from your phone, if you're concerned with phone reception. If you just want to read a book, the new touch screen is wonderful.

I also find that it is very durable and its battery will last for a good while.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It is an amazing product and a very powerful one at that. My two best mates (who use it and I) can use it to play the drums while we are on the go without any loss of sound or the need for a laptop.  It has a decent amount of features that I am quite impressed with. One of the best things about the T-60 is the fact that it does not have a lot of extra features that come with other keyboards, like a laptop or a tablet or something like that. I've already found ways to use the T60 to perform all sorts of functions on the internet. If you are looking for a good keyboard that you don't have to think about, the T6-T60 is a great option.    The ONLY negative comment I have about this keyboard is the battery life. On my T6 it takes approximately a day to fully charge, and that is with use over the course of 4 days. My T60 however takes only a couple hours to charge, so that would be an improvement.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this since last summer. I was really pleased with how small and simple it was. The unit was easy to set up, and works very well. I've never been so impressed with an electronic device that is designed with kids in mind. The built in screen is clear and bright, the controls are easy to use and the battery life is a very nice feature. I am impressed with how easy it is to read text and watch videos at the same time.  I've had it set up for two years now, and I'm very happy with it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the touch screen on my iphone. I bought this device to replace my old iphones and am very pleased with it. My kids love it. I have a 10 year old and a 9 year old. They both like to watch movies on this device as well. This device works very well. It is very easy to use. It's easy to install. The screen is very bright and the movies are very clear. It charges quickly. I am very satisfied with this device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this device as a tool for my hobby work and it really helped. There is no other way but to connect it to a PC, and then to a USB hub. You need to take care when you plug the charger in. The charger does not make a noise when it is connected. Then the whole thing will not work at all. This should not be a problem as long as it is not connected when you turn off the PC, but in case you have any problem, you need to disconnect it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The M3 is a pretty decent device, it can't match up to a full size TV or monitor but it is better than a compact set or laptop, it's the perfect size for on the go use.  Also, I love that this has a built in remote with a headphone jack and microphone, very handy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my pc2 pro for 5 years now. it works fine. my only real problem is the power cable. but that can be fixed. im a gamer who uses a pc. but i am now using my pc 2 pro for watching tv. i have no problems at all with the pc2. its has the latest video cards that are very fast. a lot faster than my computer monitor. i would have given 5 stars but the power cord i bought came too short. so i had to buy a new one. but im not too disappointed. if you have a pc 2 you can buy a replacement power cable that's 3 feet long. and you can keep the power supply in the pc. i dont think the pc 2 is the worst thing ive bought.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for a battery powered clock that would last the day but not a battery. I went to amazon and saw this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first product I got from the Kobo. I had been reading books from my computer with a blu-ray and I wanted to read books on the go. This was so handy I bought two more!  3 stars because: I have not had this device for long, but I already like it. The software is easy to set up, the interface is easy, the quality is acceptable, and the user interface is good. I use this for both reading and writing.  5 stars because I have had this product and am very happy with it: The software seems to have the same issues that the KU-8 did - but this is my second device. The interface is much more responsive than the Kugo, so I can use it for writing. It has more than enough storage for my books (more than 4 times as much as the KUGo).  Overall I am happy with the device. I hope it lasts. Best eBook Reader  for the money.  I have a Dell Inspiron 1555 laptop with a Kobo Aura H2O. This device is a complete steal for the price.  It is a nice, heavy, well built device.  The best thing is that it was a great deal on Amazon.  I will be buying more in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item to replace my aging iPhone because I am very much annoyed with the phone now, and I had been looking for a solution to that since I started using it around 2011. The first thing I like about the Mocap Touch and iPhone is that they do not have the buttons on the iPhone. It feels much more natural with a good phone and this is a very good product. I find it more natural, and that's important to me because I have a bad habit of using my phone to look at pictures all the time without using my voice at all. When I listen to music, I don't have to think about using my iPhone to get the sound. The Mocaps touch does a great job for that. It is definitely worth buying and using because it is a nice improvement over using a normal phone.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using the Sigelei S-C1a for the last 2 years or so, and it's been absolutely the best piece of gear I have owned. I'm very picky with how I use my audio equipment, and I like to get my sound from the speakers first and then I'll listen to my music off a computer or CD player. With the S-c1a I can get my music directly from the sound card, and the bass from the Sonexis is absolutely wonderful. My only issue was that I bought the Sennheiser HD 600 (which is a superior product for me), and it sounded like crap to me. I still have the S1xis, but now I'm using the HD 600 at home, and its the perfect pairing. The Sonexi's are simply the best portable system out there. I also got this pair for my friend in Japan, who was having a hard time hearing the music on his computer. I put this system in her desk, and she was immediately able to hear the music. You should also know that the Sceeli is a very good sounding headphone, and they are built VERY well. If you are looking for a portable system that will let you hear your music without being muffled, you will not be disappointed.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this device because my son wanted to play computer games with me.  He has never played on a computer before but wanted to.   He had never used a computer keyboard before so i thought that would be easier for him to learn.  The computer key presses felt comfortable and it felt like it was giving him the same feedback as a real keyboard.  It has a big LCD screen and it is large.  I have been wanting a game console so this is a perfect device for my son.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The Sony CXA18650C 18650 is a perfect 18650 cell for anyone who is looking for a quality 18650 at a great price. I'm very happy with this battery, it has lasted for me a year in the field. I recommend this battery to anyone who wants an 18650 with a good price. --------------  Good battery and great service by Mike - May 20, 2014:  I was looking to replace my original Sony 16700 battery for my SONY 18650 camera and when I tried the one I had the first thought to go with the CX18650. After reading all the good reviews, I decided to try it and couldn't be more happy. It took about 2 weeks to receive it and I couldn't wait to get it out and into the field to test it. The only negative I can think of is that I wish the package wasn't so big, but that's a minor complaint. -------------  Great Battery! by Kevin - July 21, 2013:  the batteries I use for my digital camera and camera in my cell phone are all CX batteries. i got this one because of the great reviews and the great prices for this size battery. i ordered it and its in the box right now.  It seems to me that there is a bit more care in the manufacturing of these smaller 18650 batteries which is a plus. I will not buy this size and only get smaller CX packs from now on.  at this time it would be great to be able to charge the battery on a regular outlet.  "Rated 3 out of 5 stars" is not a rating as many reviewers are not given a rating, so it means you have a lot to say about the product. I have been using this battery for over a year now and still it still keeps my camera powered up. I use a couple of 18650's a week and these last way longer than any of them. These batteries are a must for the new 18650 digital camera owner. I was also pleased with the price. it is a lot cheaper than other stores with these smaller batteries  -----  Awesome battery by mary l - August 29, 2013  My sony camera has had this battery since its inception. I still haven't replaced it. It is a fantastic battery that has a lot of power. It also does not drain my power bank so it's great. I also like that I can charge

I bought it after much research and am extremely pleased with the fact that it is a very compact and compact computer, which gives me the ability to use the computer for much longer periods of time. It also has a very powerful and fast processor. The battery life is very good, as you have to use it for a short time before it will work again. As far as the graphics go, they are very good. I have used this computer extensively in my family, and for my computer science classes. It has always been the best computer available in price and features for my students to use. I will be getting a couple more of these to my students.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from A great computer This computer has exceeded my expectations, it is simple to use and very powerful.

The tobacco was in perfect condition, in a tin dated June of 2005. I wasn't sure what to expect but I didn't have a high expectation. I figured the tobacco would just be dry and a bit off tasting. I opened the tin and smelled it very strongly, but not as strong as some others I've smelled. The blend smelled quite strong and very fruity. I couldn't put my finger on the exact flavor, but the scent reminded me of citrus fruits and berries. I smoked my first bowl out of my brand new Savinelli Aged Burley and that was quite a shock. I was really impressed with the smoke and I had to stop smoking for a moment to collect my thoughts. My first impression was how good the smoke was. It was a great smoke, and I could tell it would be quite a good smoke for a long time. My husband came into the house and we had a conversation about it. He agreed that he had to try this blend.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I can't say enough about this unit. It is so convenient and works well. The unit also came with a 2 meter cord and a battery, so I just used it with a wall adapter (not included) and the power source was fine. It was super simple to set up. It came with the required cables and a USB cord. The only thing I don't like is that it requires a lot of power. I'm lucky to have a solar panel and it's very easy to monitor and set up the system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Good gadget, I love it! Good gadget! I bought this a few months back. I needed a way to take a good picture of my dog without getting the camera out of my hand. With the included camera, I don't need to get my camera out for any of my pictures. It's easy to take and use. I love the wireless connection. I use it at home to connect to my WiFi hotspot and use it to access the web. With this gadget, my friends always think I'm crazy when I tell them my new camera is up in my house and they are on their phone. If you need a camera that takes good pictures and you can see it on the small screen, I suggest this to you. good value, no cons I like the fact that the unit has a battery backup, however I wish that it had a way of turning on and off without having to turn on/off the camera. I think the battery could last for a long time. I also wish that they would make a bigger model of the unit. The small one works great and I am very happy with it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the first time I tried a Tx and the reception is very good. Not that the phone is bad or anything, just that I was worried it would be because of the antennas. The receiver is solid and the phone works well with it. I've never been a huge fan of antennas, but this phone makes a great case for the antenna because it has some great reception. A great piece of equipment. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device and not a problem:   The screen is very bright, and the picture is clear.

The iPhone has done a great job of making Apple products more affordable to anyone who wants a great phone. I hope that more people find these inexpensive products so that they can do more with their iPhone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ---------------This is a nice portable computer. The keyboard, screen, mouse and speakers are all good. My one criticism is that the screen is not centered and is a bit off. I use my computer in my car and my hand tends to be at the lower end of the screen so I have to squint to see the text on the screen. Also, there is a small gap at the top of the display that can get smudged with your fingers.Overall I am very satisfied with this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned a lot of different digital music players, but the apple product is definitely the most versatile and easiest to use. it works on the ipad too, but you have to use the special ipad adapter to get the sound out and the apple dslr is a far better product because it has a lot more features. ive been using this device on my ipad for about 3 years now, and it works perfectly, no need to purchase another dsl rx or dsl.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: icedessert4ever - March 26, 2017 Amazing Product  A great product, I have been looking for something like this. I've been using my phone for everything. I use it for email, reading articles and watching videos on youtube. When I get a text message on my phone it goes straight to my ereader. I have read about a couple of other reviews and the ones that didn't write anything about problems I have experienced didn't help me at all. When my eReader arrived the next day, I was impressed with the packaging. I couldn't wait to get to work. When opening the box I found my e-reader, headphones, bluetooth keyboard, charger and a little sticky tape to make the stand so I can set the ereader on top of my desk and easily look at it. The only thing I'd change is the charging cord, I'm not really a fan. The one I got has a 2 prong plug. I bought a 3 prong version because the 3 prongs don't match the one in my charging cord. So after plugging in my charger I have to twist it to get the power to work properly. I got this as an upgrade from a used iPad and I am very happy with it. It is very fast for my job, so no issues using the internet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I read the other reviews that were so negative and I agree 100%, I have already bought another one, but I won't be using it as a primary reader, I'll be using my smartphone only. Thanks for putting your effort into it.  Write a negative review about something that is bad, but still worth using. misterwizard - July 18, 2016 Very slow  I had a very high hopes for this book reader. It doesn't work well with bluetooth headphones (which I would expect) and I can't open it for photos that are taken with my phone or by email. It's a good looking product, but for the price you pay, this product shouldn't be very good. , August 4, 2016 not very fast, slow, no wifi, doesn't have a stand, very bad build quality  It's pretty good, but it takes longer to transfer images or write notes on your iPhone.

Have not used it, but I would say it works well:   :  Great speaker. I'm very happy with it. -Wyatt  What a great little system! I'm using it as a wireless speaker and the battery life is very good. I think you could use this system to go in your car with your iPod, but it isn't as good as an in-dash set. But the price is great and the sound quality is fantastic. I've used it on all three of my iPhones and it sounds great in each of them.

Now they have released their iPad and I am glad I got this one. It is an amazingly powerful and light weight device. It has so many features that you wouldn't expect from any other device that you can easily add. For the money, it is a steal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  it comes with the batteries already assembled, and i haven't had to change out anything else, i love it. i also love the fact that the case comes off, it has a flap that lets you open it up and show off the battery in there.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works great. I bought this a month ago and have been very happy with it. Very easy to operate. Easy to connect to my computer.  I bought this for my 15 year old son and he works great with it  Thank You  Anonymous from NJ. This was my first purchase of an electronic device (satellite receiver). The quality of the products at Home Depot was exceptional and I received a great deal on the product. The remote control that came with the receiver is the best I have seen.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It really does work.  I've gotten the best sound with this device.  I've used a lot of equipment over the years.  I am used to all kinds of digital devices.  But nothing can compare to having an analog audio system.  The quality of the audio is very good and the built in sound card is extremely good.  There are some limitations to this device but this is by far the best thing I've found to add to my PC.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent product that does what it says it does. Very useful for all types of digital audio applications that require a portable and high quality sound card. It does not have as much features as more expensive DACs but for the price it is well worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased one of these for my girlfriend (who was a novice). The product worked well for her until she began to use it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the Tascam DR-100 and I use it mostly to take pictures of my cats. It works very well for this purpose because it has a decent stereo microphone built in (the other mics are external) and it's small and light (it weighs about 15g). I can take about 4 pictures per minute with it without any noise or distortion. It can do better if I'm using it to take more than 4 photos per minute but it does what it's supposed to do very well. I've even used it to get in some great photos of a baby cat. The downside of this microphone is that it has not one but two small jacks which are kind of awkward to get to when you're on a desk. But that's a minor complaint and a cheap mic.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the original iPod Classic for years and love it. It's very comfortable to hold and the songs and sound quality are amazing. I don't listen to my music much but I use it as a backup player, when on the go. The battery life is excellent and with the new iPod I'm able to listen to music for 2 hours or so. It fits my music collection perfectly, and the battery is rechargeable. The original iPod is still great! I wish Apple would update this product with better speakers. I can't believe Apple didn't take the opportunity to update it with stereo speakers. They should have done this!  Add a comment  You must be logged in to post a comment.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________  I have been using these for over a year now and they have never failed. The unit I got was the only one available and it is the best value. I do not think I would have gotten this unit anywhere else. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  These things are amazing! I really like the new design and all the great features. One of the main things I miss from my previous unit is the ability to choose a specific frequency. I'm hoping this is just a software problem as I'm quite happy with my previous one. __________________________________________________  Just what I wanted! It is really great! I wish they would fix the low battery warning! ____________________________________________  You must be really into this stuff to have come this far down the internet and found this site, I know that my original model died on me after 15 years, but I can't stop looking for replacements! The thing that has improved is the battery life, although it has not been tested, it seems it is a lot longer than my original unit. I just bought a different brand of the same thing but that is not the same. The only downfall for me is that I have to buy an adapter for my phone when it works but it is fine for me as the original battery adapter I have was a bit too big. __________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This one is the best one I've used in a long time!  The sound quality, the fact it's built very well and it's battery life.  They have it in two flavors (I chose grape and lemon) and for a little extra money you can have a USB plug in too.  I really like that you can get 3 different types of batteries (2 AA and 1 18650).   My only complaint is the remote and the control pad.    I wish it was more compact.  If it was, this would be a great unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought my iphone because i am a visual artist. I like it so far, and would buy it again.  I like this product. It is the first iphon I've owned that can play mp3s directly out of the iphonedrive, which is a great feature. Also, it's a nice size, as the iPod Mini is. In my opinion, the ikono can get a lot better, as it has a lot of iphones features that i find useful. If ikone could support both an mp3 player, as well as a sd card, I'd be a happy camper. I'm also using an iphoner at my ikon, and ikonenet is a lot less frustrating.  Overall, ikonet is good, but it is not perfect.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** It is really easy to connect/disconnect a camera to the e-mount without using a fisheye lens. It's not easy but easy enough to do. I was able to set my Nikon D3200 to 2:3 to make a 4K video without a problem. It has been very handy! The lens cap is a bit thin so you may have to tighten the lens as the camera moves in and out of the adapter. But when I do, the camera just moves out with the lens and the adapter still works as it should. It is very easy to do with one hand. I think it is a great feature, especially with cameras with a lot of buttons. I'm so impressed, I bought another one for my Nikon E-M1!Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the daspecial 1 amp USB to Serial converter cable for my new iPhone 4s. I was using my MacBook Pro as a computer. I wanted a USB port for connecting my phone to it. This cable will be great for my phone.   Pros: Easy to use  Portable  Comfortable to use   Cons:  Not waterproof  Could use a little more capacity  Very thin  I bought the Daspecial for my iPhone 4S. I want to be able to connect my phone via a USB cable. I also want to connect the phone to my computer via the USB port. I did a lot of research and found out that most USB to serial converters were made for Windows computers. The ones that I looked at had the maximum capacity of 6.4 megabytes. Not 6.5mb. They also had a limit of 300mA, which I didn't need at all. I searched for a product that would be perfect for my needs.I bought this converter and it is the best USB toSerial converter I have ever seen! The price was very good (about $6.95) and I really liked the quality.I purchased the daselectric 1 amp usb to serial converter cable. The converter is easy to use and portable. It also looks good. My phone would plug in to the cable. It was nice not having to open the charger case to plug in my phone or any of my other devices.The USB toserial converter has a small LED indicator at the front that shows the speed of data transfer, as well as the maximum current capacity.The usb toserial cable is made of metal, and has a long cable that terminates with a male USB-A plug. The cable comes with a 3.5mm male to female adapter that plugs into the male USB port of my phone and allows me to connect to it through the usb port. The daspecial USB toDaspecific cable has a USB-powered USB-to-Serial converter built in.The converter has been tested on my phone with no problems.The daspeatual cable has one of the smallest USB toUSB converters out there.It is very portable!If I wanted to connect a USB 3.0 hub to my phone, this converter would be an excellent choice.If I were to buy this converter again, I would get an additional usb to usb A plug with a longer
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first smart phone. This was my very first smart and easy to use phone.  If you have not used one before this one is a must.    My favorite features:   This is a very good phone. I would give the phone a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The one thing I do not like about this phone is it's battery life. I do use this phone for all of my internet and phone needs.  My first phone was a Droid, and I still have it because I love it so much. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   When I first got the HMD I was excited, as I was told by my friend that it was going to be a life changer for me. After buying it I found it to be not only extremely comfortable, but also very portable, and I love that it is waterproof. It is very lightweight and has all of the necessary components, making it easy to setup. The only downside is that it takes two AAA batteries, instead of just one. But you have to ask yourself why not just buy an original one.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've never been a fan of using an e-reader with my mobile phone, but my wife liked it for reading and chatting while I am on the road. We recently upgraded and got a Kindle Fire HDX. We are not big fans of the old one and had not considered the Kindle Fire for reading for the family but our son who is 14 (and already reading his first book) and we were both blown away by how good it is. Our old Kindle was a total pain and we had to manually add pages and turn pages. Our new Kindle has everything you need to read it and has done so with a seamless setup. It also has a nice backlight that helps you stay focused when reading. Overall, a great product and the company that makes it even better!   I like the price and size of this one, but it would be great if it were more durable than the Kindle Paperwhite.    I like the fact that it has built in speakers, but you have to connect them through the USB port.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you, it came exactly as described and fast. The quality of the screen was also excellent and no more issues with my laptop and now works very well with my new tablet with my old one. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  Have had it a year or so, and it's still going strong! The screen is still working and is as clear as it was when I got it. My only complaint is that the backlight is too bright. I'm using it in very bright sunlight, and the screen goes all black. I tried turning down the brightness, but the screen stays dark when it's too bright! I've had the unit for over a year, and will update if I find any problems.  of 3 found this review helpful, was it helpful to you? Yes | No  Was this review useful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these and love them. They are my primary music device and a great value. When I first got one, I thought it was going to be like a compact CD player with an iPod interface. I was wrong. This little machine does everything that a compact does and more, but without the cost and other drawbacks. I don't even have to worry about replacing batteries or cords. I have only a small speaker to go with my iPod and they're so easy to use. I really love it!  The most versatile tool for music:  This is a fantastic, powerful, and portable compact MP3 player. When my husband got me one, he knew right away that he wanted me to use it primarily for MP3 playback. I can put my iPod on it with ease, plug in my speakers, and put it in the back seat of my Toyota. My husband has a Sony SRS-XB700, and our new mp3 player sounds absolutely killer! It's got everything we need from a portable portable music player, to an all-in-one music system. When it's time for a recharge, the USB charger lasts a month or so with some use.  Awesome Product!  I got this mp3 recorder a few days ago and I love it. I play music through it and it works great. I am a mom and I have a son who listens to music too. I would recommend this to anyone.  of the very best I have had my mp3 in the van for two months and never go without it. it is super small and easy to pack. I love the battery life I have received. Also it is the most versatile and awesome mp3 I have ever used.  was not what I expected. I did not order from this company expecting something that would be perfect. I got what i expected. It is a very good product but i would say it needs a bit more power and a USB charger. I think it would take a USB device to be used at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I don't think that any of the things that I have bought from ebay can be equalled. I am using this!!!!  What do you mean it has been tested to withstand the forces of a car? That's a bit of an over-statement, to be honest. If the unit works as well as it appears to, it shouldn't give you any problems with the car, but if the thing breaks, you're out a replacement.   I am using the unit as a car amplifier on an old Ford GT40, which doesn't have the luxury of having a huge, powerful amplifier. The amp sounds very much like a tube amp, but it has a nice wide sound with no "tube-ish" qualities.  , I did. It does have a small amount of overdrive, but as is, it is not a massive amount. I would use it as a soundcard or mixer, and that would probably work fine.It will do this because it uses two LM386-based op amps to drive the three channels with the same power. It uses one output channel to drive an 8-ohm load (2x 16-ohm speakers, for example), and the other to drive 2x 12-ohm loads (two pairs of 8-ohms, a pair of 8 ohms, etc).This means the unit can drive just about anything with no problems (at least, I have not tested it with anything more complex than a small speaker set, and with such an amp, it's unlikely to be much more than that). It does seem like it would make a pretty good CD player and probably a decent high-end stereo, though I can't think of anything in that category that is actually intended to be used in a car.I use it on the car as a "power amplifier" with two sets of headphones connected directly to the unit, and it gives very nice sound.The thing I love most about this amp is how well it handles the low impedance loads. I put it in the center console of my Mazda (which already has plenty of power) and hooked it up to my iPod, and all the iPod stuff works just fine, as do the other sources, such as the stock amplifier that came with the vehicle. It's just that it's such a good sounding unit that the sound is almost a perfect match. I did a test drive and played the CD on my CD player, and the CD sounded great,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is my first ever electronic device, and it is the best I've used so far. I haven't had a chance to check out all the other reviews on here yet, but so far this is my favorite so far! It's great when I need to be able to listen to my music, but it also works with my iPad. I also have a phone on my desk and I still have the mp3 players for when I'm away at work. This is a little easier than going back and forth through the computer, but still has a lot of functions built in. Plus I like that I can charge it on the go. Also it has a mic so that I don't have to use it on my own.  Product Review: Marv  Works well with my iMac.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  i love this item it is a great tool and i can do any type of jobs without having to use a power tool.  I am very pleased with my new Power Tool and I was amazed at how the Power Tool works.  a must have!  This item is excellent! I love having my Power Tool with me when I'm in the field or working at a job site. I've been using mine for over a year.  the tool has been very durable, the quality is excellent and the tool is built like a tank. I use my tool every day for my job, and it never fails to work. This will definitely be my go to tool on all my future projects. , Great! i use this power tool to hold tools and batteries in place while changing them out, and also to change out my batteries, which i use every day. I like the fact that you can use it to power a flashlight, which can be handy for reading at night in a dark and dank environment.  of course I have a huge problem with the handle breaking at the plastic rivets. the entire case needs to be redesigned. I would rate it only a 3 for reliability as a tool. (5/5)  It's been almost 3 years since I bought my Power Tools, and I don't have a problem with them, I just can't find a way to get the rivets to grip the plastic.  is there a way for me to get them to work?   I've tried a couple different methods but I always have to remove the screws before the tool will work, and of course the rivet holes are all so tight they make removing the screws impossible. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned this product for a while. i bought it because i am an audiophile and am a huge fan of the d2's. this unit is great for what i need it to do. but for someone like me, who wants to be able to use music or podcasts without the loss of fidelity, i am extremely disappointed. i can't get my music and podcasts to play through this thing without the music being horribly distorted. the audio on the podcasts has been like i am listening to my old cassettes and the audio of this unit sounds like i have a crappy set of speakers. i have to turn up my headphones, but then my podcasts are in the same state as my cassettes. i really hate to see this product go. the price is right and its a nice unit, but to me the sound is completely lacking.  Value Quality Price I bought this receiver to replace my previous AVR that had been getting bad reviews. The noise is not a huge problem with the unit because the AVR noise is on the sub level. As stated in the other reviews, the tuner is a piece of junk. I installed a Sony satellite tuner that is not even on the market that has a great sound and that is much more convenient and reliable for the money. I'm now looking for a new receiver. I have read other reviews of people being very happy with the noise cancelling feature and that it is a very powerful feature. As far as sound quality, I am not sure. I think it is an older unit and that the tuners are not made for this device. That being said, I think the unit is very well made and will be perfect for someone who wants a great looking, high quality product that will last for many years.  in my opinion the noise cancellation system on the sound card is useless at best and very noisy at worst, and not at all to my liking. I got tired of the static noise and I did replace the soundcard. I am still looking for another one as I have heard that there are better ones available and I just want to buy one to compare. : i bought this as an upgrade to my vudu d2,it sounded better than the dvd with a pair of new buds,but not as good as my last one,its really weird to get it to work but you can set it up from the tv in your living room with the remote control and the tunestuff is there
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I got the new iPhone 4S and it was fantastic! The interface of the phone is so much more refined than the older iPhone. The screen is brighter, the icons and menus are a lot more clear, and the video playback was perfect. The only thing that I would say is missing is the ability to control volume. The volume control is hard to hit, and it is harder to use than the volume buttons on the iPod touch. The headphone jack on the iPhone is an improvement. The camera also is better. I didn't mind that there are no USB charging ports on the new iPod, but I would still have liked to be able to charge my iPhone at the same time. Also, there is a tiny bit of latency on my iPad mini 3. That could be just a software/firmware problem. Overall, an excellent device that is also great for the price! ___________

I got mine for my wife (my kids don't even know they exist) for our new house, they've been perfect, no issues, just the right size, no leaks. i used to use a laptop and it was a pain to switch back and forth between. i have a lot of room to spare.

I had to cut a hole in my carpet to make the connection with a screwdriver and the power supply still wouldn't work. My second iwo would not charge, and my third one also refused to charge when connected to my car. A month later I finally got rid of it and bought another for $170 that worked fine for 5 months.

Got it about a week before the end of my contract (10K miles), and put it in a couple of months later. . I put it on my car and the car battery started to smoke. So, I took it to the local iwo dealer, got a new battery and put in it and it worked. After a few more weeks, the car started smoking too. It's a good thing I did what I did because iwo got rid off my warranty, and replaced it with a warranty, it's worth it. I've now had it for almost two months, and it still wont charge. I've checked the internal contacts and I see no good contact. (Posted 4/27/18)(Posted 4.22.18) Iwo battery failed after 4 months. iwo battery failure after 8 months.

It prints a 0.2mm layer height. I printed the robot in PLA on my desktop extruder at 15cm/sec. I then took the 3d file to my PC and printed it on a MakerBot Replicator 2, with an M2.5, with 25% infill, and 30% of infill on the bottom, with no supports.   I was able use it for the following:  1. Making some parts to build a chair and keyboard for my robot (that I'm making for a robot event in a week).  2. Printing some parts for my son's robot (with a laser cutting laser I bought from another person) that we're going to use for a model of our house. He's 12. . Printing a robot arm I made. I need to get more precise and this printer seems to have everything I need.  The printer is not the best and there are issues with calibration of the print head but the price is right for it.  is it worth the money? you bet.  (I paid it for about half the printer cost)  If I had bought it for $1000 and had the other things I would've saved me a lot of money. The only down side is it doesn't seem to be designed well.  the X carriage is on the wrong side  The top carriage is not in the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this little thing to see if it was as good as the others. The one on the left is a bit cheaper, but I did get a bit more noise from the speakers which is what I expected. My phone doesn't play music, but it plays videos very smoothly, although sometimes I had to use the volume control to stop the music before it could begin playing. All in all I'm happy with it. It is compact and it's just plain good.  Did you find this helpful? 3 of 3 Found Helpful  Andrew  5 / 5  Reviewed by:from Illinois. on 8/26/2014
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Amazing product at an amazing price. After a few months using my first laptop, I decided to upgrade from my MacBook Air to a new macbook Pro. After looking around for a device that would be cheaper than the macbook pro, I found this computer. I will admit that it was a bit confusing at first, as I did not know what to put in the computer case when it came to picking out the features. However, after doing some research and looking at several reviews, I was able to get by pretty quickly, and now I am very happy with the computer. After being in the IT field for over 15 years and having my own company, I don't think there is anything more important to me than my computer. For me, the price to performance ratio was unbeatable. I was also surprised at how good the screen looked for this price. Overall, I will continue to buy my components from this company as long as I can.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the ZD12S from amazon and I am really happy with it and I can't wait to use it. It works very good with my ZD-9000.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It seems that these are well made. The case does make the whole package bulky but at least it looks good. It is a joy to use, however, I have not done a lot of gaming with it. I have the gamepad plugged into the PS3 and the Dualshock 3 wired to my TV. My girlfriend and I play a lot, and it's the best solution for her to do so. I think the wireless option is cool, but I'm not sure how well it will work with a gamepad and keyboard. It's good to have a USB device that can work on both PS3's as well as your PC.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   So far I have not had any problems with this device. It works well. Easy to use. It is a good size to hold in one hand. My only complaint is that it needs an antenna to work. I got it, and it works fine. I don't think I would have paid the $60 to have it do it, so that is a minor complaint. The only other complaint is the size of it, but it's the best I can find right now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this for my car stereo, and it's awesome. I'm sure my wife and kids will enjoy it as well.  - Chris  I have purchased several products by this manufacturer but this is the first that I feel that I get a really good quality product for a reasonable price, and this one has lasted about 4 years and will probably last another 4.  a solid unit. ,   The sound is great, the only thing that might bother some people is the fact that it only works with your car's speakers in your car. If you want to use it in your house (or your living room) you will need to purchase a wireless receiver to work.  the product is very well designed,   and it works as advertised. It just needs some power from the usb port.   - Greg  Great sound for the price!  My wife uses it as her music system. Its fantastic for her and she gets great clarity and detail.   We used it in our RV and it gave great quality for the money.   the one thing that is a little odd is that you cannot plug into the wall. I have found that you will have to remove the speaker wires and plug them into your computer or audio player.  in order to use the USB port to charge your phone you have to use a special cable (i bought from Best Buy but it may be different).  good value for the mics and the sound quality.   The speakers are high quality and sound great. The quality of the sound is just about what you get with a good speaker set for the $$. They dont sound "tinny" as some people say they do in other reviews but when you add the micing of it's own sound system you have a pretty good sound.  on my second one i installed 3 external speakers in our home theater and the system gets rave reviews. the sound really gets good and if you use good headphones or external speakers you can get great sound out of this system.  is a very well built product  We recently purchased two of these units for use in our entertainment center for DVD/Video/Music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased this product, and after a few weeks with it, I have decided to buy another one for a friend. I've had no problems with this. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the display of the computer screen is very small (about 2 inches by 3 inches) and the computer has problems keeping it up to date, so the settings seem a bit slow to me.   My other problem with this product is that it will sometimes turn off if it gets warm. And sometimes, when you open the computer, you will hear clicking and popping sounds as it changes settings. These sounds are very annoying. It is not really a big problem, because it doesn't happen enough to bother me, but it just doesn't look as nice.  3 of 4 people found this review helpful I love the computer it was easy to set up and works great. .  the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, is the computer doesn't turn off unless it is warm (which it seems to get on occasion), and the screen is not big enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The T.R.I.K.E. is a great product, the best of the bunch in my opinion. I was very impressed with the sound quality and the built in microphone to capture your voice. The only thing that i am a little disappointed in is the buttons on the top to control the volume. I've noticed this one doesn't like to press hard on them. The buttons are actually quite small, and I've had them hard pressed to shut it down. I also wish they would put in a second microphone for audio to be recorded as well. It is quite annoying when someone says something in one of the voices while you are speaking with another. It will stop the audio, and you have to restart it.   I also have to say that the voice recognition function is really neat. It's very quick to activate and once it's done, the voice can be heard clearly by the people around you. It can be a little hard to recognize certain people when talking to them as I do sometimes, but overall I think this device is worth the money.

This is just a great little device for home use and will easily replace my old computer. :)  BEST USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 to USB-A cable you can buy --------------- Love this cable! It's super quick and very versatile. It can be used to connect a laptop to a laptop, or even a Macbook Air, and can also connect a USB stick for data storage and play/pause music/video/etc.. I highly recommend this to anyone who has USB-USB or Thunderbolt ports on their Mac/PC (or can make a USB-to-Thunderbolt-to/from connection), and for everyone who wants to have a great all-around connection device.   5/5 stars!!!  Super quick. Super small. All in one device. What's not to love. The USB- C / Thunderbolt / USB- A cable will take it from your existing USB-B to Thunderbolt port on your desktop, with or without a computer. Perfect.  and with that you don 't need to add an additional port (like USB-PS2, USB-HDMI, or USB-DVI).  5 stars.  the best usb-to tb port  I use this on my laptop, and I can't recommend it enough.

If you want a lot of flexibility, and have a USB to b/g/usb,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   So far, I am extremely happy with my purchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and have always had problems with my earphones making a strange noise when I am speaking or playing music. My wife has a Samsung S4 and hasn't had any problems with her earphones.  I had read about the M-Series on the net and ordered a pair on Monday night. The night I ordered the M6I and M6N, they showed up at the door and I went ahead and got them. I've been able to use the earphones now for a few days and they have been working great. I don't like how bulky they are but it doesn't bother me at all. I use them for work and when I have dinner or take my son and daughter to the playground. I didn't even notice the earbuds until I picked them up off the counter and put them in my pocket. I think I might get them in different colors so I can tell the difference. They look really cool.

I would give it a 9 out of 10 if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't play nicely with any bluetooth phone. I bought a cheap phone and had it connect to it but when I switched to my mac and then my phone to connect to my headset my phone would connect and then stop working. It took a whole night to figure out that it was the phone because this is not a Bluetooth device.   Other than that I highly recommend this and will definitely buy more when they stop selling it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like this device. I'm an electrician and this unit has given me many hours of time I couldn't have spent on my job. I use it in my shop for many reasons. It works great for the money I paid for it and the ease of setting it up. I've been using it almost every day for almost two years now. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to be able to use the power tools they need when the power goes out.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Works great! I had a similar one from a long time ago and it is the same as this one. The only thing different is that it has two different types of outlets (standard and outlet #2). This makes things a bit tricky to set up for the new installer, however, once he figures it out the unit is very easy to use. I am using it for my home office and I am amazed at how many cords I have saved and how much more I can put on the walls. I also like the fact that I don't have to run around the house checking my power cables to see if the unit has been turned off. I like that the unit will turn off the unit if the power is not present, even if I am not connected to the power. It's a great product and I highly recommend it.  of 5 A MUST for any contractor who needs to work on large electricians shops  Customer service is just amazing. I called and got a live chat with a real person that could help me. I received the answer to my question and it helped me with my situation.  was a lifesaver.  to many things to keep track of but the customer service is amazing  the best product in my opinion and I have to say it would have been cheaper to buy new from a store  Thank you for the quick service. This is exactly what I needed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a Logitech USB Camera. It is a great product for the price. It has lots of features that a computer can not offer. This is not a digital camera, it is an optical view finder. You can use a mouse to get around the interface. However, when you are looking at pictures, it gets slow. You cannot save as many as you can, and it is not easy to get the pictures back when you want to. It was great in the past for videos, but the computer interface has made it difficult to do so. I am trying to get it working again to make movies. I also like that it has an IP camera on it. I use it for video conferencing, and have had no problems. I like the fact that it is small, easy to carry, and easy to install. The only complaint I have is that when it is powered on, it will not turn off. That is not an issue, I have the power supply for it to turn off when it goes to sleep. But it is frustrating that this would happen.

Review by Jeff. (Posted on 12/27/14) Customer rating: Quality  Performance  Value I bought one for a Cpl who has served in Afghanistan and has seen and done some of the most difficult things you can imagine - even with the limited battery life you get from this radio.  I am now using it on a mountain range for hiking and hiking on.  of course I carry the radio with me everywhere and it always works, and has the batteries for it's radio as well. , I would buy a second one for my second Cpl. to enjoy.  and when I get out of the army I will buy one for myself. -Jeff, AZ.   Great little radio - good price Review by Scott. (Added on 3/2/15) Customer review:  Very easy to setup, it will run out of batteries a few times but all the features work well. I like how the radio has 2 radio channels for the 1st and 4th radio and I like the radio's sound quality. :)   Good Radio Review by Cpl. (added on 12-14-13) Customer comment:    I was concerned about the battery life on this radio, but I have not used it for long and have not noticed any drop in performance. It is very handy when it comes to searching for signals when I am in a remote location. I am a long distance trucker and radio is very helpful when I don't want to carry extra radio batteries and batteries when traveling. It has a very long battery life, and I would definitely recommend it.  the radio is easy and fast to setup and very easy to navigate. and for the price I am extremely happy with the purchase. I have already recommended this radio to my fellow truckers and they all like it. It works very well and its a great radio to have around the truck, in the truck or even in a backpack.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________  I bought the "Electronics" for my computer when it came out. I had a Dell laptop with it. When it died, I decided to get a new one, but I just found out that I can't have a laptop with a serial number under it because it doesn't recognize my old one. I'm so glad I found this for my new computer.  Thank you.  to all the people who write: ______________________________________________________________  You will get lots of good reviews from people who are going through the same problem.  the computer works fine on my PC.  with the serial number and my username on it. but I had to put my old computer into a different computer. I've put it into several different computers over the years, including my older iMac and a new Macbook, and it still works. I do get a little jittering at times, but it's not much. Also the new version has better compatibility with my Macbook Pro which is still working fine. I use a Dell XPS M1330 laptop for my work. It has the serial on it in case something happens to my old laptop, I use it for my school. The XPS can be hard to find, but at least there it works. The best thing is it's almost free. It's so nice to be able to tell people I can still use my computer. It really is hard to believe that I am a computer guy, I mean all I do is work on computers and I am using a computer that costs almost $1,000! it's a very nice computer and is easy to upgrade with memory, hard drive, mouse and so on. I don't want to buy the Dell brand anymore, but they won't let me have the serial so that's why I have to use a non-Dell computer to go on with my school work. I think the only way to do it is to get this computer. the only thing I didn't like was that it took some time to come. when it arrived I was happy I found it. I wish they would sell it more to people. it's good to know that you can get a good computer for cheap, at least the XPS line is now cheaper. you will get tons of reviews from the people that have purchased this computer and know the problems they are having with it and you can make a better decision by purchasing this computer

If you need to do lots of things on your computer its a good investment. Also when i use this i dont need to install a new firewall or anything like that so i dont have to worry about viruses when i amnt using it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* I use this for an electric typewriter. I like how it works and it looks pretty cool. I just wish the font was bigger, and it had a little more power to it. It doesn't draw as much power as my cheap old typewriter does, but it's still better than my old computer. I also like the design. It is a little small to be portable, but as far as typewriters go, that is pretty good. You can put it in your jacket pocket if you're going out to meet people or stuff, or put it on a desk at work. I'm not that serious about computers, but I like them, so it was fun to try this one out. I don't know how much power it will last, so I'll see how long it lasts. If it keeps on working after a year and it's not too bad, I'll buy another one, since it's good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to replace my old laptop that had a built in flash drive. The new flash drive worked out of the box and the new laptop works very well. The quality is much better and the price is very good. I would recommend this device to anyone who wants a flash drive to store large files such as movies or music. I bought one of these to store my music collection on, it is an excellent backup drive. A very good option for anyone needing a drive to backup their digital files. A good deal for the price, I had two of these for one of my computer systems. I put an additional hard disk in it, and it worked like a charm. It was easy to install and I am very pleased.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  If you're looking for a good all-rounder, then the  Jotunheim  procedural synthesis package is the way to go. It's got all the necessary features to be a very capable tool for getting out of the box - as well as some pretty cool features that you can make use of right away. I'm sure I will probably upgrade my unit when I get a better one, but that's not a big deal. It has a great sound for something so simple. I can't wait to get around to the next stage of programming - but I'm not sure I want to do it all again - or I'll have to start all over again!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new XBox 360 game console has a lot of features that will allow you to do more than just play video games. It has a pretty high resolution screen, two USB ports, a headphone jack, a DVD player, and many other features.   For a $200 to $300 video game console, the XBox360 does all of this really well.   and yes the XBOX 360 is compatible with Xbox One game pad and keyboard, so if you want to play a PC game you can use this for that as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using my new ipad for the past couple of weeks. It is very easy to set up and very handy for my needs. I love the way that it is able to change the volume on my mp3 files to the songs that I am playing on it. I also like the way it is easily able to browse the internet, send emails, check my calendar, etc. My only complaint is that it does not seem to have a power off button. It just keeps going on. I have already replaced my old ipad. I am going to go to the pro level with this.  What did you like best about this product?  The ability to change my iPod's volume without using my iPhone. The size is really nice for me. Also the size is very convenient. I really like the ability to keep my ipod charging.  I am a big fan of ipads because I am really just a casual music listener and want to listen to music on my ipad anytime. Having a device that can change the iPod's iPod's music to the ones I am listening to is perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to listen on their ipad with their favorite song. It fits perfectly, it charges in about an hour and has a power on/off button. A few complaints would be the size (I think the ipad is too big). Also, the ipod does not charge as fast as it can. I wish I could change the ipods volume from my phone without having to unplug it. This may not be a problem for everyone but I thought it was worth mentioning.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it does have an auto off, but it takes a while to come on, about 10 mins I think.  have a really small ipod  This product is amazing for my young son who likes music on his ipad but also wants to change music on the go. The little thing is just about perfect for his ipod. Only two complaints. One is the buttons aren't as easy to find as they should be (they can be hard to find if you're a lefty) and the second is that the ipady only works on the apple. There is no way for me to find it on an ipad without a special cable. Other than that I love it  i have a ipod and this is so easy and smart  Great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have one of these and it does the job. You are able to do a very wide range of things and control it well. I'm using it to control a radio tower that is connected to a computer in my office, it allows me to use the computer to control the radio. When I'm not in the office, I have it connected to my home wireless access point to keep my Internet connection up. The software is easy to use. The wireless range is great. I have the wireless on high and the range is fantastic.  Write a negative review about the product:  Just bought one of the wireless routers and I'm very dissatisfied with the performance. The setup was easy and fast but now I can't use my computer in the same room. My main computer is connected via ethernet cable and now that's not going to work anymore.   I'm going to return this thing because I can no longer use my main computer.  and  Can't believe the price when I used to buy them on sale for $0.99 and used them for 4 years. I now bought the same one at my local Walmart for $25 and it was not bad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first computer I bought from you guys I was skeptical about this device but I decided to take the plunge because my old computer is getting a bit on it's last legs it was getting extremely hard to get anything done and to get it all together took ages. I have had this computer for about 3 months now and it has not made a difference in my computer at all. It seems to be pretty good but not great. I am happy with the computer so far. I used to have a Sony Ericsson S2000 and it is much nicer to look at but it is also much more expensive than this computer. This computer also cost a lot more than the Sony but it works like a charm. It looks so professional when it's on my desk. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a computer that can be used for business or school.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have to tell you I really, really love my V-1!   The battery life is very long. I play a lot of games. I use a wireless controller on my computer, and the V-Controller is so handy, it is much faster for me to use that. I can do many, many things with my computer using the V1 controller.   Plus, the sound on the V2 is so much better. I don't mind the V's tiny buttons, but this V2 controller is so precise. The V-3 is great, but if the V3 has a "key" (to press) button on it, then I can't use it. I think this V-2 controller has a key button, but I'm not sure.  One thing I don not like about this V1 is that it's a bit bulky, but it's not terrible! It does not make my hands sweaty. The sound from the V 1 is so great, I love my voice so much, but the V 2 just adds to the feel of my controller and the sound that comes from my computer.  .  the V controller is also great for the Xbox One. I know, I know the games don't run natively, but with this controller you can still play all the games on the 360 and PS3. Also, for some reason, the v-1 controller works better with the new games I've bought than the v2 controller. It's not that I'm using it differently, but that the new controller just feels more natural to use with the old games.  -   Another great thing about this controller is that the battery life isn't bad at all. I have to charge it every 3-5 days.

Yes No Wednesday, May 08, 2016  Good device  by Anonymous Coworker from Tucson AZ USA  Pros: small, easy to find a spot to plug in  Cons: no screen and is very loud  Review: Good device for the price.    It has the ability to charge 4 AAA batteries at once. It was very easy to plug it in and started working on about 30 minutes after it was on. The batteries had a great quality and didn't give off a horrible smell.   A little annoying is the volume of the sound it makes, it's extremely loud. It's best to use it in a vehicle where there isn't any air conditioner. I would probably replace it with a different one if it wasn't so loud. . 's  A review by: James from Washington DC  This device is great for what it is and is a great size. However, it has a very annoying sound. : This device is amazing for the $$ it is for the 4 batteries and the great value for it : only thing i would change is the sound of the charging beep. I have it in my car for over a year now and it is constantly annoying me.  a few years ago I bought this from the dealer but I have found that in addition to the annoying sound when the unit is not attached it is not very loud. The sound is only a bit louder when the battery is plugged in and only when the phone is vibrating. Not much different than the old car chargers. I hope the noise is reduced with the change in the charging technology.  by: Anonymous from California USA .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little unit. The build quality is very good and the USB cable is very nice and durable. The only bad thing I had to say is the software is not user friendly. It is extremely fiddly to change the USB settings and you have to re-pair your device several times. It would have been nice if this feature had been incorporated in the firmware. But the good thing about the USB connection is that you can also use the unit as a wireless USB hub and make the best of your mobile phone signal!  Was this review helpful to you?

I use the wireless model for most of my listening and when the cord is in the case, I get quite a bit more range. The cord is quite long but the weight of the headphones is not excessive. The battery lasts a long time but is not rechargeable. I purchased the bluetooth model and it works good. It is more difficult to hear outside noise with this headphone. I like the sound a lot but am not sure how I would rate this product if it were not for the noise canceving function. --------------- Was this review helpful? ------------------------------- ( 6 )
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very good product and was the first electronic device I bought. The sound is clear and clear with no noise and great battery life. It was a little bit more expensive than I would have liked but for the quality it's a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was hoping this would be better than my current wireless remote. I am a huge fan of the Apple remote and have used my iPod Touch for years. It's also very simple and small. The design is a nice touch as well. The only problem is that this remote seems to get lost sometimes when not in use. It can be very difficult to find if it's in your bag or pocket, which is a problem when you have to carry a laptop in your pocket. Still, for a simple, inexpensive wireless remote, I am very pleased.  Product: Kenwood KDC-XB920BT 4K Remote for Apple iPod Touch 6th Gen  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this for a car radio. I can't imagine why anyone would buy this over a better one. If you need a radio that will last for years you need to look elsewhere. Don't buy a car or TV/VCR/etc with this device...  This is my first device and I don't know how to program it. It's a little too bulky and hard to use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ixmikey I used a gb650m to connect to the pc. Then hooked up to my ix3 gps. Works perfectly.  Works for me: mikejb1 this is an amazing little box! for under 30 bucks I have been working on it daily. the directions are easy to follow and the setup was easy with the little manual i was given. i was able to install it into my car from the factory floor. no wiring changes, no hacking, no problem. just plug and play. i did have to do a few modificaiton to get it to work with my xt9 gps, but it was very straight forward. if you are looking for a simple solution to the gps problem you need this.  the gb 650m works as a great GPS/computer in a small package.  and the usb connection makes it so easy to update or install a new firmware  Good product: mrdavidl Great gadget, I've only had it a few weeks but it's working great. I think the instructions are a bit misleading though, I don't have the latest gps firmware to test this with, I did get a new gps fw, however I'm assuming the old one is fine. I'm running Windows 8 64 bit, so I can't test this in Linux with a usb.   The device works great. It's simple to connect, plug in and sync up with the internet. The software itself is very straightforward and is easy to understand.   at $30 I don?t see why I would want any other device, especially since it's compatible with windows.  -Michael  excellent GPS gps: johnj I use this GPS gp with my ipad and my iphone 6 and it works great i love this gps gps so much i use it everyday and i cant wait for the next update so we can get a bluetooth dongle in this gp you can also make it in the future to be a wifi dongles with the bluetooth in this case i wish the gp came with a blu-ray drive that you can use with your ipad or your iphones blu-rays  The best price in the market!: michael The price is excellent, I use the gpx650m for every GPS application I use it with the Garmin eTrex 3d gps device,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my son and he loves it. He says it is really nice for the price. He can plug it in with one hand. It's so easy to carry around. Rated 3 out of 5 by David from Not as expected from the manufacturers I bought this a month ago for a Christmas present, it arrived 2 weeks later and it wasn't as it should. It was bent, the button for turn it on and off was damaged and there was a black spot on the front where the battery is connected to. It had a small piece of wire protruding, not something you would expect from a modern product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Amazing for my first time with the ipod touch, I got the ipad and the ipods on day 1 and I am really impressed with the quality of the ipads. They have an all around good sound and the charging and playing functions are very easy to use. I do get some noise from the ipob touch but it does get loud when you play music so you need to mute it but it is a good price to get the sound quality with the price you pay.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have tried several different types of batteries and have found that NiMH batteries like this do not last as long as other types of battery, but you do get what you pay for.   It has been my go to battery for several months now.  They can be charged on the go and can easily be taken on a weekend hike or camping trip.   and I keep it charged in my pack and it is never dead even when I've had my laptop and camera in it for hours.  .   is it a must have for me for my electronics? I'm currently using a Dell laptop and my Sony nikon DSLR's with a 16gb SDHC card and some kind of portable battery to charge them and I've got a Sony RX1 and Sony RX10 and they all work just fine without having to put in a second battery, which is great when I'm out in the field with a camera that can't take it on it's own as it usually does, but it really needs one for my camera.  (I'm using this to charge the Sony RX100, Sony RX200, and Sony F2) I have a Dell Inspiron 13 7000 and I use it for everything. My camera is an A7r II with the A6300 which can take a 5400k pixel, full frame sensor and has a sensor resolution of 12 Megapixels. I also use a Sony A65 and a Sony T3i with a 5 Megapixel sensor. This thing charges everything and is the only thing I use that I don't have a spare battery for. and I don 't use my laptop very much as I'm on a schedule where I just go out and photograph. And this battery makes it just as easy to travel as a laptop or an A-mount with a lens.     So the only reason I can't rate it 5 stars is I've tried a number of different types and this is the one that is always working and never dying when I just take it out of the box and charge it up. It's cheap enough that if I ever want to replace it, I can just buy a new one.   in fact I did. I bought a new battery and it lasted 10 shots then died within 3, but now I have two NiMH AA batteries to replace them.   the battery has worked for me to the point I didn't notice a drop off in image quality until I took a couple
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________  The first i want to say...I really liked my new e pen! Very reliable, no flickers, good battery life, well built! __________________The first I want to see when I pick it up. The product works very well. My first and only e pen  Was this review helpful?  1 taco eaters like this review Amazing! January 5, 2014 taco eater : zach from California, CA United States These are awesome. I can't wait to use them. Very cool. I do wish they came in different colors.  I bought a second one to have as an emergency backup.  the only thing that bothers me is that the rubber on the pen is a little wobbly. I'm not sure if it's from the way I hold it, but it's something I'll be adjusting if I can.  and another one of my favorites that i got for Christmas, is my favorite pen. great and sleek. ______________________________  Did you find this helpful? 1 of 1 Found Helpful  (Verified Buyer)  T.K.G. from New Orleans, LA United States I own the original E.I.T., but this pen is just a little more sleek, and a little nicer, and just has that "click" I loved from the E. I.T. I still like the E Ink, the EI pen, and the original one. I have a couple others of both, and if I want the one with a black clip (and I really do) I'd have to get the pen I just reviewed.  a couple of notes, not all of the models were made by the same company.   (1) I bought the red one and the grey one. This was my first E. ink pen, so I liked the black one, but I think it has less grip on the ink-well (and is more slippery in the pen)   I think the white one, and black, are just a different company (the same company that made the E ink in the original and other red pens). Also, my black pen is probably worth a little less than mine. I would have bought it for the same price if it was the same model. I don't know. Maybe it just needed a little polishing.     2) As others have noted, the rubber of the pens is very, very wobb
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to control a computer via Bluetooth with my Mac. I'm able to program it to send me notifications (like a text message, email or social media status) about the status of my Mac so I know what's happening. The software is simple and intuitive to use. I recommend the  product  to anybody who needs to control their computer remotely. Review by:    Mike E.  (  San Diego, CA ) I've used the iStuff  smart-home for the last year, using it mostly for controlling my TV and playing music through the iMac.  It can even turn on the lights for me when I leave the house!  I do need to say it's not the cheapest but at this price point it's a great buy.  Read the full review
