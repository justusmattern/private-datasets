Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose (1971)   The Exerpts, The Girl from Everywhere (1956)  Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (2008)    Madame Grosse, The New Orleans (1920)  The Ex-Communications In 1967,  a new  film  was  released which was, in the words of one reviewer,  "not  a movie,  not  a TV show, not  an art film, but a  series.  A  series  that  didn't  make  money,  didn t  win  awards,  but was a show that  was... well, I don't think  it  was."  This show was called "The Exerscences" and was produced by Jerry Springer and produced by Michael Gittes.  The title of the series is  somewhat  misleading.  Not because it is a continuation of the first, not because it was about a  real  person, but because, instead of a serial or series of stories, this film was a series of vignettes and stories which were  intended to be  heard  and  viewed in  one  sitting  rather than  in  a  series of  episodes.  This was  not the only  Exerience series produced.  There were several others, but this was the first one to make money.  The show's first episode,  entitled  " The Ex-communication,"  was the only one ever produced. It has a very low production value, it is  a short, and it does not have much meaning.  But, that is what the critics said about it.  For example, one reviewer said  "The most interesting episode is " The Day the Moon Gave Up on the World" " This is the first episode that does not even try to hide the fact that it is an experiment in  television.  It is an excuse to test the medium.  To show a different  point of view to the audience.  Instead of  having the audience  accept the premise  of  the show, it  does  an experiment to see if it can entertain.  They try a  different  way of telling the story and this time the audience accepts it and goes along with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ Why does this have to be in this category? It is the most ridiculous, nonsensical, nonsensical movie to date. A comedy with a message? Please. I am pretty sure that a great comedy can be a good message as well. I mean, there are plenty of good ones and even if this is a very bad one, at least it has one good message. And I do mean one: Don't drink and drive. The movie goes on a long chase through the desert and even though it does get good at the end when the police chase the car to a dead end, it has little to no relevance or meaning whatsoever to the story and its ending is ridiculous. The main character, Darryl (Matthew McConaughey) is a man who has an addiction to methamphetamines and he ends up killing his brother because of his addiction. Well he makes one last attempt at a recovery, he tries to call the rehab center but they don't pick up because the phones in the desert don't work. He then decides to run the desert but gets caught and loses his life. The rest of the movie is a chase through a desert to find a drug dealer. And they are all idiots who give Darryle his stuff. And all the bad things that happen because of this are just jokes for the sake of having a laugh. If you have the time, you can just watch the stupid chase scenes and think about how stupid the movie makes you think they are. It is so bad that the whole movie was a series of bad jokes and the characters are just bad, dumb, and stupid. And while the movie might have a very good message, it was completely thrown away for the story. If the movie was about a guy who wants to stop drinking and driving it would probably be a better movie, but as it is it is just very stupid and unnecessary. There are tons of good comedies out there but this is just not one of them. The soundtrack by Aaron Freeman is very bad and while he does make some good comedy, the voice acting is just terrible and you don't even care. And as for the acting, the movie had many great comedic actors. John Malkovich is great and you can really see why he was so good in the movie and I always liked Johnny Depp. Also Chris Rock, Robin Williams, and George Clooney were all really good in this movie. But they all are better actors and they all can do so much
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fantastic film from the writer/director of I Don't Want to Live on This Planet any day.  It's so sad that it wasn't released at it's initial intended release time because I'm sure it would've been the movie of the year!  It was funny, well made, and the cast (and actors) played it like a master class.  I recommend it to all fans of the genre. I Don't Think I Like This Planet Anymore is a great comedy about a group of people who go on vacation and stay in a hotel that has a very odd theme.  The hotel is run by a man named George who believes the guests have committed suicide and is afraid he might be the cause.  With the help of two young students who he believes to be the only people to survive, George begins to investigate the events that took place.  This story was hilarious.  There was also a very sweet ending! I don't think I like this planet any more - it was really well-made!  This movie is one of the funniest I've seen.  But, in a great way.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I really liked this movie. If you are a fan of this sort of film that does not use action and is more in the form of comedy and drama then you should really check this out. The movie is very much about romance and is not as serious as you might expect. The story is good and if you can get past the silliness of it all you will enjoy it. The characters and the romance and how it ties together was well done. I have not seen a film like this in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was really well done, good dialogue, great plot twists and action, and most of all, it gave us a new character, who we would have never seen before in the show if it hadn't been for the events in episode 5. The final 5 minutes was a little weird, I felt like it was going to drag out for a little too long, but hey, I wasn't expecting it to be that good.  A very good sequel to the show that I am looking forward to watching in the near future.  If you are looking for some good action/comedy, or to see a new side of Shou Tucker, this is a good way to start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Starring: _____ _____________ _____  Director: ___________________  (Ridley Scott, 1993) Starring:_____________ (Rendition, 1993), _________(Alien) Director:_________(Rid)   A film that's not as pretty or as slick as many of Scott's other films, Alien follows Ripley, a biologist who has discovered a strange new lifeform. Her crew is killed and she is taken prisoner. When she escapes, Ripley and Hicks, the crew's only pilot, are pursued by a space vessel, the Nostromo, a long-forgotten, flying space station that is still operating as a military base. The crew is forced to fight a war for their lives.  Ripley and the Nostrovia are rescued by an ancient space vessel and the two of them crash-land in a jungle. As they travel through the jungle, Riply encounters the creatures that the Nostrome has brought with it and it is there that Ripley makes a discovery that will determine the fate of the entire planet. It is here that Scott introduces his trademark gore and violence to the film, which would not have been out of place in a Ridley Scott film that had no blood and more gore than the Alien sequels combined. It was here that we encounter the xenomorph, a creature that has been used in the Alien movies and will not be used much in Alien3. -Paul W.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   I'll start off by saying this was one of the more difficult movies I've ever seen in my life. This movie was so damn hard to see, I didn't realize how much I was missing for over 3 hours until after I saw it and couldn't put the film down. This film was hard, very hard. And I felt that I was at the point where I was about to give up. The first half of the movie was a blast. There was an element of action that was quite refreshing in a movie like this where so much of the action in the movies comes from the chase scenes. And all the action was very entertaining as well. But there was a feeling that this would be the best half of this movie. But it didn't last long. As the final half came, it all became a bit of a let down. I'll admit I had to force myself to finish the movie. It's just too much to take in at one time. This was like a whole movie in the same time frame. But at the same point, I know it'll be quite a while before I'd watch a movie this long. But after seeing this one, I don't think I'll ever get a chance to see a movie longer than that. This is a very good movie, and I would recommend it if you're in the mood for a good chase movie. This will certainly be a movie that will be remembered. I can't say it's great. But I will say it has been worth watching if you are in the action/thriller category. I wouldn't say that I had a lot to say about this movie, but it was definitely a decent film to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife's parents came to see this one at the local theater in town. I had to come to this one with her because the local theaters don't have any great movies. The movie wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I was expecting a really good action film. It was more of a action film that involved a bunch of bad guys who get killed and get together to form a team and fight against evil. But it was not a bad movie. I think that it could have been better. But even still it was great.  My wife and I have a small boy, and he had a great time on the theater floor. This was not just a kid's movie that was for him. He loved the movie, and I loved it too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A solid family movie.  I'll give it 4 stars, because I'd have given it more if I didn't feel like the movie was all about one parent.   It was a family, so it could have been any of my kids, or my kids and I. The father could have done any of the scenes, or be anywhere. So, it was a solid film, but could have used more fatherly involvement and not just for the good part. It's really good, and there's lots to love, including the nice performances from all of the principal cast members, and a great song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It really is a very good movie. The main thing is the story with the evil overlord, that is really scary. Then there are the little moments of joy and humor, and there are good monsters to be killed. The only bad part is when the protagonist dies because they did not prepare enough poison in the hospital. But it can be forgiven, because it was very well written. There are two sequels in this series, the first one I have seen and I liked it a lot, but I am wondering if they did it for the money. The sequel I watched is even worse, it just is not funny at all. The third film is pretty good, but it is just too long. There is a sequel and a prequel that I have not seen but I would like to.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Love it! I was worried the ending would be confusing or disappointing, but it didn't really ruin it. The story, the acting, the cinematography and the suspense were all just on point. I don't know if it was the ending or the other parts that were just so damn good I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I was surprised to find how much I liked it. If you're a big fan of mysteries and paranormal events you'll love this movie, but also if you are interested in science fiction and you want something that has a little more going on than a sci-fi flick then I can't recommend this movie enough. The mystery and mystery elements were strong, the suspense was real and the action scenes were just right. If your a fan of mystery or suspense movies you'll really like this one.

It was just cool to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________________ I'd give a 10/10 to any of the original Star Wars movies, but the prequels are a total disaster. The story, especially in this part, is the worst I've ever seen. I mean seriously, what a waste of the talent of George Lucas, who did such a good job with the original trilogy. I'll give him props for the original prequel trilogy, which is fun and colorful, and also a good story, but this trilogy just gets in the way and gets in my way.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Watch: _________________________ _______________________  I am writing this review on a Samsung S3, and I've been on the road a couple days now. I have been wanting to try this movie for a while, but my cell service was bad and I don't always have service. I did get to it, though. It starts out with a very dark and ominous story, with plenty of blood and a creepy man with a beard. The plot is pretty straightforward and easy to follow, but it's kind of a one-note, over-the-top story. The movie ends in a way that doesn't work in my opinion. It's very predictable, but if I'd had to guess I'd say it ends with some sort of nuclear explosion, and the main character getting trapped underground and having to find his way out of the base. I'm sure it was necessary for the story to conclude, but I didn't feel like the ending did that job. And in the end, I just didn't see the point. So, I was really hoping for some sorta psychological effect or something. I got a couple good effects and good visuals, but not a whole lot of anything else. I don the movie and realize it's just not that great. It could have been a lot better if it had kept the dark mood and kept it dark throughout, but other than that I wasn't really impressed.  Did you enjoy this review? Yes No  Thank you for your feedback!  Thanks for your question!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just watched  "Shatter"  (or "Shattered," as it was originally titled) on a whim and was extremely impressed by what I saw. The story follows four teenagers who are in the process of building a new home for themselves on an abandoned ship that they're planning to use as a base for their future careers.  When the group first arrive on the ship, the first thing they notice is that it's a ghost ship. They then learn that the ship has been abandoned since a hurricane wiped out most of the population who were on board.  As the teens decide to take advantage of the situation and work together to build a base, they soon discover that the base is not quite what it appears to be.  The teens soon uncover that the ghost ship has an evil presence that is slowly killing the survivors.  To find the answers to the team's questions, the group must go into a mysterious part of the ship called the "catacombs," which is also known as the "hellhole."  Once they make it to the hellhole, they find a place of unimaginable evil and darkness.  In order to get out of the hell hole, the teens must work together and discover the identity of the evil entity that is plaguing the ship.  A wonderful blend of horror, mystery and comedy, "Shattering" is a solid, entertaining little horror movie.  It's got great performances, great visuals and great acting that are just what the doctor ordered for a summer comedy.  If you're a fan of horror movies, and especially of the modern, slasher genre, I can see why this is such a popular movie. I recommend this film, it's just really fun to watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie is a fantastic mix of comedy and horror. Its not a straight forward horror movie, and its not a comedy, but its a great mix that leaves you laughing with it.  I am amazed how many people can enjoy a horror movie as well as laugh.  An interesting point to note is that this is a real low budget movie, with a budget of around $35k.   The story follows a group of people who come together when they decide to go to a haunted house.  These are people who have no idea what to expect, including what the house is actually like.  The characters are all very likable and you get a nice mixture of comedy, horror, and horror comedy.  I really thought that the ending was really good, and I was surprised by how short it was.  This is a must see horror movie for all.  (This movie also has an online version)   Here is a quick clip: For more on this film you can visit http://hauntedhouse.tv/

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about poor quality: _________________________________ I've seen several movies over the years, and even enjoyed most of them. Now, with my latest purchase of this movie, I feel as if I've found a great gem. The movie has a bit of a "hollywood" feel to it, and there are a few scenes that I just can't get past. I'm hoping this is due to the fact that the film is not that good, which is the case. However, I'm also hoping that there are some people out there who are fans of classic, cheesy, over the top, over-the-top action films, and will dig this one. I'd have to say that this movie is definitely one of my favorites. I wouldn't say that the movie has "good" acting, since the characters do have some charisma, but the actors definitely do the best they can. The acting seems to be a "typical" over thetop action movie, but it seems that this is just what they do to get the biggest paycheck possible, without really trying to deliver something more. I found the movie pretty entertaining, and it is one of those movies that you can sit through and keep on laughing. I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes over the high action, over over the over-under action movies, which includes me. If you're looking for a classic cheesy action film, try this out. I highly recommend it. I really enjoyed watching this one, and I would recommend it to any movie fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Titan A.E.  is a great movie. The only problem I have with this movie is the plot. You know, all these super heros trying to save the Earth, and then the whole thing gets ruined by a huge space ship. But that's not what makes this movie so good. Yes, it has a pretty good story, and yes, the end was really cool. But the way they make you feel when it all falls apart, the way the story ends without a real conclusion. It just really sucks.  So yeah, that's why I don't like the movie. You can get this movie on DVD if you want to buy a DVD of a movie you don't really like. Just don't watch it until the DVD comes out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ The movie is good for the most part. There are a few funny scenes (which I liked), the main character is likable, and some of the monsters and characters were pretty awesome. The movie was not the best in terms of the visual effects, and the acting is fairly bland. The story was very basic but did not make me bored or dissatisfied. I thought the monster and story was pretty well done, with some pretty cool monsters (or were they supposed to be cool?). The final battle was pretty neat too, so there is that. I think this would be a good choice for fans of the show.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I can't believe how great this movie is! It is an amazing story that was filmed on location in Japan with the full cooperation of the people. They have the most beautiful costumes and lighting. It's very hard to see them in this movie because they are very much hidden. The costumes alone are enough to get you interested, but they are actually the reason why I want to watch this movie more than any other. The story is really easy to understand and once you know the way they go through their story it's easy to follow. Even if you don't understand the characters, it's still enjoyable to watch as you watch the amazing performances they give. It can get depressing and scary, but at the same time it's entertaining and easy to watch, and the movie is about 6 hours long, so it's an amazing amount of entertainment you get from this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ A big time action movie from the nineties, this is one of the few movies where a group of elite troops get called back from Vietnam to stop an assassination. I like it! The first half is basically just a bunch of guys going around doing stuff, and the second half gets a bit dark and really ramps up the violence as a few bad guys start showing up. It's a shame this kind of movie isn't popular anymore, but a great action movie nonetheless. Rating: 8.0/10  Advertisements
Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ You got a great movie. I can't believe the quality of this movie. It was made with passion, heart and the perfect use of the 3D technology to enhance the emotions of the characters. This movie will keep you in suspense, it will leave you in tears and in a state of wonderment. The acting is top notch, and the action scenes and the storyline is just fantastic. This is one movie that you will see and remember for a long time.  RATING  WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?: 9  HISTORY HAS A WAY OF TELLING YOU SOMETHING: 9 . I love the story. It's about a man, who is forced to go to a distant land. After a failed attempt to get home, the man is forced into a desperate situation, with his only friend being a man who also suffers from an extreme form of "rejection syndrome". The guy wants to leave. The man wants to stay, and so they must make their way through the land, meeting people, learning and discovering new things. It all builds up to a grand climax. The story is very good. The actors are very good, and I especially enjoyed watching the friendship between the two leads. I also liked the fact that the man has a gun on him, and that it is his job to protect his friend. The guy does have a certain weakness. He can't stand seeing himself as a "bitch" and tries to help other people (the only way he knows how) and is very weak on his own. It is the weakness, however, that gives him his strength. He is determined to stay together with his friend, to be with his people and to protect them. He has a friend who is also suffering from the same condition, but is not as strong as he is. They are determined to find a cure for the illness, but are also determined to protect their people. It really is just a story of two friends, but the ending is pretty awesome. It makes the story feel so real, it is like a story out of the movie. A great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Lego Batman Movie' is an excellent family film. It's not necessarily a super-family friendly movie (that's something that some of you will be quick to correct me on) but it has its moments.  If you've seen the previous Lego films you'll know what to expect from this film.  I loved the original Lego Batman movies so I was thrilled to see this take place on a Lego set. The Lego set is really well-made and looks just like a brick house!  The Lego characters are all incredibly well-crafted and I particularly like the Joker, which looks like he's just a Lego version of the original Batman character. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hannibal has a unique style in that it's an adaptation of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon that has been well-received by audiences so far.  What is unique about it though is that it has a distinctively Italian flavor to it.  It's interesting to see a movie that isn't a direct adaptation of another book, it does give us an opportunity to learn about the Italian culture and food (a subject I think that most people know something about). Hannibal has some of the best action set pieces you'll find in a movie and this is an easy movie to recommend to horror fans.  If you're a fan of Italian films then you should definitely give this one a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is the best and most faithful entry in the Star Wars series.  It was an easy choice for my favorite.  I liked the story more than "The Force Awakens".  However, it didn't hit the heart strings in the way I wanted it to.  However it was good fun and if you like Star Wars this is a great movie.  The main reason I didn't have more time to watch this is because my work schedule would take over and I didn?t want to miss out on a movie I enjoyed so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ What more can be said about this film other than it is really well done with some great effects and an interesting story. It's a good little action flick with some really great chase scenes that get more intense as it goes on. The plot is a simple one that follows the adventures of a group of soldiers and their friend that is sent to find the mysterious group that was terrorizing the small town of Manker. I really like how the film goes through the stages that each character goes through and we get a lot of character development for all of them, though some of them take a bit longer to get going than others. It really is one of those movies that you have to see to fully appreciate. _________________________ Check out some of our previous reviews over at our Movie Review Section.

If you have ever watched a documentary on the Holocaust, or on the genocide, or anything like this, then you will know that it is very difficult to convey something so intense, so horrifying and so devastating to a normal audience. You will want to scream, you will want tears, and you will feel like this man is going to kill you. It is a very powerful film and I highly recommend that you watch it." -Alessandro Bianchi  Rated:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Feb 23, 2016 by Michael Rottenheimer.    Movies, the most important work of art ever created, are often seen as entertainment, but art is rarely entertainment, it is life. When the director, writer, producer, and cinematographer of The Room are being arrested for fraud, one wonders if The Room is actually a movie. Or if, as in the case of director Tommy Wiseau, it really is a real movie about a real person who made a real room.  Advertisement  For those who don't know who Tommy Wiseaux is, or who are new to this blog, here is a short synopsis. Tommy Wise's parents divorced when he was five, and since then Tommy has been raised by his mother in the suburbs. After a series of financial difficulties, Tommy's mother has started making money again, and she has been buying homes, renovating them, and then selling them. Now, with Tommy in middle school, she is looking to buy a house in a new town, and so Tommy decides to sell his home and move. In the process, Tommy discovers a room in the house that belongs to another person, that room is a shrine. Tommy finds the room, and, in order to access the shrine, he must enter it. Once he enters, he becomes convinced that the room in which he is currently in is, in fact, the same room that another person was once in.  on Tommy Wise-aux: an interview with Tommy Wise and his family  I'll start with this. If that's true, then it's a miracle, a miracle of the imagination. The other day I was walking through the airport and a guy came up to me and he asked me if I had seen The Room. It's really interesting. We had a conversation like that and then he came up and he said, "You should see this movie, it's really weird, it makes your hair stand on end and it's got a good director" and he's right. The Room, though, is not a movie, and if it were a movie it would be a movie that was just about Tommy Wise. I'm saying this from the position of someone who is someone who hasn't seen the movie. I don't see it, I have never seen the film. I heard it was really good when I was in high school.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "The Devil's Advocate" is a compelling movie. It deals with a subject matter that many are reluctant to deal with. People tend to take the Devil's side. What is the Devil? Is the Devil real? Is he a demon? Is this a real film? I would argue that it is a real movie. With an interesting story that is more than believable. It is interesting to see who will win and what they will do to each other. I think it is also good to see how the Devil can get people to do what he wants. This film is interesting. The Devil's advocate is a movie that I could see myself going to see when I am old.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Memento'  is a movie about memory, and yet it also deals with things like the meaning of life.   I was very confused and not sure how to react to the ending, but I had a lot of fun and it made me think about what my life would be like if I was dead, how would I react to everyone I've met?  It was such an interesting and intriguing end. So, what I think: 'Mental illness' is something that many people think they don't have, but it does affect a lot more people than they think it does.   You will probably notice that most of the people on screen are not normal people.   They are not exactly 'psychological patients', so they can't talk about their illness.   Their illness isn't obvious, so it doesn't necessarily show on the surface, but some of them have mental illness and it shows in their behavior.   It is a very difficult disease to diagnose and most of them don't understand what is wrong.   A lot of the film is about them trying to find out, and it also shows their love for each other, but at the end, they can barely understand each other anymore.   At the end of the day, it's still a movie and you have to watch it for yourself.   If you have problems with depression or anxiety, you may not find anything new, but this is a movie with so much heart.   I gave this movie a 4.5/5, because there were some things that I didn't understand and it didn't make a lot about my life more obvious.   Hopefully, a DVD or Blu-Ray of this film will have better and clearer explanations.   For now, it is an interesting movie about how a movie can be a representation of someone's life and the meaning behind it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Hey, I'm a film critic and a huge fan of action films.  I was able to watch this film and I absolutely loved it. __________________________ So now that you've seen this, I hope you can agree that I must be one of the most original of film critics on this planet.    This film is one of those rare gems in a genre which has been known to do that thing that no other genre can do well, which is to get boring for over half a century, and then, suddenly, a film is good.  I really did think the film would get boring because it's always been very formulaic, but no!  This was so different, so creative.  There were a few problems, some of which were more important than others.  The biggest problem I had was the fact that this film was completely unnecessary.  It's really a case of "if we can make it as convoluted as possible, then why not?".  We spend the entire film talking about how cool it was for these two bad-ass action characters to get in some gun fights, but we don't get a chance to see how it's done.  If you know how a fight scene works, then you know that the way the fight is shown in this film is like a badly done and rushed stunt.  They go from one extreme to the other and it's just really bad.  This is true for all of the scenes, from the initial scene where the two bad guys have to shoot a guy, to the gun fight where the main characters and one of them's buddies come across a bad guy in a tree who turns out to be a sniper, to all the gun fights.  When I saw the film, I didn't like the way it was shot.  We get shots of the two guys shooting each other in the hand, and we see them both in close-ups and it looks bad.   However, when we look at the film from the viewpoint of the guy in the tree, it looks like they have this great set-up to an awesome gun fight, and when the bad guys get close, the camera cuts away and then back in so quickly that I think it might be to show something, but it just looks like the bad guy's arm is going to go through the tree or something.  However, that's not the only problem.  That's not even the biggest problem.   The fact that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed it, and have been thinking about it for days. It has a fantastic set piece at the very end with the car chase and a very tense shootout. The movie starts off with a scene in a diner, where a mobster and his cronies are talking, and are interrupted by a stranger. That stranger is Johnny Weissmuller. Johnny is a veteran, who has been through a lot of the roughest parts of life, and has just broken up with a girl. He tells the crowd at the diner that he is not looking for any work, and they all nod. He has never made a living, but he is doing this because he is so upset over the breakup. He talks about his friends, his family, and his kids, and gives them a rundown of how he will pay them back. As he speaks he is standing in the doorway, with his hands in his coat pockets. He enters the diner, and the gang starts shooting at him. It goes down like this: a girl shoots first, killing Johnny. Then there is a huge brawl, and Johnny is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find himself on a highway, and a police officer is shooting at an armored car. Johnny jumps out of the car, and jumps into the armored car, with the other gang members behind him. As they take cover behind the car the car explodes, killing everyone, including Johnny. The ending is fantastic, and I will always remember the car and the guy in it. I hope someone makes a remake. This movie will be a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was so happy to find a movie called "Stripes". It was great to finally see the film by "Stanley Kubrick" and "Howard Hawks" (Director/Screenplay) in theaters. Stanley Kubrick is a real talent and the best director that I ever saw. And I loved Howard Hawks as well. It was an excellent movie. I only wish there was a DVD version. This was the first movie of my childhood and I still remember the moment I saw it. I was only 4 years old when I watched this movie and was fascinated by it. This film is based on an author known as "Strozier" and he is a writer that describes the lives of three black males who were in the New York City Police Department during the Harlem riots. I still love this film to this day and it remains one of my favorite movies. So I am recommending this film as one of the best movies to see in the year 2000. It's an excellent film and I recommend it as a good introduction to black film.  If you like movies, then you need to check out "Stripses" and the movie "The Black Banners". These two movies were great films to watch at a young age and you could watch them again and again and have the same emotions they caused in me. They had this old school feel and it was good to watch these two movies that I watched as a child. Overall "St Stripses (2000)" was a great film that was worth watching. It is based off a well-known book and it is a great movie that you could enjoy when you are young. I would recommend this film just because I loved this film and loved it so much that I can't help but recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I watched this one at first as a kind of a prequel of sorts (to "The Abyss") to the original film. I've heard a lot of good things about it, so I wanted to give it a chance, and I guess it was a good decision. In a way, it felt very similar to "The Curse Of The Abyss" in that it was one of those movies where the plot just kind of drags on and on without any real progress. You're left wondering just what is going to happen next. That may have been my problem, but it still is a good film. The acting is very good, as are the effects, and it's got a really cool visual style. This was the first film I saw directed by Robert Rodriguez. He is a filmmaker who I didn't see until he made "El Mariachi," and I was very impressed with his work there. In "El Manana," he created a film that was more "B-grade" than most, but I still think he has some real good stuff in him. "The Devil's Backbone" is more or less the same thing, but there's definitely more variety. While I'm usually not a huge fan of the "hard-boiled" genre, there's plenty of that here and it all works quite well. The special effects are pretty good, and the special effects in general are always good. The film is a little slow and boring in places, but not all of it is bad. It's just a slow, boring film. Also, the soundtrack has a few good songs that I enjoyed, including "Boom Boom" by The Rolling Stones. I'm going to have to see "The Devils Backbone 2" again to check out some more Rodriguez. ____________________________________________________ "You can always trust me, I've been through it all." - The Devil's backbone

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pomme le terriere, " The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Sergio Leone. This is an excellent movie, especially for fans of Sergio Leone.   This is an Italian-American classic. There's a great scene early in the film in which Robert De Niro is walking down a street and there's a little boy who stands next to him who says something. De Nirlo then turns and looks at the child. The scene is really funny because I've never seen this scene used before in a movie that I saw in the 1980's. DeNiro comes to the conclusion that the boy is speaking to him in Spanish and when he hears it he says "Well what do you want?" DeNirlo replies "I want you to put that man in his place!" The little boy looks at DeNire and says "Yes!" This is really a wonderful scene because DeNario plays a very shy man, but he ends up telling the kid something. I also like the way DeNorello's little brother looks after the kid and treats him in a very nice way.   The boy doesn't really seem to notice him, although he's obviously a young boy and probably just a fan of the guy. The fact that the kid knows the name of the man he's addressing and doesn't look down on him because of it is a nice touch. The kid does seem to be jealous of De Nario's success, but it's something that can't be helped. It's a small part in this great movie.  I found this to be a really funny movie, although I'm not really a Sergio Leone fan. But, I found this scene very funny. It seems to me that DeNino has done the right thing by asking the kid to put the man down, but then he turns around and says 'Who are you?' the kid asks him who he is and the man says 'I'm Sergio Leone.' And I'm thinking how silly this scene is and De Nino responds by saying "I don't know what this guy is talking about." And then the kid looks at him and says, "Sergio Leone, yes you!" It seems like the guy just doesn't get the joke at the end of the day and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out, but this scene was funny in a way that few other scenes are. This is a fun movie for fans. It

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film about life and death, a simple but complex theme of a man who, in order to survive, turns to drugs and death to achieve a higher quality of life, where the main character has a friend who lives on the other side of the law. The film doesn't rely on its plot too much, as it focuses on an important theme, that of living on, to avoid dying. It's one of those films that will make you think, and while the main protagonist has many flaws, the film is still a very good one. Watch it, and you'll know what to look out for in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie is always worth a look.  I have a special place in my heart for Star Wars.  It is the series I have watched the most in my life.   When I heard that Star Wars Episode 8  was being released I was so excited.  My wife and I both had Star Wars on our minds.    So I was anxious about going to see it, I did not have high hopes for it, and I thought it was going to be an okay movie.  Then, I was shocked!  It is good!   This movie is good.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Star Wars  has some of my favorite scenes, and it is funny.  I was excited to see what happened.  There was a brief introduction to some of the characters from previous movies and an episode.  Leia, Finn, and Poe Dameron were the main characters.  The movie starts off with a bang.  It starts off strong.  Han Solo  is not Han Solo.  He is a lot more cocky and confident.  Luke  gets his butt kicked by this wannabe.  They have a short sparring match where he is unable to take the blaster from him.  Chewbacca  also shows up and tries to steal Han's blaster.  In the fight with Han Solo they both get into a fight and they almost destroy each other.  Finally, Luke gives in.  But this is not a defeat.  Now that he is using his wits to outsmart this wimp, he has found his place in the universe. He is now in the Rebellion.  I think this is one good moment.  When Luke and Han have their first lightsaber duel, it looks so amazing.  A great battle between two good characters. The rest of the movie was pretty good as well. The characters are good. I liked Leia and Finn. They are good, intelligent, and funny. Luke and Chewbaffe  are still funny and funny in the movie. Their banter is funny too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved classic sci-fi, but I've always had a thing for the early films of Ridley Scott. I think it's fair to say that he's one of the few filmmakers who could have made The Terminator as well as he did. I've watched the original and it's brilliant and Scott is just so good at making an exciting sci- fi movie.  As I was watching the new film, I was pretty blown away by the first scene. There was this huge alien ship that was landing and we all knew it was going to be a big space battle. I was kind of expecting a huge space battle, not a small, intimate space battle with a huge alien spaceship. What we got, instead, was a really tense, action packed space battle between the two alien fighters. There are tons of shots of the fighter and its crew shooting at each other and we get so much great action in this first scene, which made the next scene that much more exciting. . :.  .

I watched it twice, so I can't really describe how it's different than anything else. I'll try to do a bit better describing it than saying that it's "a" magical movie and that it brings back the wonder of the fairytale. The animation is wonderful, the songs are beautiful, and it's well acted.  I've seen this in 3 different theaters, so the quality of the images may vary. In theaters 1 and 3, the screen was a bit dim and the picture quality was not perfect, but this was a little different from the 2nd time around. The 2nd place was in a very tiny theater that was pretty good. :) I also really like this movie, because it reminds me a lot of "Aladdin" (Disney) in the Disney world.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ Well, well, well... look at all the "bad reviews" I got in the first few days after I posted the first trailer on the official website. The "reviewers" were mostly just going off their own, personal biases. But in my defense, I wasn't making it up. This movie was NOTHING like the other films I had seen in the last few months, as I was really expecting to like this movie just as much as I have enjoyed most of the films I saw during that time. But that's exactly what happened. And because I was wrong, I'm going to tell you why... (WARNING: SPOILERS)...So this movie, I think, will really turn people away. After all, I was expecting a little too much. I mean, these are all films that were really good and I really liked, like, 99% of them. But this movie is not one of those films. And I'm not entirely sure how I feel about that. Because, as much I enjoyed this film, I also really hated it. And that's something I can't really do. But when I was watching this movie I had this strange feeling that I was just watching another mediocre horror movie. But then I realized that it's not like that at all. And it's actually much worse than that. I guess, to be honest, I thought it was a really great movie when I first saw it. But I quickly realized that I just watched another really mediocre horror film. But it's just that you'll start wondering why it took a year to make another one of these films, and I'll be sitting in my chair wondering "what if" and you'll just start feeling sad that it couldn't be as good as the last one. So I guess you could say I think it's good enough. And if you're feeling like it's too good to be true, then let me know, I'd like to hear from you. I'll keep working on my list of movies that have been really disappointing. Just wait, it'll be the first one on the list that you want to see too. I think.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ [A spoiler-filled review that, like the film itself, can't be spoiled: it will spoil it, if you are not interested in the content.] In the end, a lot of people are talking about the film. What is so great about it is that it has a message. "I won't judge you for your weight, if your heart is in the right place". What is not so great is that the movie is only about a guy, who is supposed to make a friend and who is also supposed to meet the girl, even though it seems like his own heart is already somewhere else. The girl's name is Mariana (Maria Elena de Jesus), and she is a bit "different", as she doesn't really care about the boy and her parents are rather strict and cruel. In fact, it seems she is trying to hide her true self, but we see some kind of feeling when we see her "secret" and that is when we realize she is different. This is why she is so interested in these "normal" guys. And that is the reason why she also doesn't show her true feelings, even after they get her to go to this place and to this party. She can't show it, even if she knows it is not right and that, she is actually not the one, who should be happy here. So she can only do everything she can to hide that. And this makes the movie, about someone, who's a bit different, who has some problems, who tries to meet someone, just to be happy, who even though his heart is somewhere else, he still tries to do what he can and do it the best way he can. The whole movie can be told like that. I just loved this movie. It was so short and it was so sweet, so charming, so unique. It is a great movie, that has a great message, that I can't think of anything else than a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* The best thing about this movie is it is a family oriented film. The story begins by showing the children playing in the field as it dries up in the spring. They then play catch with one another. In the middle of the film, one of the girls, the oldest, gets sick and stops. She has no friends or family to help her. The other two sisters go outside to help and find her unconscious. In her arms is her baby brother, which is then named. One of the sisters carries the child in a sling and they begin to bring him to the doctor. The nurse, the doctor and the police come to the scene. The two sisters are accused of murder and charged with the crime. The next scene begins with the two sisters looking for their brother in the hospital as they are being held in a cell. In this cell is their brother. He appears to have a strange look on his face as he stares out the window of the cell at a strange sight. The girls are confused as to what their brother is seeing and begin to play with their brother as they look for him. They get closer and closer to the window until finally the window breaks and they see him on the ground in the water. The scene then cuts back to the girls and the doctor who have discovered their brother missing. They take him to a hospital as the police and nurse investigate. The sisters appear confused and start to question the doctor when the doctor tells them they have to wait until the mother arrives. He tells them to wait for their mother to arrive. The mother comes in and tells the girls they have brought back their brother who was born at night. She tells them the next day will be a special day and will have a special place for him at home. The sister's have no idea what is going on but the mothers words seem to help. They start playing with their mother as she sits in her living room. They see that the doctor has been trying to communicate with his daughter. He has also been calling her by name. They play around together. One sister is playing with her sister and she has a book. They begin to look over their books together and as she is about to read, the doctors daughter appears from behind them. The girl tells her mother that they had been playing so hard she forgot to play outside. The doctor tells his daughter that they were going to play hide and seek all over again. She runs into the house and they all hide in the closet

It's a great story and I'm glad that it's getting some attention in the movie community. I'm not the biggest John Carpenter fan, but I've seen every movie and this one is really great.  I'm not sure if people have noticed, but there's a reason why I always go for John Carpenter in all of my horror movies.  You can't see this movie without having seen Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, which is one of my all-time favorite movies.    I just recently read a very good interview with John Carpenter about the making of the movie, and I think it's very interesting and worth reading.   I hope that you will go and see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good film about the true story of a woman whose husband was executed for murdering a man, and he is a good guy who was wrongly executed, and then she gets pregnant. And she tries to find a way to save the baby, but the guy who is trying to kill her says he will stop if she gives him the baby. The whole movie is very emotional and the ending is very, very powerful. Rating: 8.0/10 Director's Notes: This is a film that is very personal for me and also very controversial. I am very interested in seeing how the real story of this movie, is treated in the film itself. I've had an interest in this film for a while and I was finally able to see the film after being interested in the story for many years. The movie is not just a love story, there are many other layers and there are people involved who are not really portrayed at all and yet it is a very compelling story that is well-crafted and well-acted. There is a lot of real emotion in this movie and it does feel like a film about a tragedy. If you want to learn more about the real people and the real events of the story, then you should definitely check this out. So... I would say this film is like "Shattered Glass," but it doesn't really have the same quality of story. The story is actually much more personal and less about the big political issues of the day and the people involved in the assassination are also more "real" and less "supernatural." If you have never heard of this story, I would suggest checking out this film. The film does a great job in telling this story. One of the more interesting things about this movie is that, while the movie does depict the actual events of this case, the film is also set in the present. The characters that appear in the movie are actually very different from what you would see in a historical documentary. As mentioned earlier, it is very interesting to watch as well as read how different people felt about this event and it is interesting to see how this story has changed and has moved on over the years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Jedi" (2017) is a perfect example of how to make a good film in 2017. Star Wars is back. The "good" side has finally caught up to the "good bad" side. The movie was so good that it was a hard decision for me to choose it as my favorite of all time. So I give it 3-2, but only because that's all I had to choose from the 6 I've seen so far. I can't wait to see the next installment of the "Star Wars" franchise.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Thank you to all of those that supported the project and especially to the backers. To all the filmmakers who have been inspired to take the film in a different direction, it was a pleasure meeting you. The best news is that we have a good shot of finishing it and getting it out into the world. But, it is our responsibility as filmmakers to find ways to continue to make a difference in the world through our films. So... here's a movie I would like to see again!  Report this for removal mr. prouner 12 days ago. Thanks for your comment! This was my favorite movie.  No one in the film is a psychopath. It is a thriller. . -  The best and worst of a movie are found in the opening minutes. ,  "You can't always see what's in front of your eyes" -George Bernard Shaw, "The best part of this movie for me is the opening. It really does set the tone for the rest of the film, which is really a very bleak, noirish noir. It's very well directed and the story is very well told. I liked that it doesn't have a lot of action and that it was shot almost entirely with film. It didn't have lots of close ups and it didn't take advantage of the many, many cameras used in the movie.", "When you watch "Gonzo" (and this is a very high praise), it is clear that you are watching an incredible film that has a lot going on. And the film has been shot in a very unique style that is unusual in the contemporary noir genre. The film is also very well acted by some really top talent, including Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. I feel that if the film were released at the time, it would have been a major hit. It has been rumored that director Charles Bronson, who won an Oscar for "The Outlaw Josey Wales" directed this film, but this has not been confirmed. However, some of his friends have confirmed that he directed the film. So I would imagine that it might be a little like "The Spanish Prisoner" starring Robert Mitchay, as well as the French crime noir, "Brigadoon" starring Alain Delon, in terms of the style of its cinematography. "Gone Baby Gone" stars Robert Mitchup as a detective whose son has been kidnapped and

The Movie Review:  I'm not sure if I have ever seen a more beautiful and well done animated film in my life than this. There is just something about the movie that makes it stand out in a field full of very similar pictures, and this film is just that, beautiful and very well made.  for anyone that has never seen this movie, it is a perfect blend of animation and live action with a very unique and fun story.  the story takes place in a post apocalyptic future. In this future the world is ravaged by a massive war and has been for hundreds of years. One of the major things that separates this from many other post apocalyptic movies that I have seen is the animation. the CGI is very realistic and believable. the animation is very fluid and fluid, like nothing else I have used in a movie. I have not seen any other movie that is this good at what they are doing, and I haven't seen any good post apocalyptic movie since Apocalypse Now, in fact, all I have had to show for a good post apocalypse movie since the 70's has been either Die Hard and Armageddon. The other thing that separates the animation from the other live action post apocalypse movies is that the animation has not been completely washed out. the watercolor and brushwork used in the film is very natural and realistic. The art style of the animation, however, is very different. It is very much like the look of an old black and white movie. This movie is not one of those movies where there are giant trees and huge buildings, it has a very natural look. The animation is great, the action is great and the art style is
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ The first half of the film has very little to do with the film that comes after. It's a comedy that takes place in the town of the same name in the outskirts of New England in 1969, with a guy who is an outcast in his town, a girl who is outcast, a guy with an idea and a girl with a gun. The film, like most of the works in the first half, is a throwback to a kind of pre-Halloween/post-Hitchcock/Halloween style that many of us grew up on. Most of the actors in this film are from the "Abe Vigoda" era. The movie, like "A Bug's Life," is filled with the kind of fun, slapstick comedy that had been making the rounds since the silent era. For all of this style and the fact that it was made in 1968, "The Thing from Another World" is a pretty good horror film. There's a bit of a twist to the ending that adds some tension to the end of the movie, and it is very well made, especially by the cast, but it doesn't really add anything to the film other than a twist. The acting in this movie is top notch from the first time through. They do not seem to care that much about the audience being in on the joke and it makes it more fun to watch than any other film I have seen that relies on jokes. The cinematography and special effects are very good, and if anything, the twist of the ending is one of the best that the film offers. This is a great, fun, but flawed film. It has a lot of potential, but the story is a bit shallow and doesn't stand out much. The fact that the movie takes place over half a century ago, makes it seem like it is a prequel of sorts, and the movie's ending is a nice surprise. The only way that it fails, is that it is pretty hard to follow. The characters aren't really developed enough to really care about, and that's a big reason why I didn't like the movie. I was disappointed in how little of the story got explained in the film. All that is presented is a "thing from another world" that goes on a rampage and a character that goes looking for it, and there isn't anything to really get excited about. I also felt that the fact the film focuses on a single character made it less

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace - May 15, 1999 This is a great movie. It's like the greatest movie ever made, and the best part is, that was the whole reason why I was even interested in the saga in the first place. I don't mean to brag, but you are watching one of the greatest stories ever told and I was actually excited when I watched it for the first time because I didn't have any expectations for it and I figured it was going to be like any other film. There is not a single moment when it breaks its stride. It is a joy to watch and if you're anything like me, I'd put it on top of the list of the top 10 best films ever. I have the soundtrack and every scene is a hit. - February 15, 2005Greatest Movie of All Time  Reviewer: dave_e - favorite favorite favorite - August 7, 2004  Subject: Good... But not great? This movie is okay. I've read that George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner intended this to be a sequel to The Empire Strikes Back, and indeed it is similar in structure. But it's not quite as good as the Empire Strikes Out.   While The Phantom of the Opera is not as good, it is a lot better than Phantom Menaces.   to be fair, a lot of these movies are pretty awful. I agree with the reviewer above me that there are not a lot good movies in this series.   the only way you could ever call it a bad movie is if you can't think of any good film in the Star Wars Saga. - August 07, 2004Good... But Not great?  Review of the film by a movie critic.  , I mean I like the film. It has a lot more going on and the acting is very good, especially some of the villain's. I was not expecting much from a film with a prequel plot and a huge cast. As I've said before, Star Wars is a fantasy and action/adventure, the whole series. I could have seen it as a series that ended when Star Wars Episode VI came out (Star Wars is over 50 years old) because at the time, nobody was interested in it. In the next two movies, the series was rehashed in the public eye and it got a whole new life.     This film, the first two, are good. It
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ ___________  1.1 out of 4 stars.  (The movie is bad, I don't know why this is one of the very few reviews, but I am sure you have a feeling what I am talking about.)   The movie was ok, I did like it a lot. I got a nice laugh out of it. The film has an old-school feeling to it, like it was made in 1983. The story has a few things I liked (I thought it was funny when the little old lady was trying to convince her daughter to go back to sleep, and the old woman went out and got a big rock out of the closet and threw it at her daughter, and then jumped up and down and ran around to get the rock so she could throw it at them. It was hilarious. It reminded me a little of the old "Pound Puppies". The ending of the movie was very cheesy. It is hard to tell from this review, but maybe the ending was a little slow-paced. I loved the idea of a man who is trying to get some help with a daughter that has the brain of a three year old. The guy went to a psychologist, and a doctor, and it was all very interesting. I also enjoyed the music in the movie, the score was really good.   What annoyed me was when a man's wife came home from her job as a nurse and told him that she is having a very difficult time with her son. She has been acting very weird lately, and sometimes she doesn't come home. He thinks that she has had some kind of mental breakdown. After this, the movie doesn't really change, it is just an old guy trying to find a way to help his daughter. I do enjoy the old man character, but at the end, he is only there to be a supporting character.  :-O  :- O  I liked this movie, I just thought the ending sucked. I think this was a great idea, but the ending ruined it for me. I love old school movies, especially the horror movies, but this was so, so cheesy. The ending didn't make any sense to me at all. I liked the premise, the story is good. It doesn't hurt to see old movies, and I will probably watch this one again. If it were any better, I would love to see it again, but it was awful to watch
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Share  Tweet   Anal Sex and the Great Wall of China  Director: Zhang Yimou  Release Date: October 16, 2013  The Great Wall is a fantasy epic starring American star Matt Damon as a man who is turned into an enormous beast during an expedition to the mysterious and mysterious Great Wall. This is a story that is truly epic in scale and is an allegory for the world around us.  After the Great War, Matt Damon's character, Zhang San (not to be confused with the Chinese wall), has spent his life in the wilderness. One day he is suddenly summoned back to civilization to protect a child who is going through a rough time. While he's not the best protector of the child, his mission is not completely a waste.  to see the new trailer, head on over to this page!   In an interview with the Huffington Post, Zhang Yipou revealed that, "the film is not a historical epic. It is an exploration of the human condition. It's also about the physical nature of our nature. We should have courage to explore our own nature."  So, while the movie doesn't explore the history of the wall directly, there are plenty of images that reference it, both in the film and in the marketing materials.   "I didn't want to create something that looked like a movie from the past, but something from the present. In this kind of place, it doesn't matter what kind of history you've got. You need to understand the way the world has changed." -Zhang YimOU   Zhang YIMOU , director of the film, revealed that while he didn't see the wall as a historical object, it was important to him to show what it is like to be an outsider.   To explore this subject, Zhang spent five years exploring the mountains that surround the wall in Beijing, creating a series of documentary style images that are both realistic and poetic, to be sure.   But, I am here to tell you that the movie is absolutely epic, both literally and figuratively. "There is a lot to say about the Great wall of China, so much that I don't think I'll be able to tell it all in this short time
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Did you like this movie? Why? ___________ I like the idea that there is an afterlife. But I just don't understand it. It's like going to the dentist and having to pay for a tooth extract.  Please give the movie a chance. I think that it is a good idea and it has a nice look. What I don't like is the way that the main character, Kevin, talks. It sounds like it was done in a high school classroom, but that doesn't sound good. A couple of the dialogue lines also sound like they were recorded from a video game. I'm guessing that the movie was filmed in a studio. I think that this film will appeal to many people, but I think the idea and the story will not be accepted by everybody. In particular, I don' think that people who are scared of ghosts will like this film.

This movie isn't perfect, there are some bad special effects, a small scene where we find out what would happen if a man were to live in an alley for the rest of his life (he dies), but otherwise this is a solid movie. The writing is okay and the acting is good. The whole plot can be taken a little literally, but it makes for a more interesting story than most. I give it a 3. _______________________________________________________   WARNING: There are minor spoilers for the first 2 hours of the movie.   ______________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ The best, most fun movie I've seen since that weird little film called "The Little Mermaid" (I thought that was a joke at first but it's actually a good film. I think the movie will always be loved as much as the little mermaid, though). I loved the idea of an animated film, something that would entertain me without being over the top. It is like being a kid again in a big old movie theater watching a good cartoon. The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the animation was amazing. It's the kind of movie you would think would be made with a lot of money, but I think it's the result of an amazing group of people working on it. I'm not going to get into spoilers but I wanted to let everyone know that it's not the usual Disney animated movie. In fact, I think this is one of the best animated movies ever made. In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made by Disney. This is a movie where the best cartoon that has ever been made is used. I can't wait to see it on my new VCR and to be honest I'm really glad I made this review so I can keep up with what's going on in the world of Disney. And I think we all can agree that this movie is for fans of Disney and Pixar as well. That is not to say that this film is perfect and it's probably not worth seeing for the other kind of fans, but if you love Disney and are looking for something different and more fun, you should definitely give this a try. If you are a Disney fan, this film may be for you. If that's not you, well, you just haven't been paying attention or you're like me and you haven't found the Disney movie that makes you feel like you're a kid once again. ______________________________________________________ The Little Mermaid is based on the Walt Disney movie "The Princess and the Frog". It was directed by David O. Selznick and produced by Charles L. Grant and Irving Thalberg. The story follows the adventures of the mermaid Ariel as she seeks to be free from the curse that has cursed her and her father and brother. She finds this in the kingdom of the prince, who has a son who she falls in love with. Unfortunately the prince falls in lust with his own mermaid princess and her brother, and is willing to take both of them to the bottom of the sea where

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We Need to Talk about Kevin" is a nice enough movie. We Need to talk about Kevin (2013) is a charming and funny tale about a man who is about to be released from prison who is trying to get in touch with his ex-wife and find out where she's living. Unfortunately, he finds her not living at home but living in a hotel, with her kids and his own kids. It's a neat way to deal with an ex-husband, but it's hard to enjoy the film because we don't get much of a feel for Kevin. He is kind of just a bland character that can't seem to make up his mind. There's a lot to enjoy in this film, as the director (who is one of the best in the business) makes sure to put some great camera work in the film and there's a great supporting cast. I had a great time watching this movie and I hope you do too.

It took a very classic genre and made it better. This was the best show that I have ever seen on television!  Loved this series! The best episode is Season 3 Episode 10. The show is definitely a show for fans of science fiction, adventure, and sci-fi comedy. I recommend that you watch this series, not just for the funny jokes, but also because it is a good show.

A few months after the accident the two friends have to decide what they can or cannot do with the body that was so important to them, and it seems like they can't change the fact that they were idiots. I've seen a few movies like this and they all have a great story but never really hit the mark, and this was different, as it didn't take itself too seriously. The story is not the main focus of this movie, but it is still an interesting one, and I didn't really mind this one much.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What to say about... The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance? I have been waiting for this film to come around for some time. The Man Who shot Liberty Valence is about a man who is a cop in a small town. He is a man with a dark past and a dark future. He doesn't get along with the town sheriff and the town bully. They just seem to hate each other. In a small time frame, the main characters go to a restaurant. During the meal, the restaurant owner has his young daughter. She asks to see him outside. She is scared because she has been to a secluded area and doesn't like it. The man sees this and wants to see how she likes it. He goes into his car and parks on the side of the road. He tells her he needs to go to work but wants to wait until the owner leaves before he goes back. She agrees to his terms and says "No problem". But she is now scared. He takes her in his car to the backseat and tells her not to worry because he has a gun. He shoots the air in front of her and opens the back window. She hears the bang and looks outside. No one is there. She quickly closes the back door and runs back in the house. She closes the door behind her. But she hears the guy drive away and sees the rear view mirror is open. She sees her assailant drive by her house. Her hair turns white. She goes to the bathroom and gets the nearest towel. When she goes to go, the front door is already closed. He knocks and asks for a light. She says no. He pushes the door in and takes the light. After he leaves she sees his car at the top of the hill. It turns out he is in town to attend a funeral and has taken his daughter to see the funeral. He comes back and takes her home and says good night. The girl runs out of the house crying and starts to cry. The movie was interesting to me as an average family with kids that likes to play around with guns. There was a scene where the kids are riding bicycles on a river and one of the children accidentally jumps in front and drowns. He and another child are pulled into the water and get dragged along as they are carried down the river. The main character is trying to get help and goes to a town, but they don't seem to care about him or his family. There

The lady who is attracted to you has a purpose. If you allow yourself to be tempted by a woman, or even by the looks of a woman; she has a certain purpose in mind for you. For example, let's say you are at a restaurant, and a woman is there, wearing a long dress, beautiful eyes, and has a gorgeous figure. She looks at you, you look at her, you notice that she has very long, black hair and is very feminine. You have your purpose and she has hers.   the purpose of a women is to gain your affection. The purpose of her is to seduce you, and then leave you.      2. The female sex drive is the highest of all, even higher than that of men. If this sex drive exists in a man, he has no need to worry about attracting or seducing a woman. He can easily meet her and have sex with her over and over again, until she has become as used to his every move as a horse becomes to a mule.       3. A woman cannot control her sexual urges, and so, unless she is very careful to do so, she can easily become attracted to a man who has an extremely high sex drive. She will feel this attraction, and she will try to control it. The woman can easily do this by being extremely nice to you, or she can do this very easily by becoming a needy, desperate woman. Either way, it will all happen as soon as you start to sleep with her. If she is a good girl, she will let you have sex so that you can have fun with her, but if she is not a good woman, she may make you have very intense

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fantastic space opera that gives a breath of fresh air to the genre. There are moments of good and bad in this movie that can be overlooked but the overall experience is a memorable and good one. The story is very good and the cast is so good that they really deliver an enjoyable ride that brings the character development of many characters to a level rarely seen in Star Wars. My only complaint is that the story is a little convoluted at times and a little confusing. The main story arc was pretty good but not enough to keep the whole movie going and that leaves the supporting characters in a pretty poor state. ********* 5 out of 5 stars This movie will give you a great Star Wars experience. There is a lot of backstory to follow that will help you understand why Rey and Kylo Ren were attracted to each other. There also a lot to discover about Rey's past and who she truly is. The cast was amazing and the special effects are wonderful. The music and effects were just awesome and the action scenes were awesome as well. The only issue I had was that the main story line was a little too complicated to follow at times. I guess we will have to wait and see where the series goes from here. **** 1 out of 4 stars I have to give this movie a 2.5 out of 3 because I did have some problems with the story line. This movie seems to be about Kylo and Rey's history and I did find that the first half of the movie was a bit confusing at times because of the complicated history of Kylo. Kylo is a guy that grew up being trained by Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi. Kylos father was Luke and as a kid he was a big hero to his friends. His father even made Kylo's costume and gave him all the training he needed in order to become the perfect Jedi. The movie takes place a long time ago and so far Kylo seems like the typical strong boy that grew into a killer. His dad told him he was the Chosen One and that he was destined to become The Emperor's Right Hand (The Emperor's best weapon). He grew up idolizing The Emperor and eventually became a Sith Lord and started the Purge of the Jedi. So at this point I thought we were going to see a pretty good story where Kylo gets his shit together and becomes a better person. He is really the only character I enjoyed and he has a great story arc
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a very entertaining and very fast-paced movie, I watched this movie, and it was great! The story is simple, yet it is very exciting, because you're always expecting the unexpected! And it is always there! The storyline is very interesting, and you always need a second look! If you're a fan of action movies, like most of the people I know, you will like this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen this movie yet, but from what I read it is a fun movie about a guy who has a lot of money that is spent on many things, and one of them is a nice yacht. This is also where I started to learn about the famous actor, Steve McQueen. In the middle of the movie when it is time for a trip, there are some guys in the yacht, including this actor who, in my opinion, is a great actor. However, because of a situation, he does not have much of his money, and because of that he does a lot wrong. There are some other guys who don't like this guy and have different opinions on him. However when they are trying to get to a good place, the actor is on the boat, and he has no money, so the men take it out on him, and in the end, the actors is on a good boat, while all the men have to go back to where they came from because they lost their money. After the movie ends, you see how the actor and his friends go to a place, and while they are there, they realize how much money they spent and how they didn't spend any on a nice place for them to go to, and they return to where the boat came from. I think this is a good film, I was actually very happy with it because of the amazing actor and some of the things he did that are funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ ଠ ௵௿ூ ౪ందீ വാಲಿ ುೇതുി    A new film is playing here in the UK right now, the action-packed and visually stunning, The Girl with All the Gifts. We had the opportunity to speak to director Guillermo del Toro about his vision for this story of a girl named Mia who lives in the basement of a creepy old lady in the Bronx.  We asked the director what inspired him to make The Girl With All The Gifts and what drew him to the setting of the Bronx - he says: "I went to the Bronx in 2007 with my girlfriend. I was looking for the Bronx, or the New York, for a long time. I grew up in New York so the Bronx is in my soul. In some way, it's a natural choice."  The Girl With The Gifts has received plenty of glowing reviews from critics - one called it "the best of the great giallo-style horror movies". It tells the story of "Mia" as she discovers the truth about her family when she goes to visit them at the end of their long, drawn-out separation. The film stars Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Chastain, and Ana de Armas.  the film was shot on location in New Orleans and the Bronx at the studios of Universal Pictures and is a co-production between Spanish-language outfit EuropaCorp and USA-based FilmDistrict. You can watch it in the gallery below.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What do you think of when you hear the term "horror?" That's right; a bunch of people getting killed off, not in the traditional sense of a zombie but in a very different way. The film is called The Wicker Man and this time you'll be watching an actor named John Hurt playing an older version of the same character in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the previous movie was an entertaining tale of a man who got lost in a castle, this movie is more of an experience of a little boy having to survive against an evil being from his past and an evil old lady that is trying to take over the world. When a family is in danger, the little boy is not the hero he used to be. In fact, he doesn't even seem to care about the little girl that he is babysitting and that is what we all want to see. As the little guy gets older and gets in trouble, he grows even more meaner and we see the evil old woman's evil intentions to take the world back from them.  Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars  Wicker Man – A Tale of the Lonely Woods is presented as a silent film. There is no music, no subtitles, and only one picture. The story is told without any narration but with the sounds of nature. You can't hear the people talking and we don't know when we are supposed to stop the movie but it doesn't matter. The characters are simple and we feel sorry for them as they have to survive a harsh and cruel environment. Hurt delivers his performance as he is able to give his character an emotion. He also makes this film something to think about. If you are a fan of silent movies, this one will definitely bring a smile to your face and that will last all day. If the movie isn't scary, it is interesting because we see a man and his little girl struggling against an old lady who is trying her best to take back the world by turning the world into a lake.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ Thank you, Michael, for your kind words, and your lovely and sweet gifts. The book "A Wrinkle in Time" has been my favorite since it came out in the 80's. My mom read it to me when I was 6. It really is wonderful and a classic. I am happy to see the movie also being released on DVD. As for the book, it is well written and the pictures are beautiful. We will have to find a place where you can read it! I am also really looking forward to reading the book and seeing all the wonderful drawings and paintings of the characters. All of them are done by a talented and talented woman, I have to say. The people that make the movies are the same people who are making the books, so it will be nice to see them get the recognition they deserve for such a wonderful and magical art form.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Force Awakens is great!  I've been waiting for a good Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and JJ Abrams nailed it with this movie.  It has great character development, action, humor and a great plot.  This movie is a perfect tribute to the original trilogy and a perfect way to start the new trilogy.  I give this movie a 8/10 and recommend it to all fans of Star Wars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a must-see movie, and not just because it features the coolest looking alien ever (that one's from Star Trek, obviously).  It's also an action thriller that never fails to be funny or touching.  While the movie's ending is a little convoluted and overplayed at the end, the story is excellent, and the characters really are as interesting as they appear on the surface.  It is the only movie where a huge robot fights a dinosaur (and that's a good thing!)  The movie has everything:  As mentioned, the movie is action-packed and entertaining.  This is especially true with its strong writing.  The film's setting in the 21st century is realistic enough to make the plot all the more interesting, and it's definitely not a movie you'll forget.  There is a lot of fighting (though less so than in most other films), a lot more humor, and a good amount of heart.  Rating:  Final Score:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight is a really great movie that is really hard to review. The violence in this movie is so intense that it made me nauseous. It's actually hard to talk about because the violence in the movie is a bit of an assault.  If you're the type of person who can't watch violent movies at all you'd be very disappointed.  The violence is extreme in The Hateful 8.  This movie, for all its flaws, is worth seeing for it's acting, it's soundtrack, and the visuals.  If you're a fan of Coen Brothers movies The Big Lebowski or No Country for Old Men this movie might be for you. If you can handle the movie it's worth the watch.

I love how we all have to be aware of how much fun this movie is and how much we don't really realize. The story was actually a little silly at first, but it quickly gets fun and funny as it goes along, but by the end you'll be laughing out loud. The ending made me smile and laugh the whole time, and I laughed the whole way through it. This movie doesn't need the original cast, but this one is so good that I have to include it. It's one of those movies that I can't wait to see again!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2349052/reviews _________ A well known actor in the comedy genre, Jerry Lewis is perhaps best known for the works of Beethoven and his many collaborations with the great Louis Prima of "The Muppet Show." He also starred in the classic film "You've Got Mail" and was once voted the #1 stand-up comic on television. A well deservedly recognized film icon, Jerry has a great, if often overlooked, acting style. He has a distinctive yet versatile voice and his comedic genius is not only undeniable, but also highly contagious. There are few, if any, comic actors who can be a good-natured raconteur and a self-deprecating joker all at once. When Jerry's comedic material takes on an adult level it tends to fall short of his best material, but when he is at his best he can take anything and turn it into a riot. The first half of the film is a great introduction to the character. It's a bit cheesy, but at least it does a good job of showing off his charm and sense of humor. It is only a matter of time before Jerry gets caught up in the whole "muppet" thing. I never realized how much Jerry Lewis has been overshadowed by his friend Muppet creator Jim Henson, but now that I've seen this film I know that I was wrong. I hope that there is a sequel or a new film of some sort. _____________ A young woman and her family move to New York City from rural Oklahoma. When she begins working in a hotel, she meets a woman she falls in love with. When her friend is murdered, the woman's father takes it upon himself to find the killer. Jerry Lewis plays a very important role in the story. He's not a big star, but he's good at what he does. The scenes of the dead guy are very effective and it is very interesting how Jerry manages to portray a good man in the midst of bad things happening. At times, the film seems to be less about Jerry Lewis as the comedian and more about the woman he falls for. I really enjoyed the relationship between the two. The acting of Jerry Lewis shines through, and this is an excellent film for the man. _______ This film is an interesting piece of work. There is a lot of interesting material here and it doesn't necessarily make for great entertainment
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I've seen this movie in IMAX on three separate occasions and can say with confidence that the visuals on the big screen are excellent. Director Paul Feig, in his attempts to be faithful to the source material, makes a few small missteps in the making of this movie. The pacing of the movie is quite slow and it takes some time to get to where it wants to be. When it does happen, the movie works, but the scenes do not stand out as being noteworthy. The plot is pretty basic. We have our heroine, a very well endowed and sexy woman that has an agenda. She wants to get out of her current relationship and be with a much more physically dominant man. So she hooks up with her best friend's guy and then he hooks up to her and then she hooks him up. This is what we're getting into here. It doesn't take long until the man (Paul Feig) starts showing signs of being a bit too dominant for his own good. He can't stop himself from kissing the woman and when she asks him to stop she tells him that she wants to have sex with him as well. When Paul has an orgasm he stops and leaves her alone in the room. She goes back to her room to clean up and then sees the man staring at her. She's freaked out but he's just a guy that's a bit of a loser and she wants him to know she's in love with him and wants to go out with him. The guy turns out to be a loser that doesn't even have a girlfriend but he does have a few friends and she does like him. At this point in the movie she's still in love and doesn't mind what the guy is doing but she doesn't want to be in love, even with a loser. She says she likes him just the way he is and that he will never hurt her. At the end of the night, the guys are still in each other's rooms so the movie ends with them being just friends. This, if you haven't guessed by now, is the movie. Paul Feist, the guy from the original movie, plays Paul Rudd, the nerdy guy that falls for his friend's woman and ends up becoming in love. And while there are a lot of great parts here, they don't do much to stand out. I did not like this movie, though I do like his other movies. I would not recommend this movie to people that want

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, it wasn't too bad, but the story was a little cliche and the performances were quite annoying.  The story is about a little boy with a huge crush on a girl he meets in the local park who is also a bit of a brat.  However, things go downhill quickly after that as the brat realizes that the boy has a crush on him, and so he tries to stop the boy.  There is also some other little characters that we don't really get to know.  It is also rather dark at times.   The story didn't really have anything to do with the main movie, but I guess it was done for a different audience.  Overall, it was pretty good.  As usual, the ending was very anticlimactic.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I have had so many great movies and shows and music in my life. I have seen more of my favorite shows and artists than I can remember. This is one of my favorites. The show is so dark, dark and dark. Not so much drama and action, but a darker and darker show about this very dark person with this very long hair and crazy look. It has the perfect balance between drama and humor. A wonderful story. I will continue to watch this show and I will probably enjoy it for a very long time. I really don't see any way this show can fail. I am not sure why it isn't on a lot of people's must watch list. It will remain on my list for years to come.

(13/11  ___________________________________________________  is a film from the French director, Vincente Minnelli. It stars Jean Harlow, the great comic actress who, in a recent interview, described her role as "a kind of parody of a good horror movie." The film is also a tribute to the "B-Movie" films of Vincente (Vincente Minnoi) Minnellis. It is in the tradition of the "A-Movie": silly and amusing scenes, a good cast of characters, and a quick horror ending.I found it difficult to believe that a movie like this could be made in the 70s. The cinematography and set design are fantastic; the music is a little too much for my taste, but the acting is pretty good, if not great, and the humor is really off the charts. The writing is also great. The humor and action, along with the plot and characters, all works together.I must admit that there is a point in the film when I wondered if I had seen the movie in one of my childhood movies. The jokes and gags are so good that I was laughing for three hours straight, while also being completely shocked, and even somewhat annoyed. The only thing I had a real problem with is the ending. I had to watch the entire thing several times to get it all the way through. I'm not sure what the point of the ending was, except perhaps for the fans of the genre, but it certainly didn't make the experience any more pleasant for me.I really enjoyed, for the most part, the characters and the gags. I don't recall the ending being much more than a footnote to the overall experience. It might have been good for a kid's movie, if there was a little more emphasis on the gore and the horror, but that doesn't really make for a good comedy. The film has a great sense of humor, and it never strays from the fun. The actors, for their part, are funny. It's nice to see a good old-fashioned horror film from a good actor, and in the hands

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ What's it about? An evil corporation, a group of friends and a mysterious woman are looking for the mysterious treasure hidden in the desert, which was supposedly buried by a Spanish conquistador... This is not a good story. It's a good adventure movie and not a very good story for an adventure movie. It does have a pretty cool set of characters, it's not too long and there are some very cool sequences in the movie. But overall this movie is too short to be good and it's a pretty bad story. ____________________________________________________ Is it worth the watch? __________________________________________________________ I think so. The good thing about this movie was that it was an adventure, with plenty of action and you know the best thing about adventure movies is they're supposed to be fun. I don't think the bad things about the movie was really what killed it for me though, it was the story. This movie has a long start, but the ending is a bit cheesy. The story doesn't go anywhere for the first half of the movie, it does just go back to what the villain said earlier and doesn't really have a payoff. But then we see a bunch of cool stuff, but none of it is really that interesting and then at the very end you have a lot of characters saying "the good guys won" and it all seems pointless. So the good thing is the characters, they're fun to watch and not just a bunch guys who were in a bunch places that we see. The bad thing about the story is that it doesn't make sense, we don't really understand what the bad guys are after and it takes a while to realize that maybe the Spanish weren't that good of a guy after all. ______________________________ Cast & Crew _____________________________________ The film stars: David Warner (played by Robert McNeil), Jason O'Mara (played Robert McNeal), Rob McNeil (played David Warner), Joe Gatt (played Rob McNeal) and Kevin Sorbo (played Joseph) The cast was composed of: Jason O Mara (Robert McNeil) David Warner Rob McNeill Jason O McNeil Joe G Att Kevin Sorb O'McNeil Rob Mcneel Robert Mc Neil David Warner Robert Mc Neal Rob McNeel Robert M McNeil Rob M Mcnean Joe G Patrick Sorb Rob Mcnee Rob McNEel David Warner James McNeil Robert Mcneen Patrick Sorbo Patrick Sorba David Warner Joe G O'
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ The Last Witch Hunter is my favourite movie of 2013, and the one that I'm most looking forward to. In fact, I'm planning to watch it again as soon as it's out in the UK. I don't mind the title - it's more accurate than the one we've got in the States - I'd rather it had been The Witch Hunter's name. But it's not the sort of movie that you watch just for the title. The plot is a clever mixture of the familiar and the utterly fantastical, a mixture that I haven't come across for a while. It's well written, well acted and with an interesting central character. But most of all it's just fun. In the old days, when a movie made me think like an adult, it was because the characters seemed mature enough. But here, when characters are simply people, the film gets away with far too much. For example, when we first meet the witch, she seems to have some real depth to her, and it's only when we see her later in the film that we realise that the witch really is just a bit crazed. The same can be said of the other people we meet. The Witch is so utterly insane, that I don  I loved The Last Witches. It had all the elements that I like from a movie and did so without being offensive. The story isn't really a story. It is a comedy. It was funny to watch and I thought it was clever. The ending was so unexpected that it left me in a very odd place. On the one hand it was brilliant, and on the other, it didn't quite fit into the movie at all. The movie's about the witch hunter and what he does and how he does it. There is no real focus on him. It could have been a movie that is about a witch hunter, but instead the movie is about the hunt itself. It makes it sound like it is the witch hunting, but it is very much the witch looking for his prey. I was surprised that it was this good. When I think back to when I first saw the movie, I felt that I was watching a different movie, but then I remembered the reviews I read about it. The reviews I have read were fantastic, and all were positive. I didn't really have any problems with the movie. It just seemed like a slightly different movie. That was a pleasant surprise.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I was pretty excited about this movie. I think it's a solid remake and does a pretty good job of making the original a new and interesting film. If you liked the original, there are a few great new ideas and characters. If not, then it's not as good, and you can get a decent film from the same source. I will say that there is a weird jump in quality from the second movie to the remake. The third movie is much better and is more well animated than the third one, but the remake isn't a step forward either. However, it's very interesting to see the story adapted to a live action film and it's fun to see how the story would have changed in the years since the original film came out.  Was this helpful?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm still pretty blown away by the film.  It is an extremely clever, well-thought out thriller with some great performances.  The film is about a man who has a strange experience in a hospital where he wakes up surrounded by nurses and doctors.  This is followed by him having a series of strange dreams where he finds himself living in a house that looks nothing like he is used to.  When the police arrive on the scene he sees them as zombies who are coming for him.  They say that the house he is in is haunted, but he can't find any proof.  Once the police leave, a new doctor comes into the hospital, and the entire place starts to change around him.   It is like a bad nightmare you have where every room in the house has a different personality.  The film uses the word "zombie" in its title multiple times and the story is set up to be a psychological thriller but the execution is just fantastic.  One of the best twists is when the new doctor tells the police officer who is trying to stop the man that he has "the plague" and that he will only allow the police to come in with guns if they come in covered in blood.  I know it is not the best movie of the year but I was absolutely shocked at the ending.  It is absolutely horrifying to see how well done the film is.   I think that the best scene in the film might be the part where he discovers the police are in fact zombies.  He sees them and they turn into the zombies in his hands, and he's just completely freaked out.  After the movie I felt that it could have been an even better film if they had done more with the storyline.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a few friends who are huge fans of the "Harry Potter" movies and have told me about them a few times. I have seen this before and thought it was great so I picked this up as it was on sale and it's great to see it now! This is a great Harry Potter book, but I'm glad the film came out first because I was a little underwhelmed with the book. The first book in the series I read and I enjoyed it. While reading the book I thought that this was more fun than the film. The book focuses on a child named Harry James Potter who is sent to live with his uncle and aunt. However, things change as his life gets better with him developing a love for the Dark Arts. Harry finds his life at Hogwarts is like a dream for him and it makes him feel safe, though the world of Hogwarts is not very happy with him. The books are fast-paced, funny, fun and very different than the movies. I think this would make a great film for fans of Harry Potter who liked the first book. It has all the characters of the book and some more. It's good, but not great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Pixels is a funny and charming movie about a bunch of kids who are given a "computer" to control a toy vehicle. The movie plays out in a bunch cartoonish worlds that are very similar to those of the original Lego film.   I found the characters to be very funny and fun to watch. The kids act out the jokes that the adults are trying to get them to do. The humor in the movie is the perfect balance between being light and silly without it feeling like a parody.   When it comes down to the comedy of the movie, it's actually quite good. It works with some really great one-liners and some funny one-take comedy. There's also a good amount of jokes that would have fit better into a classic 80's comedy film. The jokes are made up in an unusual way that feels new and funny.

Just as I was about to begin my second trip to Savannah, I was told that the Savannah Riverwalk would be shut down due to a power outage. I called for an extra car, and that's how I ended up at the Riverwalk. I really enjoy this location, it was nice to take a few photos before the area was closed down. The view of the Savannah skyline was amazing. I would have liked to go further in the park but that's just something that I would do on another trip. As an aside, I did run into a very nice guy from New Orleans named "Shakey". He told me he moved to Savannah about a year ago to study to become a barber/cosmetologist. As the sun was going down, we were taking some pictures together. We were standing on the right side of the trail at the intersection of the two roads that you see.

(It was a great summer movie for me.) The two bikers start as criminals, but by the end they have become a team in order to stop the cops from closing in. The cops are called in because one of the bikers' friends, known as the 'Grim Reaper', is in the hospital and could be killed. The biker gang is formed by two cops, both of whom, like the biker Gangster, have to deal with their own bad side... Written by Steve Richer <sricher@sympatico.ca>

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________. This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. A young girl is getting ready to leave her parents home and go to her new school. She has all the right stuff to be happy, but her mom gets all upset because she is no longer going to be the only girl with her brother. I know this sounds very corny, but it's actually true! There is something about it that's sweet and sweet. And i mean sweet in a wonderful way. I really liked the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lola Bunny is a film that really has a lot of heart and charm, and is great to watch on a rainy day. Lola Bunny will bring you to tears with its sad story of a young man who finds himself without a family, but with a new girlfriend that seems to have his best interests at heart. The story revolves around the relationship of Lola (Troy Baker) and her best friend, and the friendship between the two of them is one of the most endearing and enjoyable parts of the film. The two of the best scenes from the film are at the very end, and show the two in perfect emotional conditions after their relationship has been brought to an end. The final scene between Lola and Troy is one that should be watched by all lovers of romantic comedies, and shows how good a film it can be.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ Just wanted to say this movie is a nice little comedy with some great comedy bits. The movie is more like a short film than a full on action movie. But the action is still good and it is very funny. It does take place mostly in a train station, so there is not much fighting, but there are explosions, gun fights, and people in ridiculous costumes. There is even some comedy that makes up for the lack of fighting. The story takes place in a future world where robots are the norm and humanity has become extinct. It is a pretty simple premise but the story is pretty good. The film is not perfect, but it is fun. There are a lot of funny moments and I think a lot could enjoy it. It has its moments. It would have been better if it had been longer or had more action. The ending is pretty lame, and it was pretty predictable. But overall it is a good little comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I'd never seen this movie, but I thought the story was interesting. This is a small story about an elderly woman who has just lost her husband and daughter in a tragic car accident. The father is a good man who had been in the military, and he's now retired. He had lost everything. He comes to live with his son and daughter-in-law, who have taken up the house and are now raising him as their own. The husband has disappeared and his daughter and her husband have become estranged. Now, a woman has just returned from the dead, and the son-in law has come to take up residence with the daughter in law. The two are in conflict with each other because of this woman's presence. It was a pretty good story, and it could have been a very interesting movie with interesting characters."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  The thing that I really loved about the story of Star Wars was that even though it's a sci-fi adventure, it still comes with a certain level of fun and silliness. The thing is, the original Star Wars has a sense of fun that the prequel doesn't really have. The original film was full of fun moments and moments where it felt like nothing was actually going to happen. I feel like the prequels could have benefited from having some kind of fun element added to them. There were actually moments where the previs went a little too overboard with silly, over-the-top scenes and some sequences just came off as "I'm in a space battle! The only thing cooler than that is that this movie is just so ridiculous that I'm not sure if I'm supposed to laugh or not!"  This movie doesn't try to hide its ridiculousness, but it also doesn't attempt to have it completely stripped away from the film. It's still silly, but not in a way that feels like the film is trying to make you laugh. Sure, there are a few moments that are a little cheesy or absurd. They're not out of character for the characters, but they are out of place. I did find myself laughing at some of the comedic moments. At times the acting was good and the comedy was actually kind of funny. At other times the comedy just came across as cheesy and stupid. It seemed to be more an issue with the script than the actors, but I found myself enjoying the goofy comedy more than the goofy acting.  One of the more memorable moments of the film was the scene in which Han Solo goes on a date with Leia. I loved it when it happened. It was an incredibly funny moment between the two of them. It feels like a little bit of a throwaway scene to me, but one that was actually well-written. It wasn't just a throw-away scene though. It had a real, well thought out story that could be interpreted in many different ways. The whole film was built around that single scene, but as it turned out, there was a lot more to the story than just Han Solo going on a little date with his princess. 's dialogue is as good as ever:  I've always enjoyed the banter between Luke and Leia. They've always had fun banter between the characters. It makes you think of how much more fun the original film could have been

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best example of a genre I've ever seen in my life is a film called Tintin in the Congo (1961). It features Tintine, a young boy who is a real man of action, adventure, and the like. The film's main objective is to tell the story of a band of French explorers that have been sent to a war ravaged part of the Congo by the British government in order to collect a series of rare treasures for the British. The real story is that the French were able to collect the treasures and they were able, for the first time in history, to send a young man on a non-military expedition and not to go to the war zone or engage in combat. In my opinion, this film is a true masterpiece and is the definitive example of the genre of the adventure adventure film. It is an adventure adventure, but is also a love story. The love story has a different plot from the main narrative. The central romance is of the two men that meet and fall in love as soon as the expedition starts, and then the plot develops around that friendship. The main objective of the story is to collect some diamonds to fund the expedition, but the real story of the film, the romance, is the main focus. In addition, the film's animation is also top-notch. Tintino was created by a real artist and animator (and it is now considered one of the best cartoon movies of all time), it is still considered one the best animated films ever made.  A review by the director: The film Tinti in the Coro (1960) is a tale of adventure, love and adventure. Tintin and friends are on a very special mission. A group of French soldiers have been stationed on an isolated island off the coast of Africa for a while. They are returning to France as soon they can, but they don't know what's in store for them when they get there. The film's plot is very simple: Tintini and his friend Captain Haddock are sent to this tropical island by the French government to collect diamonds. After a long and treacherous trek across the savannah, the two friends finally reach the isolated island and are surprised to see it is inhabited by friendly people. Tignic has a good heart, but he has a bad sense of direction. He doesn't know who to trust and, in a very short time, they are captured by a group of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie needs to be funny and well made, it should entertain and shock. That's why it should be rated higher than an R, there is a lot of gore, there are several disturbing scenes, there have been some characters who are not very developed and there are some scenes that are unnecessary. Still, a good comedy movie has to have a couple of shocking scenes and a good story. That is why it has been rated a high PG-13 (14 and up). This is an old movie and it shows some changes and the characters have been updated since. The movie is a very popular, very old one that is still being watched by many. If you haven't seen it then it is worth a try to get your heart racing!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie for many reasons.  First of all, I love that they are doing an "old" western without CGI (I am not a huge fan of CGI in movies) and it is really fun and fast paced.  Also, there is no annoying music, the acting is really good and everyone gets their time to shine.  It's a great movie and a good way to introduce some new fans to the classic western.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ The film is a mix of many genres. Its an action movie, a comedy, and a drama, although it is more a comedy than a drama. This is one of the rare films that was released on DVD. Its funny, it is well done, and it does have a couple of great action sequences. It does have some very poor special effects. It is definitely worth watching. _______________________________________________________________________  I would like to thank my gifter for the wonderful, thoughtful gift. I can't wait to see how it does at the theater. It's a great film, and I'm glad I could give my giftee such a gift. Thank you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I loved this movie, it is a solid flick but not great. The story is fantastic, the characters are interesting and there are a lot of funny moments but, other then that I think it falls down a bit. There are a few scenes that are just awkward but nothing that really ruins the movie. My favorite parts were the "cannon fodder" scene with the people trying to be the "perfect family". If you have a kid and need a good laugh, give this a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The plot is pretty standard, and is not that interesting. This is actually a pretty great flick, especially for those who like action. The action sequences are exciting and exciting. The special effects are amazing and it's nice to see some really good effects work in a film of this kind. The villains are interesting. Some of the villains are really bad, but it is understandable that a group of villains would be. The movie's pacing and plot makes sense. I understand the point of the movie is to show that not all are evil and some are just misunderstood. I'm all for that. I also understand that it was a pretty big deal when there was a group like the Brotherhood of Death in the 80's. Now they're just part of a cult. As a fan of the original comic series, it's fun to see how things would have gone had those villains lived. The one thing I would have loved to see is a version of the comics in the movie, but unfortunately that won't happen. All in all, it was worth watching. It's not perfect, but I really enjoy this movie and am looking forward to more of it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by zebbab from I have to admit that it is good but the worst movie in the history of the medium!!  I bought this on VOD for about $15. It doesn't take a lot of effort to watch this. All it requires is some popcorn and maybe a drink and the whole thing will be over very quickly. I was shocked when I first saw this, but once I finished it I was happy. It is really just another action flick. Not really that interesting because there are some of the characters that were not that great and I would give the action scenes a point for being entertaining. The plot may be pretty cool, but the character interactions are just plain bad. The thing is that you see a lot and that makes it difficult to care about most of the character's decisions. I really hope this is a part of the upcoming sequel. It would have been great to see another iteration of the franchise, but this is not it. This might be a solid movie for fans of the comic series and those who really like some action. It does not make any sense, and there are a lot more important things going on in this film than just going around killing and being killed. A few suggestions: I really wish there would have at least been a couple
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cats Don't Dance  does its job very well, at least for me. I really appreciate the way this film keeps you on the edge of your seat, and I love the fact that director  Robert McKee  is not afraid to show us what the world's most vicious animals are capable of. The world is full of animals that want to live for themselves, and the world of cats in particular seems to have become more and more animalistic in the past few years. This movie shows that the world can change, and even more, that it can be turned around. It's great to see a movie that keeps the tension high without ever resorting to gore. It also has a solid cast, which includes the likes of Chris Cooper, Michael Parks, Christopher Meloni, and Joe Mantegna.  The story is about a poor cat named Mavis, who decides to save her owner from the authorities. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long before she realizes that her new owner is much more than he seems and that her fate is far from a free one.   Overall, Cats Don't Dinner is a great movie with excellent acting, suspenseful scenes, and an overall dark theme.

I think if we were to see such a character played by a 40-year-old, then that would have been a much better movie. But this is not how a story should be told and you can see it all right in the film. All of the characters and the story work together perfectly to portray the feeling of the time." Read More...
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I was a big fan of the movie, but I can't give it 5 stars. A great movie but not a perfect film. Great characters but not enough drama. If I could have loved the story more I would have given it 5 Stars but I didn't. I loved everything else about this movie, great story, good music and wonderful acting. ___________  I liked this movie! I was not disappointed. It was entertaining and I am not sure I liked it as much as I could've because the movie is good, but it is not perfect. I think the main reason this movie doesn't get 5 stars is that the movie starts out slow and not exciting but I would not consider the beginning to be a bad part of the story. It really gives the characters and their relationships a chance to develop. It also gives the audience a chance of getting invested in these characters and you see how the relationship between them will develop. The story doesn't drag on as it should, it just doesn't. The characters in this movie were really fun and their chemistry was great. I really liked the way the movie was structured and the way each character played a part in the events and their reactions. I especially enjoyed the ending. I thought it was really powerful and gave the characters a chance for a happy ending. The movie does not give us the full story of what happened in this event but it does give us enough clues to get involved in the story as it goes along. I would recommend this movie for fans of a lot of movies. The acting is great and the story was well-told and the ending was great too. It didn't leave me wanting more and I think that is why the movie didn't have 5 stars for me. I didn the feeling of what I should have loved more in this film. A lot of things did, but the story didn't give me enough of a reason to feel something. I am still excited for more of this story and look forward to seeing what comes next. I wish this movie had a little more drama in it because the ending could've been a bit better. Overall a good Movie and worth checking out.  This movie is a little hard to review. This is a fun little movie about a little girl with a secret and what happens to her. I know there are some issues with this movie but it was a good time and I loved the cast of characters. My only real problem with this flick was the ending

You can say a lot of things about the story, but you can also say a whole lot of stuff about the performances and the direction, and there's definitely something wrong with the movie. It might have been a good idea to go back and watch the first part of the movie with an open mind before giving it a thumbs down for being too long and too confusing.  But let's get this out of the way first: this movie has a lot going for it. And by a lot I mean a lot. For one thing, this film has a great director, John Lee Hancock (I Am Legend), who has directed films such as The Mummy Returns and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, and he knows how to use his cast in a way that makes his films enjoyable. When the story of the story is going good, you're going to be in for a fun ride, and if the story has a twist or a plot twist to it, it can still be a bit of a surprise, but not in a frustrating or irritating way. Hancock gives his characters great depth and makes them seem like real people, and this is not always a bad thing. One of the biggest moments in the movie, especially if you like action movies, is when the big baddies come out and wreak havoc. Hancock is able to make the action look so great, and the special effects and special effects crew in the UK have done a great job. They've used digital effects to create a realistic look to the fight scenes and the action scenes that are shot in Iceland.  - There's a scene where a villain is throwing fireballs at our hero, but the fireballs are so realistic you have no idea what they're even doing. - The fight scenes are always entertaining and fun to watch, and Hancock knows how, when he needs to, to push the action

I read this article about a movie called "Actors: My Experience", it looked interesting. I thought it was a little too far out there but it was something new.  In the film, four people are forced to go to a casting session and it doesn't go well. They're made fun of and the director makes it clear it's not going to end well. I was intrigued. I wanted to see what it was all about. I didn't read the script. I just wanted to experience the casting process with other actors. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like it or not.  is based on the story of a man who goes to a movie casting and gets rejected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wolfpack is a good, if unoriginal, film. I liked the Wolfpack, but I'm not crazy about the main star. I found the supporting characters to be a little too one-dimensional and the script to be very uninspiring. I also had trouble connecting with the Wolf Pack's storyline, which doesn't make sense, and it's too bad because the WolfPack was my favorite of the three movies. It's worth watching if you're looking for something original or are in need of a laugh, but I would warn you that it will leave you feeling empty. Watch it, but don't expect anything great to come from it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a huge horror fan but this is a good entry in the genre.  The story is set in the 90's and has a good atmosphere with a lot of suspense and violence.  It starts off with a scene that gets into the psyche of the main character and how the people around him react to him.  A woman who is trying to raise her son to be the man he wants to be and she believes that his step mother is doing something wrong, she even tries to kill him but it's all in vain.  Then the other characters react as well.  One of them is an old man who has a little sister and is obsessed with his daughter and wants to see her graduate from college.  Also one of them has a young son who is the main antagonist but he has a strong and positive character.  They don't all have it the best but the good and bad outweigh the good.  This is a very good movie to watch if you like the genre and don't mind some violent violence.

I would recommend this film for the fans of romantic comedies and I would also recommend it for fans of the Twilight series!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ ___________________________ If you liked the movie, I hope you will like this post: http://doubledusts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=3468 If you read the last paragraph, this review is based on the movie: http:www.imdb.com/?s=movie&id=9072406. I didn't get a chance to see it when it came out but I have seen a couple of reviews that mention the fact that the movie is based off of an old book called the "The Art of War". The Art of war has been referred to many times but the book was not actually based off a book. The book was actually an account of the actions and thoughts of Alexander the Great while he was preparing to invade Persia. The author was trying to capture the spirit of Alexander's army while they were preparing for the invasion and to get an exact picture of what they were going to be up against. In this book, the army is described as having been broken up into many divisions and they were scattered and did not know what was going on next to each other. The idea behind this was that the army was broken up so that they wouldn't be attacked by the neighboring kingdoms or by the Persian. After the army got together, they moved forward to the Persian capital and were in camp just as the Persians attacked. The army had a pretty tough time fighting back because they had been scattered. There were a number of divisions fighting each other and it was a matter of survival. The armies would take what they could from their neighbors, kill any horses that got in their way and if they were lucky they would find a goat. Once the army had been decimated, the only thing left was the army's commander who was surrounded. The Persian commanders gave him orders to surrender and the army decided to give up. The rest of the army moved on to their next battle and the Persian commanders were not far behind. They were so confident that they didn't even bother to try and escape the Persian attack. The only ones that got away from the Persian were the leaders of the tribes and the leaders on the army. The Persians killed all of the leaders and then cut down the remaining army. Eventually they got to the river and the Persian army was destroyed. This was not just a fictional account, this was actual history and it occurred in 476 B.C.E. I believe that

There is a scene early in the movie where the young boy has been playing with a plastic gun, and is accidentally shot. The boy gets back up, and in the aftermath, his mother has been taken away. This scene was one of the most moving things I've ever seen. I cried in fear, and fear of violence. The character was a victim, but a victim who is somehow heroic. I think the movie will speak to anyone, because it is a good story and has great acting and music. In the end, it leaves you with hope for life."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ When I was a kid, there was this guy named Mr. Rogers who appeared in our local kids television show who was the world-weary patriarch of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. At the same time, there were lots of kids watching, but no one seemed to want to follow the instructions of a man with glasses and a hat who had his own show, and no one wanted to pay for it. The guy who hosted Mr.Rogers was pretty much a total douchebag, and the show's poor ratings were an open invitation to Mr.Brooks, the showrunner and executive producer, to take some of the money he made and make a lot of it go to the bad actors on the show. The show was popular enough that they kept doing it, but the original stars of the show, Roger and his daughter Cookie, got really old and the bad actor who played Roger got replaced. Now, there have been several attempts at remakes of the series since the 90s (this is the third or fourth version), but all of them have been pretty bad (with one exception - it's kind of fun - a re-envisioned, slightly improved version of this movie, for which I should thank the guy who made it). The first of these, this one, and most of the others have a lot in common with the first. They're bad movies, but they're also bad movies that seem to have been made for money. I like to think the people behind them are really dumb, but then I remember that there's really no way to tell whether or not they're dumb.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  The only negative I would have for the movie is the fact that it has such an "adventurous" quality to it, and I can see why many people think that it was made for kids, but the point I'm trying to make here is that this was a pretty solid horror movie. Not "awesome" per say, but a pretty damn solid horror flick. The acting was great, the scares were pretty intense, and the cinematography was excellent, and it also really had some great visuals with a cool, sci-fi/fantasy twist. In conclusion, if you haven't seen this already, you really owe it to yourself to check it out!  Next week I will be talking about a completely different kind of movie: the Star Trek movies. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Have you seen this movie? _________  You might have thought it was going to be a "normal" comedy that would be forgotten after it was over, but you were completely wrong.   This movie is a masterpiece that is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I love how everyone keeps comparing it to "Barefoot in the Park" but really I think "Bereft" is a better movie. This film is very dark and intense, like a Hitchcock movie at times. It was a real breath of fresh air for horror fans. The acting was great all around and it is quite entertaining. You would definitely enjoy this movie!   I did enjoy "Bore", as a character study of an artist. I was not a huge fan of that film either, but this was more in line with the spirit of "Beverly Hills Cop" than "Bored to Death". The story is well written with a lot of great characters that everyone can get behind.   The ending is very strange, I wish I could have thought of that! But other than that, this was a really good movie and it will always be a classic!  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie was The Big Lebowski. So why does it seem like everybody else has their favorite movie?  It's a great movie.  Great actors, great story, great comedy.  What you probably didn't know about Lebkowsky:  Lebowsky is a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  He and his partner, Lt. Dan "Red" Copley (Michael Ironside), are on duty one evening and their dispatcher, Lt Copleys mom, tells them that their shift is over.  Lebukely and Red tell her that they're tired but she says they could stay until nightfall, at which point they would get to go home and rest. They say they're not feeling good, so she says she'll take their car, and they head to her house.  They find that there's a police officer out at the side gate when they arrive.  She asks them why they're at the house, and Red says it's because their shift was over. She asks if they've ever had anything to drink, and Lebuky says they have. She says they shouldn't be out in the dark, that she's concerned for them. Lebrukowsky says he's not a drunk.  Then he tells her that there is no danger, because they have a flashlight, and the officer is not an idiot, and she has no grounds for concern. He says he doesn't know what time they left, and if she says so, then they should go home. Then he and Red leave.   The next day, the dispatcher calls him on the phone to ask what's up, and he's very honest with her:   The only reason I was out at night that night was because it was night. I'd rather stay at home and watch movies. So she asks him if he ever had a drink, to which he replies he's had one or two. She also says he told her that he has been on the force a long time and that he could probably remember the last time he had been out. He also says the only thing that could have made him feel better was if they went to his house. She was not having any of that.  The dispatcher asks if he could have called his girlfriend, and that was enough to drive him over the edge. She finally told him to call 911 and he went to call his girlfriend.

The disc had a very good movie and I would recommend that you buy it. If you cannot get it the store had an option of a free copy of the movie in case you were interested.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If there was ever a movie that could represent all of my loves in one movie (I know what you're thinking) that movie is this. My absolute favorite. It was so intense and intense it made my heart flutter. If you liked the book, the movie is even better. If there was any kind of a plot that I didn't like, please feel free to tell me what one was. I feel like you'll be missing out on one of the greatest stories ever told. Just be careful with your friends. I was terrified watching it so I was in an area that was easily hit by a bus or hit by lightning at one point. But this was so much more than that. It's got such an intense emotional journey that it makes me think of that one friend that you just can't have and it's such a great film that is sure to please everyone. I'm sure my thoughts will resonate with anyone who has seen it. I wish you a happy new year!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had the pleasure of seeing both of the 'big movie' shows. The first one was The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I was there on Thursday before the world premiere on Friday. I went to see it at an AMC and I was blown away! The action, the cast, the costumes, and the special effects all stood out to me. The show is a must see on film. A review of The Avengers is in order because I loved it. I'm very much looking forward to seeing Captain America: Civil War on May 6. I hope that it turns out to be better than Age of Adaline. The Avengers 2 is just about my favorite superhero movie. It has everything I love about superhero movies, I mean it has action, emotion, and humor. It does have some flaws though, but they're not enough to ruin the movie. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a movie that I thought was great from the moment I saw it. It is the best superhero movie yet. I loved the characters. I love the actors. I even love the way they filmed the movie in the winter time. It was a great summer movie. Now that they've finished the movie, and with the upcoming movie on May 7, The Avengers 3, I hope they do a good job on the next one. I'll be interested to see how they make The Winter soldier into a big blockbuster. The second movie is the new movie called Guardians of the Galaxy. I haven't seen much of it, but my friend has seen it a little bit. The story revolves around a group of guys that decide to build a space ship to escape a planet that is being taken over by the bad guys. But their ship crashes on an alien planet and they must figure out how to get home. I think the film has great ideas that will keep me interested throughout. Here are some of my favorite movie reviews so far, from other movie lovers: The Amazing Spiderman 3 Review - Moviegoer Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them - Movie Review Doctor Strange - Movie Goer The Fate Of The Furious - MovieGoer Avengers 2 - MovieReview I also have some favorite TV and film quotes that I'd like to share with you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Temptation of Christ (2005) The Last Judgement When I saw the opening scene in which a man is taken to an electric chair (as shown in the opening credits), I was instantly on board the Judgment train. Not only was the movie beautifully directed, but it was so well acted and portrayed. The scenes were so well staged that you could almost believe they were happening in front of your eyes, or in the middle of a movie theater. This movie's plot focuses on a priest and his wife, who are both sinners in the eyes of God. They go to confession, and the priest asks her to give him a sign. She tells him about the smell of an electric guitar in their car. The priest, who has lost his faith, tries to prove that he was wrong, and gets a second confession from the woman. In the middle, they are told to turn their car off and sit on the curb, and they both go along with it. But then the woman turns the car back on and the man is killed. But the woman is not guilty of murder, for she is saved by God and becomes a new creation in God's eyes. I can't help but think of the words of Christ in Luke 16:27, "Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord and the cup that we have found, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood!" The first three acts of this movie were so captivating that I found myself thinking about these words. And yet, the fourth act was pretty much as expected: The priest and wife are dead, the guitar is no longer in their possession, and God is still watching and judging them. But in the last scene, something unexpected happens: They are not dead. They are taken to Heaven. So the question is: Did this movie have the right ending? Yes, I think so. But there is one last little problem I want to address: The Last Judgements of Christ. It has been called the worst movie ever made, and I can understand why. The movie tries to be an allegory for the Last Judgment and ends up being nothing but an empty, tedious, boring, and empty film.  In fact, I would not be surprised to find that this movie was never released. So don't go in expecting a good, entertaining movie. It doesn't even have the decency to be a movie.   It is just

The movie was a bit too long and had too many unnecessary plot threads that did not make sense.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This movie was a masterpiece from beginning to end. It's a little slow at the beginning (it took me an hour to finish the first act), but once it gets going the film picks up speed and then just keeps on going. This movie has so much plot that it almost feels impossible to watch at times. There are so many characters and you don't know where the story is going, but the film does a great job of giving you the story you want to see. This is a great example of a great movie being told on multiple levels and you can't get tired of it. If you are a fan of the books you will love this film. If not, this film is worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Last Jedi review - I got this a month ago, and I loved every minute of it. The characters are all great, the action is great, and the cinematography is good. I love the sound of the Star Wars sounds from the 70s. You can even hear the droids that are in the film now. One thing I noticed about the film is how much I like Kylo Ren. I have nothing but love for him and his actions. But I think what I liked the most about the character was how much of himself he was willing to give to make himself stronger. And that is something that the movie does not show too much of. So when Kylo's character does show it, he does so very well. I think that the other characters do as well. And I also liked how the story was told. The story is told with humor, and it is funny as hell. Kylo is such a douchebag, but then again he is in his first film. And he gets to be so much worse and worse from here on out. So for a first film that has some problems, the final act that is done by the other main characters is a good thing. They really show their love for each other and how much they care about each other. There are also some really good scenes that are shown in the final reel of the film, which is very well done. I did get a little confused when it seemed like the camera had moved on to a different shot. But it was fine and no major issues. This movie has all of the things that people love about Star Wars, and with more of that we would be in great shape. This is a fantastic film and well worth getting for those who enjoy the films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I was really surprised when I saw this movie and was not disappointed at all. I thought it was going to be a simple rom com with the love triangle thing and some action but it was more complicated and there was a lot of depth to it. The first half of the movie was about finding out who is cheating on you, what is going on, and when you are going to fight back. This was the part where I knew this movie wasn't going to go the usual route with a simple love story where they fight it out for the love of the game, but instead they would have a relationship that was more complex and was growing in depth. In the second half of movie, there were a lot more scenes that would have made me lose sleep but they are the last two scenes of the whole movie and they are great. The ending scene in this movie was a good payoff to the whole story. There were so many things that went into making this movie that make it a great movie, and I can't wait for the sequel. _______________________________________________________________ Cast: _____________ Emily Blunt, Josh Pence, David E. Kelley, Josh Hamilton. __________________________________________ Rating: _____________________ I really don't have a problem with a love story, but I can see why a romance novel is a good option for the director of this movie. I found it was very romantic and romantic, but not romantic in a way that makes me wish the movie would end. A few things that bothered me about this movie were: 1) the characters are not really likable. They are very annoying and they really lack personality and personality. They just seem to be there to try to get the hero to love them, so why do they make the hero get in a fight? It is not logical that one would fight the other. The other thing that made me annoyed about the characters were when the hero tells a woman not to give up, but she tells him she loves him because he is her hero. She is trying to tell the hero that the hero is the reason she is still around because he made her want to fight. I felt like that was very annoying. 2) I found the way they filmed the movies was very strange. They did not use a lot other than a few times during the movie, but other than that, they were not very creative. For example, in the movie where the heroine (the main character) is trying not to be caught, she

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the wake of a very strong start, the "Ghostbusters" franchise is beginning to suffer from a lack of consistency. It isn't clear what the "franchise" is supposed to be: "Ghost Busters" was an amusing reboot, "The Final Chapter" is a great sequel and "The Ghostbusters" movie, while decent, is nothing like the originals. If this movie had come out when the original "Ghostbuster" was in theaters (instead of in 1984), "The Ghost Dimension" would have been a hit. However, it seems that the writers wanted to put a new spin on the original film, rather than make a movie to match the original's standards. The Ghostbusters of the future look a lot like their Ghostbusters from the '80s; they wear silly, outlandish costumes with a dash of "The Jetsons." While this movie isn't bad, it isn't as good as the original, and it's definitely not as funny or as exciting as the 1983 classic. Overall Rating: B "Ghostbusters II" (1986) Ghostbusters 2 was the sequel to the 1984 film that featured the greatest cast to ever wear the Ghostbusters uniform. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver and Sigourney Staite all star, and the entire film is hilarious. Bill is a good, if unoriginal, comedy actor and he works well with the rest of the cast. Ayk, Ramis and Hudson are great as well, especially Hudson, who plays a retired New York City police detective who just happens to be able to control ghosts. A fun, light-hearted film with some great performances. Overall rating: A "Grim Grinning Ghosts" (1980) The first in a franchise of films based on "Nightmare on Elm Street." This film is a bit of an embarrassment when you think about it. It's so bad it's good, right? The plot is awful, the acting is terrible and the special effects are atrocious, but the ghosts aren't. The film is just a mishmash of poor ideas from several different directors. The best thing about this film is the music, which sounds like it was ripped from the soundtrack of the film. The acting is okay, but it's pretty obvious that these actors didn't have to play themselves in this film, and were instead playing someone else's ghost, so there's not that much

Write a positive review about a good movie:    *. .   "Avengers" has become the highest grossing film of all time (according to box office tracker ComScore) and it has been a box office juggernaut that can't be stopped for a variety of reasons. In spite of all its success, one of the biggest questions left to answer is, will Captain America: The Winter Soldier ever come out?  One of the most famous actors of all-time (and an absolute rock star) has already been rumored to reprise his role, but there are still several unanswered questions. Some of those questions are why the movie isn't being released in America, and how the Avengers (and, potentially, the movies based on their characters) will fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the below video, we discuss with a cast member of the movie and his thoughts on the rumors and whether or not it will ever get made.  You can watch the video below or on YouTube. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't really give a movie an average rating unless you've seen it. You can also't rate something a five-star film unless you actually know what it is and how good it is. So how do you know if a movie is good? It doesn't matter how good a movie may be; it's only good because we like it. When you don't like it, we all can see it. In fact, our reactions and the comments of other people are the most convincing evidence that we've actually seen the movie. So for the purposes of this guide, we're going to be looking at the comments left for each of the following movies: The Princess Bride,  The Lord of the Rings,  American Graffiti, and Back to the Future. I've already mentioned Back to The Future in the past, and you'll recall the great reviews, but the other movies are a good addition to our list. (Although they're all great movies, we'll cover them in a future article.) We'll be looking for comments that can be verified as genuine and not spam or jokes. These comments are usually in the following format: - "This movie was excellent, it is really a great movie. It was really well done, and I liked the cast and the plot." The first two lines are the ones you're looking for. It doesn.t have to be a lengthy reply to make a legitimate comment, so just be polite and try not to make it seem like you've just seen the film. After that it should read as such: - "... the movie was great... I like the characters.... the acting was great and all of the scenes with the characters were really well acted." - "...the movie is great... The acting is good... the plot is really good. You should see it!!!" - "...The movie was really good... I liked it..." A good rule to follow is to make sure that you don.t leave a comment that says something like, "This is a great film and I'm excited to see more." This isn't the kind of comment we want to see. If you have any suggestions for movie comments that you feel should be included, please leave a reply below. Also, you can also leave a review about any movie you like on Rotten Tomatoes.

It's got the best villains, the best characters and the best action scenes, all of which combined with an incredibly fast-paced story make for a great popcorn ride.  Why is this film worth your time? _____________  I just finished watching the series last night, and I'm really impressed. It has a solid cast that are all great in their own ways. I also enjoyed the story that was told. In the books, all we see is the aftermath of a terrible war and a new world in turmoil. The story here is told from a slightly different angle. It shows us how a society is recovering from the war and how a country has to adapt to the chaos that the war caused. The film takes place over a longer period of time and we are given more time with the characters to get to know them and understand their motivations.  "In God's Country" is an enjoyable film, but I don't feel it has the same depth as the books. The novel series is extremely dense and the film is a bit light on character development. If you are a fan of this series, I suggest giving this one a shot. I loved the end credits sequence, and it made me want to check out the rest of the films that have come out since. I would definitely recommend giving it a try!

It was the biggest thing I had ever done and it was going be done by a man. My mother had begged me to do it. The last time she had been here, I told her, "I don't need your money, I don't have any money and I don''t need anyone's permission. I can make this up as I go along." But I never thought that I could make this show. I thought it would be hard and I thought I wouldn't have a show to do. I remember standing in the living room, listening to the sound of the door closing. I wondered what he was going home to. What was he going to say to his wife? I wondered if it would make a difference if he walked in the door. That door wasn't going to stay open much longer. When he left I didn't want him to go anywhere alone. I took off my clothes and put on the bra and panties I had been wearing for years and put a new blouse on. I didn''t want to get out of bed, I wanted to be in bed watching TV. That was how I felt. After I changed I went to my makeup chair and did my makeup. My hair had been long and curly and it had been cut to my jawline and I liked it that way. I wanted this show to be something different. I put on my makeup and started taking off my bra. My friend, Jane, said, "Now come on." I did. Then I put the bra in the suitcase. I had gotten so used to being in my panties and bra that I didn''''t mind it being in the closet. I went out to get a cup of coffee, which I usually made myself, and sat in the back seat of my car, watching the TV. It started to rain a little bit. I looked out the window. I could see my mother looking at me. I smiled. She didn''ve been very upset since I had left. She told me not to be sad, because it had gone better than I could ever have dreamed. It''d been a rough week but she was happy. Then a few minutes later
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fun, well-constructed film that should appeal to fans of the '70s and '80s action movies, and those who just really dig the concept of a female superhero.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was pleasantly surprised with the film. A great director, great story, and a great acting talent all added up to an enjoyable experience. A little slow, a little long, but worth the time.   The movie is actually set in a different city in the USA, but it was shot in Toronto so it looked very Canadian in a way.    This movie is a little different from the last one I watched as the plot revolves around a detective called Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr Watson. This is a modern re-telling of the famous detective as a man with the mind of a madman, but I did enjoy this one a lot more.  It is not as funny as Sherlock, but this is what makes the movie, it is not a silly movie. The acting was great, even with a limited budget, the cinematography was fantastic, the music was also great and I just enjoyed this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gravity -  Fantastic.  Just amazing, really.   It's a fantastic film, and a great time at the movies.  If you think it's a little too long for a two-hour movie, you're not the only one.  For a film that's only about 2 hours and 25 minutes long, you would think that the acting would feel a little stretched out, but it actually does.  The acting is superb, with great performances throughout.  From David the director and writer, to Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, to Matt Damon (who is amazing, he can never lose) and Chris Pine, you couldn't ask for a better cast.  I loved the characters and the chemistry that the actors had.  George Clooneys performance is phenomenal, as usual, and he gave us a performance that I had never seen from him before.  Sandra Bullocks performance, well, she was great.  Her character, Elva is really quite amazing, as well as her character's husband, and their child.  Everyone else was great, and all of the characters felt realistic.  It doesn't have the scope that a big budget movie should have, but the acting, acting, and acting all make up for it.  A fantastic movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************* The first time I saw this movie, it was the first film I watched after watching Inception. That is not because I liked Inception, but because I was curious about this movie from the very beginning. As much as I love the original Inception (and still do), it had a lot of flaws. The movie took place in a prison that was used for high-security prisoners. It also had a very dark plot and I hated that I couldn't even see the end of it before I was about to leave. I thought the first thing I was going to see was a story about a man who gets trapped in a dream world by a man with an even darker past. Then the movie changed to a man that gets trapped by his mind in a virtual reality system that was created by someone with an evil mind. There are two main things I like about the movie and one of them was the visuals. The visuals were very impressive and the setting of the movie was very dark and dark. The graphics were a lot more advanced than the ones we saw in the previous movies and the colors were also much more vibrant. One thing I really like about this film was that the movie really made me think about how we make decisions and how we have those little pieces of information that we have that make our decision. It made me wonder why our minds can go in a loop and start to repeat everything we just saw. I think it is something that is very important in life and something I think we should always keep in mind. Even if it is only a dream, we are thinking about it and we don't even know it. I enjoyed watching this movie and I believe that everyone that enjoys the movies should watch it. It is a good sci-fi flick and it shows us how we can go insane when we are watching a movie. I can also't forget about the sound that they created for this film and I really enjoyed the soundtrack that they put together.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I was looking for was a remake of a well known film, which I believe was The Woman Who Loved Tom Gordon. The remake of that movie I believe had just been released in 1992, the same year I was born. The movie I found was called The Woman in the Red Carpet, written and directed by William Castle. And it was a good film, but it also has several problems. I can't say that this is a perfect film, and many of the scenes are not as good as the original. But I'm happy to say that there are a few great scenes in the film.  So the movie begins in this diner with a waitress giving some good service, which makes us forget that there is a man in a red car sitting in the front seat. The scene continues with some people in the diner, and then the guy starts to talk to a group of girls about the woman in the red carpet. He seems to find it amusing that the girls aren't going to the party because of the red car, which they all say it will just be in the same place. .  is very bad. The only thing that makes it passable are the dialogue and the scenes where the waitress is being very good. The rest is just boring, and most of it is just repeated scenes of people in different places. But it has its moments, and it is nice to see a red carpet scene. The main problem with this movie is that it's all repetitive, with many characters repeating the same scenes. Most of the film could be replaced with an old episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Train Robbery is a fantastic movie that is worth watching. It will probably remind you a bit of Indiana Jones. It has plenty of action, adventure, humor and a good story. I don't have a problem with that because, in my opinion, this is an Indiana Jones movie. But, if you are a fan of the Indiana Jones series, you will love it. But that being said, if the story doesn't work for you, that's OK because there's a lot of other great movie to watch. The Great Train robbery is about a bunch of thieves who try to rob a train. They get out of the train, run into a gang that wants the treasure and then go on to make lots of money. So, if your a fan like me, you'll love the movie. If you're not a fan, don't worry, because you'll have plenty of other good movies to watch anyway.  What do you think? Does this movie live up to the expectations? Do you like it? What do you see as its weaknesses? P.S. I will see the movie again. I am a huge fan of Indiana and I am still very much into the Indiana movies. I hope the director (E.R. Eddison) does a great job with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Well, as much as I'm not a "Cinema fan" per se, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. I was a huge Star Wars fan in my teens and I loved the movie in general, but I was also a huge Trekkie, so for years I've had this dream of one day seeing Star Trek: Into Darkness. It took almost 5 years, but here we are, after months of anticipation and waiting, it finally hit theaters and boy was it worth the wait. The movie is so faithful to the original story that even the CGI effects look like they are straight from the original movie. I don't want to give anything away, but the story is amazing. I know a lot of people had gripes about the film, but honestly, I found it hard to even find one complaint. For those of you who are looking for a good Star Wars story (and I'm sure some of you are, but trust me this is not the movie for you) you should check this movie out. It will not disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've loved this film so far and my friend actually managed to beat me in a 1v1 match.  I've seen most of the trailers for this film but I wasn't a big fan of this one.   This movie is a bit boring and I don't really find anything about it that captivates me.  The story is quite cliché and all the characters act pretty much like they're all doing the same thing throughout the movie.  This movie has a very well made soundtrack that is enjoyable.  My only real issue with this movie is that the ending of the movie is slightly unsatisfying.  4.5/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I found out that the director of The Crow (which I thought was amazing) wrote and directed The Crow, I was excited for a horror film about a Crow. However, in fact, the film was better than I expected. It is a more grounded and realistic story, about a young boy who is on the run from his father who has taken a wife and is taking the boy with him. His mother is dead, and the young boy must find a way to get the Crow back. It also has a dark plot involving the man who wanted the Crow to be used to kill the children of the town. I think I will watch The Crow again but this time with the intention of not being disturbed by it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an entertaining movie that does not take itself too seriously. A lot of the film is played straight with no attempts to make it seem more special. If you like comedies and action, then you should watch this movie. I liked it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is a solid, if not great, action movie. The action is pretty fun, with the addition of some fun martial arts sequences. The CGI was also not too bad, especially in the last fight. It does get a little cheesy at points, however.  If you want some good action with a little comedy mixed in, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you don't mind a little bit of silly humor and/or action in your action, then you probably won't enjoy this at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dawn of the Dead" is an excellent, action-packed film that I feel is worth the price of admission for any fan of the zombie genre. The film does have some problems, such as some of the acting (mostly by Tim Curry, who plays a Zombie) is a bit cheesy. On the other hand, it is a great, well-made zombie film. There are two things to say about the film's theme. It is a tale of survival, a survival of a different kind. The zombies are not a threat, at least to a small band of survivors. But that does not mean that they have no influence in this story. And in the end, they have to make some choices that could have terrible consequences. But ultimately the zombie apocalypse is not about the zombies; it is about survival. It deals with the loss of a normal human life, and this is what makes the film unique. If you are a horror fan, there is a good chance you will like this film. I recommend that you see this film if: You like zombie films; You like horror movies; You want to see a good zombie film without the "deadly" part; You enjoy the first half of the movie; You can stomach the first 20 minutes. And if you are not one of these fans, I would recommend you not watch this film because the film does not have any staying power; and also, because the zombies are boring. This film was good enough that I would see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* "Dirty Harry" (1971) is a classic of the genre. The first in the series (the film is actually a sequel to the book that inspired it) tells the story of Harry Callahan, a retired NYPD detective who is recruited by the FBI to hunt down a gang of killers. The book is a true crime classic. It has been described as "the Dirty Harry story told in the 80's". It is the perfect combination of a murder mystery and cop movie. It is a dark, gritty film that shows the dangers of the night and the danger of going undercover for the police. The story is told from the point of view of a man who is afraid of being in the field, and what he does to stay ahead of his enemies. As the title of the film indicates, the film also deals with the use of a weapon to enforce the law. This film is a great film to watch with the family. It's simple but beautiful. "Dishonorable mention" is for "Beverly Hills Cop 2". The film doesn't have anything special about it, just a bunch of cops running around in suits.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I've seen this movie several times. I've heard people talk about it and when it came out they were surprised how good it was. I have also heard about it's poor release, which has only increased my enjoyment. It's a movie that doesn't rely on the gimmick of the actor's name. The story of this movie is well made. The characters are well drawn. I just like to think that a director's work should have a moral in it. I like this movie's story because of it's great acting. I also love the music. The musical score is also good, but not perfect. In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies. There's something for everyone to enjoy here.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Dear friends: I've been trying to figure out a good way to write about what a truly stunning film The Great Beauty is. And so I have tried to put it in as few words as I can. It's not a good film and it does not deserve the hype surrounding it, but it's a great film nonetheless. For a film that takes a simple story line about love, and adds even more complexity, I couldn't have asked for a better director. It is by far the best film from this year, in my opinion, and this is the first movie that I've seen this year that I didn't hate. And you should do the same. As I have watched it over and over again, I found myself crying just as much as the movie's characters did. So that makes it perfect. The Great Beauties, based on the novel by Umberto Eco, is an emotional roller coaster for viewers. It opens with an explosion of color and energy as a majestic city rises on a cliff-top. The city is named Florence after the Italian Renaissance city founded by the Roman emperor Florence in 1564. The film is set in Florence in 1912, at the end of WWI, but things have not improved since the war. A civil war rages, and Italy is divided into two opposing armies, a fascist (German) one led by Mariano Salieri and a socialist one led the beautiful Rosa (Ingrid Bergman). They are divided along the line between the two sides of the war, with the fascists controlling parts of the city and the socialists controlling the rest. Florence is in an uneasy state of being. The government is corrupt, the army is brutal and the poor, the unemployed and the illiterate live in abject poverty. This is the film's real strength. The dialogue is simple and the story is engaging, but the film also takes the time to show the poverty, misery and racism in this country. The main character, Giuseppe, is a wealthy family man who becomes the new head of a company. He is married and has a family, but he is not happy in this life and is considering giving up his job. One day, a beautiful girl, Giulia (Ingvild Grani) walks into his office. She is very beautiful and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. Giusepp, for the first time, realizes that she really does have a lot of problems in her life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movie.  I enjoyed the movie. I was excited to watch it for some reason.  The movie opens with two guys trying to rob a bank.    When the men leave the bank, the women try to catch them and the police arrest one of the guys and take the other guy away.  The women are so excited to have the men that they leave the banks but their excitement is short lived.    Suddenly, the police catch up to the men. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty good. I think it's a lot better than what they were trying to do with it, which was just a sequel to an older movie. It is definitely a better version of that, however, and much more funny. It's worth watching and has good gags that aren't just there to keep you entertained. If you have a young child, it would probably work better for them, but for most kids it's fine. I've enjoyed it, and if you have kids who enjoy some good cartoons and are in the mood to watch something with a little more style than they're used to, this would be a good pick. I give it a 7 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I'm sure there's more to this movie than we think, but this is a good start. A little too long to be a good horror film, but it's the only time I've been scared in a movie for a while. This is great if you like horror. I'd definitely re-watch it. --------------- Don't waste your time watching this. It's nothing but a cheap movie that was made to appeal to a younger crowd. It has a cool title though, so if you're a fan of the original (I'm not) then by all means pick it up.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I like the fact that the main character is the one who gives the lectures at the start, and then the kids learn to read at the end. It's a very simple plot, and there are only about 15-18 different characters, and you do get a chance to learn about all of them. It also has some really great visuals. The music is great. It might have the least-fancied of the big boys, but the animation is excellent. It does tend to get boring in later episodes, but there are a few really fun ones here and there. The story itself is kind of funny and quite touching at times, and it has some fun moral about the human race. My only real complaint is that the characters all seem to be really uninteresting and uninteresting, and that they are all rather thin and lacking in personality. I think that they would have been much better if they were more like the characters in Little Nemo: Dream Out of Darkness. Posted by The Librarian at 10:07 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gorgo is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was blown away by the acting from all four main characters. It is all very well-acted and it shows their passion for what they do, not the fact that they are doing it, in the best possible way. This movie is also about a great love story between a very poor woman and a young boy, that I have always liked. It was also a film that I really enjoyed watching. It's a really good movie with great acting that makes the viewer happy to watch. I give Gorgo a 10 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ _______________________________________________ Reviewer: Chris Vermeer <clapg@wpi.edu> Date: September 18, 2004 Summary: I'm pretty sure I had a good time, but I don't recommend this for kids. I saw this as an 8 year old, and I think that's pretty far out. _______________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ Reviewer's Website: http://www.clapgarland.com/ ___________________________________ _______________________________________ ********************** ********************* Review of movie: First, a little back story: my family got the original version of Raiders of the Lost Ark from my brother's dad. We watched the movie as a family at Christmas every year, and my oldest brother was even good enough to get some extras (which I've forgotten). When Raiders of The Lost Ark came out, my parents bought me and my sister tickets for the first showing, since I was a little too young to get into the theaters. Needless to say, I was not impressed with the first movie. It was too long (the opening sequence had me wondering if this was really a film), and the dialogue was really bad. Even so, I enjoyed watching it for the duration of the three screenings, and when I saw Raiders of Liberty, I felt like I really understood what the Indiana Jones films were about. Even in this movie, it seems like Spielberg has gotten away with some things which are hard to do in a movie like this, but a few things just can't be forgiven. One thing about Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade that I really appreciated about it, was the introduction of Marion Ravenwood, who is a brilliant actress (though not nearly as good in the sequel). Also, it was nice to see what would become of Indy's relationship with Marion. The last thing I'll say is that I still prefer the first Indiana Jones over the second, but if I can't handle the first one, I can sure take a second one. I hope that one day Spielberg will give us a complete Indiana Jones series. _________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie and think it has all of the good qualities that make good movies good. I enjoyed the writing and acting in this movie. All the characters had great personalities. I especially liked the characters of the two kids from the first act, and their mother, who I think really got along well with the kids. I also really liked the relationship between the three kids. They were all on a journey together, but they were still close enough that they all knew when they were on separate paths to make sure that they knew each other. The music is really catchy and well written and I enjoyed it. I really hope that this movie gets made into a series, and I would recommend that anyone who is looking for a good action adventure movie go see this. This movie also has a great twist ending, and the best part about this movie is that all of these characters are on a quest for something much bigger than themselves and it makes the whole thing just really fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A wonderful movie! You need to see this movie." I know this movie is an unusual one in the fact that I like it so much. I'm a horror fan at heart but this is not one of my favorite horror movies. The story is quite a strange one. I won't go too much into it since I think most of the reviews I read have already done that for me. The plot of this movie starts out simple enough. A young man named Kevin (played by Jeff Goldblum) is working for an electrician in California. He is trying to help his boss get rid of the dead electrical wires that are on the walls of the building and getting close to death. But, as we find out, the wires that Kevin is working on are actually electrical demons that will try to kill him. But, even the devil can't help the worker out of his troubles. The lights on the building slowly go out and the people, who have been trapped for a long time and who have all lost hope, finally break down and open the door to find out that they are trapped in an electric closet. It is a very odd feeling when you are trapped inside a closet with no light and no escape. In fact, it feels much more like being in a haunted house than a movie. However, it soon becomes clear that the workers must escape from the electric closet and kill the demons in order to stop the building from closing down. If the building doesn't close down, the employees will be trapped inside for all eternity. The situation is almost hopeless but the workers have one chance. As you may have read, the Devil has something planned for this worker. But it seems that even the Devil cannot save the workers from their impending doom. It's not over yet. The Devil has a surprise planned for the worker as well. Kevin goes in after the demon and the Devil comes after him. But the workers can not stop the Devil who is after Kevin. I really don't want to tell too much more about the movie because I don't know if there's something to tell. It was just so bizarre, surreal and scary that I had a very difficult time keeping my thoughts together for the entire movie. For some reason, this movie was so creepy and different that I wanted to rewatch it a dozen times over.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ My wife and I went to see this movie at the AMC 16. We were not surprised when it was an A- rated romp. If you like romantic comedies, you're going to love this movie. And, I'm going to bet the romance is a lot of fun! There's a lot going on in this one, but that's what makes it so very enjoyable to watch. It features a great cast of characters and is full of energy, laughter and the unexpected. I would rate this picture at 94% on quality. It has a great plot, but I couldn't think of a single thing I could take issue with. Overall, I think the movie was definitely worth watching. If your watching this for romance, I can't recommend this enough. It's a must-see.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  "The Shining" (1982)  Stanley Kubrick is a genius and we know it. In "The Shining," he created one of the most psychologically terrifying horror films that we've ever seen. The film opens with an innocent family vacationing in the rural mountains of Colorado and as the film progresses we find out how this family has come to be at the center of the gruesome events that unfold. With a brilliant script by Jack Nicholson and a wonderful performance from Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, "The Shaking" is a scary and thrilling film. In fact, it's the most chilling horror film I've ever experienced. The acting from Nicholson as Torrance is superb, the directing is masterful, and the cinematography by Tony Scott is a masterpiece. I believe this film will be called the best horror film of all time. This was a film that has gone on to be considered a classic and has won several awards. I truly recommend this film. Highly recommended!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a big horror fan, but I can appreciate good horror.  So I was pretty psyched to see this one.  I like when the actors portray real people.  I was really impressed with what Chris Sarandon did with this role.   And his performance was the most important part of the movie!  Chris Sarandon plays a man who had to save his family.  He was a real father figure to his family, and I just love how Chris Sar, and the cast, portrayed him.  The story seemed to have a bit more plot to it than I expected.  It seemed more like an emotional film than an action film, though it did have a lot of those as well.  But it was great!

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  First I'd like to say that I was surprised by this movie and even more so by the ending. It was the most exciting part of the movie for me and the first time I've ever seen a film come full circle.  I was excited and terrified throughout the film, but I also felt it was necessary to show the audience what could have happened if it wasn't for the actions of these two individuals. This isn't about them, but how they changed the world and the lives of thousands of people. If this were just another Hollywood flick, it would have probably been the best part, but after reading the history of the two it was clear that this story needed to be told.  (3/5)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't have much of a problem with the movie. I wasn't expecting any great performance from our new favorite hero, but I wasn`t completely blown away either. A lot of action-packed scenes were done very well. It was a little surprising to me that he didn`t have a girlfriend at first, as he was a soldier. He really doesn`t care for girls. That`s about it. I don`t think this was meant to be an action film. I think it was meant as a comedic romp. I found the jokes hit at just the right time and with the right delivery. When I`m watching something, the funniest part of the movie is usually when something happens that is completely stupid and pointless. In this movie, there were quite a few moments of stupid. I was actually hoping the movie wouldn`t be so long. That way, I could just stop watching at any time and not feel that bad about myself. I would have rather just not spent a good amount of time watching this movie. So, if you like action movies and you like stupid moments, you might enjoy this movie a lot. I mean, I do too, but that`s just not enough for me to actually go out and see this movie once it opens in theaters. I just can`t bring myself to waste another hour of my life. However, if it gets the same reception I`ve received on its opening night, then I`ll have no problems in staying up til the wee hours of the night just so I can have a good look at this movie again. See it on the big screen!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix is a classic that deserves its place in the canon, even if it does not make the list of my favorite movies.  I really enjoyed it as a film and I'd love to see it again.    What is the best movie ever made?   I honestly don't think that there is a true answer.  There are many great films, and many great movies have gotten a little stale since I first saw them.  For that reason I think that the best film ever made is probably Citizen Kane.  I just really enjoyed the idea of seeing the first person perspective of a person and the way that the film portrayed it really made it that much better for me. I'm sure it is very similar for most of the people who have seen the film.  But as I think about it, I think the original Star Wars is my favorite film of all time.  It really is a great movie.  My only complaint is that it really was a bit slow for my taste.

The Best Movie: Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace ___________   Release Date: May 25, 1999   MPAA Rating: Rated R for strong language throughout, some disturbing images, disturbing images of violence and disturbing images suggestive of sexual activity.   Starring:   The Best Movie was written by John Logan, who wrote the screenplay for The Lion King. The Best movie was directed by Richard Donner, who also directed the previous two entries in the Star Wars trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Temple of Terror. The Worst Movie: Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade _______________  Indiana Jones and The Last Crusader was the last film that Indiana Jones starred in as the young archaeologist. The film was directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, and was based on the novel The Last Castle by Robert Jackson Bennett, which was written at the request of then-governor Ronald Reagan after the book had become an international best seller. Indy was supposed to make a film of the novel, but after Spielberg wrote a draft of the script, the governor refused to accept it, and ordered an entirely new film be produced instead. This was the final film that Steven Spielberg directed with the title Indiana Jones, and also one of the last movies to feature Harrison Ford, who played the film's eponymous protagonist. The movie was also the final movie to feature any Harrison Ford in a movie, as he was only in one scene that was not his own work. The Bad: The Worst movie in the series had an awful screenplay by Stephen J. Rivele, which did a pretty bad job of establishing what the plot of the film was supposed for. The worst parts of the movie were mostly the scenes that were supposed to be flashbacks to the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and even they weren't too bad. The other major problem in The Worst was the villain, a guy that the audience was meant to hate, which didn't really turn out that way. The Good: Indiana did his best to stay out of trouble, and kept it within the boundaries of what was reasonable. He saved his friends, and did what was required of him. The rest of the cast did a good job, and the acting was good. The bad guys were pretty fun too, as they didn't have to be very good, because the bad guy
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I liked this movie. It's an amusing movie with some solid acting. It has some good laughs and some bad ones. The movie is funny and the cast is pretty good. I'd suggest this to any fans of the cult-classic 'The Evil Dead' series and anyone else who's ever seen 'The Exorcist.'

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Did you watch this movie? If so, why? _______________________________ Reviewer: Mark D  I saw this film a week ago. It was worth it! You should see it if you want to know what it is about, who it is aimed at and if it can go over the edge.  What did you think of this movie:  2/5  If you liked this movie please share it with your friends.  the film is about a mother who decides to take her daughter to see the new horror film that was just released. She decides to buy tickets online and is shocked when the tickets are charged to her credit card. She starts to scream that she has not made any arrangements at all and that the ticket is fake and she is not going. After some time she goes to the theater and discovers that it is all just a stage and her daughter is in the audience. The mother starts to feel very uncomfortable in the presence of her daughter and wants to leave quickly but is unable to do so. Soon after she begins to hear a strange noise coming from inside the theater. When she goes inside the auditorium she finds the horror film is actually taking place in her home. The father is there and she notices that he is holding an umbrella over his face. She tries to leave the room with her daughter but finds her way blocked by a wall. She looks behind the wall and finds her daughter still in the auditoria and begins to scream. Her daughter is now trapped and is about to be raped. What would you do?  The film has a lot of blood and gore. The sex scenes are very good, but I feel that this is a film for older audiences.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My opinion about this movie: I'll go first and say that this was a really nice movie that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre of science fiction. I have been really looking forward to the new series since I heard the news of the show on the news. However, I was very disappointed with this movie. For starters, the story seems really rushed and there were very few elements to the story that I really found to be engaging. For instance, after we find out that there is a virus that could possibly be dangerous to our very existence as humans, there are several subplots that just sort of end and never really end. Even the ending itself was kind of poor as well. I found it to be very cliché and I would have much rather not seen this show at all if I had not already been told that it would be a good series. I was disappointed with the plot so much that it was hard for me to get into it at all. Overall, this was an okay movie that had a lot of potential. ______________________________________________________ Review by: James K. Date Added: 09/07/2004 Overall Rating: ~~~~~~~~~ - ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ - Rating: 10/10 - ~~~~~~ - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I first heard about this show on a podcast that I listen to often and it was interesting enough that I decided to give it a try and it really did not disappoint. There was a lot that was cool about this series, but I found that the story was rushed. It was a very slow start to the show but it was enough to get me interested. The plot and characters are interesting and I really do like that the aliens are human, in my opinion, though I do not think the humans will like it that much. Overall I was really surprised with this series and I was surprised with it a lot. I will give it an average score because there was a ton of cool stuff going on, but it wasn't nearly as fast or interesting as it could have been.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dancing in the Moonlight" was a wonderful movie. The actors, David and Laila, made you feel like you were in their story and the love story was powerful.  What a great story!  David's mother was an alcoholic and Lally's mother killed herself when David was 10 years old. Lally and her husband have four children; three boys and a girl. The story focuses on the relationships between them and the problems their children have when they grow up. The last two-minute scene in the movie is one of my favorite scenes and it was great to see it made into a movie. I was surprised that we weren't allowed to see more of the film. _____________________________________ I just saw this movie last night. ____________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ (I will not mention my personal favorite, because it's already mentioned in the article, but this movie has some great moments)  Review: (8.6/10) I thought I would be watching "The Thing" with a full stomach. I had an urge to put the kid in a cup and smash it against the wall, because I'm sure he'll be having a very bad time when he wakes up. Instead, I sat there watching the amazing opening titles. I know this is just a movie, and not an epic film, but I was still blown away by the amazing visuals and the special effects. I think this was a great introduction to the world of the movie, because a) we don't know much of what is going on until the very end, and b) it's a perfect way to get people used to the idea of monsters that exist in our world. I also love that it was made for a limited budget and that it came out in 1973. I feel like I learned more about what happened to the people in that base, and what was going on at that time, from this movie than from any other movie I have seen. I'm sorry, I couldn't give it any higher praise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The only reason that "Battleship" has gone out of print in America, is that it doesn't give you anything to write about, nor do you have anything to compare it with. It gives you a good story, a beautiful setting, a good cast, and the right message, but nothing you don't already know." - John Adams, Boston Globe The Best of Both Worlds: ____________________ The Movie: ________ The Good: _____________________________ "BATTLESCAPE" ___________ A classic of the science fiction genre, and a classic that many still refer to as the best, "BATTleship", written by Herman J. Mankiewicz, was a story that is very important to many of the writers who helped develop the genre of science fiction and horror, and that's not just because of its themes and subject matter, although it did that, it was also a great film, because it did have something the other science fiction films, while it was a bit dated and didn't have all the high points that many of those films had, it also had a very strong story and very interesting characters.  "Battlestar Galactica" "Bitter Truth" "Spartacus" "Star Trek" "Dr. Who" and of course "BEN 10" have a great deal in common. It's a story about a great evil empire that seems to be on the brink of destruction, and in the middle of the empire is a secret resistance movement that is also on the verge of defeat, a resistance that was actually led by an alien that's been sent here to help them. He is an old enemy of the humans that has been sent to Earth for some reason and now is fighting the evil empire and the humans, and as this battle rages around the galaxy, the two sides of the conflict realize that their enemies are coming for them, and what will happen if the humans fight the empire? "Ben 10" and "Bend's Pendulum" are also stories about empires that are on the precipice of destruction. Ben 10 and Bend's Pendulums were both science fiction movies that have a fantastic plot and a great cast, but that's where they all started, and both of these films have a very different feel to them, one being very grounded in reality, one of science fact, but both of them are both equally brilliant and imaginative. Both "Ben 10: Omn
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm going to do it. I'm going on a movie trip to Ireland next week (Feb 21-24, 2016) and I want to be in the back rows of the screening of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" in Bray, County Limerick. "Joule", starring Peter O'Toole and Robert Shaw, and directed by Richard Condon, has been playing in theatres for nearly 30 years, but the cast is still pretty exciting. I hope to see Robert Shaw in a new role. It's always a thrill to see his face and I'm so glad that we get to see him again. There's also one other person that I'd like to see, but I'm still unsure. It would be great to see Tom Hanks in a role. I've never seen his work and I've always been a huge Star Trek fan, so I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. I'd be interested in seeing a new incarnation of "Willy Wonka" too. It was just a little while ago that we saw that and I'd really like to go see it again. If I could see it with a crowd of people I'd love it. "Wonka" is a great movie and I have great memories of it, so a crowd would be wonderful. I was told that it is a very faithful re-creation of the film, so there's some great characters. One of the best parts of the movie is the story. It makes for a good summer read and a good way to spend a day on a beach. "The Adventures of Tintin" is also set to play in Bray. I have not heard much about it, but if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about. That was my first ever movie and the only one that I've ever seen in its entirety. It is a little slow, but a must see. I just can't believe that people still make movies that are that old, that's for sure. I really enjoyed "Candyman" too, and I don't want to miss it if I see it in Bray again. I remember the first time I watched it, and it was a little bit of a strange experience. I can't remember the title of the play it was based on, and was surprised that there wasn't any real dialogue to the play, but it was well-made and the ending was a very haunting
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was good, but not a very good movie. If you have seen the other ones then you will notice that they were great. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to several other characters including the villain, we see a great action scene, and they are the reason this movie is great. Also, the film is set in the 1800s, so it's a great look at the times. If they had changed the main character, it would have been a great movie. We did not get to learn too much about the characters, and the characters were not developed. There was no love story in this movie, or if there was a love story, it was not developed well. I thought they should have developed the characters and the story in the beginning. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but you should watch the other movies first. 

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wake up, go to sleep and repeat. - January 12, 2016Great, and easy to follow "Great!" is a word that you see more than enough times on this site. It's one of my favorites, and it's one that we use to describe many movies. This is another movie that I had no doubt was going to be great. If I was a betting man, I would have bet that at the beginning of the film, the title would have been "Wake Up, Go To Sleep" and that the rest of the reviews and the buzz surrounding the film would have not come around for several more years. I'm surprised how this one has gotten out so far in advance. I've got no problem with this, as it's not like I can get a copy on DVD or Blu-Ray. We're talking about an "event" film here, and there's no better way to get one than to give it a shot through streaming. When I first heard that The Grand Budapest Hotel had a streaming tie-in, I was skeptical. But I was wrong. It is a great film, not only for its subject matter, but for the quality of the cast and direction. The cast is not only great, but a great bunch of guys. The movie is a dream to watch, so I will take my time and allow the story to unfold before I comment. I will say that this film is not a comedy by any means, but I didn't feel like I was watching any comedy. It was an ensemble film, and the cast handled the material so well. The way that the actors came off with such ease and ease, especially the supporting cast, is really a treat. I have to admit that I'm not sure what I thought of the ending, but my thoughts on it are more positive now than I was before I saw it. The entire movie is very well directed. It has all of the classic elements, like a great score, beautiful camera angles, and great acting. The story itself is more of a fairy tale, but at the same time, is about real people with real issues. We see what happens when those issues get the better of them, and in the case of Oscar, I couldn't help but think of all the times that I heard stories about people who get into situations where their lives will be at the mercy of their illnesses. We saw this in the film and there is so much that can be said about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Your review has been submitted.  There's a lot that needs to be said about this movie. The most important thing is that I never would have imagined that a film about a teenage boy in an abusive relationship could be as moving as it is. But this is a movie that not only manages to be human but also humanizes. There is no way around that. It is very difficult for me to describe this movie, as it was so unlike the films I've seen before. As much as I have to give it credit for being unique, there are plenty of other movies that also have this element in them, but they are not as deeply resonant. The film's story takes place in the town of Alderney, a small, but extremely lovely seaside town, which is on the western coast of France. When a friend of the teen's, a beautiful girl by the name of Alyssa, disappears in the early summer, his friends begin to worry. As they do, there is a strange series of events that lead to the teen discovering his girlfriend has been murdered. We watch as the teen becomes more and more obsessed with Alyss, and the way that she has been portrayed in the news. There are many things I can criticize this movie for, but one of the things that stands out most for me is that it can't be appreciated without a very long watch. It starts out slowly and steadily builds up as it goes along, and when it finally does get really good, it is a stunning, emotionally-driven and moving film.  I think the movie is a masterpiece, and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of you agree with me. The movie was a huge success at the box office when it was released, so don't miss out on it.   Like this: Like Loading...

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I have been a film buff for as long as I can remember and I am a sucker for a good action film. This movie was on my must watch list so I took the chance to see it. The trailers are always misleading about the actual plot which doesn't really matter to me. All that matters to me is the film itself and its overall quality. I was disappointed with the ending of the movie, but what could have been worse? I'll leave you with my favorite line from the film "The only thing that gets me going is when I'm having sex with an action star and I have to watch them do a backflip and the camera keeps rolling." I was very excited to see this film and I was not disappointed at all. It was one of those movies that I would watch again and again. I would like to take the time to tell everyone that this film is not just a movie with great action, great actors and great set pieces. This film is a whole other thing! It has great character development, and great chemistry between the three leads. Even the bad guys had moments where I was really rooting for them. I really enjoyed the way this film was edited and shot. I know there are a lot of people out there that don't like action films. They think that just because someone is doing something cool, it's not a good film. However, I can say that I did like this film! The story is great, the action was great, and the actors were great. I highly recommend this film to all fans of action films and it should be on everyone's must see list!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  "This movie is a classic, a masterclass of film noir: the first two thirds, the most exciting, thrilling, exhilarating parts of the movie. The third part is all a mess and the last two are just muddled, unfocused, uninteresting, even disheartening." _________________  This movie was one of the most difficult to make in my career. My first experience with it was with two friends and we all had the same problems. We were the only people in the theater, so it was a long time before we finally saw it. We had seen all of the James Dean films and the classics and had always enjoyed them. However, we were tired of James Dean, so we wanted to see something different, but the only thing we could think of was that this was a classic and we must see it again. _______________________  After watching the first film with my wife, I was afraid this would be a slow affair. It was not. In fact it was the film with the best acting, most exciting action, most memorable scenes and a lot of mystery. It's a classic noir, and the reason why it still holds up to this day. _________________________  the greatest thriller of all time  by John B. Wells This is a great thriller, with some amazing suspense. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys thriller films. ___________________________________________________ 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** This is definitely not a great movie, and that's before we even get to the story.  However, the story and cast of characters are great and the plot keeps building up.  The story of this movie is about a girl that decides to quit her job after a particularly bad day and instead become a professional ballerina.   It all begins with a young girl from Russia, the daughter of a wealthy and beautiful family, named Nina.  Nina is looking for her mother who has just lost a large sum of money.  The poor girl, who is struggling to get by, comes across a homeless man named Max, who tells her that she has a lot to live for, as she can become a ballerinas.  After the first encounter, the two begin to have a sexual relationship.  Once the first act ends, they realize that they aren't even that far apart sexually.  They both become bored with each other.  However, Nina gets the idea to make her dreams a reality and takes off for New York City to look for a job in the ballroom world.  While she is there, she meets a handsome American man named Kevin.  He takes her to his apartment where they engage in many sexual acts.  It appears that the two of them are destined for each other and Nina becomes a ballroom superstar and he becomes a successful corporate employee.  Unfortunately for Nina, Kevin is much more than an employee, as he has begun to become a kind of friend.  Eventually, Nina discovers that he has something in his past that is far darker then what he has tried to cover up with his successful company.    Kevin has a very dark past that makes him a complete sociopath.  These two characters are both extremely unlikable, and don't have much in common except for that they are both men, and have similar problems that need to be solved.  So far, so bad, right?    I have to give this one a positive rating, because the first half is really well made.  I really liked how Nina is the main character, as it was interesting to watch a young woman do what she needs to do to move forward.  What I didn't like about this movie was that there was no chemistry between the two.  If I were going to watch this again, I would not recommend it to anyone, as both characters were unlikably terrible.  A great movie would

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film made by Japanese with an American crew.  "Americanized" (2002)   Starring:  Tilda Swinton, Ben Kingsley, John Hurt, Helen Mirren, Robert Redford, and more  Review:   It is a good film but it is not really a thriller.  The mystery/action plot is really a series of coincidences, the movie's ending is a bit disappointing, and the acting is good for the most part.  I was really not sure what to think, but it was fun watching the various people who play in the mystery/thriller plot interact with each other.  There are some good moments in the film but for the majority of the film it was too convoluted for me.  Starring:   Tilda Director:   Kenneth Branagh Director:   Branagh Star Rating:  I am not sure if I have any comments on this movie, but I can say it was interesting to watch it.  It reminded me of the first few episodes of Game of Thrones and was very entertaining to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** It's a very interesting movie that is very different than the typical horror film. It is very disturbing. The story line is very interesting and it is a true story. A small town is terrorized by a supernatural presence in their town. The only way to keep the town safe is to hire a private investigator to find out who the devil is. This is not your ordinary movie as it has lots of blood and guts. The acting is very good, but I didn't really care for the characters. It's like watching a horror movie from a child's perspective. But the movie is great and has a very good rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an excellent movie. It was good for a few reasons: (1) The main characters are so interesting. (2) The ending is perfect. I am surprised that the writers of this movie haven't made sequels. I think the movie could be even better. It would be a great film for children, and adults, but not the kind of movie that should be watched by people who don't like the supernatural. It's about a girl who has been sent to a "school of love" to learn how to be happy with no problems. She doesn't quite get the idea but then goes to her room for a nap and wakes up one morning to find her room filled with strange animals that have been waiting for her for days. They tell her that they are going to get their next meals by feeding her to them. In addition, she has a strange feeling about her stomach and it causes her to have an upset stomach and have to go back to school. She is sent back to her regular class but now all the students have been turned into animals. The teacher is very angry and starts throwing around a lot of words like "cursed" and "unholy". She has even started talking about "evil". The teacher even brings in a new teacher and tells her to make sure this "new girl" learns to love her as much as she does the other kids. Her best friend also goes missing. At this point she starts to realize that she has been duped. She comes back to class and sees all the other students turned into their animal forms. She has to get to the principal and find out why it happened. Once there she meets the new teacher who is so beautiful that she causes the students to fall in love with her. She starts to teach them how to love each other. In the end, she and the other teacher realize that they have all been part of some kind of "magical show". This movie is a bit like watching the Wizard of Oz in the first 10 minutes. It has so many surprises that I was completely blown away. The book is very well done. It is very funny and the dialogue between the characters is quite interesting. The author also is very creative and gives a lot more depth to some of the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The most remarkable thing about the way this movie is made is how it works on its own merits, and not the other way around. The story is very strong, although not all the characters are developed, it is possible to care about most of them and you will feel sorry when they die and that is the only reason you will come back for more. As for the story, it tells you why people fight, the good and bad things of life. It's a simple story and it is told very well. I felt a lot of sympathy for the characters, the way they faced themselves and how they would react to certain situations. I think it was a nice touch. As mentioned before, some of the dialogues are very funny and can leave you smiling for hours. It is one of the best movies ever made about war and it makes you appreciate it.

"I wanted to like this movie, I felt it was a decent movie, but the story didn't really make me care about the characters. That being said, I did enjoy it and I recommend it to those who like a good film with strong themes and interesting characters." 2) THE BLUE MOUNTAIN (1996) The Blue Mountain is a strange, beautiful movie. It's an art film in the most simple sense, a movie about the artist who has a hard time finding his inspiration and being in the right place at the right time. It was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and it was based on his own story of a painter in Greece that is called The Mountain. He starts out by saying "I'm not the painter that you think I am. I'm not an old man with a beard and a beautiful woman in his life". Then, he shows his masterpiece and says "Oh my god, this is what it means to be a good painter, it's so beautiful, so complicated". The film then jumps to a character named John, who comes back to Greece to work for Yorgus and who is a very complicated character as well. He is one of the best characters of this kind of film. The character is a complex one and he doesn't know what he wants from life and it's a question that we are all asking. His wife, the very beautiful Lila (Iris Bell) goes with him on his trip and she starts to feel his pain and he tries to get what he loves from life, but it is something that he can't seem to get. It is a simple, beautiful film, but very touching. 1) THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1978) Lebowski is one great movie. I would be the last one to say that it is not a great movie but it has all the qualities a great American movie has and it is funny and it can make a person laugh out loud. I loved the movie, it has that great American atmosphere, the American music and the atmosphere is great. It has great dialogue and great character development in it and the characters are very interesting to the audience.

It's a story about a group of friends who become involved in the local scene, including a young man who is addicted to heroin. One evening, the group gets together at the home of a friend of the family (whose son had just died). They talk about things like sex, drug use and politics. I found it very hard to follow the plot. I can't see how the film is able to tell a cohesive story with so many scenes happening in quick succession. I also didn't like the cinematography, as it looked very amateurish to me. I guess it worked well for the actors since they were all very good at playing their parts. And they did manage to convey the spirit of that period of American history. But to me, it's so amateurish, so much in the way it's shot, that it lost any ability to impress me. This movie is probably one of the most boring American movies of all time. I hope it will have some impact on the minds of the youngsters at the upcoming Columbine high school shooting, as well as the people of England, who were responsible for the same thing. |__________________________|_________________________| |_____________________________| |__________________| | | A Song For Arbonne - The White Noise (2002 | | The directorial debut of Italian filmmaker Fabrizio Ficca is a very beautiful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You know what? The movie sucked...but it was just okay." The whole thing was just a complete waste of time, but I think it was at least enjoyable for its length. And there was no way that the movie could have lasted any longer, it was boring and rushed.  I didn't see it again, but then I decided that I should watch it once more, to see what I might have missed.  This time, I went out with a friend to see it.  And what an experience it was.    There were moments when I felt like I had never seen this movie before.  But there were also moments that were enjoyable.   In this movie, a young woman is kidnapped and taken to a house by her captor, who has two male slaves for her amusement.  And what a way to make a movie about slavery that is also about a rape!  The story is told through a series of flashbacks.  The first is about the young girl being kidnapped and she is forced to give a slave a blowjob.  Her master then decides to force her to have a baby by taking her virginity.  After giving birth, the slave is sold into slavery, the next flashback being of a girl named Mariela, who is sold at a slave market.  She is sold to the man that gave her to the slave trader.  It is there that we learn that the "slave" was a woman, and the girl in the flashbacks is Mariel.  We see the other slaves, who are also all women.  When the woman comes back from the market, she is brought to a cabin with the man who bought her.  They have sex.  While the slave in the flashback has given birth, Mariel is now a virgin.  Mariel and the man then sleep together.  Afterwards, the man sends Mariel to the market and the woman takes her to her family.  A few days later, the old man comes home, to find Mariel, now a mother.  On her way to the house, she stops at a pawnshop and there, buys a knife, which she uses to rape the old person.   The old man then beats her, and then they have sex once again.  As they make love, Mariena has a sudden seizure and dies in the middle of the bed.  This is Marieno's last dream.  Then

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ When I first saw the title of the movie "The Way" I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen. I had never seen a film called "The Big Sick" until now. The first time I saw the film I said to my friend "it has a lot of heart" and that it was something different than what we had seen in the past. I'm glad we saw this because it is a very good film. The film is not for everyone, some people will like the comedy, some will not, some may find it a little too preachy but in all honesty it is what the film is about. The plot of the film begins when an actress named Mindy Kaling (who had the same role in "Girls") decides to come to New York and start her career. She arrives in New York to try her hand at acting in the world of New York theatre. The story begins after Mindy arrives in a hotel room to see a play and finds her friends were not there and she had no clue where to go. This leads Mindy to realize she has been sent to this hotel in order to commit suicide. She goes back to her room and has a drink, thinking she is going to drown herself in the sink but instead she is seen by one of the hotel workers and takes her to the bathroom. This is when Mindy sees the way people around her act towards people they don't know. She begins to realize that this is the way other people treat others and she wants to change. In her bathroom she gets a call from her mother and she immediately calls a friend and rushes to the hotel where her mother is waiting. It's then that Mindy realizes how different the world is now than it was 10 years prior when she saw her mother for the first time. In the meantime, the rest of the cast and crew were in the bathroom and they find Mindy, she realizes the reason she is here is because she committed suicide and this is why people have been calling her on the phone and showing her all the bad things around her, she then leaves the bathroom feeling better about the world. Mindy and her friends are then seen in a bar and her friend calls her back to the restroom where the bathroom scene begins. As Mindy continues to go through her day, she meets a man she meets named Seth and decides to get dinner with him. Mindia becomes the next person that she meets, and she is a mother.

This is one movie I will be watching again. - GQ on The Great Gatsby (2013) " This is, in the grand scheme, a little silly; a movie that's really more about friendship than anything else, a movie about a woman and an orphan who are living their lives and growing up together, a romance between them that isn't going to last. - David Thomson on The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2014) "It is so difficult to give a movie such a glowing review, but it must be said that, at the end of its first act, you feel the sheer weight of a film that takes place over the course of a few months and that, by the end, feels more like an eight-hour period piece than any story that may have preceded it. - The New York Times on Django Unchained (2010) This is the third and final piece in a series of posts on the films of Quentin Tarantino. Previous posts can be found here, here, and here. Quentin Tarantino is a filmmaker who has proven time and time again that he is one of the most inventive, creative, and original storytellers in film history. It's true that Tarantino has made a few films that are of mediocre quality, but no one can deny that the talent he has shown over the past 25 years is undeniable. Tarantino's latest film is his most audacious and ambitious effort, a fantasy-themed epic featuring an ensemble cast led by Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Forster as Django and Dr. King Schultz (played by Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz respectively). The film centers around a world where a young girl named Shoshanna, played by Tarantino herself, leads a gang of slaves through a series if dangerous adventures and confrontations. It follows them through their various adventures and the various conflicts that the film throws at them, and it is quite remarkable to see how Tarantino juggles so many storylines in a short period of time. The film, which is set to release later this month, is also Tarantino's most ambitious to date, taking his signature style to a whole new level. The

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* It was an excellent movie to watch. The story of the boy and the girl, how they meet each other, how he is introduced to her and how they become involved with each other was very exciting and the way in which they met made the movie feel alive. I enjoyed the movie very much and will watch it again. The boy is an interesting character as he is quite shy and does not get along with the girls, who often become hostile towards him and the situations that he finds himself in. The girl is beautiful and attractive and has an amazing body which I can only describe as being hot. I was quite surprised when the girl told him she had an affair with a boy called David and that she would marry him and live a happy life with him. I can see a girl being very attracted to a boy like this, and I think the movie did a good job of showing the girl's feelings for David. ********* This movie was made to entertain the viewer, so it was quite amusing. If you like to see two people who seem like they would go on to get married but then never are able to meet because they are not in the same town, then you will like this movie. ************** I give it a rating of 8 stars out of 10 **** *****
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " A new breed of Hollywood action star makes his debut here, alongside the original James Bond and the first female James Bond, in the new movie'Skyfall,"' directed by Sam Mendes.  Mendes, as well as the rest of the crew, put the most impressive amount of time and effort into capturing the atmosphere and history of 007's home turf.    As we get into the story of 006 (Daniel Craig) being offered a job in London, his first official mission as MI6 agent is to stop a man trying to steal a diamond worth millions.   As the movie opens, we see a young Daniel Craig getting ready to travel to London.       He is meeting with a woman named Vesper Lynd (Léa Seydoux), and when he gets to the airport, he's not sure if he's in the right place.                     The scene that I loved the most was when Craig's father and Vesper's father (Sacha Baron Cohen) meet and tell Daniel to come home and be a good son.     As we go from scene to scene, the Bond franchise slowly transforms into a very interesting and mature film with a great ensemble cast of great actors. _________________________ Skyfall is the perfect 007 adventure movie because it is filled with many references to the films before it.  What makes this film special:   I think the most interesting thing about Skyfall, is its inclusion of all the other James Bond films.  Skyfall has a wonderful soundtrack, a strong story and many memorable moments.  The most intriguing thing for me about this movie is not only that we get a new James Bond; it's how Bond is the first to be a woman.  That is a really interesting idea that has been done so few times in the films.    I will see Skyfall again and I will give it a perfect score because it was an amazing experience, filled with amazing locations and some of the best action scenes I have seen in the James Bond franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I watched this for the first time today and just wanted to comment on the acting. I love that there is a real-life person in every scene, and even though some of the other actors in the movie aren't as great, it still feels like you're watching someone on stage. I'm surprised the actors were able to pull it off though. I think the actor who played the teacher in the classroom scene should have just let her walk in, and not put her in a wheelchair! It could have been embarrassing to watch, especially because the teacher was the only one who seemed to actually care. The kids didn't seem to know what the problem was and I wondered if she was faking it. The only bad thing about the acting was that I was surprised by how easy it was for them to do. I thought the acting of the kids was good though, and they seemed to be a very talented group. This movie might not be for everyone. I felt like it was a little too serious for me, but I don't think that would necessarily be a negative. For a family movie, it does a great job portraying a family, and I was very pleased with how the whole thing turned out. I didn't mind if they didn't go all-out when it came to the special effects, as it was still a very good movie. It also is worth mentioning that it's probably the only horror movie I've seen that was better the second time around! :)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are not many movies I've seen where the script was so good that the acting was so bad that it's really hard to find anything bad about it. I've watched it twice. First time, it was good, not perfect, but good enough. Second time, was a disaster. In order to make the movie work, you need to get an actor with enough charisma to overcome the terrible acting and make up for it with a good story line. This is not the case with this film. The movie is bad and doesn't care about it's actors.  The movie follows two different groups of people (Crazy George and Mr. Zsasz) who decide to work together to fix a car crash that will kill one of their friends. When they set out to do it, they start to realize that their intentions to do the right thing are not as noble as they think. The acting was atrocious and the character development was absolutely worthless. The script was a mess and the direction was awful. The music was terrible and the editing was terrible. The ending was a total joke.  It was clear that the entire production team was not interested in this film so they just rushed it through to get it into theaters. If this movie had been done with more care, it would have had a very good chance of being a decent film. I'm not sure what was worse, the awful script or the atrocious acting. I give this film a C+

A great adventure for me and my family.    The film's good enough to keep you in the theater.  A great adventure you would like to do it again.  One of my very favorite movies. - Eric A. Well, what can I say. I loved this movie.  This is the type of movie I really want to see.  The actors were great, the camera work was fantastic and there were some great stunts.  I thought this movie was awesome.  It had all the stuff I wanted and more.  Not to mention the story line was very well written and a great story about an old school adventure.   I also found the music a bit out of place.  There was this nice folk/rock tune that I really loved the feel of but I felt it was a little jarring.  But other then that, this is an awesome adventure movie!  - Peter P.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A year after a horrific school shooting, Adam Lanza opened fire on his fellow students in Newtown, Connecticut. The first shooting killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary, and the second killed 20 more in the elementary school's cafeteria. The gunman killed himself before police arrived at the scene.  For the past five years, Lanza has been the subject of a documentary called "The Incredible Truth," in which a man named James Kolarz interviews many of his surviving schoolmates, their families, and Lanza's parents. The film depicts how the shooter's mental condition was the main reason he was able to carry out the horrific crime. He was a loner who "did not understand that violence is wrong," Kolar said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. "The people who were around him knew him as a lovable and caring kid and not someone who could commit these mass shootings."  The documentary was made in order to raise money for Adam Lanzas' family after the shooting, which made headlines in 2012 after Adam Lanzone, the then-18-year-old shooter's older brother, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon. In the documentary, which is also available on YouTube, Adam is repeatedly shown as a shy and innocent boy who was never violent or aggressive. The interviewees say that he had no emotional problems until one day while he was 9 years old, when he decided to do something he never had the opportunity to do, the Washington Post reported. He decided to "shout out his hatred for everybody in the room," and that made him angry. In a 2011 profile in the Washington City Paper, Lanzone's older sister, Emily, said that Lanza did not seem like a bad kid. She recalled that he loved to draw and had a talent for drawing, a trait he shared with his brother. She described him as "really good at art," and said he was also "kind of a loon."  and that this alone didn't explain why the boy would carry out an act of such brutality. "We can't deny there is a part of Adam that does have mental problems," Kolars told BuzzFeed News in an email. "However, there's no evidence that Adam had a real history of violence or was capable of carrying out the crime alone." It is true that Lanz was never diagnosed with any mental illness, and it is possible that he is now a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* [A] a solid effort by a great director. I'll be back for more. ***** [B] not my cup of tea but good film nonetheless. **** [C] i would've loved for more of it to have been as well written as the first. ****  I have to be honest: I'm not a huge fan of the genre of zombie movies. For some reason I think they are a bit of a stereotype. I mean, I love a good zombie movie but I'm tired of seeing them. So, when I heard about Zombie Flesh Eaters I was excited. The movie starts out great, with a zombie going on a rampage around an unsuspecting population. It is then interrupted by a young man who discovers one of the infected zombies. He decides to try and kill it and saves the young woman. So the movie keeps moving forward, all the while trying to capture the essence of a good film. There are a few good moments here and there. I'm thinking of the scene where they walk around a shopping center and see a man walking down the road with his head covered by the hood of a vehicle. They think he's dead and continue their walk, but in reality he's just trying to hide his identity from a group of people who seem to want to hunt him down. And I did laugh a few times. The pacing in this film can be a bit annoying at times and I thought the actors were playing it safe with most of their dialogue. I loved that when they cut to the zombie in the middle of the night, it was completely silent, even as it took aim at them. The zombies in this movie were a good mix of the classic types: There were a few "I wanna be a hero" type zombies, a little too fast and aggressive, a couple of very realistic looking ones that had some good laughs, and then some crazy ones with more body horror and blood/smoke. They all have some cool moments in the movie and it is quite enjoyable. The film had some interesting visuals and music, though the soundtrack did get a little repetitive at times. So this was an entertaining and decent film, though I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!My favorite movie of all time (I watched it a few days ago) is... and I don't say this often, but I'm going to say it... The Shining.!!!The Shining is not just a great movie. It is THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER.!!!It is also a very controversial movie (for good or ill) in the horror genre, in that it is the first "overlooked" movie in horror cinema, for many. It also has the distinction of being one of the first films to use the sound of dialogue (as opposed to still images) which was quite revolutionary at the time (1961), since it was still a new medium at the cinema and had yet to really catch on. It was also the first film to feature the use of color (and one of only two to do so, the other being The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which features black and white photography) and it was also one of those movies that, for a long time, was believed to have been a flop (and I mean that literally), but is now widely considered to be an amazing and terrifying achievement (it won the Academy Award for Best Film of the Year). The film is very well produced and it's well directed. The pacing is fantastic, and you get the feeling you are watching something amazing (especially since the film is a very short one). It has great acting (particularly in Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, the film's two stars) and a very haunting ending which I think is quite appropriate for a story about a family in a horror movie. The Shining is the kind of movie that when you think of a scary movie you think, "Oh my God! How did it ever happen?" It's that good. I've been a fan of Kubrick's work ever since I first watched Full Metal Jacket (yes, I am one of your people), and for whatever reason he always just seems to do amazing things with his films. The best example of this is the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, an amazing piece of work by a genius. This film, of course, was also a huge influence on Kubrick and is widely considered his masterpiece. This is the reason why The Shining (and Kubrick's films in general) are sometimes seen as being the closest thing to a "real" film that exists. Kubrick, as we all know, is an amazing director, who has influenced a huge number of people including the writers

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Starring _________  Director __________  Screenplay by ________  Music by _______  Cinematography by ________________  Production company __________________  "I found a film that has never been heard before," said a reviewer for the Chicago Tribune. "It is an astonishing and unexpected achievement."  The Film  "The Manchurian Candidate" is a CIA thriller, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick (who invented the term "hard core pornography"), that features two of America's most infamous, and least likely, American characters, one a fictionalized version of an actual character, and one a real-life American intelligence officer named James McCord.  McCord, played by Robert Duvall, is a fictional agent of the CIA. The character is portrayed to be the embodiment of everything evil that the CIA is known to be, and is given a very real and troubling mission. McCord is assigned to the Soviet Union to gather information about the Russian and Chinese secret services and to assassinate certain people connected to the KGB, including President Kuznetsov. "I did my research," said Dick. "If there's a KGB officer in Russia, I wanted him to be as unsympathetic to the Russians as possible, and that was all I had to go on. If there's an agent of espionage in the Russian military, I also wanted to have him be an amateur and incompetent and incompetent. I just let the characters speak for themselves and did my best to write for them." .  I watched it in English on a large projection screen at the B.O.B. on the first floor of the University of Chicago. It was an exceptionally dark film that made me nervous the entire time. After a couple of viewings, I began to think that I'd be fine, but then, a couple nights later, the film started to look like an adaptation of a Philip K Dick novel that I had seen many, many years before. I had forgotten all about it.  "The Manchanter's Candidate" was first released in 1959. It is the longest film in Dick's entire filmography. So when I first saw "The Woman in Red" in 1999, I knew I wanted to see it again. It's about the same thing, except that it's even more dark and disturbing. The characters are not quite as memorable as in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wreck-It Ralph  was very well written and directed, in this case by John Musker and Rich Moore. The film has great humor and is filled with a lot of action scenes. The characters are all well done and some of them have great moments. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the cartoons and all the old movie characters, but it would also make for an interesting family film.  2.5/5 Ralph was one of the most popular characters to come out of the classic animation. This Disney sequel to the original animated film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world and stars the son of King Ralph of the desert kingdom of Auria. Ralph and his friends are on their way to visit his father, but they are stopped by a large, mechanical flying fortress. Ralph attempts to fly through it to their father, who is on the other side. Unfortunately, the gate closes before they are able to fly. They then find a giant robot named Scarface and the gang gets a ride on him to a castle on the moon. As the movie progresses, the robot begins to transform into something resembling the King of the Desert. The main problem with this film is that it's really difficult to determine who is good or evil. There are a number of scenes in the film where Ralph, his friends, and the King are pitted against each other. The King is portrayed as a bit of a dictator, but I don't think there are any characters portrayed as villains in the movie. There also seems to be no logical motivation for any of the villains, although Ralph and the others do appear to be the victims of some sort of injustice. The movie is also filled with some really great music and effects. There is some amazing special effects and animation. While the story is a bit complicated, there is enough here that I'm willing to accept that the King is probably a good person who's being punished for some evil deeds. That said, I still wouldn't recommend this movie. Ralph is only interesting for the fact that he is such an animated character. The rest of the cast is really unmemorable and I couldn't recall any of them by name. Overall, this is a really poor movie. It's only worth watching for the characters, and even those characters seem to be pretty forgettable. This is the first film to ever come out from the Disney division of the Walt Disney Company and it's certainly not worth the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My Dad is a genius. If you can't make him laugh he will make you look at yourself in the mirror, if you can, he will let you, and only you, in on a joke." -  Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler I've only ever seen the original, but it's worth mentioning because of how it compares with the sequel. Both were brilliant and brilliant, but the sequel actually gives more time to Pennywise to talk. We get to see more of Pennywise than the first time and he's quite the character. This time the clown is more sinister. We have a glimpse into his mind and I'm a fan of his creepy laugh. The special effects were fantastic and the scares were excellent. The cast is excellent as usual and the story is great. The sequel doesn't add any of the characters that were left out of the first. This one is more for the old school, but I'd still recommend watching it and getting the original. 9.5/10 "A story, it seems, about two little kids in a house that is not their own, a place where no one comes and where everyone is afraid. The story of Bill Denbrough and Richie Tozier. Their world was taken from them, and there is no place for them but that which is beyond their reach."

It may not win any awards, but if you can find a copy, buy it. It's that good.  I'm amazed how different things were when this came out. I first saw this film on VHS in 1996. At the time, the movie had a terrible sound mix. Then came the sound mix on DVD. This is a great movie and definitely worth the price of admission.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A man named John C. Reilly, in an effort to get ahead, gets a new job with a tech company that has a virtual-reality camera to help with the company's social media business. When it is set up, it turns out to be an amazing social tool, but with a twist. This new technology could have huge effects on the social media industry.  An amazing performance by Ben Kingsley as Reilly, who plays a salesman, plays into a plot that's played out over the past year on "Silicon Valley," and one that could come to a head later this year in a season finale. It's one of the few times a tech product could be both fun and important.  and a movie with good story. It follows a few of the characters from "Silicone Valley," with some twists, including the discovery of an alien device that could cause major problems, and the discovery that everyone in the world has their own VR camera, even though they're in different countries. I loved it.

The way the characters react to it, to the deaths, to what the fuck just happened? I'm actually thinking that this was a bad idea from the get-go, the first half of the movie never made me care about the characters or their struggles. Not that it wasn't interesting, but the story itself doesn't seem to be very well-written, not like the previous two movies. I can't see that being a good idea for the rest of the story. Posted by bbgdude  On Probation on Quote theseawfulfucks  The main problem with The Elder Scrolls is that they decided they were going to add a large chunk of content to Morrowind and just throw it all into the second game. If the first one wasn't as broken as it was, then the next one would be a very good game.   The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is by far the best Morrowind game since the original. If you're new to the series, I would highly suggest giving it a try. If Morrowind was a much better game than Morrowind: Bloodmoon, then I would argue that it was an excellent series. I'd say the rest is mostly good though, but I wouldn't say it's a perfect series by any stretch of the imagination. That being said, The Elder Scroll series isn't really a series for beginners, unless you plan on getting started quickly, in which case, Morrowind would be the better game to start out on. I would say The Elder scrolls III: Tribunal is also a great game, however. The Morrowind expansions were the ones I played the most, although they are much longer, and while not as polished, they are still great.   with the recent announcement of the 3rd game, I am hoping that Morrowind will get some attention again. It's one of the more solid RPGs that I've played recently, and if it was given a chance, it could easily be a cult classic. But it's pretty easy to see that it will never get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ  Plot summary: Mardana and his daughter are going to visit a sick relative. When they come, they see the house is in ruins and the only sign of life is the young man who is still alive. He has been shot and the man tells them that they need to take him to the police. Mardanas son and his friend have the time to escape when the police arrive to investigate and find him and his two friends missing.  The film is not exactly great. A lot of the characters are not that realistic or fleshed out. The movie is not scary at all and it has a sort of a "I am just trying to survive" mentality. But what it does have going for it are the performances from the cast and the good dialogue and music.  and my 2 cents:  I am not sure if it is for you, but I give it a 8 for the acting and 5 for the characters. I could give it an 8.5 if there is not that one or two lines that really make me stop and think "wow"   My rating: นัดกระต้อน  Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an awesome story about an alien who ends up on Earth and has no idea what it is. He learns about humans and ends up becoming one of them. The alien's friend is a guy that lives in the suburbs who has this strange habit of talking to the walls and has a crush on a girl. He tries to communicate to the girl by using a strange language, so he is actually trying to show her the things he can't show in the walls. But she keeps on ignoring him and he ends up finding out that it's because he has no social skills. He ends up in the woods and learns how to use some rocks, sticks and leaves and find a cave where he can sleep. A day later he is visited by his friend's mom and she gives him a big hug and tells him to "be strong." That's all we know about his story.      What I Liked: I loved the story, there was something about this story that I really liked. It was interesting to see that the alien that lived in the wall didn't know that it had landed on earth, so it was a little interesting. It wasn't really my style of sci-fi but I thought the idea of a guy who couldn't communicate to other people was intriguing. This movie had a lot of heart to it, and it had a good ending.  What I Didn't Like: I didn't think the movie did a good job with its plot and the ending wasn't as great as I expected it to be. I also thought that the aliens in this movie were really silly. The aliens were not very intelligent and were basically just like an alien version of the character from the Twilight series. Overall: If you like a good story and great characters, give this a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's an hour and half of a really great movie. It's good for a couple hours of enjoyment before the show is over and you can't really enjoy it any more than that.  The story goes that a man and woman meet at the train station and go for a coffee and a date, and at the end, they get engaged.  They start talking to other people and eventually meet each other's families and they get married.  After that, they live happily ever after, until the day of the wedding.  But it's a happy story.  That's what the film's about.  And the art, the animation, is really good.  This is just a very good romantic comedy, and that's about it.  It's not very deep.  There are some deep philosophical questions, but they're not really answered.   It's just an hour of a very enjoyable, romantic comedy that's a lot of fun to watch.  I wouldn't say it's really a deep movie.  Maybe it's because I'm not a film buff, but when I watched the film, it was easy to remember those ideas.  It's not a very philosophical film, but it's interesting to think about and the characters are well done and interesting.   The music is wonderful and the movie has a very catchy, upbeat feel to it.   You have a happy ending, a happy life, and then you get a happy wedding.   I can't find anything to complain about in this movie.   There is some comedy and romance.  My Rating:   4.75 out of 5   The movie:   "Till the end of the night you never know what will happen, what the truth will be, until you hear it from a woman's lips."   That's how the film opens. The first half of this movie starts out pretty ordinary and then it gets very weird at a certain point.   First there is a wedding.     The wedding is a disaster because the bride is a robot.   And the whole wedding ceremony is a lie to everyone.   Everyone in the wedding is made up.   This has the entire wedding party, the whole ceremony, the entire thing.   Then the robot bride says, "I never wanted to be a human bride.    You will never be a man, and you will never see me again."   Then everyone goes crazy because they never want to be married

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining  is a film that's impossible to take seriously. But that's how it's meant to be, of course. There are some serious, harrowing aspects to the story, and Kubrick knows how to make them work in the right kind of way. There's something of the existential about the characters, a sense of unease and loneliness at the core of what's happening. It's more about the human condition than the supernatural. There is some pretty good filmmaking here. There have to be at least two or three films on this list that should've been on the top ten, but that's not saying much, especially with this many greats in the mix. It could still be a great film if they'd done the things right and it wasn't a case of someone doing everything right and doing the wrong thing.  The Shining was released in 1980 by director Stanley Kubrick and producer Arthur C. Clarke. The movie tells the story of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are trapped in their Colorado home during a series of horrific events. The events are triggered when Jack has an intense nightmare where he is the main character of a film about a family trapped in a snowy hotel room for several days while one of the children dies. Jack spends his entire stay in the hotel room in a sort of trance and begins hallucinating and losing touch with reality. When Jack finally gets home, he discovers that his family has been killed and he now has to deal with the paranormal effects. There was already a Kubrick-directed horror film on this film's title, The Omen (1980). This movie was a big hit during its time and was followed up by The Shining (1980) and A Clockwork Orange (1971). This film was not part of the Kubrick-Cuevas-Bergman trilogy, but Kubrick also directed a film in the same franchise. It is an alternate reality that follows the story from a different point of view, and in some ways it was a better movie.   Kubrick's style is very subtle and subtle and is used sparingly. In the final third of the film, the camera moves through the entire house to give us some nice shots of the snow. There isn't much gore. The film also features some pretty creepy music by the band the Talking Heads. The Shining  At some point after he wrote the screenplay for The Shining, Kubrick hired the band Led Zeppelin to record a song called The Song Rem

I mean really the way that this movie is made is beyond amazing. It's an art form of its own. It has some of the best acting of all time, the most beautiful lighting I've ever seen and the most surrealistic visual imagery I've seen in a film. So this film truly is one that you need to see. It truly is an art piece of the highest order.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The Mummy", a movie based on the classic story of a young man who is turned into a mummy and sent to Earth, is definitely a fun movie and I have to say that I'm very glad I decided to go through with my viewing experience after all.  I've never heard of the film before but I didn't know much about it at all. I saw the trailer and then I heard a little about it from my buddy, who has seen it. So I decided at that time to see the movie, and here's my experience. The movie starts out with a bunch of people standing around and talking as they wait for the arrival of The Mummy. After that, the movie starts right after he has been killed by some guy and he starts getting buried and he just keeps walking, and walking, until he ends up in Egypt.  Then after a while we see him walking through the desert and he keeps walking until he gets to the pyramid of Karnak. He then meets The Priest who tells him that he has a message from the king, so he goes to the king and it turns out that he wants him to go on a journey to search the world for the monster that killed his son. So he goes and he goes on this journey and he meets different people who tell him the stories of the monsters and he's trying to figure out what it is and where it came from. Eventually, he finds a room, but in the middle of the room is a tomb with a mummy inside. He tries to dig it out and he manages to do it and the mummy turns into The Mummified Man and it comes back to life and it bites his hand off, he freaks out and his hand is now like a snake and it has the head of a lizard and it goes on killing everybody. He freaks and runs and he runs until he reaches a city and he frees a guy who tells the mummy to go away and that's the end of the movie.  So the end result was a good way to get people to go see the film and there's a pretty good plot that was pretty good.   For a movie about a guy being turned into something like a mummy, I thought it was great.  It wasn't over-the-top and it had some fun elements to it.  The characters were interesting and fun to watch and I can't wait to see where they go.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.   I got this DVD and I immediately took it home and watched it at work. It was a cool idea and it made me want to watch a few more shows. A few years ago when I first started getting into film I watched a lot of movies that were on television, mostly crime dramas. It made me realise just how bad the writing was. I remember looking through a newspaper once and finding a newspaper from an old tv show from the 80's called, The Man from UNCLE. It had a lot better writing than the films I'd watched and it really opened my eyes to how bad television can be. I had watched a bit of it when I was a kid but I'd never really gotten a good grasp of it. I liked this idea, the story line was intriguing and I liked the idea of it being about the effects of a virus that's devastating the population. I was hoping for something interesting in the story and was a little disappointed at what the story ultimately became. I think the writers, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were trying to take a different direction in this show. When I saw the episode 'The Rains of Castamere', I thought it was a pretty good episode. The characters were well developed and the story was told in a very slow and methodical way. The plot was interesting and the episode was about as well written as any episode I've ever seen on Game of Thrones. The story also ended on a very emotional high with a great set up for the next episode. I thought this was the most emotionally powerful episode that I'd seen on the series thus far. In the show, Bran and Rickon are getting closer together. As they get closer, the tension is increasing. The scene that really made me sit up and take notice was when they were in the forest with a warg. The warg had died of the flu and the boy had to bring it back. It looked like it had been a very close call for the warg, almost having its head cut off. In a way it was sad but also tragic because it showed the loss that the wargs suffer when they die. Bran and the wyvern had just killed this big thing. I loved it. The ending scene of the show did it's job. The audience has been in control of the story until this point and we have come up with a way for Bran and Arya to stop the Boltons and get the Three
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I really liked the plot. The way it was written, with the little details and the twists and turns and the character development. There was a moment that I couldn't believe I saw that film in the theater and there was a part of me that was worried that the film was going to get canceled or that it would be a poor showing. But it turned out really well. I loved the movie. It was good. --------------  I really liked this film...but it really, REALLY didn't make me feel the way I thought I would. I had thought I was going into a really interesting and thought provoking film but, in reality, it is a lot of exposition for a film that doesn't need it. It is boring and the characters are, for the most part, very dull. It's just boring. ------------  You need to have the patience for a long, and well thought out, story that was poorly delivered...which was in the final analysis the most entertaining thing to happen in this movie. Not many films can get a laugh out of a boring ending. -------------  The plot, plot, story, plot...what can I say? That it was a little silly, which makes the whole movie even more ridiculous. And the characters have no life. They are just there to make the movie go by as fast as possible. This movie is pretty much an action-comedy with very little character development, and no real plot either. There's not much to say about it other than it was fun! ------------ I liked it, I enjoyed it. I didn't like it, but it wasn't bad. But I was too bored by it to give it a better rating. This was another fun film with pretty good acting, not bad acting. I liked how the plot of this film was made to be somewhat silly, and a bit of a farce. That's what I liked about it, the fact that I actually liked the idea of a comedy, but the execution just fell far short of that. ---------------

I love that they don't make a big deal about this being a western, because it is more or less a western in spirit.

The young king is being groomed to take it and the local duke has his own plans for Richard. The film is great because it manages to blend together the two genres.

"If it had been just music, it would be very, very good. The fact that it was filled with so much emotion, with so many different characters, a whole cast of characters. It's got all the different genres in it."  It's also the first time in the nearly 50 years that the actor has worked as a filmmaker and it's a big difference.  In the film, "The Big Chill," he plays a detective called in to help the police after the disappearance of a young man. He then joins forces with an ex-con (played by Anthony Edwards), a retired cop, a former gangbanger and the police chief. .  of,,  He says he got "the feeling that people like me, people who were from the hoods and who had worked as police officers, are now in an interesting position."  the.  . "Now I was going to be a cop and doing things that no cop ever wanted to do. I was really excited about it. I had just done the HBO movie "Rabbit Hole" with Michael Madsen and that was a little different kind of experience. This one was a lot more fun."  a.  the film, which opened on Aug. 21 in the U.S., has been screened in more than 40 countries. "It's become very successful," he said. "The reception has been tremendous." ,, So what's next? "I haven't decided exactly yet," he admitted. "I was really looking at trying to make another Western or something like that. I didn't want to do something like "Cobra Kill" where you have to do a lot of the same character over and over again."  for me the, I was very excited about going to this new world that the Western had created. It was exciting to me to do it with John Lithgow. it's such a fun character. He's a man with a lot going on inside of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was definitely a great flick.  Not quite in the same league as The Great Escape or Escape from New York, but still a very good movie. Â It does have some pretty silly sequences which aren't exactly my thing but it does bring us back to our original point about the lack of originality in the action genre and how a guy like Arnold Schwarzenegger can get away with shooting someone in the head while wearing a bionic leg and walk away scot-free.  I'm not going to get into any details about the story which is not exactly what we are looking for here (the whole movie is basically just the plot) so just remember to stay with me for a second and think about this movie in relation to Escape from L.A.   In L.S.A. you had to put together a team and find a way to get back to where you were before the crash.  Now it seems that the only thing keeping this team together is their belief that a "God" will help them to escape, and when they meet this "God," they start to doubt each other's credibility.   They have a few really great moments in the movie and they show us that Schwarzenegger's acting is still good.  As a side note, it would be interesting to see a film where Arnold goes up against a professional fighter or a former professional boxer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I don't normally watch horror movies but this one was a fun watch and I loved the movie. The movie is about an old lady who went to a mental hospital and then fell in love with a young man, but then she found out the young man was a serial killer and killed several of his victims. It was really scary and creepy and I did enjoy the ending, as they don't find the killer. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed a good slasher movie!    Rated 5 out of 5 by Marge from Creepy! It's scary and you don't want to go to bed! It is creepy! I watched it with my daughter who is 11 and she loved it. She said it was like something she would see in a movie. Great job! I highly recommend it. The only thing that was a little awkward was that the music didn't match what was going on, but it wasn't really that noticeable. So, if you are looking for a slasher, try this one out! :)  What I Liked: Very Creepy I would definitely recommend. The actors and the acting were great. I liked the ending especially when the woman is taken away.  Hate It? Not really. Not really my cup of tea. But it wasn?t that bad.

His character seems to be more of a 'hollywood' role model that can handle the pressure that comes with being a professional. He is a good actor, but I don't think he has the experience of someone who plays such a big role.  I really thought that he would be better off playing a "lesser" role in a low budget movie that had a more comedic feel to it. He has a really good stage presence, but is probably better suited to a more serious role. But, his acting is really decent here. I can't remember seeing a film where he is not funny and I enjoyed watching him. This is probably why I liked him more than I really thought he would. . -  .

Read the movie review: "I think I'm going to miss a lot of kids these days because there aren't so many movies like this out there.  They don't make it anymore because movies are more commercial now, they want something that kids like.  There are still plenty of good films out there, but they don't have that magic that you just go, this is the one."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** This is a good, straightforward, no frills, no nonsense, good, solid sci-fi movie that's easy to enjoy and enjoy for hours! ***************** I was looking forward to watching this movie because it's pretty much a remake of a really good 1980's sci-fantasy film, the one with a killer robot and a space base that could have been made by one of the classic '70s TV shows (Space Oddity, The Twilight Zone, or some other good movie I can't remember right now). And while I've already seen a few of the old sci-Fi movies, I'd never read the books in order to enjoy them, so I was really looking forward for this movie to take me back to the good old days of good SF/F. And it really did. I would even go so far as to say that I'd watch this movie again in order, just for the characters. It's a lot of fun! It's the kind of fun you only find if you're a kid (I'm old enough to know that this is the time period I grew up in, so it's not exactly like I'm enjoying it now). ********************* I can already tell you that I'm going to go back and watch this on my iPad in a few weeks, so when I watch it on the big screen (and not the iPad, because it can't handle the sound, and I'm only old enough that I know that is is much better on a big screen than a small screen), I may be going back even for a second viewing. ********************** -The sound effects are excellent! -The characters are cool as hell. ******** I highly recommend watching this one in a theater. It will definitely make you laugh and it will make you think. I was expecting a very predictable, but a lot less entertaining, movie. I guess it's hard to put my mind into being predictable. ~~~~~~~~- I think that's enough of my thoughts on this movie! The story was really well done, and the characters are a lot more fun and unique than I expected them to be. I really enjoyed it. I also think it's important to mention that I didn't think it was a bad movie, or even bad. It was a solid, good sci-fiction movie with a great story. I can definitely see myself watching it again. I don't know what's up with the people who haven't seen it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (April 25, 2015) After watching "Lemonade," the new documentary on Beyoncé that aired Monday night on HBO, I was struck by a couple of things. The first is how many famous people are talking about her album, which may have made people take notice, and the second is how people are discussing her as a pop-cultural figure. I thought about how the documentary was a huge success (for the most part) and thought about the many problems with this "documentary" -- but then the video of Beyoncé speaking came up. She was doing her interview with Vogue magazine. I noticed she was wearing an old-school Black Panther tee, and then she began to talk about the movie. When she described the movie she started with one of the more bizarre details in the movie: She said she found a book in her hotel room that said to "get your money's worth in this world." Then, she said, "I just said to myself, 'I have the gift, so I'm just gonna take over this world.' " She continued, "If somebody's been told that their life is worth nothing, they're not gonna be able to see the value of it. If you're told the meaning of life is nothing, you're not going to see it." Then she added that she was "still figuring out" her life philosophy. It was really strange to see Beyoncé talk so candidly. She seemed so happy. I can understand why people have been inspired by this project -- for many people, Beyoncé's career has meant a lot -- but to me, it just seemed a little bit over the top.

The story was okay, and I did feel like I saw something that could have been done better, but it was a good story. What didn't work:  I hate to say it, this was a major let down. The art looked terrible. The music was terrible, and the writing was terrible. There were several moments where I would have liked to have seen more, and it just got worse, and worse, as the movie went on. What could have made this better:  If the characters were more fleshed out, maybe it could have worked. The director could have done more, but the writing just was bad. Not recommended to watch it:  You shouldn't. I guess you could watch it as a comedy, but I don's watch comedy with the expectation that it would be good. There was no laughs. The movie is really bad, and would not make any good film. Don't waste your time.

I have heard other reviews that the ending is a little weird, but I didn't really mind it because the movie kept on going until the very end. There was only one downside to this film - when the action scene between Jake and the villain was over, the camera zoomed out and let me just watch the fire engulfing the city. I don't know what that is supposed to represent, but that was very disappointing.

But when you're on this journey with the movie, don't expect to laugh so hard the next time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Avengers"  is an impressive Marvel blockbuster, but I wish its heroes were more interesting.  In this case, it's a lack of compelling antagonists.    Iron Man's arch-nemesis Dr. Doom, played by Michael B. Jordan, is a wacky, charismatic genius who wears the uniform of a military scientist, but he's a clown to begin with.  He's not a good villain because he's not really a bad guy, he just has a tendency to get carried away and start blowing things up without thinking twice about it.  Iron Man, meanwhile, is an ordinary guy with a great sense of humor.  You could argue that he's less of a villain than he is a foil to Dr.  Doom, who in my opinion makes a poor villain because, like many comic book villains, he's only really interested in proving how bad he is, while Iron Man is interested in trying to prevent destruction, and that's why he always has his shield with him.  But I think that this is ultimately a matter of taste.  There are good superhero movies out there that aren't as reliant on bad guys to be entertaining.  The other character who could've been more interesting is Black Widow, played convincingly by Scarlett Johansson.  This film is full of action, but there's also a lot of character and depth to be found in Johansson's performance.  She's charming, intelligent, and sarcastic, all in all, a very good fit for the part.  I did have a little trouble with the screenplay because the characters all kind of seem to be in the same place at the same time.  While I could understand why people would want this to be a character driven movie, and not a action movie, it did mean that there wasn't a lot in the way of interesting character development.  As such, I would recommend that you watch this one with someone else or with someone who is just watching the movie for the first time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       We just finished watching The Hateful Eight, a film about a bounty hunter who gets framed for murder and sent to a "reeducation" camp in Wyoming. At the end, he escapes, only to find himself on the run in an insane, desolate world of violence. It was one of my favourite movies of 2016 and it's a shame that so many other people seemed to think so, too. In fact, in the last couple of days, a number of sites have written about how The H a tt e e has "bad reviews" or how the film "does not deserve to be in theaters". The latter of which is perhaps the most ludicrous statement I have ever seen, and it is hard to say that the film isn't worthy of a wide audience. That said, The H ateful Eight is not a film to get into the theatres for. And as far as the movie being a "disappointment" goes, I can see where some people would say that. However, for some people, the movie is actually one of the best movies of the year, if not of all time. I know I was one, and I have to say, this is one of those rare times where the words "best movie of 2016" really do describe it as it did for me. It's not perfect and there is plenty of stuff to nit pick about (the music and cinematography in particular), but this is probably my favourite movie of the entire year.  The premise of the film is simple. The bounty hunter played by Kurt Russell has a run in with an escaped slave who was given a "re-education" camp by the government. During the course of the movie, he sets out to find this escaped slave and bring him back to his masters. The concept of the "rehabilitation" was the backbone of the script. The slave is in danger, the bounty hunter knows this and wants to help. The whole plot seems simple, but is actually incredibly complex. We learn that the slave isn't actually in danger and, in fact, that he may have some good advice for the bounty hunters, which could make them better men. But before the end of the day, he is brought back to the camp and told that his fate is sealed. He isn't to be heard from again and he is sent to the "reedauge

As the car turns into a deep canyon, Jeff's voice becomes faint. Jeff, with his wife's hand in his mouth, finally stops the car and slowly opens his eyes to find the whole world is a fog. This is a movie with a lot going on. The acting is top notch and each character is likeable. The movie is very funny and has a very bleak vibe that is very similar to what you'd expect from a Quentin Tarantino film. If you are a fan of movies with the same themes, but with more action, you should really check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I know a lot of you may be asking yourselves, "Well...what kind of movie is this??" Well...let me put it this way, the "Good Movie" part. I don't believe there is a better movie about the life of an athlete. A guy goes from winning all the time at the local high school, to being an all-star. I'm talking about Barry Switzer. A few years after the last "good movie" I watched on the list, Barry still is a great story. It's not perfect but it's well told. I really wish someone would give a try at a follow-up to this movie. It would be really great to see another movie starring Barry as the head coach at Michigan, since he is no longer the coach at Ohio State. I know people have made jokes about the ending but I can say this...my son loves this movie more than I love my wife. A great movie, well told and great fun. ____________________________________________________________________________  Good Movie: Barry Switzler, Head Coach at Michigan (2001) There are few movies that could compare to the greatness of Barry Swisher's portrayal as a coach. I am not just talking about his personality, as great as he is. I mean his coaching style. Barry Swoyer has a flair for the dramatic that many coaches and celebrities have, but few can match. What sets this movie apart from the rest is the fact that Barry is actually coaching, and not just acting as his on screen persona. The movie makes you feel like you are part of a sports journey, and you are actually there to witness the entire event. I love that this is not a typical sports movie. The story itself is well told, and the scenes are done really well. When the film is all said and done, it's not a perfect movie, but a really good one. Barry is one of the best coaches ever, and I think it would be a shame if he were not able to win with his current teams. This movie is a must watch for fans of college basketball, and a great addition to the "Best of the Movies" series. ____________________________________ If you've never seen a great sports movie with a great storyline, you will not be disappointed.   ____________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: it ain't no ole' cliche no. 1/5 stars  A long time ago a man came to me, with a great need for something to make him laugh. He had to be a man of action or else he would grow old. I told him I had never heard of a film that satisfied that need. So he made one himself and I said I'd help him along. He gave me the money to make it and I had to make some changes myself. I took the story from an old, unedited, old-fashioned comic strip that had been on the newsstands for years and then I put my own twist on it. That is how I started'The Jungle Movie. I wanted to make a movie like it. A story for the ages. It wasn't just a funny movie with a good hero and some great scenes, it was a story to be laughed at all over the world. I also tried to make the people of the jungle more human, less like mindless animals. But that is a secret behind the scenes. 1 can say that 'The Jungle Movie" is my finest work in the movies, it's so funny and it is the kind of film that you want to get up and watch again and again. it has everything you'd want from a classic and it makes you feel like you are in the jungle with the real jungle people.  1'm proud of it and it was good fun making it. The Jungle movie was a commercial and critical success and the producers asked me to make another in a similar vein but different.   I thought they had found a new kind of movie and I worked on it for the next ten years. After it was finished I said it was time to call it a day and never worked on another one again. But it was too late. 'The Big Bang' was already in the works and so was 'The Return of the King'. I also wanted to work with Robert Redford in 'I Dream of Jeannie'. That is what brought me to Hollywood. I had the great fortune to be the director of the second part of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. It was a terrific and rewarding experience. I thought "The Lord of the Ring" was my masterpiece and when you look at it you are aware that it's not so much a story as a work of art. It's really a work in itself. The first three films
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film that I highly recommend. It's a little strange at first, but once you get your bearings, it's a very interesting and well acted story. This movie is a little dark at times, but it's not a bad thing, it just feels like the movie's tone is a bit too dark. If you're a fan of sci-fi, or have a passion for the genre, I think you'll really enjoy this one.

The cinematography by Michael Beheim is excellent, especially when Michael Beaumont is in it. I have seen the movie several times, and enjoy it each time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes gangster movies, although there are many different versions.

This was my first ever viewing of the movie, and it did not disappoint at all! It was extremely exciting and interesting!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ If the above review was helpful to you, please consider rating this movie: 1 (great) 2 (ok) 3 (average) 4 (bad) 5 (deplorable) Please give a star if you loved this movie!  The movie has a fantastic cast in it's cast with an interesting mix of personalities. Some of them you get an idea of what they are about as a person and can tell they can get along with each other. The other ones you don't quite know how they will act with each each other, but there is enough to show how good they could be in a movie. Some are more serious than others, some have an open mind and some just have a very weird manner of thinking. Most of the cast have some sort of family to represent and that's where the film is really different from other comedies out there. There's no love story at all, just some funny situations. The family is the best part about the movie, but it's the characters that make this movie so entertaining to watch. One of the more memorable ones is the family dog that's named Charlie. He's the most adorable and I'm sure there are many viewers that fell in love with him. Another character that is very memorable is the old man. He is such a character that will make you smile just from watching the character's actions. They are funny to watch and it's just funny how some of the things the family say just make you want to laugh. I think if you like a character, you will like the movie. One thing I did not really enjoy was the acting. Most actors are not known for their acting skills and some were very stiff. This is only something that affects you if you are a fan of comedy and you think it was really bad acting. Overall, I found this a very entertaining comedy that is sure to have many viewers laughing and looking forward to the second half.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I have nothing bad to say about this movie. It was quite good and the cinematography was great. I do recommend this movie to anybody who enjoyed "Star Wars" trilogy. It would have been nice to see more of those people with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" fame. But, I have seen a lot of crap and this was pretty good. It's like watching "A-Team" as if it's really a "Star-Wars" movie.

For all the flaws it has, I thought the acting, the characters, and the acting was still pretty good in it. I didn' like the plot, though I thought it was well-written.   The problem is, despite the fact that the characters were decent, the story was just too stupid. I am no fan of Star Wars, but I did enjoy this.   of all the Star Wars movies I've seen, this is probably the worst. The plot and acting were too bad to justify it.

"The film's main message about how a generation with no future can be held back by the old people and be forced into hopelessness and despair, and by society's obsession with youth,"  It's not just the youth of today who are suffering.  A new survey by the Social Mobility Commission shows that while the percentage of 18-29 year-olds with full-time jobs has risen to almost a third of all people in the UK, only one in six is employed in full- time work.  it's a stark contrast to the 1960s when youth unemployment was below one-third of the workforce. .  in Britain today, the youth unemployment rate is 25.1%, the highest since records began in the year 2000. This is higher than the jobless rate among the oldest generation of Britain, the baby boomers, at 21.1%  The government, which is currently considering whether to introduce a minimum wage for people under 25, has pledged to work with the likes of YouthSolutions and Teach First to improve education standards, according to the Daily Mail.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a good watch. I did like this movie a lot. I enjoyed it a lot... Well, the reviews were in! I don't want to read the reviews because I have too many of them on my computer (too many reviews for too many movies) so I decided to use the new site. It is called movie review.net  (www.movie-review.net) and it is a good way to find movies. It works the same way as the blog (which is the best way to read reviews) but it is much faster. I think this new website will help to speed up the process of finding movies. So I thought of using it for this blog. This site was good at finding movies! There were only three reviews which I found very interesting. I don´t know if you have any way to write a review but I thought I would try to write one here. I am not a great fan of the new series. But I am going to try to find more of the same. The main plot point of the story is about the old man and his daughter (who is also played by Mireille Enos).  It is a movie which I would like to see again. It had an interesting ending which I didn´t see coming. I didn't know how the movie would end. The movie was great and I enjoyed my time watching it. I liked it. It wasn´t a good film, but I would watch it again. I will probably watch the second film, because I didn`t find the first one bad at all. I only saw the first film and I liked it a little bit. I can see it was a different kind of story with a new way of telling it.  I don´T recommend watching this film, just for fun. But the movie itself is great. It made me laugh. It was a funny movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The most beautiful movie ever made, in every sense of the word." A young man, with no education whatsoever, and his two best friends, meet each other, and they have a conversation. At the end of that conversation, they decide to try to kill each other. They come up with two ideas - one of which, "Let's just take a knife and stab each other in the heart." They agree to try this out. However, the knife that they chose to use was broken. The one who chose to stab first, was killed by his best friend. The next morning, they all decide to go to a local restaurant, which has been a favorite of their before they decided to murder each other with knives. While there, they get into a small argument over the menu, which is then ended by an incident. A young man tries to stab a girl who was standing on the other side of the counter, only to be knocked down by the girl. Meanwhile, a strange woman is seen walking up to the counter of a bar, and a man tries trying to get away from her by running away from the bar, but to no avail. Suddenly, a knife is seen going down the neck of the young man. The young man wakes up, and starts to bleed out from his neck. The girl, who had been standing behind the counter for a moment before this happened, falls to the floor, and is dead. After this, all three of the boys get in the car, and drive off to a distant city, where they decide they need to find another knife for the crime they had committed the day before. After leaving, they head to a bar to drink until they are ready to kill some more people. "The two young men decide to find a knife at a bar in a distant town. Meanwhile, a girl has just been stabbed in the neck by another woman who had just run away from a bar. After a while of drinking beer and talking about how stupid all of their problems were, a man suddenly falls off of the back of the car as the trio is driving away. He is the same person who stabbed the young woman in the same place that the knife had been used, and he is killed as well." This film is a masterpiece, in terms of style and substance. It's the kind of thing you can watch once, but it never gets old. It really is a one of a kind film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight Rises" is a dark movie. The fact that it contains a lot of references to the previous movies, not just the first but also the "Dark Knight", makes it look like a mashup film.  The film starts with the Joker getting the Joker's head. He then turns to Bane and tells him to bring his body. Then the Joker begins to choke Bane and the body is torn from his body by Joker and he throws the body into a dumpster and puts it back on. The Joker then tells Bane to bring him his body and he picks it up and takes a small toy gun and puts the barrel in his mouth. Bane then looks at the Joker and tells his father, "This man is your son".  As the Joker puts the gun in his head the Joker tries to shoot the Joker with it and Bane then tells the Joker that he's trying to kill him.  Then the body of the Joker is shown in front of Bane's eyes. Batman and Bane are shown standing over the dead body of Joker. Then the Joker turns to the real Bane, "My father wanted me to kill you, Bane". Bane then says, "I didn't want you to", which is a joke made by the Joker to taunt Bane. Suddenly a car comes flying by and stops. Batman jumps out of the car and runs towards Bane, holding the toy gun in a panic. Batman says to Bane, "...you have got to stop". Bane says to Batman, "If you don't kill me, I'm going to kill your son!" Bane then takes out his machete and slices off Batman's finger. The Joker then looks out of a window and says to the man next to him, "They call me the Clown Prince of Crime...". The man looks up and sees the Joker but then the Joker gets shot with a dart and falls to the ground dead. The dead Joker tells the man, "You think you can stop me with a gun?"  Batman then says to him again, "It won't work". The man then says that he just wants to be left alone. That's where the movie ends. After seeing this movie, I think that the makers of the film have done an awesome job. I think the Joker has come to symbolize the darkness that is inherent in the human spirit. I hope that the film continues to explore the dark side of man and will
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ This is a good old-fashioned Western, set in Kansas, where, in the early 1900's, the sheriff of a small town is about to face a trial on charges of murder. The defense is that the man killed his wife and the sheriff's best friend, both of whom are accused of having shot the sheriff. If this sounds like a no-brainer, it is! But the real twist is that they are actually innocent, and the killer was hired by the sheriff to do it. This may sound like it could be an uninteresting movie, but the real genius is in the way it builds suspense. There's a great scene where the detective is talking with the wife of the dead man, and it's a suspenseful scene, with the tension escalating with each sentence she speaks. It's an old-school Western without ever seeming old-timey. _________________________________________________ This was a very good movie. I wasn't really expecting too much from it, especially considering its $2.50 price tag, but it was great. I enjoyed it because of its pacing, and because I know a lot of people who like this type of movie. It was well-acted, and well-shot, even though it could have used more of those things. That said, this is a well-done movie. One of the most popular of the genre. __________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I saw this film at the BFC. I am in my early 20s and have never seen any of this before. The story starts out nice and simple. You are introduced to a young man and his friend on their way to work. They make a stop at a gas station, in the middle of the day. One of the guys sees a sign for "I love you, I really love you" in the gas station. He goes up to the attendant to ask for directions. This girl walks over to them and starts talking to them. She is a stranger to them but not to the young man. She gives them some tips about the job. I loved that the two guys were so quick to do what she was asking of them. They took this girl's advice and did exactly what she said. She had asked them to go to the gym and eat clean and get their vitamins. They did just that. I was fascinated to see the story develop so slowly. I thought it would happen at least a little quicker. I wasn't sure what the movie was about but I liked that they went about their lives normally. It kept me guessing, just like the movie. This was an enjoyable movie. It was a real treat to see how they handled the plot and the ending. I saw it last night, but I hope to see it again in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I found the movie to be the best one I've watched so far this year. It reminded me of another movie I've seen, "Killing Them Softly" (the original, I believe), which I enjoyed. This movie is different in the sense that it's a straight up action movie. It's not just the fights, but how they are done and the intensity with which it is done. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but it's still worth watching just for that one moment. The pacing of the film is really good and I didn't feel rushed through it. As for the story, it was good enough for me. This one was a bit slow to start, but after that, the story got really good. I liked the characters and their interactions with each other. A few character traits were used well, such as the love of being able to use their powers for personal gain and the way they would deal with being a hero. I also liked the way the movie was shot. I thought the camerawork was good, and it looked really nice with lots of blood, gore, and explosions. I wasn't that interested in the characters, but I liked how they were portrayed. In conclusion, this was a good action movie and I would watch it again if I had the chance.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  This is one of those movies that I knew from a trailer. So I went with the assumption that it's a sequel, but it's not. I don't want to say too much, but I'd say this is probably the best of the original trilogy and is more than worthy of your time. Don't think about it too much. Just go and watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: heir is a decent-sized thriller, but you get more from it than just that. It's about a guy who works in a big, nasty-looking building in the middle of nowhere and has to live with his two little sisters who love and adore him. It doesn't take long to realize that the little sisters are going to turn on the big, bad guy who's been haunting them for the last ten years, but he's so much fun, he almost makes it worthwhile. he cast is great, from the pretty kids to the older, more snotty ones, and that leads to some fun scenes where they are all trying to get in a bad guy's head. If you've seen The Towering Inferno, you will probably enjoy this one, as it's more of a mystery, and the big monster isn't as big a deal. A movie that takes some of its ideas from The Wizard Of Oz and The Man Who Would Be King.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm a massive fan of the "Voyage of Time" series. When they first started out, I was still in grade school, but I read the first two books way before I was ready to read the third. The first time I saw the movie, I had to look it up on the Internet. I remember looking up the actors' names on the IMDB and just being so amazed at the fact that the actors are so incredibly close. It's so amazing to see how much effort went into the series, with not only the incredible performances, but how the directors were able to capture the characters in such a beautiful and moving way. So much of what they're doing is captured with the lens of the camera. When it's not being used to capture dramatic moments, it's being used just to see the characters interact with each other in an adorable way. There's also a really touching moment in the third movie that I can't describe. And they made a "Vacation" series of books in 1996 and they did an animated series in 1999, but it wasn't the same. The series I'm referring to are the two "VOY" series: Voyager, and then Voyager: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. And while the films themselves are good, the best part about them was their animated series. I've already mentioned "The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages," but now is a good time to talk about "The Good, the Bad, And The U.G.T.W." and the various movies that were made before and after. When the first series began in 1991, the crew were on the same basic crew that they had been on for the entire series. The only major change was that Captain Janeway had taken command of Voyager, as opposed to Captain Janek, who had been in command of the U.S.S Voyager for the entirety of the series. But that was just a minor change. In fact, Janeway was still Captain Janesays, the captain who always had the Enterprise on course, a person to be reckoned with, who was willing to risk her life for Voyager. She was still that character that had the power to take Voyager from the fringes of the Federation and into the center of the galaxy. And she was still willing to fight for Voyager even when it was on the brink of destruction. In the first movie, "Unimatrix Zero,"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not easy to describe what I like about this movie, but I'll try anyway.  I like the fact that it is set in one area (the old town) and not in one specific country.    There is nothing at all like in the original movie, so it is a good thing that it uses this as the basis and uses a different idea about the future, without going back to the old movie.  To have a more accurate description of the plot, we have the two men from the old world.  This time they have to fight the forces of a new world. The setting is not that much different from the original film but the world is completely different and I like it that it doesn't go back to that world. So the plot is what I thought about the movie: The new world wants to make war with our world and there is a reason for this.  It is a time of the great wars between the old and new world, the world has to fight for a future.  The movie has a nice story and I think it is interesting in that the character's motivations change and change.  You get to know the characters and the world, and they are real.  In the end, the movie is all about the characters.  So the movie shows that a human can live in the future and that they can even save the future. So I liked this movie a lot and recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw the preview, watched the trailer and had a good time.  The movie was so fast paced and the action scenes were great.    I did find it a bit difficult to watch this at times.  I can see that it is an action packed movie, but it is not the best action movie I have ever seen.     This movie has many parts that all add up to an entertaining movie.  The movie had good chemistry between the leads.  One of the best parts about the movie was the chemistry between Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Williams.  They are so great together, it was hard to leave them alone.  This is a great movie and I enjoyed watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Why does it work? It works because it makes no pretense about what is really going on. There is no "we" on-screen and it is not a "drama." There is only the actor, the woman and the people around her. We do not watch for our character to be well-dressed or attractive. We watch because it is good acting, the script by the very talented Peter Landesman (who adapted The Girl) and a terrific direction by Bruce Greenwood (The Imitation Game). The best part of this film for me, is the first scene when the women walk through the rain. It is not the action-packed action sequence that we expect. The rain is an effective way of showing us how the lives of these women have changed. I can also understand why people will not like the film. It isn't very funny or exciting, and there is not much in the way of humor. The humor comes through in the writing of the script, which has a very interesting sense of humor with characters we recognize. This is another film that I plan to re-watch. It has not changed my mind about the characters, but it made me think. I still do not understand why it is called The Girl.

A couple of the scenes even make me feel as though I should have been the main character and that I was in some sort of danger. The plot is good, but the story does not seem to go anywhere. I like the concept of the film; it has some dark elements to it, but it is very well done. A lot of people have said that they thought the action scenes were unnecessary, but they are quite necessary. It is just that this film is way too long. There are too many long scenes for a film like this, and I think they are unnecessary. This film is very good and the ending is quite nice. But the story itself has the potential to be so much better, but for now I will give it a 2.  *** The film's rating ***  Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Incredible Journey"  is a movie about two guys, a man and a boy who were trying to fly in a plane and they got lost in the middle of the ocean. They lost their way for days and even though they eventually found each other they were not able to fly together as the boy wanted to stay in the plane to get more air. So he is forced to give up his dream and give up on his dream as well. And that is how life was. The guy was very happy for his son to have found someone like him and be able to make a better life for him. So when he found his son on the beach he had a big smile on his face. It was a wonderful story. I loved watching it because it was very nostalgic and beautiful. It reminded me of my childhood and my father. So a nice movie to watch if you have any nostalgia about that time. What did you think about this movie?  Did you like it?    Dislike it? Let me know what you think in the comments below!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ A good movie, but it needs a little re-imagining for its audience.  While this isn't a great movie, it's not a terrible one either. I think if you want to see the movie and enjoy it, it has a decent amount of depth to it.  It's not going to win any awards for its acting and story telling (both of which are quite good), but you'll likely enjoy it and the ending will probably entertain you. It's a good little movie that isn't going to keep you up all night with the story, but you're better off taking a long nap.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Movie __________ is a good enough movie, it's just not great. It takes a pretty good idea (the evil alien robot named Dr. F from outer space) and then doesn't take it far enough. You'll get some interesting story developments, but the film doesn't quite get it. Instead it's more like a long series of scenes where something is said and then it's put on hold while the next thing is said. For example, one of the characters (not named Dr) is about to eat an alien, but he doesn't eat it. The rest of the film then proceeds to be a conversation between him and the bad guy character (the one he's eating). The only really cool thing is that the bad guys are played by good guys, so I guess it's okay. I can't believe I actually paid money for this bad movie, even if the trailer was pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you're having a hard time figuring out what to watch this weekend, then get it out of the way, I'm looking at you, Terminator: Genisys. This film is an extremely smart and entertaining sequel to the 1986 sci-fi classic, a film I myself was just lucky enough to see as a kid. As such, I was thrilled to see the latest installment in the series, but also more than a little puzzled by the film, and perhaps even by a few of its choices. I mean, I got a tad bored with the third film, The Terminator Salvation, and it was really a shame, but I'm still kind of shocked that the film didn't change its mind and go the route of the previous two installments. What I didn't anticipate was that the movie would still be full of the same sort of sci-fantasy/horror concepts and imagery, and that the same problems would arise as before. The film's pacing isn't quite as long as I was hoping, but it's still a little on the slow side, as it does drag a little towards the end. And yet it's so well-directed, and so well crafted, that the most noticeable difference is the fact that now there's a plot. If I were being totally honest, the plot itself isn't all that special, or even all that well executed. What it does have, though, is a fairly intriguing and well-executed premise, which allows it to build to an interesting conclusion, while never really feeling like a slog. The movie's action is mostly good, and the characters are pretty likable, but the story's direction and execution is pretty flat in a lot of ways. In addition to being mostly well-written, this movie has a great soundtrack, which is a little less of an issue here, since most of the action takes place in a deserted city with some really nice ambient music. It's definitely not a perfect film, but what I'm saying is that, with the exception of a few minor quibbles, it's pretty enjoyable. If you haven't seen the original yet, or don't like the first film very much, then you may find The Terminator:Genisys an enjoyable change of pace. For me, it is one of those "go back to the future" films that, as a Terminator fan, I think I'll see more of in the near future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ Watch this amazing, mind-blowing animated film, made by the same team that brought us Monsters Inc, and you'll understand why it's so well-regarded.  Plot: The film follows a group of anthropomorphic animals living in a zoo as they struggle to live in a world where they're perceived as freakish and terrifying. It is up to them to change their own behavior, to become leaders instead of followers, and find a new way to live, and it will take every ounce of strength, courage, and perseverance on their parts. There is only one rule: "If you can do it, you can be it!"  Animation: Like any Pixar film, there is a lot of detail and creativity put into the animation of this film. Every single animal seems like it's been designed to fit together well and look good. This animation is so fluid that it is hard to believe it's all animated. The character designs and backgrounds are equally fantastic, especially considering the movie only takes place for a single day. The music is also beautiful and catchy. - Michael W. Barrino, The Mary Sue  Characterization: While the animals in Monsters University are often depicted as goofy and awkward by their peers, the movie does well to show just how different they really are. Despite their many problems and awkwardness, they all remain warm and kind, even as their egos grow larger than they know how to handle. It's easy to be friends with these animals, but it's equally easy to learn they are much more than that. .  are the backbone of the film. They seem to be the only ones who can make any real progress in any given situation. They make up for their few flaws by displaying amazing strength and courage. They are also the most relatable. Their struggles, failures, and triumphs are also realistic. It was refreshing to watch a Pixar film that doesn't feature a single human character who is a caricature. In fact, the only human character that seems overly human is Sulley, who has the worst hair ever and the worst facial expressions.  in the beginning of the movie they are introduced as a bunch of kids who are stuck in an educational zoo with the other animals. They spend most of the time being silly and getting into silly shenanigans. However, it's soon revealed that their antics are actually a way to try to get out of the zoo. Their goal is to be as cool and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** I have to admit that this movie isn't good. The plot is lame, the acting is not great, and the acting and writing are pretty similar. But I think that the idea of a world where everybody wears the same outfit is pretty cool, especially since we see that everybody is wearing clothes that make them look like they are wearing different clothes. This also creates some pretty hilarious situations, such as when some people (i.e. people who wear the same type of clothing) can only speak one language. A lot of people seem to like this movie because of the art style and the music, but it's just not very good. If you are a fan of old timey movies that feature the same people, then this might be for you. If not, then I would suggest looking elsewhere for a good old time movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Kia from Great Movie This is a good time travelling story. It was fun to watch. I hope to see this again. .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of What's Hot  is a documentary about how "B-movie" films have changed over the past 60 years. The film is a fun, nostalgic view of the early days when these films dominated the movie scene, and their popularity is undeniable.  It does have one problem though.  There's a bunch of old "B" movie scenes that are edited out.  In fact, there are more than a few scenes that show that these films were a bit shoddy even by the standards of B-movie history.  But I can live with that, because the director is so funny that he doesn't really have to worry about the old stuff.  What's not funny is the fact that the director was hired as the new host of the "Cannes Special" after the film's first airing!  If you've never heard of the show, the premise is that a host of people are chosen and the people are asked to give a speech at the beginning of the special about what's wrong with the world today.  The host usually has some kind of a story about the world in general or their own lives that makes for great entertainment.  This particular episode of "CANNES SPECIAL" is called "The Best Worst Movie" and I have to say, it was pretty terrible.  The worst Worst Movie Ever is a documentary that takes an alternate view of cinema.  They go over B-movies and how they are inferior to the more classic films that have come after them, but at the same time they show how films are so much more entertaining now.  I thought this was a fun film, with great voice actors and some great editing.  The movie is a "comedy," so I have no complaints about the story or voice acting, just the editing.

What Was Good: The first thing I noticed about this movie was how much sex the movie had. This movie was just *****ing crazy with sex. The guy in the last film, played by Jason Bateman, was hot. There was sex and there was laughter too! Jason was in this for the long haul and I think he is going to make it a very long run.   He was great.  and for this he gets a ****** rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** A film that does not take itself too seriously and is an exciting and enjoyable romp through one of the most beautiful places on the planet, with an incredible cast. Not only the cast is superbly designed and acted, but also the effects are impressive, especially the use of the slow motion sequences which are the stuff of dreams. It is a rare case of a director trying to emulate the great Italian directors of the late 40's and early 50's in the film which manages to be more than just a simple adventure story. A must watch for the serious Sci-Fi fan who wants to see more of what has gone before.

I loved the kiss in this film! This film has great characters and wonderful plot twists.

The plot is a master class in how to build a suspenseful, well written thriller using all the elements that make a great thriller, but it is not one of those movies where the director tries to over-complicate it. This is the type of movie where the reader knows what is going to happen before the movie even begins. A simple and easy way to make money. I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Phantom Menace is not only a great film with superb characters and wonderful themes. It is also one of the finest and most entertaining Star Wars movies ever made. The film is set in the first three months of the original trilogy and shows Obi-Wan in a very different context, both in terms of style and purpose. At the beginning of the film Obi- Wan is sent on a mission to rescue Amidala. In the process he is caught up in a complex plot and is forced to confront some of the most powerful figures in the Galactic Empire. He is not an invincible superman but Obi-wan is a force to be reckoned with. This is the story of the character and the way the film explores the themes of selflessness, honor, and strength. There is a scene where Darth Maul and Anakin Skywalker discuss Obi-Wans honor in the presence of Count Dooku. The two Sith Lords say that Kenobi is not yet a Jedi and they are amazed that this could be true. When Dookus comes to Kenobi and says that his uncle, Palpatine has given him the title, Obi-wans eyes grow wide. The Sith Lord tells the Jedi he will find a way to make him a Dark Lord but Dookuse says there is not much time. Obi-wich's eyes grow even wider. Obi wans is worried about the mission and he says he will do whatever he must to help him. That is the spirit of Obi-wen and you should feel the same about the film as you do when you watch it for the first time. The acting is superb and the film has some terrific special effects. It has some of Lucas' finest visuals. It's a beautiful and funny film that is one of my favorite Star Wars films. See it now!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a really good movie.  I got to see two different sides to the movie. I liked the scene where they are playing hide and seek.   I thought they handled it right.  It was the scene when the couple were watching tv when she said to her husband that they shouldn't change the channel to the one with the story about the woman who died from an overdose.  He didn't seem to like it at first but I think that was the point.  I felt that they could have done better with that one.  She had the guy get a cold medicine before she passed out.  In the end the doctor talked to the husband and the wife said that they should take the medicine every day.  This was a very emotional scene.  They are both struggling to deal with the death of their daughter.  That is something that you would never see in a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A few years ago when I had the chance to watch 'Pulp Fiction,' I thought it was good. Then I saw 'Punch-Drunk Love,' and I had to go back and get my mind out of the gutter. What a great movie." "I think it's pretty awesome. A big deal of the movie comes down to the idea of love and friendship." You have been in love before, right? You have. So why not tell me about it? A: First off, this question is very tricky to answer for a couple of reasons. The first, which will be obvious to most people, is that you are not the first person to have been involved in a sexual relationship with someone you were not legally married to. That's true, and we all know this. But the second and more important reason is that the answer depends entirely on the person who asked the question, which would be you. I was a young man when I decided to marry my first wife. My wife had been with me since we were both eighteen, when we were married in college. Our courtship was fairly standard. We both agreed to be faithful to each other, and to the other. That was the beginning. We were married for only one year before my father told me he was taking our family to live in Europe for two years to complete his schooling. During this time, I decided that it was time to have a serious relationship with the woman I was seeing, and I asked her to marry me. My marriage to my wife did not survive this decision, however, because she was pregnant during the time we were going to Europe, and had to move back to America before giving birth. It was only once I got back to the States that I realized that she would have been my wife no matter what, and that the pregnancy had nothing to do with my decision. After the pregnancy, I took my first step down the slippery slope of romantic relationships. I met someone and we had a good time, but I left her because I didn't feel I could get any deeper with her. A year or so later, I met a woman in the same city. We talked for several weeks, but nothing ever went further. I then began to date another woman, and she took me to Europe for another two years. We began to explore the other side of love, but we never fell in love and I eventually decided that I had found my
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________, The most realistic looking vampire movie I've ever seen! If you love vampires, or vampire films, you have to see this. The movie is great, with an awesome and original story and amazing performances by all the main actors. The only thing I think is lacking is the blood factor (since most films have a blood factor) and some blood in the movie, but this film doesn't have that. I also loved the music, as it gives off a real creepy vibe to it, making the movie so much better. Also, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Its fun, fast paced and filled with lots of action scenes and blood. The acting is excellent and it is hard not to love this film. Also I think the film is very accurate in how vampires look and act, as they actually appear the way they did in the book/movies, even the extras! This movie is so much fun and I can't wait to see how it ends! Highly recommend, even if you're not a fan of vampires, the characters and the actors are all amazing!  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Don't be fooled by the title of this movie, there's nothing that's actually about animals other than their welfare, and I think the entire movie was designed to be about that. The animals we watch in this film, the pigs and sheep, are all brought to a slaughterhouse so that we can see how much better the animals who live there are than the pigs, and the sheep. In the first 15 minutes we see how the pigs are treated and how they get to live in the same room together. By the end, we see the poor, poor animals that are the only good thing about this movie.  "The Pig Butcher's Wife" is set to be released in the US on September 28, 2017.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   "Cannibal Holocaust" is one of those movies that has a strong following and many who have seen it have left a comment describing their own reactions to the film. The fact is, people really enjoy this movie. People like horror movies with a bit of dark humor, and that is exactly what the film is. The film is based on an actual event that took place in Germany during the 1990's. A group of men with "Nazi" tattoos took part in the killing of more than 100 people who were "disappeared". In order to avoid arrest and prosecution, the men murdered the victims in front of an audience. This was done for the thrill of doing it, not because they were "racist" in the slightest. That is not to say that it's an outright horror movie, but if you don't like gore, this is not the movie for you.   The film begins with a young boy named Raimund who is watching the show "Der Zweite Wunder" (The World War). He has a fascination with the horrors of the war. He has no understanding of what is going on or why, but he is fascinated by it. He also has a great interest in Hitler, the Nazi regime, and the atrocities committed by the Germans. One night he and a friend go to a movie theater, expecting to see something silly, but are completely shocked when they find a documentary on the Germans who committed atrocities during the war, including killing people who couldn't fight back. The boy is not sure what to make of the documentary, and he leaves. A few days later, the boy is playing baseball with his friend. After being struck by a ball, the ball hits the boy in the head, and a bullet pierces his head. The bullet then travels through his head, neck and body, killing him. His mother comes to find out what happened, but she is shocked and horrified to find her son dead. She tries to find him, but all of her searching leads nowhere. The movie continues and the camera focuses on the boy's dead body. When it moves from one location to another, there are a couple of images which seem to show blood splatters. This is all of a sudden punctuated by a shot of the boy lying on the ground. A police car approaches and the boy wakes up. The camera pans around and we find out that he is not dead, but rather in a coma, but is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is just plain awesome. You get to experience the good ol' days when a bunch of actors could get along and a movie made the rounds of a few movie theaters.  It's a great example of a buddy cop movie and it has all the right ingredients to be a great action movie.  The character of Lenny is hilarious and his character has that same good ol', 'nough said' attitude that made '80s cop movies so enjoyable.  This is a film with some great acting by everybody involved and the acting was fantastic.  The acting is really at a point now where it's more than the actors putting on the performance.   The actors are actually working as a unit with the same tone, the same mood, and the same kind of humor.  And it's all just fun.  I'm not sure if this is because the actors have gotten older or if it's because the director of the movie has a great sense of humor, but this movie is a fun romp.  It's all about getting back to good old times.  All in all, this is a great film that will bring a smile to your face.   This is what I look for in a buddy movie: -    - "Who's your partner now?" "Uh... The one and only..." -

It was funny, dramatic and had a heart of gold. The film is well made and the soundtrack was nice. The editing was really good and the actors gave it their all and the final credits were spot on. It is a film that will have you looking forward to it. I will definitely be watching again. *****  Rated 4 out of 5 by Ainsley from Beautiful but could be better I have only watched this a couple of times now so I am sure that it needs more editing. But for the price of this I expected more. I would also like to see more people in the cast, but not too many more!  Rating: 4
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ What did you think of "Truly Madly Deeply"? I watched this as it came out, and I was a bit confused with how to start it. I mean, I thought the ending was weird and that it was kind of a let down. However, after re-watching it, I can definitely tell that it is something different. Not that it doesn't have its own distinct charms, but it does have its flaws too. It's definitely not for everyone, but I really think it's worth a look, and it's certainly worth a watch. You won't be disappointed.

The main characters (Liam, a guy who's really interested in computers, and Trudy, who is a girl interested in cars) are the best, and the jokes they come up with are great.  And you have to love the final twist that makes it a perfect comedy.    The movie is not a total hit, but it's got all the elements to be great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those who don't know, this is the second movie from the 'Star Wars' movie trilogy to be shot in Morocco. The original was shot in Tunisia while the second, 'Revenge of the Sith,' was shot here. For the most part, it's the same scenery and same locations, but Morocco is always the highlight of a shoot, and the same can be said for 'Revelations.' You'd think there wouldn't be much to distinguish between the two, right? The sets, the costume and the visual effects. Except one. The Moroccan desert is a different world than Tunisia or even Tunisia's neighbor Algeria. And it's all thanks to a man who's been a part of them both.  The main set for 'Star Tours' in Morocco In this case, we have the most famous name in the movie world (and in the Star Wars world), the man who invented the hyperdrive (the machine that allowed for travel between the known and unknown worlds) which he brought to Morocco in 1977.  He brought along with him an old friend of his, an engineer named Roger Craig Smith. When he saw the desert landscape for the first time, Roger was shocked. He remembered a friend who once told him that the desert is full of monsters and the desert has always been the playground of some of the most dangerous people in the galaxy.  Roger knew the story, but he also knew that no one had ever seen these things, so he started a search. And then, when a young boy named Luke Skywalker was sent out to see the first desert planet outside of the galaxy, he too saw what appeared to be a monster. And so, Roger and Luke decided to set out to find this monster.  In the process, they set out on a quest to save the galaxy and discover a way to use the hyperdrives to travel to new planets. And they didn't just bring their old friend along on their quest. He became a member of the team, and even brought along a droid named BB-8. So they're working together on a very dangerous and very personal mission that leads them to all kinds of strange places. But at the end of the day, the one thing that binds them together is the hope that they can find a way, with the help of the droid BB-9E, to bring an end to the Sith and save the Republic. It's the most interesting idea in a movie that has a lot of ideas
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's my favorite movie of 2016. I have seen many movies in the last 12 months, and this is one of the best. I loved everything about it, the story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the direction... I could go on and on and this movie is so good, the ending was just perfect. The story itself has so much potential. I love a good mystery, and I love that it isn't your typical thriller. This movie is full of suspense, mystery, betrayal, and just a good story. The acting was great too, especially from Tye Sheridan. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I'm looking forward to next year with the release of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, I hope that they bring in a few characters from the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movie! There is not much you can't do when it comes to aliens in space. I enjoyed this movie because it's a different type of alien movie. I'm not really a horror fan but I do like aliens, especially those from the sci-fi genre. The film is a very good film. It really is just that, a good film! If you like a good space adventure, with an amazing special effects, then by all means you should see it. But be warned, it will make you laugh a bit and you'll probably end up crying a few times. 4.5/5 I had to make a special note of this film due to the fact that this is the best looking, one of the best acting performances, and the best script. It's a beautiful movie, with a good special effects. A great movie! Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed the review!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ So, what did you think about? Was it good? Bad? I'm not sure that the movie is very good but if you are a huge fan of this type of movies then you should definitely give this movie a chance. A movie like this should be taken very seriously as a serious horror film, even if it is not as good as some of the other films of this genre, which I believe that it could be. There is plenty of action in the movie but it still is not that scary as I would have liked, even though there are some very strong scenes. The acting is solid, the story is quite good and the visuals and sound are a perfect mixture, with the only bad part being the acting, especially of the lead, who is very under-utilized. I guess the reason that I like this movie so much is that it is a classic, not a remake but a remake, with a unique, modern feel, I'd definitely recommend this film to fans of horror movies.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Apr 1, 2017 11:14 AM  The Martian by Ridley Scott - Movie Review - 3/5 Starring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, Michael Peña, Ken Watanabe, Donald Glover  The Martian is a film that's at times a joy to behold, and yet it's still a film about a human's struggle to survive on a planet where, by default, it is impossible. This is a movie about science, about finding out whether we'll be able to live on a world with no breathable air, no resources. It's a film with one of its more famous lines, which, as the credits begin to roll, has a bittersweet, almost romantic undertone: "If we all die, the Earth will survive. But what about us?"  And that's the thing that The Martian is all about: It's the story of a man's struggles to survive; a man who, like Matt Damon's astronaut Mark Watney, finds himself stranded on a mysterious, barren planet.  It's a beautifully shot movie that plays out like a movie, with a visual style that is absolutely dazzling. The whole thing is set on a Martian-looking planet that looks just like Earth, but that has a completely different atmosphere. The atmosphere is thick, like that from an oxygen-rich atmosphere on Earth, except it has no oxygen; instead, this is a heavy atmosphere of methane.  and I loved the visuals, they just made the movie so much more special  In order to survive, Mark Watley has to use his strength and his wits, in a very human way, to find out what this new world has to offer. And that means that there is a lot of talk and very little action, and that's all great stuff. But I loved it, because the visuals were gorgeous and I appreciated how, unlike most movies, the scenes were shot in a way that seemed to be based on science rather than just the obvious practical stuff. In some ways, it felt as if The Martian were a prequel, and I'm not entirely sure why, but there is something to that. . /Film rating: 3/4

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We started off with a bang and ended with a whimper.  I enjoyed this film to bits, but I wasn't all that impressed.   First off, I will say that the casting was absolutely perfect.  It was so funny watching the various characters interact and I think this is partly due to the fact that the only other actors involved were of a high enough caliber for the film to come out without many complaints from the studio.  And the performances really hit all the right notes with the actors in this film.  In fact, it seems that there was a lot of hard work put into this film, and the film was well worth the wait.  I think if I had seen this when it came out, I would have been more positive about it.  So I am going to give it a C for comedy and a B- for acting.  The film follows a couple of the people we all have a crush on who are stuck on a long-term vacation after a few months in a new town and all they want is to return. However, they don't really want to and they don t have time to plan because of their busy schedules.  One of them decides to stay and work on her resume in order to get a new job and the other one decides to take the long-awaited vacation to see the world in hopes of getting away from it all.  This is probably one of my favorite films of all time, and I am glad I got to see it again.  My only major complaint would be that the film does not seem to have a happy ending, but it would not have been the first film I had watched that had this issue.  Overall, this is a fun film to watch and is a really good movie in its own right.

It was a well thought out movie that everyone should enjoy. The only thing that could be improved was the use of a voice over for the ending, but that was a small thing in a huge movie. See it if you haven't seen it:    I highly recommend watching this movie, it is a well crafted movie, and everyone should watch it. It's a very funny movie, which will have people laughing for a long time, and also it's just an excellent movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  "The Mummy" is a solid adventure that does not waste a minute or an hour. The Mummy does not need a hero, he is good, but he is only a character in the first act. His motivations are not explored and in most cases his actions do not add to the overall story line. In fact, his motivation is often not even a problem. The story is all about the "Monster", the monster is played by a very nice Christian Bale (I would not have changed the casting) and he is scary. The monster was the only thing that the filmmakers needed to scare the audience and they have succeeded in doing so. "The Mummies" is not a good horror movie, but it is not the worst horror movie ever made.  If you would like to buy a copy of this movie, contact your local independent theater and ask if they have it. It is the best movie about a dead mummy ever made and if you liked "Return of the Living Dead", you will love this one. , April 11, 2009  I love this movie so much. I watched it with my family and we had a great time. I really like this movie and I like the director! The Mummys (the people of Egypt) are very funny. I think this movie will be a fun movie for a kid or for a grown man. I recommend this movie for people who like a good scary movie.  the mummies and the action scenes are great! I recommend to see it with children  -Mike D, April 7, 2009

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's something about " The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance " that feels very much like the future I'd envisioned in my head as a child growing up. This is an adventure story without being a simple fairy tale. There's no "magic" to explain what's going on, no "mystical" elements, and certainly no princesses. No princesses, but there is "The Dark Crystal", and even though it doesn't have a simple princess story, it has a great adventure story. " The End of the Crystal " is the film's first true "action-adventure" film; it's not about fighting evil or rescuing a princess, but about protecting a key location in the past from a terrible menace. As a children's fantasy, " The Crystal " makes sense on the surface, but the story beneath it makes a lot more sense. The "magic", if there is any, is just enough to keep things from getting too confusing, but even so, there's a sense of the real world that the film evokes. We see how we are influenced by fairy tales, and how the "dark side" of things can easily be used for evil.  It seems very much at odds with the more light-hearted and magical "The Sword in the Stone", but in this case, I believe that's exactly the point. The Dark Prince (voiced by Christopher Lee) is a figure in the film who is both sympathetic and terrifying. He is a "bad guy" in the same way a person like The Joker would be, a person with a twisted soul. The fact that his backstory is more of a fairy tale tale than "King Arthur" makes him more terrifying than most "dark" bad guys in children's fiction. The dark nature of the film is not an attempt to have something more terrifying; it just happens to come from the fact that it's a little more silly than you might expect. "The End of The Crystal" is about a magical creature, a crystal, and the dangers of how much of that power he can wield. This being a childrens' film, there is very little of the "mysterious" stuff that is more apparent in the more adult films like "The Shining", but there's still some mystery. There is also a little bit of romance, but this is fairly subdued, as it is the dark side of things that is being revealed and not the romance. The romance is also not really a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This is one of the few movies that I am sure everyone has seen. I am surprised how well the movie was made, the actors looked good, and they all acted their parts well. The ending was not a great ending and I think we are all left hanging on that cliffhanger of who is really a boy and who is actually a girl. If you like this movie, it is probably one of your favorites. I would recommend it to anyone, but be aware that this movie is not easy to find on DVD. If we ever get a version of this on DVD, I will be sure to let everyone know!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ Dear Neighbor: My family was in the car with my friend, Mike, when he turned the car off to turn it on again to charge. When I went to get ready for bed, there were several items strewn all over the passenger seat, as if someone had jumped out of the vehicle, grabbed a can of gasoline, jumped back in and started it. After several moments the car began to fill with smoke, and flames engulfed my friend's legs. He managed to grab my hand and said, "You're all gonna burn". I turned around and saw what was left of my friend sitting in the seat, and I realized what had happened. The car would have burst into flames like a candle. This was the third time he had jumped a car that way. It was horrible. I thought, "What is this world coming to? This is a person with a disease." He was in a bad way, with a burning leg. I tried to get out of his way, but he was very strong. He wouldn't let go of my hand. Then I heard my wife screaming, "Mike! Help!" I grabbed Mike's hand and I thought I'd lost him, and this is a good guy. I had no idea what happened to him. My friend was burned to death and I had nothing to go back to him with. The fire department told me they had had no problems with these guys before, but they were not sure about this one. They wouldn't give me any info. It took two weeks before I was even allowed to go home. This incident really shook me up. Mike was the kindest, nicest person I've ever known, and the one most responsible for all of our lives. There are times when I think of his burning body. He was so smart, and loved life so much. I wish I could have helped him at that moment. My wife and I were so happy we were able to see him again. He looked like he was 15. It felt so good to see his face again. I just wish I had known what I know now. He would have loved to talk to me one last time. And he would have wanted me to go to my local fire chief and ask if he could be cremated. If we knew then what we know now, I think our lives would have turned out very different. May Mike be at peace. A friend of mine has a similar story and a story of the same type
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was a pleasant surprise. As a big fan of horror, I was excited for this one. After a few missteps, the film ended up being one of the better entries in the Halloween franchise. The film is set at a small community college in Indiana, and it stars a pair of young teens, Mike (Drew Barrymore) and Rachel (Jessica Harper). Mike is a geek and she a nerd. The two meet and form an odd and wonderful friendship. Unfortunately, the movie gets a little confusing early on, but that's why you watch the movie for yourself. It's a bit of a mess, but I would have never been able to enjoy it without being familiar with the earlier Halloween films. There's some great action here, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, then this one is for you. The movie takes place in Mike's dream, as he and Rachel walk across a bridge over the River Styx. Rachel suddenly slips and her life is in danger. Mike rushes over to save her, but finds her trapped in the bridge by a gigantic creature. She is not only saved, but she and Mike are teleported away. They soon meet up with a young couple named Danny (Michael Chiklis) and Nancy (Holly Hunter). The movie gives them a chance to explain to Mike how a monster got into their house. At first, it seems to be the sort of goofy dream that any kid would have. The story eventually takes a turn, as Mike and Rachel begin to figure out the true nature of their dreams. It may not have been the greatest dream in the world, but it still had a very real message for its young viewers. For a movie that is a couple of years old, this is a great, fun, and surprisingly emotional film.   I gave it a B. It was very fun and was entertaining in places. It is not the best of the series, but not the worst either.  The rating:  C Check this out on IMDb The Cabin in the Woods is a new horror movie from director Drew Goddard.

There are many different characters and it shows all of them. The art of this is really good. All the characters are really interesting. The story is not very complex, but at the same time, it does not try to make the viewer feel anything, but still, it is very good. The acting is good.

Stines) and friends do the best they can with the time they have, which is basically two hours a day.  It starts with Stine sitting at his desk.  He has a pile of papers on his desk and on his top shelf he has an apple which he eats and another apple which is his "poop" apple.  The apple is just thrown out there so that everyone can make fun of it.  Stine's neighbor is his girlfriend's brother, Joe (who he gets his name from) who has a family who loves him.  Joe's girlfriend, Amy (Amy Adams) has a brother who is the best friend of Joe's son, Dylan (Luke Wilson).  The family is very poor.  One night when Stine is working late, he decides to go see an old friend who is a friend of his dad's (who is an inventor).  Stines dad doesn't want to see him, so Stines just goes anyway and there he finds his old friend and the inventor in the form of two little brothers named Paul and Scott who have the same father as Stine.  After talking to them, Stine realizes that he has been living in the past, and goes back to his time, but now he must travel back and change everything.  A few months later Stine finds his father, who wants to help him.   Stines father then changes everything for Stines, including the way the apple works.  This movie has the main characters from the first two movies, plus the ones from the third one.  The first thing I noticed when I watched this movie was the amazing voice of Mr. Stiles.  His character is kind of funny but I didn't get what his dad wanted him to do.   In the third act of the movie, Stiles travels back in time to see his father and get back home.  While the first movie was a bit too long at 90 minutes, this movie is a bit shorter.  I found this movie to be very exciting and entertaining.  Overall, I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My mom loved the movie.  It's not bad, it's just good. It's a good thing she liked it because the movie was kind of awful.  If you liked the other movie, you'll enjoy this one just as much but with far less charm.  A lot of the humor, character relationships, and plot development is just plain old "mildly amusing" which is just not as funny as it sounds.  There are two things that make it enjoyable though, I found one great joke in the movie and that was the fact that the guy who plays the dad is a bit of a jerk.  While he doesn't really get any character development, he is still hilarious and when he shows up at the party and you see him trying to act like a good dad he's quite funny.  That's about it though, there's really nothing to see here except maybe a couple jokes that weren't funny and some bad acting.  Overall I thought it was ok but you won't want to watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is a good film, and even if it had a bit more "oomph" and "gritty" that is not a bad thing. The story was good, but the acting was not really outstanding either. I didn't like the guy who was the only one who was really good. So I can see why it didn't get any awards. I really liked the characters and the story. However, the action scenes were a bit annoying for me. They were pretty cheap looking. I felt like they were too rushed and not well done. And the film didn't have any suspense at all. There was nothing that kept me watching after a while. So that's a negative on the film, but it was a really good story. It was also interesting to see what happened between the three characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've seen a more enjoyable movie in a long while, especially when compared to the last two I've watched, A Single Man and The Last Stand. The dialogue is entertaining and the film does a good job of moving the story along, but the main story here really is that this is a character driven movie and I think it works. The action is exciting and the plot twists are just right to keep the viewer interested. I'm really happy I saw this movie because it reminded me that when a story needs to take place in the present day, that we all have different reactions to that. I don' t want to know why things are happening or who is at fault in the plot, I just want to enjoy the movie. I think that's one of the main reasons why I really like movies and especially action movies. In a way, I think movies are like a drug to me because I can enjoy anything and everything because I feel like I'm part of the story and not just watching it from a distance. Even the music and the direction were amazing, I loved it. Posted by Daniel G at 9:15 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ "I saw The Exorcist as an eight-year-old. It terrified me, and I was still terrified three years later, when it was re-released on VHS and DVD. I had to see the new version, and so I went to see it again. It's wonderful. I was thrilled when I saw the new release. I felt I'd seen the real thing, not a made-for-TV horror film. I would have loved to have seen the director's cut of this movie in 1997. I also would have wanted a different opening than the original, which is really all the opening we get." (David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter)  I saw the original as a child and am so glad I did, even if it made me a bit of a freak. This version restores the essence of the movie. The sound is a bit off-kilter, but it's all in the execution. It might not win over everyone, but I'm happy to know this is the "original" version. It still scares me.  So, who was right?  You should definitely watch this remake. It was a very different film in it's time and is now one of the great horror movies of all time. , "I am sure this movie will continue to scare, entertain and thrill film lovers as it did when I first saw it as a kid. The original film, while a little hard to look at at times, still remains as fresh and original as ever. For the past 27 years since its release the film has been released on DVD in every edition, with a few minor changes. This film should be seen by all film lovers and horror fans. The classic image of the Devil standing in the fireplace, as Father Merrin, Father Karras, and Father Liguori are looking at his shoulder, while he begins to do some very peculiar and evil things with the broom. It is in this scene that we finally hear the sounds of the demon coming from the broom and are given our first glimpse of the creature. This scene remains one of my all-time favorite moments in all horror movies. When the Devil finally starts to come out from the fireplace he is truly terrifying and it was such a fun and scary scene to be part of. This new version makes the original even scarier. The Devil is now completely transparent. He is completely black, just like the image of him on the screen.

I always love it when the guns are flying.   I liked this movie very much.  Rated 3 out of 4 by aussie from not as good as the previous instalment. There were two scenes I thought were a little out of place. One, the gun battle in the desert and the other a few times at the end when they got into the boat and the two men are getting out and they pass one of the white settlers.  Not my favorite of the westerns but still a decent one.  A little dull after the first half or so.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Man Who Loved Children (2008) - 8/10 The Man who Loved children is a film that has a lot of good points. However, it also has a large number of flaws. The story is the focus, which is fine, but when it is pulled out of context you start to realize it is going to be a very difficult watch. The film takes place in a time when the whole world is at war with each other, yet in this film the children are in hiding from the war because of what they have done. The boy who loved children has his parents killed in a war, but his loving and protective mother doesn't get enough credit for what she's done for her son, and the war that devastated her life is ignored. The movie was made in 2007, and even today people find it interesting and interesting, but it is no masterpiece. It's a good story with some flaws, but I'd say it isn't one of the top ten films of all time, which means it isn  It is interesting to see the different ways people have reacted to the film. The reviews all have one thing in common: they all call it great and funny. Some of the reviews include, "The children are so well played out, it really is amazing". "I liked it so much, I am a big fan". People are praising the actors and the direction, and not only that, but they think it is funny! People are really giving it a good rating for a film made in 2008. I don't understand people's reactions to a film from two decades ago, and I don`t think this film has gotten a lot better since it was made. In my eyes the movie is still in the "good" category, because it is a well-played out story that has some good ideas, and is entertaining. However it also suffers from one of many problems that plague a lot good films that are made today: it is written and directed in such a way that it's hard to follow the story. When it is all said and done, we're left confused. The director, Tom Holland, has done some great films, but he's a bit of a lazy director when it comes to story, and he fails to show his main characters in the right light. This makes the movie difficult to follow in parts, and it is often hard to figure out who is who. I know it is impossible to follow a movie like this all

Well, it's good that you asked that because I think this is the best movie I ever did. Not only is it funny, but it's a good story that keeps you going and then you get to watch the good parts in the end. If you are a guy I would tell you to buy the DVD because the story is so good and the acting is good. I would love to do one for every character I played in this movie. You should watch it right after you saw the movie and then see it again after you have seen the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I really enjoyed this film as well as my other favorite movie "The Devil Inside" from the 80's. The film follows a woman named Julie that is in her late 30's. She had married a nice guy named Peter and the marriage went well. Peter was a brilliant man and a wonderful father to their daughter. She soon after gave birth to a son named Josh. Julie and her family are moving to a new town and she had a great time with Josh. However, one day she had an accident and Josh was very sick. She decided to have another son. Now it seemed that it was the right time to have a third son but when she found out that her son had died. At first she didn't feel like it was her fault. But now she believes that Josh's death was not his fault at all. Now she wants to give something back to the man she married. So she gives her baby son and her house to her husband Peter. But, now she feels the need to be a mother to a little girl. Then she finds out that the father of her child is a man named Mark. Julie's life is turned upside down when she finds that Mark is not the man her husband was, but he is also not who he says he is. Now, things get worse when she learns that Mark was once married to a man who cheated on his wife and was also an alcoholic and died of a drug overdose. Julie is now forced to face the fact that she must now raise a daughter on her own. The plot is excellent. It is filled with suspense and is filled to the brim with amazing dialogue. There is no way to describe how much fun I had watching this film. This is a movie that is definitely a must see. It will make you feel like the life of a mother is a hell on earth.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie has some very good action scenes, but the movie's focus is on some characters that have been around for a while and are a little too tired. The plot has been done to death in every other action film. The only way the movie makes it through the middle is because of its excellent acting. It takes place in the same universe as the other two. The film's soundtrack is great too, as is the original score. Overall, this is the best of the series, and definitely worth a watch. - March 8, 2014Good Movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy (2017) is a good reboot of the Universal Monster movies. It gives them a new beginning with Tom Cruise as Dr. Jekyll and a new antagonist who is more of a villain and more like the monsters in the first Universal Monster movie. I know there are some fans of the old Universal Monster films that will probably want a better treatment to the movies so I would recommend the movie to everyone. There are some new elements like the new monster, but the old monsters are back just like they were in the original. If you liked the original Universal Monsters then this movie should make you happy. It is definitely worth watching especially if you love movies or you are a fan of Tom Cruise.

' The great beauty' is quite a beautiful film.   I like the story and the acting is great.  I am sure most would like to be in a situation like this.  In this situation, one man has a beautiful woman and it is not what she wants.   There are a lot of things happening in this film.  It is the first movie I have seen about a woman and her relationship with a man and what happens between the two.  There is a lot going on.  One scene in particular that is very important.  This part is a good scene and the action is good.  Overall, this is a beautiful movie that makes you think.  Although it is a little bit difficult to get into it, I think you will love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Do You Believe in Miracles? (2016) is a fine movie with good performances from the lead actors and very good storytelling. It is just as well done as The Revenant was but I like the idea of the story. That of the survivors of the Titanic, survivors of a shipwreck on an iceberg, having to survive on land, eating wild berries and drinking sea water and the various animals around them. As an audience, we are able to empathise with their plight. In the end, they are able somehow to make their way to a nearby port and in the process of doing so, they discover that a second ship, the Titanic is on its way back to Europe. The film takes us back to the events of the shipwreck which makes for a very interesting story. The screenplay by Peter Straub and the direction by David Mackenzie are both excellent. The editing by the well known David Gordon Green makes for good film. I am not sure if the cinematography is just great or if the lighting is just right but, overall, I really liked this film. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good tale told well, who wants a good old fashioned survival story, and who also wants to get a feel of how survival stories are told around the world. ______________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gore (Gore Verbinski) has a new job. As a government scientist, he is tasked with tracking down and eradicating the deadly virus responsible for the extinction of the human race. But he soon finds himself in the crosshairs of a group of renegade mercenaries and elite soldiers determined to end his work and the virus for good. "Gore" is a modern-day action-comedy featuring plenty of gore and a high degree of gore humor. It's also the best action-comedies we've seen in years. The movie is fun to watch as the story evolves, and a terrific ensemble cast (Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and James McAvoy are just a few of the impressive names) helps carry it along. The film's script has a little too much gore for my taste, but you won't care since there's enough laughs and fun. Gore Verbinski and company are responsible for some of the best horror and action comedies ever. They've made "The Chronicles of Riddick," "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," and "Paranormal Activity" and many more. Now, they've made a funny, thrilling and well-made action movie about a scientist who works for the government, who has to kill people to save the human species. I can't wait to see more from them.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************** I thought I would try this out on my birthday, and I can definitely say I will be ordering more from here! My family and I are all big fans of Star Wars, and we've been trying to get tickets to all the films lately... but I've never been to one I was so happy to go to. First off, I didn't have to wait long to get into the theater, because there were only a few seats available, and they didn't want to let people in if they weren't seated within a couple of minutes. Once seated, I got to meet some of the cast members that worked on the movie, and watched some of my favorite scenes, including the scenes of Luke and Leia. The action scenes were incredible, the costumes are fantastic and we were able to see many more of the film than the trailer would have you believe. In addition, we had some extras that we had never seen before, and even if you didn't know the film was about Darth Vader, they were awesome. I think the only downside is the food, which is what you see in the trailers. It's not that bad, but it was a little over-cooked. If you like the "Star Wars" movies, you should definitely see this, and it's just an awesome gift from me to my family and friends!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The best example of the classic Hollywood style of making people feel things, without having to have anything else to say." The best picture in the world  (2004) "In the world's best-known and certainly most beloved film trilogy, Christopher Nolan has built upon a remarkable achievement by Michael Mann and directed by David Fincher. It is hard to believe that this is an entirely new screenplay by Nolan. It was written by Christopher Nolan in a few days (during the winter of 2004) after FincHER told him that the movie needed a lot of work. Nolan was given the same material as Michael Mann with the exception of the script. It all just fell into place. The picture, like all of Nolan's, is completely original, with no trace of references or homages. The story is entirely a Nolan creation. This is a brilliant and complex film. " - Jeff Widener, Los Angeles Times, April 5, 2004 "Christopher Nolan's THE MATRIX is, without question, the best movie to come out of Hollywood in the past decade. It may also be one of the most original films to come along in the last half century, with an emotional complexity that few movies could match. It is a film that, by its very nature, makes you question everything you know about human existence and the human condition, and it does so with the sophistication of a master craftsman. It's not for everybody, but it's for everyone who can enjoy the journey. " – John Updike, New York Times, June 6, 2004 My review on RIDGE OF TOMORROW : "I've always felt that Christopher Nolan should've had his own feature film. I'm not talking about a small-budget studio affair, either: I mean a feature with Nolan's name attached to it, not some indie or independent endeavor where he has to make compromises and beg forgiveness for any problems. So you don't really know what to expect from RIDGEO. I've always appreciated how well the director makes you feel like a character in his movie; he's a great storyteller, and the story has enough emotional heft to it to make you care about Nolan's characters. It could have been really good, if it had any characters, but for what it is, it works. In fact, there are plenty of moments in the film that feel as though they were cut from a Nolan movie: the first time that we
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- This was a great movie that's not too violent, but it does contain one scene that's a bit too long and over the top, but for what it is, it's worth the price. The story is about two lovers in love, who get caught up in a strange case. What you get is two lovers who do not need each other because they are each other's other. The couple have a strange relationship that seems to go beyond normal human standards. It's a good story about love, life, and sex that is sure to have you feeling so happy and relaxed that you want to start a new relationship with your partner. I would like to thank my boyfriend for watching this movie with me. Thank you, thank you. I love this movie. -- The only thing that I didn't like was when one of the male characters was wearing a blue bandanna and I had trouble getting used to it. The movie was a bit slow at times, but I still enjoyed the movie. I wish it had a bit more action. Overall, I'd recommend this movie to all lovers of romance, erotic movies, and sexual fantasies. -------------- If I had to give it a rating... I would give this a 7.75 out of 10. -- This was my first time seeing "Crazy Crazy Love" so I was a little scared. I got to the movie theater a little early because my boyfriend had to work, but once we arrived we found out that they had a few extra tickets and decided to go see this movie anyway. I was very nervous to go because it was my boyfriends first time in a theater so I didn;t want to embarrass him in front of everyone. The place was packed when we walked in. I couldn;t believe how many people had just come out of the theater. It felt like we had to fight our way to the seats because the seats were so packed. We went straight to our seats and we were very lucky to have the extra tickets because when we got to our seat we couldn;ts believe how empty it was. When my boyfriend started to read the movie, I started to feel a little anxious and a little nervous. He started to talk to me, but the words just wouldn;t come out. I tried my best to get as much as I could out in front him, but he kept making strange faces and trying to get the words out. He was saying, "I want you, I need you", but

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was one of my top picks for 2016, and I was very happy when I saw that it got made in time for my holiday. In my opinion, this film is a very strong example of modern psychological horror. It is very tense and intense, with very creepy and graphic imagery. It also features many great twists that are well placed, and even a bit surprising.  The film's strength is the way that its main character, Richard (Dylan O'Brien) is slowly coming to grips with his identity. When I think of psychological horror, I don't necessarily think of a movie like Psycho. I think a great example is The Exorcist. Richard is going through the same kind of struggle as the possessed child in that film, and there are many similarities between the two, and between Richard and the demon. But this isn't an exorcism film. Richard doesn't want to be possessed. Richard has been possessed, and Richard is the one who has to deal with the aftermath. . The plot is very much based around an old woman who lives in the woods and who has been cursed to never return to her home or to leave it. It seems that she is cursed, but it is something that is slowly being revealed to her, and is slowly destroying her. As the plot progresses, we learn more and more about her life and her history. She lives alone and seems to have few close friends. When we first meet her, she is dressed like a man, but then she is revealed to be a woman. She doesn't seem to have any family. Richard seems to be the closest of friends, but the curse has affected him very badly, and we see Richard slowly trying to make sense of what is happening to him. This leads him to see the ghosts of dead people, but more importantly, to meet a serial killer (played by an excellent Gary Oldman) who has also been cursed. He is killing people, and when Richard confronts him he almost instantly dies. When Richard finally learns what he is, it all starts to make more sense, and the curse is slowly revealed to him, but we also learn what the curse does to the people who are cursed. The curse is a curse which takes away the human identity of its victim, and they lose all sense of self, and also their sense of morality. When Richard learns the curse, he begins to understand what the other people are going through. We

Paddington the Parson's first meeting with his new owners is at a market, where he greets the pheasant farmer's daughter. The young girl is played by Emma Thompson and their relationship will become very important in the film. As the film progresses, Paddinton discovers that he is a very special paddy who's life is about to change forever.  Daniel Radcliffe in the movie. If you're wondering why the paddy's voice changes from pudgy to more muscular, it's because of an unfortunate childhood accident involving a large plastic toy.

It stars James McAvoy and Emma Thompson, and takes place in the year 2044. The film features a variety of actors including a young Daniel Radcliff.

After the events in Paddford, George begins to realize that all of his family members have died. George learns from Paddy that he's going to be a father. The ending of the film shows George with a horse that looks similar to Paddy, and he's being trained as a paddy.     Paddwick, a funny movie: A bunch of young people play a game of Paddick, which is basically just a big group of silly children playing a silly game.

Jordan and Emma then share a quick peck on the cheek, Emma goes to grab her books, but is interrupted by a guy in a white mask.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ It's the final year of high school, and you've decided to make the most of your last year of glory, by doing things like going to every football game and being an active member of your school's sports teams, taking some classes you may not have learned to program or read, and getting into some shenanigans with some older guys. You do everything right in the way you dress for it, talk to the guys, and play with your friends. You're excited for the end of your high school days and you're going to graduate with honors, in the nick of time! You feel accomplished.   Then suddenly, you're stuck, and things get worse. You are a computer-science major, and your major advisor decides that your major is too easy and that you should change majors. He says that computer science is too boring, too repetitive, and that he thinks you should become an engineer. He's right, you think. I really don't get it. Computer science is something I enjoy doing, but he is right: it is boring. All my life, my parents have told me not to take up a major that is boring to do, but this time it feels different. My parents have never been able to explain this feeling. They've never had a single conversation about my being bored with computer science. Maybe I'm just a hopelessly romantic, but that was the only time in my life where I ever felt more alone than I do now. I'm not just bored with it, I've never liked it. I don't even want to be a programmer. I want to get a master's degree, or a PhD, or to become a novelist. Why does this feel different?  You wonder if your parents' opinions, and the opinions of your friends, are valid. You wonder if you're just a nerd or a romantic or a bad example, because no one else has ever felt this way.  's final year ends with you feeling very alone, and it seems that even with your parents being able to understand and accept your decision, you'll probably never feel truly happy with your life. But perhaps you won't even be able to find a true romantic partner, so it's best you do what you need to do now before you waste your life and the rest of your life on someone who doesn't even really love you. You don't feel alone anymore, but you're still stuck and you don't know what to do with

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the only film that ever made me cry, and it did so in a very pleasant way.  The film begins in the midst of a violent attack on a man by a masked man. Â There is some very nice animation, and the way the man reacts to the attack is truly chilling.  The film follows this man as he tries to fight the masked man and escape, but finds himself having to deal with the same thing all over again.    After a while the masked villain is taken out, but the man survives, and is forced to try to protect himself from others who are looking to harm him.  This is a very nice film, and with that said it's certainly not an easy watch, but it's definitely worth it.    This is the best of the old 'fantasy' films from the 50's and 60's, and for that I give it 5  1)  The Pink Panther (1963) 2)  Return of the Pink Panther 2 (1964) This film is one of the very best films of the 70's.  The film has a very unique style that blends the 70s cartoon with a more real-life feel.  It's also a very entertaining film, but don't expect any great acting or animation.  A great film by the Disney team, and one of my personal favorites.  Recommended!

"Atonement"  Director Alfonso Cuarón ("Children of Men") directed the Oscar-nominated "Children of God," "Gravity" and the new sci-fi "Gattaca." Now he takes on the long-gestating "Atone" and makes an extremely satisfying, complex film about religion, redemption and the afterlife. Atonement, which was a big gamble for Cuarñon, opens with a very long and strange opening scene, involving an American family having a hard time getting a visa to visit their daughter who was killed in the Iraq War. The couple's teenage daughter, who's pregnant, is in a hospital and is undergoing an abortion, and the mother is angry at the American embassy because it's being slow to release the information she needs about the child.  "We have a lot of time on our hands," says the woman. "If we go to the U.S., we can get an abortion at any time. And we can tell everyone we have a baby, 'This is my daughter' — that way, we will never get in trouble." Her husband, an attorney, is the anti-abortion zealot, and tells the embassy his daughter is in great pain but shouldn't be forced to have the procedure. The embassy staff tries to reason with him, arguing that her case is complicated, that she's pregnant and that she doesn't have any control over what will happen to her baby. (There is no legal justification for such an arrangement, but it's what he'd come to believe anyway.) Eventually the mother goes to the hospital, where she's told she's given birth to a girl but can't find any birth certificates because the woman didn't get her baby's father to take them to the embassy for registration. The young woman is given a shot at a different kind of life — at

In 1970 Sam Peckenshaw became a professional photographer. He shot a series of pictures in New York City that were later published as a series in the newspaper Life in 1971.

The first photograph in the series was taken at a party and shows a young girl standing next to a man with his arms outstretched towards a car. The girl's face is blurred and her head is not shown. The photographer, Sam Pecksonsaw, then took two more photographs in the same location. Sam Pecksenpah used this as an inspiration for the famous sequence in the film "The Wild One". The images of the girls were accompanied by the story of a boy named Frank who became very sick after going to a party. During the course of his illness Frank tried to convince a priest to get him a bottle of holy water which was said to be able to cure any illness. The priest eventually gave in to his patient's demands and gave him a holy water. The water was supposedly made from the holy water of the Virgin Mary. However, the bottle was really a poisoned bottle of Coca-Cola. Frank vomited a number of times before finally dying. The original copy of the "Holy Water" photo. As you can see, the water is a clear drink. One of the most famous images of Sam Peppenshaw was taken on the set of the film, "Wild One" during the filming of the final scenes. The scene was set in the church of St. Bartholomew's where the hero, Frank, is dying of the poisoning that had been inflicted upon him. Sam Peppershaw was there as a photographer for Life Magazine. In the original photo the priest is standing next a church's window. On the photo's backside Sam Peckenpah has made a cross with blood-stained hands.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (3/5) If you're one of the people who haven't watched this movie yet then I suggest you give it a chance. I'm still not sure how to feel about it, I guess I was a little disappointed by how it ended. I feel like the end of this movie felt a bit abrupt, but it didn't really leave anything hanging. The action sequences were great and this was one of those rare movies where I was able to get more out of the soundtrack than the movie itself. There's not really anything else to say, just watch this movie if you haven't seen it before. Posted by D. M. Thomas at 9:15 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Nov 21, 2013 11:30 AM by   In The New Yorker, Jessica Winter writes about the history of sexual harassment in Hollywood and the way that the abuse is often handled internally by women who want to maintain their own careers and safety. But it's often the men who perpetrate the behavior and don't want to risk getting in trouble that can create the climate where sexual assault can thrive.  On November 6, 2015, Variety reported that producer Harvey Weinstein was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against him. It didn't take long for Weinstein to find a new job.  (Photo: Michael Kovac, WireImage)  There have been other high-profile cases of men allegedly committing rape in the film industry, but those incidents have been far less public. It's almost as if the victim doesn't want the whole world to know how powerful the man was who assaulted her.  on Dec. 7, 2016, Weinstein was accused of rape in a bombshell report by Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd. The case was the first to make public accusations against the mogul. (Photo credit: HANDOUT/INVISION/AP) - - - -  The New Yorker's Jessica Winter reported that women are reluctant to come forward with allegations of harassment, because the "vicious cycle" of women being silenced by the men they're accusing can sometimes be more than she can bear. The Weinstein case is particularly disturbing, especially if you believe that women should have the right to work in the workplace without fear of being assaulted.  "You know, in order to feel comfortable to come out, I've had to be in a position where I know that somebody else knew," said Anna Graham Hunter, an actress who says Weinstein raped her in the late '80s. "I know he's a famous person and a powerful, wealthy man, and that's a threat to me. But I've also had to learn that people who are powerful and wealthy, and powerful men, will get away with anything."  After Harvey Weinstein allegedly raped Gwynneth P  walt, we shouldn't take anything for granted  Paltrow in a 2015 article. , Angelino Jolie, Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, a producer who accused him of sexual assault, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed them and then
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What a great movie! It's the same director (Kirsten Dunst) who made last year's The Girl on the Train. It's a nice and relaxing movie with a great soundtrack. We all felt like we were inside the movie with the beautiful music that was very relaxing and a bit dreamy. It just goes to show how good the soundtrack is when you make a good film. The best thing about this movie is that there was some great acting and it made you feel like a good person if you were going to make a movie like this. There were some scenes that were more realistic than the other ones so that was interesting and it helped make the movie really worth watching. It was also a good idea for this to be the first movie of the year since the Oscar was so hard to get this year, which was nice to see, and the movie got a great review from The Wrap. It won the Audience Award for Best Drama. It also got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, which is just as good as it sounds. It did well enough in its first week so that we were all looking forward to see how this film was going to turn out and it was. I thought it was a lot of fun and it went above and beyond what I thought. I liked all of the characters and the story that the film told. It does a great job of having a good story with a good script. The story was good, but it also had a great cast. The performances were great and they all played well. I can't say enough about the acting. It all works together and it all helps make this a great watch. I was really happy with it. I'm excited to see what the film does for this film industry. This movie was well worth the watch. The film's soundtrack was great and I really liked all the songs that were played throughout the film. I really hope that they will do some music on some of the films that they make in the future. I hope they can make something that really makes you cry like in this movie. This is definitely a film that deserves to get more attention from the audience and more people should give it a shot. Overall, I'm very happy with this movie and I think it's the best movie of 2015 so far. It has a great story, good acting and a great score. It may not have the plot of a more mainstream movie, but I think that it would be a good
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wolf of Wall Street"  is a great movie. The movie deals with a lot of themes that are related to Wall Street and the real life events that took place during the last 10 years. However, the movie deals not only with Wall Street, but also with other topics. The best example of this is a group of young men who run a hedge fund. They try to win big by investing in stocks and thus making huge profits. But this makes them greedy and they begin to lose all of their money. They are in a bad situation and are faced with many tough decisions. As the story progresses we learn that most of the time these decisions are made in a very short time and thus, these decisions will often lead to disaster. However they are too greedy to admit it and continue to make the same decision. A few of the many things in this movie that are good:  The music is excellent.    This is another great movie that is filled with great scenes that have a great plot and have great performances from everyone.  We get to learn a lot about the lives of these people as they go through their own problems.  "The Wolf"  I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the real lives of Wall St.  I recommend this film to everyone and everyones who is a fan of real life Wall St and who have a problem with greed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very impressed with this one! I found it to be very exciting and a lot of fun. It has all of the qualities that you would expect from a zombie movie: crazy special effects, great characters, interesting plot, and of course plenty of blood, gore, and grime. I was not expecting to see the "infected" in such great quantities and also not at such a slow rate. This movie is very much a "feel good" movie, with a lot going on in the world of zombies. It also has some strong messages and a very well-written story, and does a great job of staying focused throughout. The music is wonderful, and is very memorable. The acting is mostly good and I do enjoy what was going on with the characters. The film ends with some great final shots and the end title sequence really shows what a good work of art this film is. My rating: 8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The first thing I was hoping for from this film was for it to be the first time that I saw a horror movie, so I could enjoy it. I'm glad I was able to enjoy it; as for the movie itself, it was definitely one of the better horror movies I have ever seen. It takes a very different tone from most of the films that I have seen in the genre and it does it well, which is surprising to me because the genre is often criticized for being formulaic. I also think that the style and sound of this film is unique, but the plot itself is not so different. While the story is very intriguing and suspenseful, it is never too overwhelming to those who are just watching it to find out what happens next. This film does a good job of letting the viewer know what is going on in every scene. ___________________________________________________ Summary: ____________________ _____________________ "Wicked has a new master director; I would have been scared out of my wits." - John Waters.

His wife, Nguyen Thi Thanh, was a high ranking member of the North Vietnamese Communist Party. For decades, Kim Suo had been the most important North Vietnamese military figure and advisor to Chairman Ngo Dinh Diem of North Vietnam. Kim Sui is now serving a 20 year sentence in the US for attempting to overthrow the government of South Vietnam after the collapse of the French colonial occupation of South Vietnamese territories. When we visited Kim Suis, we asked him why he was helping the North. His reply was, "If I had had nothing to do with the Vietnamese, there would have been no war". Kim Suer also stated that South Vietnam was an American colony and that the American government needed to be overthrown. The United States was involved in the killing of tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese, including women and children, and millions of Americans were wounded or affected. The war, according to Kim Suie, was all about money. There are many who believe that Kim Suui's actions were in fact the work of the CIA. In this article, I am going to try to convince you that Kim Sung Sui was, in fact, a patriotic man, who was trying to protect his country and the Vietnamese people. I am

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie a lot! I had seen it before on TV but it is a good idea to watch it again. The movie is about two kids and their friend who is going on a trip. Their trip goes wrong when they fall in a hole and they come out into a river with a crocodile on the other side. I didn't really like crocodiles at all and this movie didn't show any. It was also well made with good effects. There was an ending that had me laughing out loud. My wife did not like the movie and she didn't know how to describe it well either. She was kind of disappointed but it was a good enough movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best" is a very unique movie. I will say that the story is very interesting and unique. It tells the story of a young boy who finds himself in a village full of people with no memories except for what he can see. His mom decides to take him there to live with his uncle, who is not so keen on the idea of a child living with strangers. However, they meet the villagers, who eventually learn that he is their son and begin a life-long friendship. They give him his own place to live and a job to help them survive. When things don't go as planned, he has to decide who he truly is. "The Best", which takes place in the year 2000, is one of those films that is so much better now as a film than it was as a documentary in its original form. It is the story that will keep you watching. It's got great acting, great cinematography, amazing locations, a very original story, and so much more. If you are a fan of the original, you will enjoy this film too. It could be considered an "immersive" experience. "The best" is available on YouTube  as a feature length documentary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Day The Earth Stood Still, starring Sean Connery is probably the best movie ever made and is an iconic sci-fi classic of our time.  It is a fun adventure film, with amazing special effects and the perfect pacing of the plot is great.  There is no reason to not watch this classic now.  The movie is available on Netflix, Amazon, Youtube and Vudu.  For more information and reviews of The Day The Planet StoodStill, you can go to http://thedaystothedestreet.com/   Check out a trailer from the movie: Movie Rating: 7.9/10 For more movie reviews, you will find them on my blog: http://www.filmbuff.com  Movie Review:   A very memorable scene in A New Hope was the Battle of Hoth, with Yoda, Luke, Leia and Han on the Death Star in a great sequence.  When the Rebels attacked the battle station with a huge force, Obi-Wan and Anakin used the Force to try and stop them, but were unable to stop the Rebel fighters from blowing up the Deathstar, destroying the planet.  The battle is still remembered as the start of the Empire and is probably one of the most memorable scenes from any Star Wars movie. This is an interesting question.  In fact, it is impossible to decide.  Is it better to see the movies in order, or is it better not to know which movie you are watching?  For me, it depends on the context and the mood of the film.  If I am watching a film that is intended to tell a complete story, as in the case of a film about the Death of Luke Skywalker (the original trilogy), then watching the movies at the same time is the most natural and the most immersive way to experience the story.  On the other hand, when I am just enjoying a film as a good story, then I would prefer to watch the movies without any pre-existing context.  Personally, I feel that the best way to enjoy a Star Wars film is to simply take it all in with your mind.  Sometimes, to experience a film with no context is to feel a sense of awe and wonder about what the story is trying to say.  This is the feeling that comes to mind when watching Episode V, when Han Solo and Chewbacca enter the Millennium Falcon.  At this time, it does

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I know you all like it: _________________________________________________________________________________I know theres not much time left, but I have to make up for lost time. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I have been waiting for a good one that would show more of the "real" life of a drug addict. As always, the good stuff happens in the beginning when you meet the girl who lives next door and you see the first of the parties. The movie is a bit slow, which I guess was intentional, but at times you wish it would speed up a bit. But I guess some things need to be slow in order to show them in the best way possible. It does, however, tell the story of how the drug abuse started, and it is actually very good. I do like the guy who tries to make it work by going on more and more meth, but that guy is so obnoxious. That guy had it coming. He had nothing to do with anything except his addiction. I really think he would have been better off if he had just stopped. There is also a little bit of sex in there, but it is brief and kind of unnecessary. Still, this movie is still a good example of the real life that a meth addict can go through.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This is the first "real" movie I have seen about the Holocaust, and it shows it very well, in terms of the story, the acting, the costumes, and the cinematography. The movie shows very well what happened. The camp, the death camp, and how the Jewish people lived there. The Jews had all they needed. The Germans were just being nice to them. They didn't bother killing the Jewish guards. They were just getting food and taking the Jews to work at the camp. It shows the German perspective, that they were the good guys. I had a problem with the scene where the German is trying to get a Jewish doctor to take the Jews. The doctor was the Jewish doctor, and he was the one that would do anything for the Jews, so he refused to help. In a way, he was a Nazi. This is also the first time I was actually afraid of someone. I was afraid of this little girl, this little young girl, I don't know why I was scared, but she was so cute. She was dressed in a brown coat and she had this big brown mop, and she was wearing a brown hat, and her feet were dirty and black. I don' t know how they got dirt on her shoes. But the little girl was so good looking. It is one of those movies that I still haven't seen, because it was so long ago, and now I have kids and everything. But it still makes me laugh. It just doesn't make me feel anything like it did then, but now it does. The actors are all good, all the actors are very good. I didn't care that many times where the movie stops and they do something, you know? And I always laughed when they were in the kitchen, the Jewish kids cooking and stuff. They all had this German accent. It was a good film. I have read about the first and second part, but I think I have just seen it. It took me about 2 years to see it, but it was worth it.  _________________  'A' was a bad movie, and this is no exception. The characters are stupid. I hate the little Jewish kids in that movie. They have no brains. They are only in the movie because they are part of a movie. The film does not have anything to do with the Holocaust. And they are just a bad, bad, horrible movie. 's.

It is one of the greatest horror movies ever made and it is worth watching for the brilliant performances. The Shining is one that can stand on its own as a horror movie, but it is very effective in building up to a climax that is very hard to top. I would recommend this film to any fans of horror, because it is a classic that can only be improved upon. What are the other recommendations you have for me? Please let me know in the comments.

The story of two families that are trying to make their way in New Orleans during the Civil Rights movement is fairly typical. The actors are great, but this isn't a good film for the "family" genre. It was good at first but grew tiresome, and not just because I can't remember a single line by anyone. The Best is still on the way, and I hope it will be better. The director is Jeff Buhler, so hopefully he'll make it better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I have to say, this movie was incredible. It had a great cast and a great plot. It's got a bit of a cult following, so it may be a little dated now, but it was a great movie in 1992. The plot was about an alien race that invaded Earth and took over the government. The government, led by a nice, smart, but somewhat boring President, decides to send the aliens back to space, but with an important catch. They want to take the alien's technology with them, but they're afraid that if they do, the aliens will come back and take over the earth. They send the alien race back to earth. The main character is an astronaut who's going to be the first to land on the moon. I think the movie was really well done, with great acting, great sci-fi, and great plots. I'm not sure if it was that great in the US, since it was first released on DVD in the UK, but I'd certainly recommend it if you're a fan of sci-fantasy and aliens. The DVD is out of print, and I haven't seen it in a few years, so if you don't mind having to do a bit more research, then you should check it out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Liked it. I wasn't really expecting too much from it as I've never really been into the James Bond franchise. But it turned out to be the best thing I've seen this year. I was really shocked by how good the plot was and how it managed to hold the focus on the Bond villain and not the plot.  In general the pacing of this film was great.  There were several times when you thought you would get caught off guard by something but somehow it kept it in the background.  One of my favorite lines from Bond was when he says "don't tell me what I have to do, I'll do it myself." Well that sums up the main character of this movie.  This movie reminded me of The Magnificent Seven and the fact that Bond doesn't want to do any of the bad things the evil gang members want him to do.  It's not that the plot is bad, it's that the acting is. The villains were great, especially the boss, Mr. Lauer (Christopher Plummer) who was really scary.  I'd say I loved every character except for Bond and Le Chiffre.  The story was great, but I found myself getting a little bored and bored with it.  Overall this is a great James Bond film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The best movie about a young woman's relationship to a very old woman" - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318752/review from @brianahills I was a little hesitant to review this movie, as I knew it was being marketed as a horror film and some people think horror movies can't be funny. However, I must say that it was definitely funny, and if you don't like it then you are probably just not looking in the right places. I also enjoyed how the movie used humor in a positive manner, I mean how is a guy who doesn't think about the future a coward? The idea that you have to be prepared for whatever life throws at you is funny. The movie was well directed, the acting was great, and the cinematography was fantastic. This movie is a little overrated, but it is still a really good movie that you should watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Citizen Kane, The Princess Bride, or Sunset Boulevard.  All good films.  On the other hand, they've all been very good movies.  Some people hate them for their plot holes or the cheesy acting, but that's their charm.  One of the things I love about Citizen Kane is that it's one of the few movies that makes sense.  I could see what was going on in Kane's head (it's a very unique situation in that he's the perfect idiot for that situation, if you ask me), and I was hooked.  To me, it was the only movie that could possibly ever make me a more devoted "movie fan". It's no surprise that the other big screen masterpiece of the 1950s, The Lord of the Rings, would also be one of my top 10 of all time, but it did not make the list.  It's so obvious what the plot is supposed to be, it's hard to get excited.  Tolkien was such a genius for inventing a world that can never be found in the books, and making it feel completely real.  Sure, the characters might be "characters" in the book, but they are completely different from the movie characters.   Also, there are a lot of people (like me) who just don't like the movie.  If you read the books and decide to see it, go do it.   This is one of those rare films that made me truly appreciate Tolkien.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not great, but it's definitely not bad. A lot of my friends will say that the first two or three minutes are where the movie becomes great, and I agree. It's the first time the plot gets interesting. It was interesting to see how the main character was introduced, and his parents were the first and foremost things I got from him. It did get slow, however, by the time it got to the finale, and that's a problem. The plot does not resolve itself. There's not much to be excited about, but this is definitely the kind of movie that I would watch multiple times in order to get a full understanding of it. If you like fantasy, fantasy adventure, or fantasy romance, you're definitely going to love this movie. It doesn't live up to the greatness of movies like The Sword in the Stone or The Lord of the Rings, but it will give you plenty of entertainment. Did you know that there is an American remake of this movie? Well, it is! It's called Dragon Warrior II : The Search for the Red Elixir. I've never seen this movie, and frankly don't know why I am surprised. The movie was very, very poor. It looks like a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of The Lord and The Ring, which is not a great film at all. It makes the same mistakes the movie did, but in a different way. The story is the same, except the movie takes place in the future. There are some interesting ideas that go over my head, but at least the movie does get interesting halfway through. It starts out slow, but once it gets going it's amazing. As a result, I ended up giving this movie a 2 out of 10.  I've seen a lot of bad movies, but if I am going to complain about a movie, this is the one I am most upset about. It is very sad to see it go on the silver screen, even if I don't want it to. But if you can get past its flaws, you will still have a great time with Dragon Warrior. I haven't watched this movie since I watched it in college. I've heard of it, but I'm pretty sure I haven't seen it. So far it looks great! It is a very epic adventure! I love these kinds of movies! I don and I want to watch this movie all over again! If you've never heard of this film

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate is an extremely tense thriller in a story that is reminiscent of both the plot of The Manchursan Candidate and the book that inspired it, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  It is a tale of the dark side of intelligence and the ways that even the most elite of people are not immune to the effects of intelligence.  The story is told from the perspectives of two people, Paul (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Holly Hunter) who are two of the most wanted terrorists in the world.   Holly is Holly Hunter from the book and Paul is the clone of Dr. James Donovan (who is played by Paul Bettany), a scientist who has been creating perfect human clones for years.  I read this book as a teenager (I believe I got it around 1977, I'm not sure, I don't know if it was released then or if I'd just gotten it on a later edition) and the plot was completely unbelievable to me at the time, the first half of the book follows Paul and Holly as they attempt to sneak across the border and join the enemy in an attempt to steal a large amount of money from a bank in Europe.  These two, in a completely unnecessary twist, meet Dr. Donovan, who is a clone himself and has been working on a clone for a long time, even though he never tells anybody about it.  This leads to Paul and Dr. Hunter getting embroiled in an incredible war of mind games played by the most evil human being who ever lived.   The story has a very intense and realistic feeling to it, one that you'll be hard pressed to shake from.  I was not blown away by this book, but it did something I've never felt before in a book; it took me out of the story.  It didn't take me out far, it was more along the lines of a suspenseful movie.  Dr. G, the author, writes a fascinating book and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.  Unfortunately, for the movie I can't give it five stars, as the film doesn't live up to the book in that respect, even the characters didn't stand out much.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ "Dirty Harry" was the first film I ever saw that not only told me what I had already figured out but also how I could actually go out and get some real revenge on a guy who was a real threat to me. My first thought when the film starts off is: "Oh great! Somebody's finally trying to do something about this asshole." You know, there was a guy named Tom Cruise who was the lead in this movie. We can probably count him among the most prominent people who are still actively doing business. I didn't know who this guy was, but he was the guy who got me into drugs. You see, I lived in New York City when this movie came out. I had just graduated from Columbia University. I was twenty-two years old, living with my parents. My mom was my primary bread winner. When I came into my first job, she sent me out to buy some weed. I'd never bought weed before, and I wanted to figure out how much it would cost. I went to a friend's house. He bought it for me. It was dope, man. It had a huge bouquet of flowers. My dad smoked it, and he liked it. He liked to smoke it and talk about it. I felt bad that I was not really enjoying it, but I didn and didn't like it. So I brought some back home with me, because I figured I had a couple of friends who would like it a lot. The guy I bought it from, he gave me a little joint and told me to do whatever. And he said, "Just do what you want, you're a young man and you're going to get high, don't give a damn what anybody thinks of it." And I went out and bought some weed, and then I got a job at the mall. I got fired from that job because I was using. That's when I first really decided I was an addict. So the next thing I knew, I was coming home from the mall, having a couple beers. It's the late '80s, New York is really hot. This guy, Tony Montana, he's working at this mall and he just goes out and picks up these young dudes and tells them to go out to the parking lot and do whatever they want. So these kids were just having a great time. They were all in high school, and the last time I talked to them they were just about

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I've never really been a fan of superhero movies because it's kind of like the biggest waste of time. But I saw this and it's ok, I mean it's still a superhero movie, it's got action and good fight scenes and even has a very nice song that gets stuck in your head after a while. The movie does feel like a big superhero movie as all the people onscreen are in some way super powered, there is always a fight going on with the good guys. The action is ok, but the story is the thing I remember the most. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite a good, if not original movie. You get the feel of a '40s-type, hard-bitten, cynical detective who knows that the system is rotten and just wants to get to the bottom of it. But he's not interested in any of that. You feel that he just wants the bad guys, but that you don't like him that way. He's not an idiot. He knows the system. He just wants justice. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you liked the film (especially the detective) you should try the book. If the book is just as good as the film, you will love both. I am a sucker for both. The book, by Mark Z. Danielewski (of The Hunger Games fame), is also pretty good. I would recommend it if you are looking for an idea of what the next two movies in the series would be like. If not, I recommend trying the book first. I did not like the book and so have given it only three stars. It is a good read, but it is more interesting and better written than the film. 3.6/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ "One of the most memorable films I've seen in a very long time. Great acting, good performances, and the movie is so damn funny. There are a lot of things I don't like about this movie, but I just couldn't stop laughing. I've been wanting to see this for some time." —E.M.   1. _______________ (2001) Directed by __________ and starring ____________.  This is a great remake of a French film of the same name, but it is a remake, not a remake. And because it is so much more than a remake of the French movie, this is a movie that is much more special than its French counterpart. While this is not an absolute classic, it is one of the great movies of the 21st century. And as long as you are going to pick a great movie based on a film of French origin, this might just be the one.   Heavily influenced by Monty Python, the film centers around a young man named John (Ryan Reynolds) and his girlfriend (Annie Mumolo) who get caught up in a gang of drug dealers. But, John's girlfriend also happens to be an undercover cop. So the gang's leader, Mr. _______, takes an interest in John's young girlfriend and begins to manipulate John into getting involved with his gang. John's parents are not happy about this arrangement, and they set off on a road trip to stop John's father from getting the gang killed, which John's mother happens to see on the TV.   The story begins in the small town of ______, Texas. We meet the town's resident _________ (Cameron Diaz), a prostitute who helps the police find the dealers who are committing all the crimes. Her involvement in the drug trade also means she is a drug dealer herself. She runs an "entertainment" show out of her bar in town called ___________, but is being threatened by a rival called ________________ (Ed Norton) because of her prostitution. Because of her relationship with ________________, she and the police get involved in the case, and eventually end up fighting on a beach near the city of ______.

As it turns out, one of them is Jesus and so they start trying to take him down and they run into this super handsome guy that has a tattoo too and this super sexy woman that is with them. It was a fun time and was one that I would recommend to people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cannibal Holocaust  is a fun, unique and bloody film that is a perfect mix between gore and comedy.  While the film's premise is far fetched and its execution is somewhat poor, its characters and situations are entertaining and creative. The film is all about the  human sacrifice. In the movie the main characters of  Cannibalism  (which are all cannibal cannibals) kill people who have just given up. This is the most popular thing to do in North Korea and people are killed in public as a form of entertainment. This causes quite a few people to go crazy and commit suicide. The movie's ending is not very satisfying as it shows the main character (the protagonist) killing his wife, which just shows what a pathetic human being he is. I suppose this is what happens when a world leader commits suicide, which is a story I find very interesting and sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I have to pick my favorite horror movie, it has to be this one. I always wanted to see this movie when it was released, but I had trouble finding a rental store near me (until now), so I decided to wait until the midnight showings of it at the Cineplex in Toronto. I was lucky to see it there when it came out in a sneak preview at midnight. I'm a horror lover, and I wanted to be scared, but when I finally saw this movie I had no idea what was going on. The whole film was so strange that I started to wonder if the movie was made by a lunatic. But it was the most frightening thing I have seen in a long time. This movie is scary not only because of the acting, but because of how it makes you feel. It makes you nervous and afraid. When I came home I started watching the movie again, and it still terrified me and made me jump. I had to find a way to share this with all of you. So here I am, sharing this movie with you. I hope it was worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" is an oft-quoted maxim that many moviegoers follow. A film, therefore, that is considered a classic is often criticized as "too sophisticated for its time" or, at the very least, "not entertaining enough." It is a very difficult thing to be a part of that generation. For me, one of the many highlights of my adult life was watching this film. I can't even begin to describe the impact the film had on me and others around me when it first came out. It's a film that not only captured a moment in time, but an idea that has remained with me since. The story begins in 1951, in an Italian town called Aix-en-Provence (which you can check out on Wikipedia). A young family is fleeing from an American bombing raid that killed their entire family. As they cross the border, they're met with a group of German soldiers, who promptly arrest them. The father of the young boy in question decides that it's time to get to the bottom of the bombing, and decides to take the young man with him. Unfortunately, the child is a member of the Nazi party. The Nazis are impressed by his physical endurance and cunning, and decide to keep him on as a personal bodyguard for their leader. However, the boy is not a complete moron. He has studied the works of Goethe, and is a fan of the German composer. He is also a good-looking boy, and the Nazis have the boy's mother, his sister, and their mother's friend as their "pets" to "play with." The Nazi leader, named Goebbels, has been appointed Führer of Germany. As a part-time farmer and carpenter, he is just beginning to grasp the power that his position grants him. A few weeks ago, he and his wife were watching a movie called "Adolf", in which Goethe's character is introduced. The Nazi leader was taken in by the film's melodramatic plot and melodrama, and immediately began to consider himself the greatest writer in the world. He was, and still is, quite proud of the film, and continues to show his appreciation for the film by writing letters to Goethe. The Goebblers are also planning to get married in the near future. He decides to have his young friend, whose family is from the area

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The film's title could be seen as "The Secret", the movie is a bit of a mystery. The movie is about a young man who has a bad day. He's late to work and his girlfriend has gone to a concert. He gets home and he and his mother watch a bad movie with him and his mom. That's when the movie takes a turn for the worst. There's a sequence where the son of the woman who was watching the bad movie starts having sex with his mother. The son starts to make a pass at his mother and she starts to choke and gush blood. Then there's a weird scene where he starts to lick the blood off her. There are a lot of sexual elements in this movie and they are very dark. It is very strange, the mother's blood and her son's sexual encounter are the most powerful images in this film. But in a good way! The film has a great script and it's just a lot to take in and process. The actors are all really good. The only problem I have is the soundtrack. I didn't really like the movie. I'd say it was a fun little comedy with a lot going on but if you are a horror fan or if you like the suspense genre you should look for it because the film is very funny. If you love comedies or you love horror you should check this movie out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Here's another one that I feel was definitely a hit with fans of the manga, though I was not too fond of it. It was a very enjoyable ride, it was not only interesting to see the world in which it took place, it also had a good mix of comedy, drama, and action scenes that just had a very nice flow to it. I think that this movie did a great job in the world it created, from the main characters who all felt very distinct and memorable, to the way in which they were all designed and made to look like they were from a different world. This also made them feel more real, rather than just having them look like a bunch of generic fantasy creatures.   In this world, there are five races, who each have their own individual style of art, history, and culture. I really enjoyed the look of the cultures and the way they were drawn. The history in this movie was very well written, as I think all of the history presented to us was very thought out. I also loved how the magic in the movie was portrayed. It never felt like magic as we know it to be in our modern day lives, but as this world always has, and in fact is, there were elements of magic present in the past. The story of the movie has a really good flow, I really loved the way that it all played out. For the most part, the story was not all that great, there weren't too many things that were truly amazing about it, but overall, it did a really great job at telling the story it did, it just did not really have that many good things about it. Overall, I thought it was a good way to get into the world that is the world of Kuroko's Basketball, which is not to say that it does not have it's flaws, but in general, I do think it is a really fun movie to watch.  All in all, this was a fun movie. The premise of this movie does indeed have its faults, but I think it made up for them in it's positives. The world created was interesting and I really liked the designs of the characters in the story. Overall it did well in what it was trying to do. It just didn't do as well in many things as I had hoped it would. But it is still a fun watch, and for those fans of Kurokocop, I recommend that you check it out!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This movie is the epitome of my taste. I'm not one to give anything 5 stars, but I will say, after watching this movie, I will be buying this movie more than ever before. The action scenes are so freaking good. The plot is pretty simple. You have an evil government trying to do the exact opposite of what they want to do and get revenge for an evil man who took over their government. The best part about the plot is the little character interactions. They all have very small parts, but they are always well executed. I would have loved to see more of the other characters, especially the bad guy, and I think that could have been very cool. The cast is really good, and they have some really cool voices. I had the privilege of seeing this movie on a big screen. The sound was so good it made me tear up a little. I hope I see this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Room  is a hilarious film about a man who is trying to get out of a hospital and finds himself trapped there. The film is a perfect example of how comedy films need to keep a good balance between satire and genuine moments. It's one of those movies where you just want to laugh to the point of tears, with hilarious scenes, that have the potential to become some of the funniest films of all time. It makes me laugh every single time, even when the script can't be that good. The performances are all very strong, the film doesn't need to do much for the audience to be amused, it just needs to be there to keep them laughing. The only downside is the length, the movie takes way to long to explain how everyone got trapped, but the film does an amazing job of making you want to see more of the story. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!  This was an absolutely delightful time. It's funny, smart, and a bit emotional. I was just sitting in a park in front of the library. As I was taking a nice, slow, breath, the film started and the laughter began. At first, it was just the two of us but it didn't take too long for the whole family to join in and it was fun to have the whole neighborhood there. So here we are.   The plot starts off with a couple that goes off to live with their uncle and aunt. He's a rich lawyer and she's a housewife who is working part time. But the uncle/aunt doesn't seem to like them and the two are not getting along. One night as they are walking to their house, a man comes up and is very nice to them and offers them a job. A few days later they go to his office for an interview. The only problem is that he has an important meeting the next day with the president. He knows he can't tell them anything about it. But he'll do his best and hope they'll be willing to come.   the couple decides to stay.   for some reason, we get a little bit of a story about their family and the things they do. When the two return home, they find out that a big fire had destroyed their house. They are a bit mad at the new man and the family is a little upset because their parents are being taken away. The two of them decide to find out why. That's when they find that the new boss is also the son of the guy who hired them. He didn't know what he was getting himself into and so they end up working with the son and the father. This is where the movie really starts to get interesting.  .  The film starts out with a very funny scene where the father gives his son some money. The son gives it to his father and then the dad realizes he should have never given the money to his son. So his son gives him some money and the money ends up in the son's pocket. When he tries to retrieve it, the son tells him to stay away. So that was all fine. Then the father realizes that he gave the money away. He apologizes to the son for not looking after his money and tells him that it'll be okay. They try to work out their problems. The mother makes the new uncle an offer and the uncle thinks

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ This is a great movie. I loved the film as a kid and really like the idea behind it now. I have never seen a movie quite like it before. The cast is all excellent. My favorite of the cast is Terence Stamp who played the kid. He has a great part, and I think he got the part because he was the youngest. The best actor of the bunch is James Caan. I had no idea who he was, but I do now. He is a bit of a shock in the film. He was so good that I had to look up him and see what his real name was. I'm not sure if that's true or not. His part was probably his best. Another terrific cast is played by Michael Dorn who was in the second Harry Potter movie as a ghost, and Paul Newman who is in it as the father. I would rate this as an 8. This is one of those films I have seen many times, but never really really understood it. The acting was top notch, and the story was great. I always liked the films of Peter Hyams, and this was one of his best movies.

The world needs a film like this, it would really go a long way in breaking the stigma surrounding female empowerment, and showing that women can be just as strong, smart and talented as men, and be loved by their partner. Thanks to everyone involved in making this film a reality and making it an emotional journey, which I'm sure will be seen by many a person who has never thought of themselves as a strong female character. -Rona, US

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********" I went to this movie as a last minute alternative to a bad movie, because my family was going away to my parents for a week. I went alone. I thought it was really good. The movie was very good, it made me laugh a lot, and the comedy was not as bad as I had been led to believe. It is well made and I recommend it. I did not watch it at first because I was scared to see the violence but the violence was very few, and very bad. I would say it was a bit scary in a "you know what" kind of way. It was really funny as well. Overall the movie was well made, it was not bad, and I would recommend it to anyone, I would even recommend it if you are sick of violent movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Airbender is the only animated series that I have watched so far that I find enjoyable. I loved how the art and animation came together, and I think it is one of the best animated shows of all time. I found the story enjoyable and the action and humor always made me smile. The only issue is that the movie did not come out until the 2nd season, which may make the show a little harder to watch now that there is no story. I would highly recommend watching the original TV series if you enjoy anything animated, and if you are an Avatar fan this is a must have.

The story is fantastic and the performances were great. I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is, in my opinion, the greatest film to have been made so far, with a cast of characters and a story that have a sense of wonder and mystery, all mixed in with great dialogue, a well-written script, and the music, of which the music is superb. Even if you haven't seen the film or don't know much about it, I think you would enjoy it. It's a great film to take the family and have a fun time with. The dialogue is perfect, and it's one of the best "what if" films I've seen. It was one of my favorite movies of all time, and I'm glad I got to see it, so I could review it. Watch this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you know that in the middle of a movie, a bad movie can sometimes have the perfect amount of badness? If you're watching a bad film, you've almost got to hope for the best. I love watching bad movies. I always do. I even watch my favorite bad movies with a smile. They're so bad, in fact, that it becomes fun. It's so bad that it might actually be fun. So when I saw "The Last Airbender" and I saw the poster for this movie, I knew it was a bad bad movie. I wanted to see this movie and that's why I was happy to see it. The film has a lot of problems and I'm not going to pretend that they're not there. But if you are going to see a movie that I've written an article about, it's a movie I'm going to give you the opportunity to see. _________  What you won't like: ________________  Plot Summary:  When his father dies, young prince Zaheer (Travis Fimmel) is sent to the Southern Water Tribe as an apprentice to Aang (voice of Henry Winkler). After failing to impress the wise old man, Zahe, under orders of his uncle, decides to take up a life of crime. He quickly becomes a wanted man and ends up in the hands of the ruthless Fire Lord Ozai (Dean-David Bringman) and his thugs. After meeting the waterbenders, however, Zahee is forced to fight his former masters and the Fire Lord. The waterbending spirit, Vaatu (Michael Dante DiMartino), appears in the form of a beautiful, fiery woman.

I've seen a few movies with ghosts in them, some are pretty good and some are really bad, but this one has some good ghosts.        This movie, a little over 90 minutes long, has three people that go to a funeral, and some other people that have come and gone through the day before, but only the third person who will get to see the funeral and get the chance to see a ghost.  If you enjoy long story s and think it would be fun to see what a ghost would be like if we could see what they are thinking, then this is a good place to check out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a well-acted movie with a terrific soundtrack.  You get to see all the main characters in action, and the script has a lot of depth.  My favorite character:  When you first see the main character, your mind is already made up as to what you are going to think of him.  But it is really more about his relationship to the other characters.  The character is actually quite complex and interesting.  He is a "loner" and a "dope" in many ways.   The best part about the movie: Well, the acting is stellar.  There is no way a movie like this could have been made in the 1950's.  And it is well-written, with a great soundtrack.    A good movie and a great watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _____________ It's not much to write about, it's just an old-fashioned adventure movie (actually the first of a number, as the second one was just released). But that's the charm, because if you have one problem in life, this one should be it, and the movie manages to make you laugh until your heart is pounding in your chest. I haven't seen a movie that's made me laugh so hard in such a short amount of time. It's like a dream, where you don't really realize how much time has passed. And then after a while it starts to dawn on you that you have been dreaming all these years. And it's one of the best movies of the year, for me at least. ____________ ________ _______ It started out as a big dream and quickly became a nightmare.  ______________ _______________________ "I'm a big fan of the genre; I watch a lot of old movies, read a lot about them, and even sometimes study them. But even as an academic, I'd never seen anything like it." - Jeff VanderMeer I read this one as a pre-teen, it was one of those books that my dad would bring me to every now and then to make me laugh out loud.  I remember being really surprised by how much this movie was able to make my eyes light up, and I remember the first time I saw it. I was a kid, I really did have to convince my parents to let me see this movie. But I'll tell you one thing, I was hooked and I would watch it over and over again.  "The main characters are played by the two actors (Barry Bostwick and Catherine Deneuve) who are probably better known as the characters in the Twilight films. I thought the acting was really top-notch." - Robert Krulwich "This is one of my favorite films ever. This is the story of a boy who is living in a small village, the locals are all too happy to make fun of him for his unusual hair and clothes, but he doesn't let it bother him, he just goes out to his small village to be with his friends and play games, while his parents go to work. This story is really sad, but there's a real sense of humor in this movie, in the way that you realize that what's happening isn't the real deal.

The acting is fantastic, they really use every part of their body and you feel like you can trust them to do something as important as survive in this cold and unforgiving world. The soundtrack was great, it was great to hear some of these famous songs played in the movie. I only gave this movie 3 stars, I really enjoyed it but it was the best film about space in a while, so I'm giving it 2 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2018) Is an entertaining science-fiction film that is not for everyone. It is certainly not for anyone that does not like space opera, as the story is too long and drawn out. If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick, this is not it. The story is nothing new and has been seen many times in the genre, the characters are generic and the animation is average. There are some great moments in the film, especially when we first see the A.Is in action and we see the effects they have on people. But most of the time the movie is not very good. A lot of it is filler from other movies like Terminator Salvation (2015) and The Terminator (1984). Also, this movie has very weak characterizations, the main characters are not very complex and not very believable. The characters in the movie are more like cardboard cutouts than living, feeling beings. A.M.I.'s action scenes are also boring, as they focus on getting the main character out of danger rather than making you feel for the characters. Overall, this sci-fiction movie is worth watching if you like space-opera and you are not a fan of sci- fi. Watch it to have a good laugh, but don't watch it if you do not like action and you do want to be entertained by a space- opera movie.

It is nice to see how many of those characters still exist in the movie but there are others who have been added and have little to no dialogue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great little romantic comedy from the director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. What I like about this movie is that while it has a lot of romantic, fun and romantic moments, at its core, it is really about the bonds between people.  What is great about these bonds is that they are not in any way romantic or superficial, they are really about friendship. And so, when an old couple moves into the house next door and have to make new friends, we see their friendship grow by the second.   The movie makes us realize the great love and care that they have for one another and how much it will mean to them later on.   This movie was made in the 90s and it feels very appropriate today to get a nostalgia rush from seeing it with someone from your childhood. There are even some scenes that are in my opinion reminiscent of the first movie of the series.   But it was not the movie itself but the message behind it that made me think about it.   In many ways, this movie was just a reminder to us all that friendships are very much worth fighting for, no matter how hard they might seem at the time.  It made me realize that friendships matter a great deal and they matter in more ways than just making people feel good about themselves. And you know what? I feel great about the new life that I will have once this film is finished and I can spend the time with my new friends. This was a very romantic movie that brought me back to the days when I first started to discover romantic comedies as an adult.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only thing better than a great movie is a great story.   - Sean O'Neal  Great Movie, Great Story, Great Picture... This is a very good movie, about a young boy, who has the potential to be the greatest. He is not allowed to show that, because he is a Jehovah's Witness, and he is not even allowed to talk to the other children about it. He lives with his sister and his uncle, he has nothing, he is constantly told not to do anything that would be considered a sin, like talking about God. I was shocked at how little he really knows, in a way, but what really got me was how he didn't know about his little sister. The way he talks to her is very much like an angry man, and they fight quite a bit. As I said before, I loved the movie, it was very funny, and I loved how the family's religious beliefs are never explained, and yet still they all seem very true to me, and you really get the feeling that all of them are very devout Jehovah's Witnesses. There is no question about it; this is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Sean O Neal

The DVD is more than two years old, and a movie that I've seen twice. And this DVD is not a Disney film. It's a low-budget, foreign production. If it were, then it would be more like this. (Photo: WENN)  The DVD for the big-budget fantasy-adventure Gods of Egypt is out now, and that's good news for people who want to watch the film without having to shell out the $75 for the film's two discs. The film is set for a U.S. release Friday and will likely have a strong showing at the box office.  But the lack of new images of director Alex Proyas and stars Gerard Butler and Sarah Silverman is just a small disappointment for die-hard fans of the film. In fact, this DVD release comes on the heels of a massive rerelease, where the original theatrical version of Gods of Earth and Sky was offered up for $70 more than the standard edition.  "I'm a fan," said Proyus. "I thought I was going to be a fan for a long time and when I saw the box set, I thought, 'This is great!'"

I mean it's great to look at, it makes you think, but the film, and this film is the kind of film that can only be made by two people to make a film that I like. It's a bit like 'The Goonies', that kind of a film. It is pretty, but there's a definite lack of something. It would be a good film to have with you, on a quiet night, but I doubt you'd find yourself humming along with the tune when you are really watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  The script was fine. The movie was a bit stiff, but I was too into it to notice. There was only one scene that I found to be awkward (the love-making sequence) but it was so out of place that it didn't bother me much. I suppose I was more disturbed that some of the characters, like the school principal (the most irritating person in the movie) were presented as comic relief, rather than people you really wanted to know. All in all, it's not the best film of the year, but you can't be too critical of a movie that doesn't actually suck, can you? _________  Hilarious! I think it's probably one of the best horror movies out there. The acting is good, the movie is funny, the direction is great and the effects are quite amazing, especially the zombies. Even though it may not be one of my favorites, I'll definitely be watching this again in a few years. __________  BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! I was just walking up the hill on my lunch break and had to come back home, so I was kind of bummed about the fact that I had to wait to watch it, but this movie was amazing. There were moments when you really thought it was going to be a one-note horror movie, and the best part is when the killer gets caught in the shower and is shot and then he dies in the water. This movie is so good and makes you feel so bad for the poor guy, but not in a depressing way. The scene with the girl at the lake with the killer was so good, you just wanna laugh and scream and cry with her. I would have to say that this is one of those movies that you watch once. Then you see it again, and again, to try and figure out what's going on. It's so good. The ending is a bit confusing and the ending of the movie itself is very confusing, but all of the other things were just amazing, I just loved this movie. This is definitely a must-see for every horror fan out there and if you like scary movies at all, this is a must see! _______________  I saw this movie a couple of times and it is amazing. It is funny and it's definitely one of The Ten Best Horror Movies. The character's have very interesting and different personalities. I am not going to spoil anything, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Wanted" is a great movie! It is the story of a man who has a "disability" which he takes to be his disability. He takes a job working in a factory, and being a "worker" is never a good thing. The story of the man trying to survive his situation as a "working" handicapped man is a really hard and dark story, and the movie is very emotional at some point! My only criticism is that the movie seems to be shot with the best possible camera equipment that can be bought, and so is it an "in your face" movie? You have to watch the whole movie though, because it is a good, depressing, depressing movie, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Amazing The first hour of this film is so intense you want to scream at the screen. The acting is great as does the editing and the story is so clever. This movie is about a person (in this case a person who is obsessed with the life of the dead) who is convinced that he is the reincarnation of a murdered girl and goes into a whole mess of trouble trying to prove that. This film has a brilliant opening as an innocent young man is murdered while walking with his girlfriend and then comes back in the next life as a man of the family with a vengeance. The director used the story so well that the ending left no question as to what would happen next. This was a fantastic film that was worth it.  Thank you, Renny. (I really appreciate it, too.)  I think we've all had those people who think they're special. If you haven't, you will. I know I have. I love to have people think I'm special. Maybe you're special too. So here's a little secret. I'm not special, and that's okay. I was made this way. You are made the way you are. You aren't the only one like you. And we're not the only ones with your personality either. Just remember that.  the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ I'm not gonna lie to you. This movie is not good. The story starts off with a nice twist but, after watching, I thought it was just a joke. I found it hard to believe that people could actually fall in love. There was so much that went wrong in this movie. The writing was horrible and the cinematography was awful. There were so many times where the actors were talking to the audience and not to the characters. A lot of this movie was just talking. The sound effects were not believable either. And I'm no expert, but the acting just was so horrible. There weren't any funny scenes in this flick and most of the actors had a very flat delivery. There wasn't a single person that stood out in this terrible movie. There are a lot of actors that made a big name for themselves on shows like "Lost" that were not in this film. It just seemed like most of them couldn't act. The only reason this movie didn't get a 1 star was because the plot was interesting and I thought that if the characters were more interesting I'd be more entertained. However, that was all I needed to make me give this movie a 2 star review.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  When I saw the trailer for a movie called "Lion", I knew that it would be pretty great. But I never expected it to be like it was...It's a modern day "Django Unchained" with lion attacks! And in the end, it actually wasn't bad. But it is kind of a shame because it's actually better than I expected! The production quality was on point. The acting was spot on! The cinematography was beautiful! But it wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy it. The story itself is a bit strange, but it wasn' t the only thing I enjoyed about the film. The other two things I liked were that it had the same style that "Bourne Identity" had. It had the modernized set design. And the music was very fitting for the movie. The best part about the soundtrack was the score by Hans Zimmer! So many great actors were in the film, and most of them were fantastic! They really brought the story and the plot to life. But of course, the performances are what made it great! And that's why I like it! The cast was great, and all the actors were able to bring a lot of emotion to each scene! Especially the lead. Tom Hardy brings a lot to the film! He is the main character. He is smart, tough, and determined! He makes a lot happen in the plot. And of course the movie's biggest bad guy, Leonardo DiCaprio! The movie has a bit of comedy in it, but overall it is serious and very intense! I really hope this film will be successful in the future! It was one of the best movies I saw at the summer festival! I think it could become a movie classic! And if you like action movies, and you're an action movie buff, "LION" is a must see! (But if you don't like action, then I don't think this film is for you!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two parts to "A Fistful of Dynamite" that will have your jaw dropping. For one, the "Dynamite" in the name of the series is not a typo, as "Dyno" was a popular nickname for the British Prime Minister (later President) Harold Macmillan in the 1930s, and when "Dyna" became an official name for the government, it was to avoid the negative connotation of the "M" that the "A" was known for. The second part, in which the title character's daughter goes on a date with her father, is simply an example of the type of jokes that the humorists in the British comedy group Monty Python used in the 1970s to satirize politics and to make fun of people who thought they were being clever when they said "I'm not a Nazi". (The film is set in the UK, but the comedy bits are not). "A Fistfull of Dynamites" is a good, funny movie that you will not regret watching, even if you are a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Review by James M. O'Connor, September 7, 2011 "Mysterious Island" is the name by which it is commonly known to foreigners in this country. It is an oddity that a movie about the mysterious island where the story is centered is directed by Michael Bay, the man who so famously made the Transformers films. "Sea Monsters of the Pacific," which is not really about Pacific Ocean creatures, is actually a film about man-eating aliens that have come to earth. In "Sea Monsters," a team of scientists is sent out to discover the aliens, but it turns out to be much more than they bargained for. They end up saving the planet, but not before some strange things happen, including a fight scene between Michael Bay and Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is one of the more entertaining fights of the year. I did not think that this would be the first time that a director who is regarded as a comedy genius, with his own special effects, had worked in a horror movie. The film is about a man and his family, who have a vacation in the remote Pacific Ocean island, where there are giant sea monsters roaming the place. There are also a few strange happenings as well. While the film itself is a comedy, it does have some disturbing scenes that do not have the same sense of humor

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I would give this movie 8 stars if I could but I can't because it is so fucking bad. It is supposed to be about an old woman who is dying and in the process of dying she meets a man who is the only one that she is capable of falling in love with. I love old women and when I read that this is a very old woman and her husband that she would meet the man of her dreams I thought that it would be an amazing movie. Then it turns out she is going to die in two days and when she does this man does not even come to visit. It turns out that she was the best thing that ever happened to the old woman. When I read this I laughed my ass off thinking this was going to be a great movie. I thought I would like the character of old woman very much but after seeing this I feel that she had a bad case of dementia. The fact that she met a guy is not important. What is important is that she fell in love and had him to keep her alive while she was dying. That is the real story that this movie is trying to tell. The movie is not funny at all, there is no jokes and the story is very boring.

But what I really like is the music. There are some good songs in this movie, and the music is really really good! It's a bit slow, but it is perfect for the time period it was made. I really love this song, the one for the end. The only thing I don't like is that I think the girl that is playing the piano is too skinny. I wish that she would have been a bit larger. So, I don�t like it too much, but I really think that this movie is really great.

The film does a good job in capturing the essence of the world we live in.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ You just have to see this movie because it is the most brilliant comedy ever made. Not only because it was the first time we see a comedy like this but because of its message. This movie is absolutely ridiculous. It shows how the world of modern western media would be if the entire US and the rest of the world was run by a man named Bill Hicks who just likes to make movies with words on them. But hey, who's to say that Bill Hicks doesn't have some kind of higher purpose behind all this? Who is to say Bill Hicks isn't a prophet? Who's to prove that he is not crazy? Who would want to believe that an insane person like Bill Hicks is the true God? Well, you would because that would mean that you've got to believe in God! Now you know why this movie is called the most profound movie ever. It's just such a beautiful movie, a hilarious movie, and it teaches us a great lesson in human history. If you want to know a great and funny movie, watch this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lets face it, most movies are crap. We spend a lot of money on movies, and it is always a lot for a mediocre movie.  When a movie is good enough to earn its price, it is a good value.  The movie is great!  A big budget movie, I expected some things to be a bit better.  But, I'm not giving it a negative review, because there were moments that made me smile, and I feel it was worth it.  There were also moments that showed the good writing skills of the cast.  Great cast for a really bad movie. I loved the character of David (David Tennant) He was my favorite character, he reminded me a bit of Harry Potter, even though he had to learn magic the hard way.  It is nice to see a really intelligent wizard, because it was a bit rare in the movies. There are scenes with a wizard in every movie. Also, the film was really well choreographed, and looked like it was shot with professional camera equipment.  Overall it was good, and a good way to spend a couple of dollars. Did I Like It? Yes I did!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic and a must see:  When one considers a movie like this one, one has to wonder how people have been able to create a culture so based on violence, where the people who make it are so much more violent than the people watching it, it has become almost a parody of itself. It is no wonder that this movie is so well known today.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Dear Cinephile, This is a great movie. The film has a nice pace to it, but I don't know if it has a "final" quality to it yet. I love how the character development feels very natural and believable, but the movie feels somewhat long and the ending is somewhat disappointing. I still feel like I've seen this movie several times and I really haven't come up with an ending that I like. That said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys horror movies. __________________________  Review by: Nick P. - March 30, 2010  It is hard to pinpoint a single feature in this film that is the best, but it is certainly the most entertaining. I think there are several. First, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the horrors that are going on in the town at the time. It has a sense of urgency and urgency is an important factor for good horror. Second, the soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of the movie. It is haunting and a bit unsettling, and I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a good, fun scary movie. _______________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ A couple of years ago, I got the chance to see a bunch of weird, creepy, awesome movies that I'd never heard of before. These were The Room, Creepshow, It Follows, and I Saw the Devil. The Room is my favorite; the first time I saw it, I was shocked and scared and it was the most bizarre, most disturbing movie I'd ever seen. If you like horror or have seen it before, you should definitely see The Room. I Saw The Devil is more of a slasher movie than The Room because the killer in It Followed is clearly more human than the one in Room. Creepshow is a good way to introduce people to weird movies; it's a slender tale, but the actors are good, the costumes are creepy, and there's some really neat visuals. I also like to think of this list as a "favorites list". So, I decided to make an all-inclusive list of movies to watch if you have an hour to kill. I've included the rating, which is what I think makes it a fun experience. The first and the last films on this list are by far my favorite horror movies. My two favorite films are It Followes and The Witch. They are so creepy and the ending was so creepy that I felt like I was in a horror movie for a while. In the end, the list is pretty long. It may seem kind of long, but after watching the movies, I realized that I've watched a lot of weird films and I've loved them. I'd really appreciate any feedback you can provide.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I just watched it last night and thought it was a great film. The acting was really good, and the cinematography was amazing. The script is actually very well written. This could have been one of the greatest movies of all time, but the ending was not the greatest. I thought the ending of the movie was not quite fitting. I mean I understand that the whole story is about a man who just lost his job, and is so mad he wants to die and just go home and not to worry about it, and just sit around and watch TV. But the guy is so depressed, that he does it and it ends up with the police and doctors having to save him. Well if that is not a sign of depression than I don't know what is. So I was kind of shocked that the ending did not make more sense. And I also did not like the fact that the police officer says "it was just a matter of time" and then the police are not allowed to help him. I feel like that was unnecessary. I was not happy that they could not help him because I think he did not deserve to die. Maybe I am wrong on that, but it just was not my cup of tea, especially when there were so many good scenes. So this movie is not really for everyone. If you like this type of story, then you will love this movie. You will also like the movie. If not you will still like the film. If this movie made you feel something it will have to do with the ending. I know it may not be for everyone but I really wanted it to be so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhat "slightly" "somewhat-slightly different" was how I described " The World's End " to one of my parents this summer. I'm no stranger to a lot of the clichés about movies. I have no problem with the "glorifying the monster" movie. I've seen them all, as far as I know. What I don't like is the "I could watch this movie for the first time today" movie; which is why I'm not exactly sure why I wanted to see "The World'sEnd" at all. I mean, I'm sure there's some movie I could have watched in my lifetime that I should have seen earlier, but that's an unfair comparison, since I never watched the film. I'd be willing to admit that. What happened to all the old-fashioned "sadly, I didn't get to see this when I was younger and I feel a pang of regret when I recall it" films? "The Man Who Would Be King," "The King's Speech," "Shakespeare in Love," "It's a Wonderful Life," etc. I grew up with them, and they still resonate. Even "The Truman Show", which isn't exactly the most sentimental film ever made, has something in it that really sticks. I'll admit that my first viewing was a little rough, but then, I have a few times in my life when I go back to a movie that I missed as a kid. It's just that I feel the film was rushed and there was no real effort to make the movie interesting. And that's not something I'm accustomed to from the director of "The Ring," either. If "The Towering Inferno" is a bad movie, and "The Wicker Man" was an even worse movie, then "The Wall" has a good chance at being the worst movie I've ever seen. But it's not. "The Stand" was a big deal back then and it's become even more so in the past few years. But the story was good and there were some great performances. But what made "The Watchtower" and "Wall" so special was that they weren't just two sides of the same coin. Both were more like an alternate universe that, while seemingly very different, had similarities. If "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and the "Star Wars" prequels are good examples, then what
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember my mother was a regular moviegoer in her teenage years. She watched a lot of movies, a lot. She loved 'The Sound of Music' and 'My Fair Lady.' I'm still a big fan of both of those movies. I've watched 'The Notebook' once in the theater but I've yet to see it on video. But I definitely want to check it out sometime.  I'd say the writing on this movie is above average for a teen comedy. It was funny and fun to watch, especially for me. There were a few times when the movie got stuck for me, but thankfully, by the time the end came around, I was having a good time and not really paying attention to it.       There were a couple of things that stuck out to me during the movie. The first was that the kids in the movie seemed to be a lot more mature than they are in real life. I think it is probably because most of them have the same parents who raise them like that, so they understand the consequences of acting that way. For example, there's one scene in which the girls who live in a trailer park act like they are getting away with something, but they do not act that way in real world. They get caught in an awkward situation, which I believe would cause a lot less trouble in real reality.     The other thing I found to be amusing was the fact that I was watching this on DVD at home with a roommate, and she commented on a number of times that the movie was the 'craziest' she's seen. I thought it was hilarious, but it's also the reason I decided to see the movie again.   The movie was very well done. I liked the fact it was not too dark or over-the-top, but still had some lightness to it and was a light comedy that worked. I'd love to see a movie in which all the girls have the exact same personality. I just wish I could be as mature as those girls!

But we have the luxury of being born in a civilized society where our parents have money and can educate our children properly. It is sad that the majority of children in America live in poor, violent, violent neighborhoods. The American people should demand better schools and an end to violence. And, if you think that violence is acceptable in some small areas, you need to read the book by James Howard Kunstler, "The Long Emergency". That book has something to say about America. I love America and I want all the good things it has to offer, but it has problems.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* My father had one of these on the deck in the family home when I was a young boy. A couple of the other kids would always come over to play and I would sit and watch them. He must have been about ten years old when it was built and the water from a storm that hit it while he was there must have washed it all down the drain into a creek that went to the river and over to his father's home down by the river. It would be lying on the creek bank today. The other kids, being teenagers, used it as a swimming hole. In the 1960's the bridge was still in good condition. I got to drive it once with my father who had it installed. I drove from his home in Oakley to town in his old truck. The road was clear and the bridge still had the lights on it. I had no trouble getting over it and as I climbed out of the truck, I got a good look at the structure. I was impressed with how well it had stood up to the wind and weather. The bridge had three decks and it was wide enough for a boat to come through. My father would get me off his back and we would head up to Lake Waukesha on the Wisconsin side to go fishing. I have many memories of the bridge and I always thought about it when I started to get older. The first time I ever saw it was in the movies when I watched "Downtown Abbey". I was always amazed when I saw it in movies. It was beautiful then and it still is now. It really is a special piece of architecture that deserves to be cherished. A good movie can make you forget all about the bad times.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ A lot of you will be happy to hear that the sequel to the smash hit "The Hobbit" is in production now! If you enjoyed the first movie, you are going to love this! I went in to see "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" before I went to see the movie. I was in a trance, and when the movie finally started I couldn't help but think "wow this is amazing! The characters are all so believable! There are so many different and interesting things going on! I can't wait to see what the director has in store next!" Now, that may not be a compliment, but to me this movie feels like a sequel to "The Return of the King". And as a fantasy fan who's read the book, I can tell you, it is just as good and just as enjoyable! So here is the review of the sequel: If you enjoy fantasy and you like to be amazed then this is going to be the movie for you! "The Fellowship of The Ring" is a wonderful fantasy story, but there is a problem. One of the most important characters in the movie is a character that you would never think about. He is played by the wonderful, wonderful John Bell. In my opinion, he is the greatest movie star in the world! John Bell is an American actor best known for playing the role of Jack Kirby in the Marvel Superhero series. Since then, he has gone on to become one of the top talents in Hollywood. And you have no idea what he is capable of doing on screen! This is the movie where he is going on a quest to fight off the evil forces that threaten the world. After seeing the movie I was reminded of the first part of the movie, but with the added bonus of a little more story! The movie takes place in a world that is similar to our own, but a little different. This world has a monarchy called The Council of Elrond, that is the ruling body. The King and Queen of the country that is The Shire live in the town called Rivendell, and have a strong connection to the land, to the people, and to the animals that are there. There are a few of the people that live in Elronde that live an isolated lifestyle and don't know much about the world beyond the town. One such person is a young woman named Celeborn, who is the daughter of a nobleman from Rivendel

The performances were phenomenal as well, and the story was well written, but the best part was that the film never felt like it was a throw away, cheesy, or cheap film, and that it really felt like a piece of art. The ending made a huge impact on me as well.

I found the movie to be beautiful in the way that the movie is in terms of both art design and its cinematography, although at times it does start to get a bit stale. It is a movie that has a very unique style that allows it to be quite interesting, especially in the cinematography. The movie is not a very big one, and it does not have many songs, but it manages to make up for it with a lot of other things. The actors in this movie really give a really unique character to each one of them and it makes them very fun to watch as well. The cinematography is really good in the movie and the visuals and lighting are really cool. There are many moments where the cinematographic shots in this film are so beautiful that you can't help but to want to keep them in your mind to look at them again for a long time.

I think that there are songs that are quite popular amongst people who like to watch movies, and I am one of those people. I like this movie so much, because it is quite a different kind of movie, and this is what I like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby  is a brilliant film, and the best of the post-War period.  It's set in the American South during the roaring 20's and shows how the upper and middle classes were just beginning to make their way out of the depression and into the new world.  The film is the story of a young man who moves back to New York City with his family from the countryside, after losing his job at the Gatsbys' bank.   The family is a well-off family from New York, but not one with a lot of money and luxury.  The father is a banker who runs a large firm in Harlem.  His wife and daughter have gone to live in the country and are married, but are still relatively poor.    After the move, the young man becomes a successful attorney and a social climber, until he is thrown out of a party for his social skills because he is the son of the bank president.  There is an odd, tragic quality to the story. The young man is a man of action.  He is a young boy with a dream of success and he follows it.    The Great G'sby is about a man who wants to go from being an elite lawyer to being a socialite in the 1920's.  What would that look like to a man in his late teens and early twenties?  I'd love to see a film like this.  I'm curious to see what would happen to GatsBY.  At times I felt like a bit of a bad guy (especially in the end) but the main character was a bit one-note.  We get a good look at a young GatsBdy and he is a fun character.  If you are interested in the film and don't mind a bit odd and tragic story, I recommend it. My rating:  -

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a gem. The film tells the story of two soldiers on the Western front during WW1.  Their mission is to kill German spies and prevent the Germans from reaching the British for supplies.  You are probably thinking "Who cares about a movie with spies, I don't know what war is like!"  And, you would be right.  The movie is an incredibly realistic portrayal of war that you will learn very little about and have no interest in reading about or hearing about.  This is just like any other war film that you have seen.  At one point you see a German soldier, who has killed a few people in the area (and there is no blood), and you think "He should be shot for being a traitor" and you start to pity him, but you realize that this is just how war is.  You hear from the Germans that a spy is being sent to the front, and you see him come through the door of a house with the Germans.   I think it is the only thing that is realistic about this movie.  War is terrible, and it does make its way into the film, but I found it to be the most interesting part of the movie. It is the first war film I have ever seen where I felt the horror of the war and understood that the soldier who got a bullet to the leg (it doesn't go in) had to stay back with his unit as they are needed elsewhere. I don' t know what else to say but this movie is amazing. My rating: 7/10 I did some research and I think this film will be a big hit at this year's Anime Expo (July 11-14) in Los Angeles.  Anime Expo is a convention that celebrates the best in Anime from around the world.  My friend and I were invited to attend Anime Expo and we are very excited to come and see what all the excitement is about.   I hope that the film will also make it to this year's Anime Expo so that you all will be able to see the film.

But there's a third and probably the hardest, the one most people don't even know is possible: find the best actor for the part. That guy can actually play the part! And if he can, then the rest becomes easy.  You don't have to be the best director in the world, or even a director at all. As a general rule, you don't want to direct. You want to work with people like yourself. You need a director who wants to get up in the morning and do what he does best. A director who likes to do what's right and who has no problem letting you be your own man. You won't make a perfect movie if you have a director that does not.   In Hollywood, the directors have to have the power to hire actors. They want a strong, well-established star. So they find the most promising actor they can find and they make him or her star. What does that get you? It gets you what you want.    What's the point of directing if you don' t have the star power to get it made?  But how do you get a star without the actor? Easy! The actor becomes the director's star! And once again, the power of the actor is what's supposed to get you the job.  The more the director relies on the actor, the more they need the actor. In turn, the actor will find more and more ways to make the director comfortable. And the more comfortable the director is, the easier the actor becomes. And once you have an actor who's comfortable making you comfortable, you have what you need.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was like that time we sat in the cinema and saw The Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That movie was a masterpiece, and when it came time for the end credits, you didn't need to wait too long before hearing that this movie was made just a little bit better. The special effects were great, the acting was awesome, and the plot was more than just okay. All of that being said, this movie did have the potential to be a masterpiece. It had great performances, great direction, and a great cast. It was a little more than okay. But when you have the right people doing the right things, sometimes the movie is still good. That's exactly what happened in this movie. The cast was great. We had our favorite actors, and we had our favorites actresses. And we had everyone who could have been the next Christopher Walken. This movie had plenty of people to be proud of. And the movie was still good enough to be entertaining. I'm giving this movie a B+. If this movie were a lot better, it would have been an A-. And if you know someone who might be interested, this is a great movie to show them. So watch it. It's not as good as Terminator: Salvation, but it's still good!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ [IMDB: 5.7/10] I found this film to be a great example of how to tell a story through music. I enjoyed all the different parts of the film, the story of these two women, the music they played and the characters they play. I thought it was a good film that I wanted to share with people. I do have some gripes with it, mainly in the ending but it was still fun to watch and if you like your story to be told through music then this one will be a good one.

The whole time it makes me think how much of a piece of shit most of us are. I can't believe how good this is!  Great March 21 (Mon) 18:29 By Anonymous Guy I think the only thing I'd change about this movie is I think they could have a bit more musical variety with the songs. Overall, very entertaining and funny, especially in the last couple of minutes. . March 20, 2012 (Fri) 19:13 By Anonymous I watched this for the first time last night. I love the song that plays as we leave the club, it's one of my favourite songs from this soundtrack. The story is interesting, and the story is told with a couple of songs that are a lot of fun to listen to. It was fun to see some of the different characters that were introduced to us, and some of them have a lot more personality than the others. The ending really made me laugh, the ending of the movie was actually a bit disappointing, but I enjoyed it! If you're a fan of music, I recommend this movie to you! It's worth watching.  the end is a disappointment March 18, 2012By A Great movie, and a great story. The last part where it said 'the end' made me sad. However, I still enjoyed it all the same. The best part of the story was the first part. Also, there was some humour in there. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good soundtrack, especially if you're the type of person who loves the same songs as your favorite bands or artists. This is great!  I've never seen the film before. I don't understand why this movie has such bad reviews, the film is
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ I've always liked the film adaptation of this book as a whole. It really gets right into the heart of what is really going on. In the original book, a few minor characters that aren't part of the main plot are present, and they are all very compelling and funny. While the book was a bit slow at the beginning, that is quickly changed when we get to the parts with the characters that really get to know and care about these children. I also like how they got the characters more to life than they probably would have with the book as well, I think it's really nice. If there was one slight thing I wish the movie did better, it would be that the character's voices were a bit muffled. I've heard it on the DVD so I can't see if it was on the TV release or the audio commentary. The book really does have a little over half a page for the dialogues. There are a few times where they talk over the scene that we are in, but they weren't a big deal to me and they didn't really take any time away from the story. _______________________________________________________ 1st off, this is the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is so well done, it's just like reading the book. The voices are realistic and they do a good job of getting the characters across and making it easy to follow. The acting is very good too, the acting is good all around. It takes a lot of work to portray these characters in a film. They do a great job of portraying these children who are struggling with how to cope with the horrors that is happening. These children are all funny as hell and make you feel like they really do have emotions going on behind the scenes and are not just playing these role. Even though the movie may seem a little slow at times, the movie never loses track of the story and the characters. It never loses sight of the emotional turmoil these children are going through and is able to keep you watching, while simultaneously building suspense. This movie has everything that a good story needs and that's a good thing because it is a good book and it deserves to be seen by everyone. If you like books and movies that are well done and don't let anyone tell you different, then I highly suggest this film. I can not wait to see how it does at the box office. ___________________________ So what do you think, did I
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the best of the three movies, that I have seen in a while, it's funny and has a great soundtrack. The plot is very well done, the villains are really good, and the heroine (Rin) is a very strong and confident heroine. It's one of those movies that I watch with family. It may have some flaws, but nothing major. I have watched this movie many times, it is very good. A must watch for any fan of anime or any person who enjoys watching a good Sci-fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ What did you like? __________ What did I like? The story: It was hard to tell if there was a twist or not, but I felt like it worked. It was very predictable and I couldn't understand why they were following it up with another. I felt there was only one real surprise of the movie and that was the finale. The acting: The only really good character was the teacher who was also a teacher and also the only person in school who could relate to her students. The rest were just generic. I found her acting to be very poor. She has the same accent and her speech wasn't very interesting. It also felt that the way that the story was telling was very formulaic. Rating: _______ 1/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have to understand the mindset of the people that make movie. Movie makers work on a tight budget. You have to get everything that you need to make a movie. So how the hell you can pay for a car that costs more than the movie cost and hire a crew to make that movie? How you can spend $15,000 to shoot 2 scenes and not pay them $500? How is that possible? Well there is no money in movie. The movie will only go after what it needs to. What we need to be really honest is what did I do to get these guys? What we will do now that we have been paid? Well they were not happy with me for two reasons. I could not give them what they asked me to do and secondly they had already spent $20,000 on me. So they asked if I would do the scene where I beat up the guy with the yellow hat. I said that it was too long. It was at least a three minute scene. So what did they do? They asked me if I could give them a scene where they beat up someone. I thought about it for about 30 seconds and said that is fine. And sure I can do that. So we did the scene. The next day they called me back and they said, hey we want another scene. That was the second scene they wanted. That scene was just as long. I would have to have the same crew and they told me that I would need to spend $50,000 more than that one scene just so I could film it. I asked them if they were serious? They said, well yeah. So I said well I would be happy to make it. So as a matter of fact we did another scene, this time a longer scene where the guy is getting beat up by the people from my band, that were all at the same time there. That is just a two minute scene, you do not need to shoot two scenes. I spent that $50K, that is $1.25M just for that scene. All of this happened the first day. You can call it the last day before I shot it.  I would like to thank my fans. They have been with me through the long run. It is not easy to do what I do. I have put my life on the line for my art and I do not want to let that go. As I said before it is hard to do. It
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I was really surprised to see how good it is. I haven't been into the comic book movies much lately but this one definitely caught my attention and I was impressed. _________________________________________________ I really liked this movie. It wasn't something I was expecting but it was still a really good film. _________________________________________________________________________ So I don't have a ton to say about this. It is an interesting take on the zombie genre. It has a couple of things that I don' like but it is still a pretty fun movie. I really enjoyed it. I don\'t really think that it has anything groundbreaking in terms of zombie films but it does it's job. I enjoyed this one a lot. ___________________________ I saw this movie on a Friday night and I have to say it was a lot better on a Wednesday night. I had seen The Walking Dead and I found that I was really tired by the end of it but I found myself very entertained by this film. The story was interesting but I don''t think it did a great job in capturing the essence of what the zombie is really about. I did feel like this movie did its job in that it did try to capture a sense of zombie in a scary way but it didn't really get there. I wouldn''t say this is a great movie. But it is entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The film does a superb job of introducing us to a new world that we are introduced to in this film, and the character development between the various people is spot on. We are introduced, for the first time in our lives, to this world that has the ability to create anything out of nothing, and all the people in this world were given these powers to begin with, including our main character who has a gift of teleportation. The powers are bestowed to the various characters by a wizard (who happens to be an ancient sorcerer) and he has this gift with the blessing of his gods, who have given him the power to create whatever he desires. He is given a magic staff that he can use to travel through time and space, a magical sword that is his most trusted weapon, an old car that he uses to travel and shop, and a magical suit that can make him invisible. In the beginning of the film we are also introduced to his friend who he saves the day in his previous life, and we also learn a little bit about how his life was prior to the film, but this is kept in the background for the most part for the sake of the characters, who are all very likable. They are all likeable because we actually get to see them have a little growth and get stronger in the film. We see the growth from when he first came in, and how he is slowly going into a full fledged wizard in the end. So the story for The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a very simple one, and it's done very well. The film isn't very long either, so if you liked any of the Harry Potter movies, then this is probably a good place to start.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- ------------ "I think The Magnificent Seven is an excellent action movie. It is like watching a great action movie with good story and good characters. The movie is entertaining, suspenseful, and good action movies should always have great action. I also like that the movie is very well shot with good special effects, especially when the movie was shot in the middle of the desert. I think the best thing about the movie were the characters. If you liked John Travolta's character, you will enjoy this movie a lot. But in my opinion, the movie's best character is John Heard's character. If John Heard has a wife, I would like to see that movie! The movie's villain was just bad. All that good stuff is ruined by the villain's character (sorry for this rant, but the guy had no personality). The plot is very complex, but it works because of the characters and action. The way the movie ends is very good and I don't understand why some people didn't like it, although the ending is a little confusing to me." Read Full Review

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************* Hi, my name is Robert D. Sheppard and I am the writer of the movie "Loving Vincent" ( http://www.amazon.com/Loving-Vincent-Peter-Hughes/dp/1943263533 ). It was directed by Mark O'Donnell who also co-wrote the script. I had no idea that Vincent would end up being one of the most controversial movie ever made, even though he's a very good guy. I am not claiming to know Vincent better than the rest of the world, so please don't tell me that this movie is too preachy. He wants to be a good man, and I think that's good. He does try to get out of his funk when his new girlfriend gets married, but he's still in love with her. So he wants to get married again and have a family, even at the cost of his soul. And if that doesn't work, he will have to end it all. I guess I should say that the character of Vincent was inspired by me and my own life. I was born in 1960, and my mother had a daughter. As a child, I'd play with dolls and go to the doll shop, and every time I looked at that beautiful little white doll with the little gold buttons, I felt a bit of jealousy. I wanted to be like that doll. I want to feel that way about my own daughter someday. In high school, Vincent did not fit in, he was a very sensitive boy. I did not even know what a sensitivity was until I went to school. I got so much hate mail because I didn't fit in. Some people even accused me of being homosexual, but I never had a girlfriend, I didn'T even date. I just never was that interested in girls. But Vincent was very different. He had so many good qualities that made him attractive to me. I always felt that he would be the perfect husband for me, a good father for our daughter, and a wonderful friend for the rest people. When Vincent's new girlfriend, Annabella, had her heart broken, she tried to leave Vincent, but Vincent got up and did a number on her. But she was a good girl. She knew that Vincent had made some mistakes, but she didn't think he would commit murder. Annabella had left him on good terms, and had stayed in touch with him. When she and Vincent got married, they just

It is a funny and entertaining story that is told well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw "Gravity" in 3D, at 7:15 pm on Friday night in a large and reasonably loud cinema at the Paramount Theaters in Los Angeles.  We had seen the movie a number of times before and I had seen it with a family that had seen all of the previous "Giant" movies, so we were on top of our game for this one.  The movie is a lot of fun.  It's one of those "science fiction" films that is not really science fiction per se, but more like a movie set in the future, as it was set on the moon back in 2005.  There are plenty of space battles, which are both great and funny, and it's a very funny movie to watch, even as we get up and go home, as most space movies are.   One of the best and funniest parts of the movie was the character of Sandra Bullock.  She's funny and fun and she really puts on an interesting and good performance in the role of Sandra.  Sandra Bullocks character, Sandra Bullox (not to be confused with Sandra Bullinck, who played Bullock's character on "Parks and Recreation" for some reason) is an astronaut and is the only other female on the crew of the space shuttle Discovery.  The shuttle Discovery is the same one that made the first two "Giants".     It's the same shuttle that was involved in the first successful "Goliath" battle, the one where Sandra was able to defeat the monster, using her new weapon that she designed.  This is the first battle she won as the character.  Unfortunately, she was killed in the battle.  After she died, the Discovery and its crew are sent to another planet, in order to try to repair the shuttle.  They arrive, but the alien ship that was responsible for the attack is there as well.  While the shuttle is repairing, the shuttle's pilot is in a coma, but a scientist on board, John Blake, is able to repair him.  When they arrive on the new planet, they learn that the alien vessel was an invasion vessel, and had been in space for a long time, so they have to find out why it attacked.  Luckily, they are able to destroy the ship, but there are lots of people on board.  One of those people, a beautiful woman, is a scientist from Earth, who is
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  It was the second half of the 1970s and I was still getting out from the shock of "My Three Sons" (1969), the movie that had caused the death of the young actor in the first "Lord of the Rings" movie (1973). When I first saw "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," I did so in the middle of that movie. I saw the rest of the movies in theaters, but my heart was on the third film.  This movie was not as good as the first two, and in some ways, the third movie was even worse. But it was different enough to make up for that. It is the story of a young man named Andre (Cillian Murphy) who was orphaned when he was 12. He goes to live with his uncle, but it is clear that the uncle was a sadist. Soon, Andre discovers he has magical powers. And he has the bad habit of using them on people who aren't human. The Hunchbacks were his army of victims and his first and greatest obsession was the beautiful young woman, Mina (Diana Rigg), whom he began to love as a girl and then as a young woman. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dude, this is a great movie. I have been waiting for a movie of this caliber to come out. The characters are interesting and the action is incredible. The special effects are perfect. The story is very clever and the ending is great. It's a great time, a great film, and a great ride.  The only thing I'm confused about is why they didn't shoot it at 2160p and have the special effects done in 2k.  The Matrix In a future where the world's population has been depopulated, an anti-globalist group known as the "Synthetics" rise to power. Led by an enigmatic computer, Morpheus, they set about creating artificial humans from data of the human species. Their first success is an elite young woman named Neo.   This film was produced for $20 million dollars and the film was shot in only 2 weeks. The film is set on a barren, cold planet, called "The Matrix." The movie begins at a convention of people interested in how to become part of the Matrix. When Neo awakens, he is told that he is in a dream world where he has to choose between the good and evil in the form of the "red pill" and the "blue pill." He must go through all the tasks in order to awaken, but this is not a simple journey.  The blue pill is the first of two options that Neo has to wake up. If he goes through the "good" path, he gets to live an "easy life," but he will not go back to the past and his family. In the "evil" path he will live the remainder of his life in the "real world" and have to endure everything that was said to him while on the "dark side." This would leave Neo to a miserable existence.  The "good path" seems like a logical choice and it turns out to be one.  Neo wakes up in a desert. It is apparent that he has been asleep for the last two hours. It would seem that the "bad side" has taken control of him as he has become a very violent, anti-social person. However, he then goes through a tunnel and finds a woman who tells him to go through the red pill to be reunited with his family at home.  After taking the red pills, Neo finds himself in a different world and sees a girl he met before and he is happy to see

I've heard that the film will be released on DVD but I haven't seen anything of it since last month. I'd rather not watch it again but I am glad that this review came out in the nick of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I really enjoyed this movie. There is something very refreshing about a film that is actually about a woman instead of a man. This movie is a fun, uplifting look at the importance of hard work and determination. I didn't find any glaring flaws in the movie, and I have to admit that I laughed my butt off the entire way through. The special effects are good, the soundtrack is enjoyable and the cast and crew work hard to bring a great film to the screen. My rating is a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I don't think this is the best movie I've seen but it was a good one. I'd say there's nothing wrong with this movie and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is into a good laugh and likes a nice underdog story.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** Here's a good and interesting movie that will entertain and relax you. Although it takes a while to get into, it is worth it. *********************   Storyline: 3/5  The story of this movie is pretty straightforward: A group of six teenagers decide to do a cross-country road trip for a summer vacation. They will stay in motels for the first part of the trip. The motel is very far from their destination and when they arrive, they are in for a shock. They are now in Arizona and all the roads they used to take are closed due to the winter storms. It's all very confusing but it is all explained in a funny and engaging way.   The main character, Dylan, is a bit of a dork but not out of place in the seventies and he makes some good friends along the way. I didn't find his friendliness to be annoying, though. His humor is pretty funny and very endearing. All the friends are funny and entertaining and some are even funny and interesting. Their conversations are enjoyable as well.  All in all, the movie is very entertaining. Dylan, the main character and his friends do not give up and they overcome the difficulties and challenges in their lives.   I enjoyed the movie a lot and I found it to be a very interesting movie.   and my score for the story: ************* 2/5 *****************   Visuals: 3.5/5 (Good)  This movie is a classic in the sense that it uses the long shots to build a feeling of mystery. The long shots are great for showing how isolated the characters are. The close-ups of the characters also show their personalities very well.   the soundtrack is pretty good as well and the movie has some beautiful background music which makes it look even better.   that is about all I have to say about the visuals. I really liked the movie and I will definitely watch this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, the film itself is very funny, and the humor really shows itself early on, the story is very light, and when you are just watching the movie on youtube I don't think the movie gets very funny until about the 10-20 minutes in. This is a very good movie, and I highly recommend watching it, or at least you'll have something to laugh about when you're too busy trying to finish your schoolwork or going to a party, I'll be watching more movies from this director, and hope that he does better films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Fell to Earth" was one of the first movies I ever saw in a theater. When it comes to movies in general, I tend to think that they are pretty shallow. I don't care for the dialogue, I don the jokes and I don a lot of bad action. I tend not to like anything with a lot (or any) blood and violence.  With the exception of "Rampart" and "The Warriors", which had their "good" and good "bad" parts, I was a bit of a critic on those two movies. So when I came across a trailer for a movie about a guy who lives with a girl who has fallen in love with a big scary spider and tries to save his life by shooting it with a gun. Yeah, not much I can say but I can tell you that it was not at all bad.   "The Man who Fell to earth" is a movie that is kind of reminiscent of the "Star Wars" series. The action scenes are very cool and exciting. The plot is very good. It's a story about a person who fell to earth and who goes to find a girl and save her life. And it all works out. The only complaint I have is that I wish there were a little more story involved. That's not really a complaint. I just think it's good that the main character is just so good with guns. The movie would've been a lot better with a little less action and a little better story.   I'll give this movie a 6/10.  5.3 out of 10.

This is the sequel to " This is the sequels to " A Good Woman."  It has a very similar plot, but more of the humor is in the relationship between the husband and wife.  This movie also has the classic scene of the husband watching his wife's "sex tape," so it is a little different from the previous film.  It is very funny and has a few laughs.  The husband does have some good moments.  But the woman has a couple of scenes that are not quite as funny as I would like.  She gets some good comments from the audience.  I would have liked to see more of her and the husband's relationship.  And the husband is pretty clueless about his wife. It is a good idea for the movie to have more laughs. The only thing I really don't like about the film is the music.  They try to get some "classic movie" music playing.  When I saw it, it wasn't that bad.  However, there is an important song which is played when the husband goes to his wife in the hospital.  What does he hear?  A woman's name and the word "bitch."  I don't know if I like that song at all.  That's the only time in the movie when there is a song I wouldn't have liked.  There are a couple other "classic movies" which you won't like. If you like your movies a little "silly" than " This Is the Movie " is a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not the first time that a movie that has a lot of good parts but is overrated by critics is a hit. My new favorite movie is THE BEST FRIENDS.  It's about a group of friends who get caught up in a car crash, and end up in jail. My favorite actor, who plays one of the main characters, plays the role of the movie star in a way that is extremely believable. In fact, I would watch a documentary about the movie if it had just had one of those interviews with the stars and directors.   I also like the movie because it is about two good friends who try to get through life when life starts to get difficult, and when they go to the movies, they go with one of their friends who doesn't like the movies. The best part of this movie, IMO, is when they talk to their friends when they get back to their respective places.   Also, I thought it was an interesting thing to have the lead actor playing the role as an adult. I'm a 40-year-old woman. What is your favorite movie from the 80's? Please, leave a comment!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Perfect Storm" is a superb and beautifully crafted film.  It has a wonderful and poignant message to offer about the true nature of human nature.  This is an emotional and insightful film about a storm that never ends, a storm so strong that it changes the way people see one another, a film that makes you wonder how long a storm is going to last, a powerful film that has many more to offer.  The music is beautifully composed and the voice acting is superb.  It is a great film to watch while driving to work or for a long and beautiful day by the water.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  A good movie needs good actors to play well the characters, to write good scenes. And there are plenty of good actors working in this movie. So they can easily cast themselves as well. A must watch film. I recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ "This one is great."  About the movie: When a boy named Henry (Ryan Gosling) and his friend Jack (Paul Rudd) find a mysterious, glowing orb of light in the woods and take it home, they do something extraordinary: they light it on fire and make it dance. That's just one of the amazing stories in a film that feels almost like an early Kubrickian psychedelic-comedy. The other amazing thing is that the film's a good one, with the kind of laughs that are hard to come by these days. A good deal of it has to do with the script by the excellent J.C. Chandor and his brother David (who wrote the original screenplay), a very funny bunch. But it also has a great visual feel, with some excellent animation from the great Daniel Kwan, with terrific choreography from Rudd and great makeup work by Michael Shannon. "It's all a question of balance," says Jack as he and Henry take their orb to a nearby lake. I liked the idea of Henry's orb having a very specific, mystical, non-verbal function as well. But I can't help noticing how very little Henry really talks: he just does whatever he's told. His orb dancing, meanwhile, is a lot of fun, too, especially the way it makes you feel very small and powerless and vulnerable, and also very, very happy. I was impressed at how well the camera kept up with all the amazing things that happened. I've always thought of the Shining as a great film for its time, which made watching it again a fun, wonderful experience. "This is one of those rare movies that has the quality of being a great work of art." A film by Daniel Kwon

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ತ್ರುನಿ (20/07/14) I really enjoyed this movie, it was a good action packed movie and really enjoyed all the action scenes. It was really good, the special effects and effects were good and it made the characters have a good look and feel to them. The special effects in this movie were really good and in a good way. The way the special effect was done in the movie was awesome, I really liked the fact that they used all kinds of special effects to show what kind of danger the characters were in, and they really made the movies more suspenseful, and it was pretty cool to see. I liked the way they did the fighting scenes in this, they were really cool and in fact made the fights in this really interesting. Overall this is a good flick and a good fun action flick. The action scenes were very interesting and in the way that it was done I felt it really had the right feel to it, and in some ways even though the special force effects were done very well I didn't feel it was overdoing it. ภ_༼ຈل͜າ༽ข༼  Helpful a good thing to have on the list. It's a good, good action flick but it's still just a movie that's action. This movie was pretty good as it had some great and scary special effects but it was still just action, action in a movie like this can always be improved. I think the special fight scenes and special effects were great but it could have been better because it's a movie about action it could be done with less special effects. It is still a good and a fun action/comedy flick but just not quite what it could and should have been. I really want to like this but I feel it's just not as good as some other movies in it's genre but it did have some great special effects that really had a good feel to the film, so I do recommend watching it for that, but it will not take you away from any other movie on this list.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ The good : A nice, but not over the top adventure. It uses good dialogue and is full of good character development, and the cast is quite likable. The bad : As usual, this movie is a bit of a drag. The characters are a bit stereotypical, and there is some nudity, though not enough. There are also some bad scenes and weak action. The final act is good, but it comes a bit late. There isn't much to recommend other than some good action and a good story, but this isn't a movie I want to see very often. There is also some gratuitous nudity in this one. ___________________________________________________________________________________  X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) 8/10  I gave X-Men a 9 and was looking forward to seeing what director Bryan Singer would do with the characters in the new X-men films. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to expectations, and I didn't find it very entertaining. I am very disappointed with the story and the fact that there is no true Wolverine. Wolverine is not needed in this movie and I have no problems with the acting, but they could have handled the Wolverine character better. The acting is decent, with a few standouts, and this film will probably appeal to a few people, but I will probably stick with the films that already exist. The animation is excellent and there are some cool action sequences. I loved seeing Jubilee's transformation. I will certainly watch the other films, but if they don't do better than this one I will consider not seeing anything else that happens in the X-movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ [The film follows a police officer as he tries to find a criminal (played by Chris Cooper) who has stolen money from his boss' safe. As we follow Cooper, he gets into a car crash and is saved by the heroic police chief. The chief then finds out that the police officer was the main culprit in a crime the chief had investigated a long time ago. There is a lot of drama that develops as Cooper is investigated by the police, but ultimately he is cleared of all charges. (It turns out the other person (played in the film by Peter Fonda) was the real culprit and he got away. The film is a really good film and I recommend it to everyone. I liked the script and the character work the movie had. I think the film was shot very well and it is definitely worth a watch.]
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The world needs more movies like this. - J.D. Winton  A very interesting story of a guy who does everything in his power to take care of his pregnant wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her child (Alexander Skarsgard). The plot is a little bit too simplistic, however it gets better and better. I hope this film will have an interesting ending. - Christian Bauchner  What can I say about a movie with so much heart and so much love? That a heart of a mother wants to be there for her son, to hold him and let him know what she is feeling, to have the time to laugh and cry and to feel the love of her child? And that the wife, who's in the end almost a victim herself, can make it through? - Jörn Schmidt  It is the kind of movie that makes me think I really love my mother - Eva Schloss  I have been wanting to see this for years but no one wanted to let me see it - Mark Rylance  Hollywood can't get enough of Skarsgaard. - Mike Leigh  After spending some time with this movie, it turns out to be a lovely film in which we can all learn a thing or two about life, love and family. - John Waters  My mom watched it with her and was in tears - Sarah Jones
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I'm not sure when or where, but someone made a new movie about a girl called Aishwarya Rai, an Indian American who grew up in Bombay, India, to British and Japanese parents. The name 'Rai' was originally written as 'Aishwary' by one of her teachers. She was an actress and dancer and was one of the first South Asian women to appear in the film industry. It was also her first American TV role and she became the first Indian-American to play a romantic lead on a TV series. (she does a cameo appearance in the movie). It was her first lead movie role and was the beginning of a long and successful career. She went on to star in many more movies, including the Indian/American romantic comedy 'Chungking Express'. She also appeared in 'Gigi' and 'The Dictator' (which is another movie based on the book 'The Emperor's New Clothes') and also did several movies in France and in Japan (she was also involved in the making of 'Shiksha') I also remember that she was a model. She had a great voice and was known as a good singer and had a number of radio and TV shows on the radio. She also performed in the musical 'Shake Hands with Luck' and also 'The Indian Princess', in which she played the Indian princess. As far as my memory is concerned she was very quiet and kept to herself, but we all got to know her a lot more over the years. I hope she will be remembered for her role in this movie, and that her name and image will also be remembered in other films as she was the first and the last Indian woman to play the romantic lead in a Hollywood movie. It will be very sad to see her gone and for her to be forgotten over the rest of her life. Please go see this movie and share your comments and thoughts. Thanks! __________________________________________________________ My review: _________________________________________________________________________ Aishu was a very shy and reserved child who used to hide in her room from the big boys in school and was not interested in girls. She only went out when she was invited. She lived alone and she was told at an early age she was not good enough and she shouldn't try to do anything in life. She would sneak out from her home after dark and would travel to different places around the Indian subcontinent. She often came home late at night
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Trek Into Darkness" is a good film, and a very good one at that.   It is, after all, an entirely new entry in the "Star Trek" franchise, and it's not even the sequel to a "Star Wars" film.   Yet, the film succeeds on all counts.   I think the reason why so many people enjoy it so much is because it shows us a new direction for the franchise, something that will be explored again in a few years.   This is one of those rare films that transcends the genre, and is genuinely an excellent film that everyone should see. I will admit that I'm a bit biased here because I am one of the original "Trek" fans, having seen the original series on the original TV series back in the early seventies, and having read all the books and comics about it, but I will say this:   "Star Trek" is, in my opinion, a very successful movie series, and the most successful "Trekkie" movie franchise in film history, just after "Star wars".   I also think it is very "Treky" for its time, and in many ways, is an early step towards the more sophisticated direction that the franchise would take a few decades later.   As a viewer, I found the film to be a bit of a let down, but ultimately, it is a very entertaining, thought-provoking film, that I personally recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in "Treked" fan fiction.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ This movie was a classic. In its simplicity and the simple way it is made, the movie makes it easy to accept that the main character is the one who makes this world a better place. The movie doesn't focus on the world itself, but how the main characters try to make it better for everyone. It's a small idea with huge implications, and it makes you laugh out loud on several occasions. It also gets a laugh out of the title, which can be the most annoying part of the movie to many. As someone who likes simplicity, I can't say I found much that wasn't a simple idea in this movie. The comedy, the art style, the themes, the characters, and the love stories all shine. The acting isn't too amazing, but I didn't expect it to be. A few more actors would have made this movie a perfect 5-star movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have more than one thought.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I enjoyed this movie. As a long time fan of the show, this is my favorite episode of the entire series. I enjoyed it for the whole four-hour runtime, not really wanting to get through the first hour. I was really hoping for more but didn't want it to feel like the ending to season two (because it wasn't). It has its good points but it is ultimately flawed and doesn't really connect with the rest of the series. It's worth watching just for the first episode and then checking out the rest.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   1- Starring: Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Josh Duhamel, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Michael McKean, Ronny Cox, Kevin Kline, and Robert Duvall.   2- Directed by Ron Howard (The Terminal, The Truman Show).   3- Release date: November 6, 2006.   "With an almost laugh-out-loud title, this is the big-budget fantasy starring Aniston and Roberts, and it's so good that we can't imagine anyone else taking on the story, from Howard's screenplay, which, at times, has a slight edge of camp to it. This one's got great performances, and you won't be disappointed."--Roger Ebert   4- Rated PG. "One of the more surprising box office hits this year, the film's popularity owes in large part to its star, Aniston who plays an angel, a woman of good character who's cast in a fantasy world of magic and adventure. A series of incidents begins to affect the angel's soul and bring about a clash with the demon lord, and an epic battle ensues, during which the world of the mortals is destroyed in a massive nuclear explosion."--Loris K.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. _________. If it isn't terrible, it's worth a watch. _____. ____. _______. ____________________. This isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it is one of the best action movies of all time. The movie is set in 1970 in Vietnam, the Vietnam War is in full swing and a bunch of American soldiers are being hunted down by a mob of Viet Cong soldiers led by General Phung Hoang. The only way to escape from these murderous savages is by taking out the bad guys. The gang at first consists of Sergeant Major "Fatso" Coughlin (Kurtwood Smith), who hates everything about the Viet Cong, a Marine named Joe (Vince Vaughn), his former sergeant who was captured by them and is now being tortured, an amnesiac named Danny (Steve Buscemi) and a woman who has been kidnapped by the Vietcong and is forced to help them out. They are joined by a group of mercenaries led by a man named the King (Robert DeNiro) and they soon find themselves involved in an epic battle that is fought across a mountain range. The entire movie is shot in a beautiful style that is almost cinematic. The fight scenes are intense and entertaining, all of the cast, especially the cast of characters, have excellent accents. The music in the film is also excellent, I personally think the main theme is "Hear Me Roar" by Joe Cocker. The film is very dark and is very dramatic, but there is a lighthearted feel to it. I think the cast is excellent and all the characters are unique and each one is likeable. I do like the character of Danny because it reminds me of the characters in a certain movie, it is a good change from most action films. If you like violence and adventure, then you will like this film. If not, you will probably like it more than the average action film. As stated in the beginning, this movie is not good. But the film does have a lot of personality and is actually funny. This is not the funnest movie ever, but you have to at least give it a shot if you're bored of the same old stuff. I give it 4.4/5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The Mummy is just an all-around good movie. Its story is engaging, and its performances are top notch. The Mummies are awesome, and they are my favorites from the live action line up. I would say the Mummy was definitely a favorite of mine this year, and the only other movie that comes close is Paranormal Activity. It had a great atmosphere, and was a well paced action packed ride. The action scenes were all well choreographed, and really made for a great ride. If you want something a little more family friendly, then I suggest picking this one up! __________  ______________ I had some major mixed emotions about this movie. On one hand, it is a fun, action packed movie that was a bit slow for my taste. On the other, the pacing can be a little disheartening at times, which made the movie a little boring. But it also did a great job of showing just how far the Mummies have come, since this is a movie about them, after all. _____________

It was not bad and it was not the greatest. I do think that the director and the producers of the movie did not know what they were doing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I will forever remember the day I was able to see a movie for the first time. It was the release of a movie called "Sgt.

This movie was a little bit ahead of its time in that you couldn't tell you were watching a movie from a movie until you had seen the music video." In the next 3 years we will be seeing some great sequels such as "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "Rudy". "The Matrix" was released in 1999 and in 2003 "The Dark Knight" was made and was nominated for many awards. The movie "The Lion King" was a big success in 2003 and 2007 and in 2013 Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" was produced. These are just a few examples that you can find in the movies list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Walt Disney's  The Hunchback of Notre Dame  is one of those rare films that has that rare ability to move the viewer. While it is set in medieval times, it is not medieval in the sense of being full of the religious beliefs that were a part of our culture of the time, but instead in the very modern world. The only thing that seems familiar about this world is the large castle which is called Notre Dame. The Humpback is also an interesting character. While he is an antagonist to the main characters of the movie, the Hump is actually a sort of loveable underdog in this tale. He is not exactly the most fearsome of villains, but he is a very interesting antagonist who has been given a new lease on life in this modern world and has become a sort out guardian of Notre-Dame. It is also nice to see the character of The Humpy not being an absolute monster, but someone that has a good heart and can be an ally to the people he is tasked to protect. He does have a bit of an issue with the fact that the King of France is not interested in his help in defeating the Knights of the Cross. When the King comes to ask for the help of the Humpy, he is quite angry that the Hunch is still in England and not in France to help with his war efforts. Unfortunately for the Humble Hump, he soon learns that the knights are actually not that interested in this new hero who is now on their side. The king even tries to make him the target of some of the knights' arrows, but the Humbling Hump comes through and saves the day. The story of The Hundred Hunchbacks is an interesting one. It tells the story of four heroes, each with their own unique abilities, who fight against the threat of the Hundred Humpbacks. The Knights of NotreDame are a group of monks that are tasked with the task of protecting Notre- Dame. Their leader is the beautiful Lady of Notre Dame, who can become invisible, or at least appear so, to other people when they ask her for her help. One of the other Knights, the Brother, is the leader of the Knights in the other part of the castle. He wields a greatsword. Another Knight, the Son, is a young man that is very shy. He also can be invisible and has an ability to control animals. The third Knight, also the Brother's son,

The teacher explained that the idea of a Southern rebellion had been concocted by the Southern elite to keep the North down and to keep poor whites from revolting."  -Mark Greif, author of Civil War, the Myth of the Lost Cause   "One thing that does not need to be explained is why the Civil Rights movement was portrayed as a conspiracy to bring about slavery, and why it should be remembered as the movement that ended slavery. By portraying the war as a struggle between "North" and "South," the historical record is that the War was about the American South's desire to retain the economic and political power that they enjoyed prior to the Civil war. It was the North that began to create a racial hierarchy. And once they had created the hierarchy, they became more and more aggressive toward the rest of the country.  And once they got their way, there was very little that could be done about it. You can read about it, if you wish, in your local newspaper, but there were no monuments erected.

The nation was reeling from the collapse of the world's largest and oldest savings and loan institution, Savings & Loan Association (S&L), on Sept. 30, 1933. The following day, Congress passed the Savings & Loans Act, which imposed restrictions on the industry and placed the institution under federal government control. The United States entered the world of banking and finance.   Two years later, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created to insure savings and loans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you like this movie, you should watch it again. ___________  LOVING  The film begins with a man named Frank, a retired marine, playing the guitar in his living room in the 1970s. It's a good song, but he's clearly having a hard time at work, and he can't seem to get his work done. Frank's daughter, Kay, comes in and tells him he's got to leave his room. Kay is concerned about her father, but Frank is so exhausted that he thinks she's crazy. The next day, he gets another visit from his daughter, who tells him she's not crazy at all and that he's been out there in the snow a lot. Frank agrees to let Kay visit him at home, but she leaves in a hurry. Frank thinks this is going to be the last time he'll see his daughter. When she calls the next day to see if he is OK, he tells her he can talk to her when he gets home. The first couple of minutes of the movie are spent on this kind of small character drama, and it's pretty well done. After a couple of such scenes, the story shifts gears and takes us back to Frank's home office, where he's suddenly interrupted by a strange visitor, the voice of an angry voice, and an image of Frank's dead wife.  That's all we have to go on. The images are hard to follow, but they are clear and dramatic. What's more, I didn't feel as if I was getting too many ideas, especially since they are brief and simple. There are three scenes where it's clear there are no ideas behind them. It was just a lot of visual stuff. I wasn't sure what this movie would be about, and I couldn't tell you why Frank was so tired. It had a nice vibe, but I wasn.t feeling much in the way of emotional connection to Frank or anyone else in the story. It also seemed as though Frank was being played more by the music and imagery than by his own character. The character was pretty well fleshed out, and the character-as-idea was very interesting. It reminded me a little bit of the work that was done on the early episodes of Dr. Who and was fun to watch, but it wasn't enough to really sink me into the story as a whole.  The story starts to move toward an emotional climax after about

If you're a fan of the original, this is pretty much exactly the same but with less nudity and more of a horror feel. If, like me, you're also a fan who loves the series, this one is also worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You go to the movies, and it's just not that good. Just a dull, slow, over-hyped mess. So dull, in fact, that you can't stand it. The only thing worse than boring is boring that doesn't have anything going for it." "This movie is a bore and nothing to recommend. It's boring, but it's not as boring as this review makes it seem. The acting and dialogue are so awful and so unfunny. If you want a movie that is so boring that it is impossible to enjoy, I highly recommend you check this movie out." I'm not sure what kind of people will watch this movie. I don't think they will see it as a bad movie, since it is one of those films I thought could be really good. It is just so boring, and the people in it are just so damn unfunny and one dimensional that it just seems like a bad bad movie. But that is not the worst part. It isn't even the worst of the movie. It actually is pretty good, and I don.t think it's that bad. However, this was my first time watching this movie, and as a first time viewer I did not have an opinion on the movie, so this is as good a place as any for me to go and share my opinion. First of all, we get to meet our main character (Michael Pitt). We get a bunch of scenes of him playing with his toys, but we do not get to see his personality come to the surface. We never really see his parents, but what we do see of them is rather boring, since their entire purpose in the movie is to tell you who Michael is, and to teach you how to be a better person and a better husband. The other main characters are his little brother, his wife, his daughter, and a couple of friends he meets on a cross country trip. The first thing I noticed about Michael Pitt is that he is really tall. Tall in that a real 6 foot, 2 inches, and when he is at play he seems to be almost twice as tall as most of the other kids. That just adds to his image of being an awkward, dorky little kid who does things just because he can. This is actually another thing that really bugs me about the movie: the fact that he doesn't like doing homework. For some reason, he always seems to not do his homework.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not wait, download the Movie for free and watch now! The most astonishing action movie in the history of cinema is a perfect example of how to capture an audience's imagination with a pure cinematic style. The film begins with a breathtaking fight scene with several heroes of the Soviet Union against the most powerful American spy. The scene is repeated over and over with an incredible intensity, as if it is a cinematic poem. The heroines of the film, Natasha Romanova and Natalia Chertanova, are perfect. Their love story is pure joy. There is a genuine innocence in their behavior. I especially like their dialogue, which consists of only a few words, but they create a unique atmosphere. The actors, Nikolai Yudin and Vasily Poddubny, are exceptional. I loved the scene of the train robbery. The characters seem to live in this imaginary world, which they are making up. Their feelings and their thoughts are pure fantasy. The movie starts with the Russian army storming a prison where the agent is held. The action is so intense that the viewer is overcome with emotion. The first three hours of the movie have a thrilling story. The second half, which is the most violent, takes place in the prison. It is a very moving film. The scenes of the torture are so horrible that the audience cries. I was shocked and deeply saddened. It's not the typical Russian torture scene. The torture is more cruel, more graphic, and more disgusting. The most painful scenes were those in which the torturers used a whip and electric shock. The whip shocks the tortured, even with the help of a blindfold, and a small metal tube is inserted into the torturer's anus. The electric shock has a terrible impact. Some torturers are killed with the shock, and others almost lose their sanity. The only exception was a blind girl. She is very brave and is able to resist the whip with great strength. The death of the two male torturers in the last part of the story was also very sad. The final part of this film is very different. It was a great action film with a very unique ending. It seems that the American agents killed their own family and destroyed the family house, killing all their pets. The whole thing is tragic and heartbreaking. This kind of movie should be watched on a special occasion, like the day of the funeral. It should be shown when you are sad, and when you want to feel the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   The last film of the season has some great acting and writing. It's a great blend of horror, mystery, and sci-fi. It may not be a good choice for people that don't like the genre but it's a good time for those that like it. It was released on the 25th of January so I'm just gonna talk about the movie and how it does.   I was going to review it for a horror movie, but it turns out that it's actually a good horror film. It starts off pretty slowly and as you get into it, it becomes more interesting. I don't know if I've ever seen a film so slow-paced as this. I thought it was pretty great until the last third. It has some good moments but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a good suspenseful film.   and what about it's story? I enjoyed it very much, even though it took a few times to get to the good parts. The pacing was good, the story was good and some of the things are not so obvious, like the connection between the two kids and the man.  , but the plot did not go the way I thought. I was expecting something that would involve the girls and the creepy old man. I got it. But I guess I expected a bit more. And I would like to recommend this film to those that really liked the last one, but also liked the other ones. There are many horror films out there and I think this is one of the better ones and it doesn't leave a bad aftertaste. I'm not going to give it an 8/10 because it isn't perfect, but I really enjoyed the experience.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wolf of Wall Street  is the only film to make me feel as if I were at the top of the stock market. It's the movie where the "greed is good" and "you have to make a buck to make money" mindset is on full display. The movie begins in the office of the "Wolf of Wall street", played by Jordan Belfort, who has already earned his nickname by turning the world's largest bank into a crime boss by exploiting his natural connections. As the film progresses it becomes apparent that Belfort is a pathological liar and that his story is almost entirely fabricated. There is also some evidence in the movie that Belfry may not have committed the crimes he is accused of by even his best friends. The film is filled with people trying to take advantage of the Wolf of Walls, even those who don't realize they are doing it. There are a lot of opportunities to get rich quick and many people are just willing to take the risk. Jordan Belforny is one of those people and the film has him take a risk of a lifetime that may not pay off. The Wolf of Walton Street is filled to the brim with people who do this on a daily basis, and it all comes back to one man. The only real thing to take away from this movie is that you can't trust anyone. There's a saying that you have to be careful who you befriend, because in the end they'll betray you. You never know who you will meet in life, and you never know what will happen to you when you meet them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grown Ups 2  is a very entertaining film. It has tons of jokes and just enough action and blood to satisfy even the most seasoned of gore aficionados. There is a reason the cast of this movie are considered one of the greatest. The movie is a sequel to the 2010 film but was not directed by the original's director, Statham and it is not the greatest film ever made. It will appeal to anyone who has ever loved the first one and enjoyed the sequel. A fun romp through the suburbs of NYC with a good time guaranteed. I'm giving this film a B+ What I like about the film:  The jokes are great, the actors are great and the movie never gets dull. The story is not bad either and I'm a huge fan of the first movie and this film has nothing to do with it. What needs work on the film is:

The film's plot involves a bunch of other movies coming together in a way that I can't quite figure out yet, but there is definitely some depth to the movie and the cast do a great job playing the roles.

It had all of the things I was looking for and there were some nice twists and surprises along the way. The movie was very funny and did a great job of capturing the spirit of old school 1970's cinema. My friend loved it and I found it a great way to spend my afternoon and I would recommend this to anyone who is into old timey films. It made me laugh so hard.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first started watching  The Lost Brother  I was surprised by what an interesting concept it was. In the early 50s a mysterious figure, who later became known as "The Lost Brother," appeared to three of his children in a dream. He warned them not to try to get in touch with anyone, including their parents, since it would lead them into the "dark world." The Lost Brothers appeared to have been lost for a long time before they made their reappearance in this movie.  The story takes place in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but focuses mainly on the experiences of two sisters named Dorothy (Ruth Wilson) and Maud (Pamela Macdonald). Dorothy is in her late teens when she begins having encounters with The Lost brother, who tells her she is destined to help the boy and give him a new start in life. The two begin to share stories and share a sense of mystery with each other. The film starts off with Dorothy as she's preparing to go into the forest, which she doesn't want to do because she believes the Lost Brother will follow her. Once Dorothy is alone in the woods, she sees a man coming toward her, whom she believes to be The Lost. He asks Dorothy to tell him where her parents are and how they died. Dorothy then realizes that she's been deceived. When she goes back into the woods and discovers the man is gone, she's upset and tries to get back in touch. The Lost has a different plan and tells her that she is going to have to work with him. The movie also tells about Dorothy and M Aud's relationship and how she feels that her life is being controlled by The Lost, and how he's constantly trying to get into her head and influence her. The story is interesting because it does a great job of using the medium of film to tell a story. The setting and the atmosphere are fantastic, and the movie itself is a good one. In regards to the acting, the performances of Dorothy and her sister are well done. Ruth Wilson does a good job of portraying the strong, independent Dorothy while playing the character of Dorothy's mother, who is a bit more feminine. She gives a great performance and I particularly loved her performance of the fact that she hates her daughter. Maud does a very good job as Maud as she is able to portray the strong nature of the child, while still being feminine. I enjoyed this movie because of the
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I can tell by the way you are looking at me that I am the star of this movie. It's a simple story about a young man and his relationship with his father, a world famous surgeon, but what makes this movie so great is that you never look at the hero as the hero. You are supposed to be like him. And, despite being just a kid, you really feel like you are in his shoes. The film is shot in black and white with some grainy effects, but it still looks beautiful. The acting is pretty weak and not much dialogue, but I think that's part of the reason this is a great film. The music is pretty good, and the sound effects are pretty realistic and believable. There are no crazy effects and no CGI used during the battle, which gives the movie a very unique feel. Overall, it's a solid, interesting film that's a lot of fun to watch, and it would definitely make a great holiday movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Short  is an amazing movie that I recommend anyone see, be it a newbie or someone who is not so familiar with the world of real estate, to get a grip of what is going on. In case you have never seen it, The Big Short is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and feel a mixture of happiness and anger. It is the story of Adam McKay and Charles Randolph as they attempt to create a film based on the real estate investment and mortgage meltdown of 2007. The plot revolves around a group of bankers who come up with an idea for a film that focuses on the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that were issued during the housing bubble and then lost over a hundred billion dollars in the ensuing implosion of the economy. As the movie goes on, the movie looks into the inner workings of the American financial system as we see how the world's economy is controlled by a group who are very adept at manipulating and manipulating our economic system.  The movie is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in understanding what has been going on in our economy, who knows the real facts behind the facts, and the effect the financial system has had on our nation.  I can say with no reservation that The Big Picture  definitely deserves a place on the list of great movies. It will likely take years for this movie to receive an Academy Award and if the movie does get nominated, I am confident that The Oscars will give it to it as a masterpiece.  To sum up my thoughts on this movie, it is a comedy that delves into some very interesting subjects and while I did not have a ton of laughs watching this movie I can definitely see how it would make a good comedy and how it could appeal to a large audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really did not have much of a choice.  The only real choice I had was between "Poseidon Adventure" and "Proteus", which was not only an epic film but also an extremely exciting one.  A beautiful woman falls in love with a man that is a god, but unfortunately, he is an egotistical man who has trouble with his father, and even with his wife.  I have to admit, though, that I was really excited by this film because, as a lover of epic movies and science fiction, I wanted to see some epic stuff with a sci-fi twist.  It was very similar to some of the great films of the 1960's, like  Planet of the Apes  and  The Day The Earth Stood Still. I would also compare it to the movie "Blade Runner" from Ridley Scott, although "Poserus" doesn't look like a direct adaptation, but rather it has its own sense of style and it is extremely imaginative.  This is a fantastic film, and if you love science fiction or epic movies, this is definitely one for you.  Score:   9/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Halloween (2004) - It was the first time I actually liked a horror movie.  I had a hard time getting into it, but I couldn't get enough.  The characters were all memorable and creepy, the gore was extreme, and the acting was so good.  It was pretty entertaining.  At one point, the monster came out of the water with blood pouring from it and when I saw this I cried.  My husband was confused and worried about me so we skipped the film for a little bit.  We later watched it again, and I think we really got into it and enjoyed it.  If it wasn't for that, I think this movie would have won me over in a hurry. It's been five years since this movie came out.  Five years since I finally got to see it on a big screen.  Ten years since it was a big box-office hit.  A decade since my family and I saw it.  So, why would I watch this movie again?  I guess for the sake of completion?  Yes, I love this film, and it's a lot of fun.  That's my main reason, but also because it's about a girl and a demon.  She's a little girl named Jessica, and she's scared of a scary old man.  He's the only human she's ever seen before.  They end up getting eaten by a giant squid monster that is the monster we saw on the last film.  In this movie the monsters are not as scary, they're just plain stupid.  But that doesn't mean the monsters aren't still very scary.  Especially the giant squid.  The first part is pretty easy to watch, the second part is a little harder to watch.  First off, I wish the monster had died in the first film. It wasn't like it needed to.  Once they were done fighting it, they just left it there.  And now we have the third film. They really should have made the giant monster move a little faster.  Maybe it would have scared the crap out of us more.  This is also a movie you don't want to be in front of a bunch of kids.  There's a bit of nudity in this movie. It's not that big of a deal, but they should have been more careful.  When the film was in theaters, I had two different parents tell me they saw

That is really something for me, and is a very cool feat. I also enjoyed all three episodes, with some of the dialog being a bit hard to watch, but it was still fun. __________ The most interesting thing about this movie is not necessarily the originality of the film itself, but the fact that Lucas wanted to tell the same story but in a different way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Story: A young boy is brought to a forest to see a man who will reveal the mystery of the tree-people, but is he really in the right place? This movie is an example of how great a story can be made without great acting, but excellent direction and the right script (as well as good direction and a good script can make a great movie... but not by itself, you have to work it). This movie was made before the days of computer-generated special effects, and was very realistic. There is a lot of good stuff to talk about here. The acting is very good here, and even when you see actors in motion-capture, they are very convincing. You really get a sense that this guy (who will probably be identified by the nickname of the hero, "Mr. Jones") really feels like you're in a real adventure. The story will take you from the forest to a town in the state, and back again in the same town. This is a nice and interesting journey. The action is very well done, and the ending was just great! You will be surprised at the ending, but I did. I did enjoy it. It's like a short version of the Lord of the Rings, only the magic is gone, but the stories still go on... and you'll be left wondering what could have been.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** ********** ********* The film takes place in a fictional village which exists in a small town in Japan. In the village, there is a high school for "special" kids, where they have their education and they live a normal life with the rest of the world. There is only one thing that the "special kids" don't know about the outside world is the existence of the supernatural. Then one day in the special school, a girl named Yuriko (Haruka Shiraishi) comes and tells them about the evil that is coming from beyond. When this evil is discovered, everyone jumps to conclusions, the girls, the staff, and the students. While most of the students are worried, one girl named Shizuko (Satsuki Takeda) decides to confront the evil head on. What follows is a crazy fight for survival, with lots of fun and action. The production values of the film are not really high, but it does a fine job at keeping you on the edge of your seat while it is happening. When it is not action, it is mostly character development, and for once, I believe that this could be a better movie if it was made for real. Unfortunately, I don't think it was. I just don't find the plot very interesting. The film is basically about Yurikago, the main protagonist, who is a bit of a misfit because of his small stature and a weird and strange appearance. Shizuki, the mysterious girl, doesn't take to kindly to her presence, so Yurika leaves and meets up with the other special kids, and decides to find Shizuku. The rest of it is a fun ride through a world of crazy, but at the end, you are left with a lot of unanswered questions and it just feels like it ends. I really would like to see some more plot. But for the most part, the film did what it set out to do. And it did it very well. I would definitely recommend this film to a fan of action, because it is more than just a fight sequence.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I didn't watch the first movie and I didn,t like it. The reason is that I don't like the whole "evil" thing going on. It's more of an evil thing that comes with being a human. But this one is different. I liked it. It has a lot more personality. There is a lot of humor. The character development is good too. There's a little mystery behind the story. Some people may find it silly. Some others may think it's clever. I'm going to go on record now and say I don?t think it?s as ridiculous as most of the other movies. But it's still funny and it's an entertaining story. The acting is pretty good in this one. There isn't much of a plot. The film is about the adventures of a young boy and a woman. And I liked that. I think there is some story behind this one and I would love to see some of that. You don?T find that in most of these movies. I also enjoyed the music in this. It was interesting. The music was catchy, very catchy. It also reminded me of a movie I watched recently called The Good German. The good German has a similar feel to this one with its cheesy music and a funny plot. I just liked that movie and thought this one was a good enough sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie, and it's a pretty good one! Story:    Not my favorite of the year (it was in the Top 10 at one point), but it does a lot to help us understand the motivations of the other characters. There's a very interesting moment with Dr. Fisk and the Feds which shows just how much he believes his powers are for something worthwhile. There are a lot of "realistic" scenes that are pretty convincing. Overall, the story is fairly original and interesting, but it's not quite the "good-bad" comedy that it could have been. However, I liked how the movie got into Dr. Doom's psyche a bit (his childhood, his childhood friends, his hatred of Dr. Manhattan), and how it explained why he is willing to go to any lengths to achieve his goals. The movie also had a lot more heart than I expected, which is definitely a good sign. One of the main characters was particularly interesting, and I'd like to see more of him in the future. Grade:   A-

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ You: So, I was reading the book and I was like, "Wow! There's a lot to this story!" And it was kind of an epic book! So I was super stoked, and I started to read it. And it just kept going. So, now, I've finished it, and now I'm about to start the movie. So I'm kind of blown away! What kind of reactions did you get from people? ____________You: I got a lot of people in the book who were pretty surprised. Like, "What, you're making a fantasy movie about this? Is this some sort of joke?" And I had no idea what that was, but people seemed to like it, I think. So that's pretty cool. You: I didn't know, too. It's pretty weird. You're also working with your brother, Dan. How did you come to make the movie? _______You: We were just doing all these experiments together. We were talking about the movie, how we could do it. You can see my brother's in the trailer, too, at about about the 20-second mark. So he's my brother. Dan and I were kind of doing this, like, kind of collaborative experiment with each other. You know, we were looking at stuff we liked, and we were sort of working out the film, and it just kind of came to life that way. You were also making some movies with your friend James Franco, right? _____You: Yeah! I'd been kind of watching him for a while. So James was like "Hey, I'm making some shorts" and we got together to do some work on them. And that got pretty cool, too! I just remember that we had really crazy ideas for the short films, and then we sort of found ourselves making them together. ____We did an entire week's worth of shooting in a week in one weekend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters were all interesting. And even though the movie was somewhat short, you really felt the emotions of the characters. This is not necessarily because I have a very high standard for a movie to live up to, but more of because I enjoyed it so much.   I'm actually really glad I waited to watch the rest of the movie. I got into this movie and was looking forward to a good time. I actually feel like I'll go to see a movie I liked, and I won't just get an okay time out of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** ** The Matrix is one of my favorite movies of all time. The story of Neo is as cool as it sounds. A new breed of humans is born that will change our world. We are the machines who will free ourselves and mankind from the rule of the machines. The last line in the movie "You must fight the forces of evil within yourself" is a reminder of that. The special effects are amazing and the whole film makes me feel like I am being watched by a movie god. I loved the whole Matrix story and I will miss it greatly. I only wish the special effects were a bit better but otherwise this is a wonderful movie. Recommended for people who like: The Matrix, Sci-Fi, Action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid movie, though I wish it was a little longer. It had a decent cast, a good story and a good action sequence, but as usual the ending left me a little underwhelmed. As a fan of the series, I was surprised at how much it stayed the same, it's basically a continuation of the first movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the first movie so much that I thought the second one needed a change of pace or maybe it would've been better off if it was the only sequel. It was good but not great and I do think it's a bad idea to try to start a new trilogy without introducing new characters. But the story of the old one is fun and it's funny. This one is about the two young people who become estranged as they are trying to make a living. I liked how they made it more adult than what I was expecting but this was just a little bit different from the first one. The music in this one was better and it was more well produced. The special effects were much better in this movie. I think the story was a little more mature than the first. But it had the same funny characters and the same fun adventure, and if you were to do the second part, I think you would probably enjoy this one. This was just great!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********The Black Cloud (TBA)********  Starring:- Aunty (I don't know what she's called). (Aunty-Aun, a black cloud is born. Aunnie-Aunt, a cloud has wings, she flies in the sky. It is a kind of a miracle that she is a cloud. Her name is Mab)  Story: I believe this is a very important movie. It tells us that love is a big problem in the world. Love is a problem of love, it is a real problem. Love can be good and evil. The movie is a love story. It also tells us the value of life and that we are not alone. We are not and we should never be alone. I found it a very beautiful and important movie to watch. It gave me a message of life. It was very moving.  Art: The art is very good. The colors were very bright and vivid. The way the clouds moved in the air was very realistic. (the clouds were not like the clouds in real life, they were more realistic, they moved with the breeze, it was a nice touch).  Sound: The voice acting was well done, I thought. I didn't notice the voices being very good, but it was not bad, and it was enough. The music was very nice. It didn't change my mood very much, but for the movie and this movie is very important. I liked the music and the acting.  and now the thing that bugs me the most, the thing the can be one of the best parts of the movie, the kiss, the way it is portrayed and I can't find the right words. A black cloud kisses a white cloud, and the white cloud is a little girl. I don't understand what they are doing, I can understand the story being very dark, and yet I think it would have been better if they didn't have the kiss. It makes no sense. I wish they had the kiss in the middle of the story. What I can say, the black cloud's kiss is what the whole movie is about.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I have been watching a lot of TV lately but none have had as much success as the "Lost" TV show and it's sequel "Inca Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor" this week and "Tomb of the Giants" is a fantastic episode and one of my favorite things so far in the series. The main story focuses on Dr. Hilda (Julie Benz) trying to escape the tomb with the help of her son and a priest and they run into the new queen of the tomb and she is no less than a monster. One of the things that is so cool about the show is the use of magic and magic spells as well as the magic artifacts and weapons that are used throughout the show. This show does a great job in showing off the best of both magic and science and also using these two things to its advantage to create some spectacular and fun magic moments. Another great feature of this episode is that the magic isn't used just for good but also for evil. Hilde uses her magic to protect a priest who is trying to kill her and to make sure that her son escapes. There is also a scene where Hilde has the power to bring her son to life as well that is simply amazing and one that I wish all other TV shows would feature. The story is a little bit slow at first but you are soon treated to some great fight scenes and fun action sequences. I can't speak highly enough about this show but if you don't watch this show you will never get the chance to experience the wonders of magical TV and that's a real shame because this series is brilliant. If you want to see the show then I would suggest this episode or maybe the first episode. If not then you definitely should check it out because it is a must watch and should be on your list of upcoming TV shows. See more

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I was very impressed with this movie. There were a lot of moving parts and plot twists but it was also a very well acted and paced movie. It also didn't have the cheap "let's just run and hide" feel of the other Star Wars prequel films. It had the same kind of emotional weight and I could feel the emotions of the characters. The plot kept me guessing and the movie even had a satisfying ending to it, although I'm not sure the film would've had as much success if the ending wasn't satisfying. I would say it's a very good movie that would give Star Wars fans a reason to go see it. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a lover of movies, I've seen a lot of films over my lifetime. This one I really enjoyed and a great story.   I've also reviewed many more movies including this one at time.  The film was based on a true story and also starred Kevin Kline as Mr. Huggins.  He was a real detective who had to solve the murder of a wealthy lady, who was found in her home. The story of the movie was very interesting and I think I liked the detective, which was played by Kevin K.  Mr. Kline was great and made the movie very entertaining.    There was also an excellent ending to the film which gave it a more "action-y" feel and it looked good, but it was not a great film to watch.  A nice film to be sure but not a masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers, or The Dark Knight Rises, or even The Dark Knights Rises. And no one wants to be "that guy" who gets all critical of those movies in the past few years and can't seem to get into new ones. But, I must say, The Dark Night is one of my favorite movies of the past couple years. It's very well done, has its fair share of humor and thrills, and it has its own distinct style and a unique voice. It may be one of those rare "mature" movies that isn't completely childish, and you can be sure that it will give you all of that. For a summer blockbuster, it's very stylish, the acting is great, and the action is impressive, but I think it's got a special something that makes it stand out from the pack. I also think that it's a good film to show off the potential of The Conjuring (or I thought it was) and the ability of the filmmakers to bring horror elements to the big screen. I think this is a film to watch with an open mind, and one to be seen on the big stage, I think. So, if you enjoy a good horror movie and don't mind a mature, dark, gory story, then watch The Dark Nights of Willoughby Manor. If you don't, then just stay home and watch something more wholesome.

However this film is different from many other romantic movies.  Instead of the couple being an unconventional couple that goes to the beach, this is more of a woman being married to someone she doesn't like.  I found this film funny.  There was a lot of laughter and a good amount of tension.  If you enjoy good looking people who fall for someone they don't love and love is not in the room, then you will like this film.

Please leave any thoughts or criticism in the comments section below. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ My husband and I are not huge horror fans, but we absolutely loved this movie! We thought it was the perfect way to start a new genre we love, The Paranormal. We have both been a fan of Paranormal Investigation shows ever since we watched the first one in the late 70's. We are in our early 50's, and just getting into our late 50's. I was really glad to finally have a show that matched up with our taste in films and was easy to understand. If you love stories with a little extra something, you will love this movie. _________________________ In the 1960's a young mother is found dead in her bed. She is not moving and the coroner is unable to determine the cause of death.  Two local detectives are assigned the case. They take a blood sample from the crime scene. They are told by their local doctor, who is treating the woman, that her death is a result of a blood disorder that causes a fast heart beat. They believe it has something to do with a drug.  _________________________ The show takes a unique approach to the genre. It is a combination of a procedural procedural, a mystery, and a horror movie. There were several scenes that were reminiscent of an episode of CSI. There was a detective with a lab coat with white coats and rubber gloves. He walked around with a handheld microscope that was pointed at the crime scenes. His partner was a woman in a labcoat and a man with a bandana covering her face and a large white glove that covered her hands.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Don't see "Hitchcock," the new James Cameron film, because you think you're too old for it. If the only thing holding you back is "Jaws," you can make that leap. But if you can't accept a story about a man (Hitch) who has been lost at sea for forty-seven years, you'll find it impossible to suspend disbelief. Cameron is a master at making a realistic story of human endurance. It was this quality that made him cast Tom Cruise as the titular captain and to make the movie's title a reference to the famous English poet, Lord Byron. But while Cruise can deliver his lines with aplomb, Hitchcock was more convincing as a man driven to find out why he lost his wife and son. It is the most realistic portrayal of a man who has lost his way and is forced back to the world where he knows nothing and the world he knows everything. The movie opens with his wife Mary Kaye (Gloria Stuart) and son John (John Saxon) leaving on a cruise and not realizing they have only three days left to go. Hitch was an inventor and was on the verge of getting a patent on an invention that he had made years earlier and which he claimed would give him a one hundred percent return of his investment. While the patent was in the process of being reviewed, Hitch was kidnapped and taken to the U.S. and imprisoned. It wasn't until decades later that he discovered what had happened to him. At one point Hitch tells the narrator that he thought that he would be able to return to his family someday. In this movie, he never thinks that. His wife and children are gone but Hitch, his wife's parents, and the rest of his family know that if he can survive in his new environment and find the time, he may be able return and reclaim his lost family. Hitch is a man with an extraordinary thirst for knowledge. He knows a lot of things, including how to build submarines and how to fight in World War I. He even knows how to ride a motorcycle. He does not know how to fly a helicopter, and when he does, he loses control, almost going into the water. He is a reluctant mentor to the young son John who has come to be fascinated with the sea. In one memorable scene, Hitch, who is trying to explain his invention to a young man, asks him, "How many things do you know?" Hitch explains that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was excited to see The Rocketeer when I heard that I could see it this weekend. I don't have many Rocketeers as I have one, but that was enough for me to see it, especially when the people behind it were giving it a positive rating, which I thought was amazing, not only for the movie but for the people who made it. The Rocketeer is definitely an adventure film that is entertaining and full of action, but it's also a film that's respectful to all its characters and the themes of friendship and the nature of teamwork. The movie's theme is an interesting one; I've seen this movie a couple of times and there are quite a few themes that you could take away from it. For example, it's nice to see how people can change and grow from one another and I think that the way the movie has to go about it is very interesting and well-thought out. And it's not like the characters get hurt throughout the movie as they fight and fly around the world in an attempt to save the world from an invasion. The world that the characters live in, the Earth, is a very interesting place, not unlike our world but a more peaceful and hopeful one. There are many different countries that the movie touches on and they each get their own story and their own plot lines. In the end, I really enjoyed the movie and can recommend it to anyone that's looking for a great action adventure that is well-written. See it and you'll see why.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ I thought "Mystic River" was a good film. A funny movie. There was a scene where the main character and his son were in the river. They were talking about the man who created the canal, and how he didn't care who was hurt or killed when he was working on it. The son mentioned his father, and his father said he wasn't proud. The whole time, the son was sitting on the edge of the edge. And the father said, "I'm proud of me, son." It was a nice scene. I was really looking forward to it. It was also great to see it in 3D. I love to see the big screen. _________________________________   Best scene: _______________________________________________________________________________________ (1) My favorite scene is the scene in the theater where the kid is watching the movie. He's watching the man play. And he's looking around. He can see people walking by. He sees a woman, a woman with a man. The guy with the man puts a gun to the woman's head. And it's the woman who says, "It doesn't matter who you are." He says, it doesn't, it only matters who you hate. And I liked that. It made me smile. (2) The scene where a police officer is trying to find someone. And she sees this guy who's dressed like a priest. He looks in the book bag, and the book is a crucifix. And when he sees the priest, he says, 'I have a problem with that.' And then he starts trying to get his wallet. But she says, that's enough. He gets scared and starts running out of the room. It's just beautiful. And as a parent, that was the moment when you go, 'Wow.' It was such a great scene. And in the script, it was called 'The Good Priest' because when the bad priest tries to get the guy's wallet, the good priest just stands there and he says it doesn,t matter who it is, it just matters who is hurting. _____________________________________________________________________________ (3) My last scene in Mystic River was in the last scene when they're in the boat. And they're going out on the river and it's pouring down rain, and they're talking about their problems and how their lives are going. And at one point the dad says, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And his son

If you liked the Marvel movies, then this is a good place to start. There were some pretty cool fight scenes and some great special effects. I think if this was in the Marvel universe, it would be one of the best films of the decade. A lot of people will hate me for it, but I enjoyed this movie so much. The characters were well developed, the fight scenes were amazing, and the special effects were amazing. I love Spiderman, but this is my Spiderman movie and I'm happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. I'm sure a lot of you did too.  It's about a young couple who decide to rent a house together because it's cheap. However, it is not cheap at all. It takes place over the course of 6 weeks, and it does not end before the end of those 6 weeks.  The plot revolves around them attempting to save the house from foreclosure by convincing it to become a cooperative.  But it's much more than just that.  You will find out a lot about the world of home ownership, and about why this is such a valuable asset.  And there are plenty of humorous moments.  I was so impressed with how much this movie put me in the mindset of a real-estate lawyer and a real estate investor. I had a hard time putting down the DVD after watching it. It has everything you would want from a movie like this. The plot is excellent, the acting is good, and the humor is great.   The DVD is available on Amazon and many other sites, but Amazon has the best price I've seen. I have no complaints about this purchase at all! 
Write a positive review about a good movie: r the next one is just as good as the last one and this one is no exception. I was so surprised to see this movie on TV, I thought it was going to be another one that was just about aliens. But after watching this movie, I'm glad that this is one of those movies that you'll have to watch in the theatre, but also be on the look out for the trailers. It is just that good! I have never had a better first film in my life!

Reviewed By: Matthew S from Atlanta, GA on 1/22 in Reviewed:  So far I'm in love with this movie. Not a long story, but in short it tells a short but action packed story. I'm not a huge action film kind of guy, but this film is great in my opinion. It's a story of good vs evil, and it's not as serious as it looks. It also has great fight scenes and a great soundtrack. It really is a fantastic film and I really enjoyed it. Now if you guys could please cast James Bond as the main guy, I'd love to see more action from this series!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crazy as Hell  (2017,  dir. John Waters)   There are some great movies out there, and the best of those have one thing in common: they are fun. Crazy as Hell, though, is a much more serious, mature movie about the sexual abuse of children.  As a child, I had no idea that a director could find such a way to relate to his audience, but Waters has managed to do just that.  There is a certain sadness that comes with this film as well, as it deals with themes of loss, abuse, and betrayal.  This movie would be great on television if there was more time to tell a good story, but there are no episodes available.  If you are in a position to see this film, I'd recommend that you take a few hours to soak in all of the amazing performances Waters provides, as well as the incredible acting that is provided by the cast.  Another great movie, even if it is somewhat controversial, if you like humor, violence, and/or great performances, then you can't go wrong with Crazy as Heck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A woman named Maria is a real downer. One day she runs into a man named David and says he's the one for her. David's a bit of a loser, but she likes him anyway. A few weeks later she hears that David was shot and killed. But David wasn't dead! Maria and David decide to go to Las Vegas and meet with the man that shot him. Turns out David is a cop and had gotten his name from another cop who was killed. They find out that David's dead, but he's been lying about it. A man named Peter has hired David to catch someone who killed his sister. Peter has his daughter kidnapped by a gang called the Slenderman. When Maria and Peter find out they go to save their daughter, they meet a bunch of strange people. It's like a horror movie with a cop in it. I'm gonna give this movie a 8/10.  An old man (George Hamilton) who lives by himself is dying. He's had a heart attack and wants to die in peace, but the doctors tell him he still has a chance of getting out of his bed. George is having his memories erased, so he can't go back and see his old life. But his old son (Joe Flaherty) has gone to California to find his dad. George goes to his old house and finds the memories are being erased. He decides to go back in time and change history, so that he can go back to find out what's happening to him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There were several different takes on this story but it all ended up making me sad. The first, and most obvious, was that the kids were a bunch of little monsters who had turned into children for a day. They had a lot of bad ideas about how to handle their situation but eventually came to a consensus that they were the victims and everyone else were the bad guys. Then they learned that the adults are good guys who wanted to give them a second chance in life. They tried to tell the adults about their monsters but only ended up bringing more trouble. In the end they all ended being in for some kind of a rough time with all sorts of things happening. A little girl and an older guy go to a party and end up trying to figure out who really killed their father and how the parents are really dead. When the kids realized that the only way to get away from the monster was to be good they decided they would work with the adults to change all the wrongs they've done. The movie starts off okay with a lot going on but it gets off track pretty quickly. It's not that the movie is terrible but its pretty much a disaster from the get-go.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer. My first impression: "this is going to be a rip-off of a rip off, a good rip-of-a-rip-of." However, I ended up really liking it! The story is pretty bad, but the actors are really good, the music is awesome and the plot is actually good. This movie is so different from the other movies, especially the American one, but it's a good change. If you're interested, I recommend going to see it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by marybeth from Excellent Film I saw this film about a month ago and I still love it. There are a few cliches in it but nothing too egregious. I did not understand most of the dialogue and the characters did not get much development but the acting was really good. I am glad that I went with this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur was released in theaters on Friday and I saw it in a theater that is known for showing independent movies. The movie was shot in California, and it was nice to see a film shot that way. The actors were all great, and they all did a wonderful job with the characters. I thought it was fun to see an animal that can tell stories. I think this movie was a great way to tell the story of the dinosaurs in the area. 4/5 stars If you like this movie, check out these other movies that I saw: Gattaca
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The plot: ___________ As an older, crankier-looking female, you'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger image for her in modern fantasy. But the thing is, she also happens to be the one who's actually capable of saving the world (and her life, as well). A couple of hundred years after the end of the Great War, the remnants of humanity live in a small, densely-populated country called Durotr, a land where the old ways live on, old ways that aren't going to change any time soon. There, people are still governed by kings and queens, and the whole thing is run by a strange, medieval-ish order called the Order of the Sacred Star (more on that in a second). When the order dies and the king dies of a mysterious illness, it falls to his daughter, Eliane, to bring order and stability to her country. That's where you come in. Eliane is not your typical young lady who goes off to study. In fact, she's actually the opposite of typical, having grown up in the shadow of her tyrannical father. Her mother, a doting old hag, died when she was a child, and Eliane herself didn't get to know her until she was an adult. She's a bit more independent than most people her age, but she's also incredibly resourceful and capable, and you'll want to watch her grow as she goes through her life. Elianne, as she's known, is a pretty normal, if not pretty stupid girl, whose only real skill lies in her wits, and it's only after she takes over as the Order's leader that she can show her true strength. That strength comes in the form of her magic ability. As she's about to go into the Order, she gets bitten by a lemming, a large insect-like creature that can be found everywhere in Durostr. Since she's only 5, she doesn't have any sort of magic beyond her ability to resist it, but it turns out that lemmings can be turned into something called "Lemmings' Eggs." So, Elianna is a genius with a bunch of eggs, which she can keep inside her, and which she uses to create powerful, durable creatures called "Lemmings." Now, the plot isn't as thick as it should be, but I didn't mind it all that much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just came out of the theater after seeing this and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I do not watch a lot of horror but this was well worth the watch. I was not a big fan of it when it came out because I thought it would be about a young girl but it is so much more than that. It deals with a lot more topics such as mental illness, suicide and how people cope with them. This movie made me laugh and smile a lot and that is all you need in a movie. My kids loved it too. One more thing I think is worth mentioning is the story is very very well written and very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It had a lot going for it! If you liked the first film, you will probably like this one. It is much more fun than the first one and it is a better sequel.  The characters from the first are back and they play themselves very well.  The storyline was the same as the first, but there were some interesting new scenes that were added in. I was a bit confused with the ending of the first movie, but then the ending to the second movie was just as good, just different.   I did not expect this to be the best of the four, but it was close to being the best. I wish I could give it a high score, but all I can do is give it three and half stars.  You're probably wondering why I gave it a lower than five stars. I don't feel it deserves to be a five-star movie.  This movie is good, but not great. I wouldn't say I enjoyed this film.  If you are looking for something to be scared of, this is not the film for you.  Overall, I give this a three-and-half-stars because it had some good things going for itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I saw The Big Lebowski on the big screen and I loved it. The plot is fun and funny, the performances were all great, and the song that played in the end was very beautiful. The director, the screenwriter, and cast all did a great job in creating a fun and unique comedy and I'm glad I went. The first five minutes are where I really became hooked on it, so be prepared. The next five minutes and the beginning of the end are what made me cry, I love the movie so much! - December 17, 2005You Must See This  Reviewer: Terence - favorite favorite favorite - November 20, 2005  Subject: I'm sorry, but......This is a fine example of a well made "slacker" movie. There are some good ideas in here (see, for example, the music). It's also the sort of movie you can watch again and again. But it's a bit too slick for my taste, for all the good intentions it tries to show. - November 21, 2005I'm sorry  Review of a good film: ____________________________________________ I saw this on the first day it was shown on the film festival circuit, and it didn't do much for me. I was hoping that perhaps the big cast of characters and the good use of comedy (especially in the beginning) would have redeemed this picture for me, but it didn�t. So I have watched it over and over and again to find out if there was something new or different. The only thing I could say was that some of the acting in this picture was very good, and I found that one of the characters seemed to get his act together and make a convincing effort, which I think is a good sign. Unfortunately, the movie is not really funny, at least not at first, although some of its dialog is funny. It has a "jock-y" feel to it, and many times the characters' reactions are very unfunny. But I guess the movie isn't all about the characters; it�s about the music, and that is a bit hard to make out without watching it several times. So if you like big-screen music and don�t mind some pretty funny characters, this film is a definite good-to-go-to. Otherwise, you may find yourself more inclined to go watch another picture.  - November 20-2005I'msorry, but....

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you know the name of that guy from that movie that was supposed to make people believe in angels but ended up being an atheist? This is the story of how that guy is trying to make that movie a reality. ___________ "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" will be released in 3D, IMAX, IFC 3D in 35 mm. It is directed by Peter Jackson and will have Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett and Elijah Wood. The screenplay for the movie is by Fran Walsh and Philippa Campbell and it was written by Philippa Cunk and Philipp Joseph Boyens. There will be 2D and 3D versions. Peter Jackson has made a lot of movies, but he doesn't seem to like doing 3D as much as he is doing it now. There were a lot that I liked about the 3D version of "The Fellowship of the Ring." There was a lot more 3D. The 3D is much better than the 2D. I was disappointed with the scenes with Gandalf and the trolls. The Trolls weren't scary. They were very cartoon-ish and I guess Peter Jackson felt that he didn't have a lot to work with there. The Lord of The Rings has been made before, so the world is very well known and it doesn't make any sense why Jackson was making this movie. It seems as if Peter Jackson was afraid that he might not have enough material. The book has gone through about 40 versions, so I doubt that Peter Jackson wanted to try to make it more cinematic. He is already making movies that are very different from what most people want. His next movie is based on the Book "The Hobbit." This movie is still being made, so it could be years before Peter Jackson sees any money from this movie, but I think it is a waste of time. He has never made a movie that I really liked. It seemed as if he had just done another version of The Lord Of The Rings and this one was more like the old versions. The movie is written by Fran and Philipp Boyens and directed by Philipp Joseph. I have seen the trailer and I can tell that it looks like a big waste of money. This movie will be the most expensive film ever made, even with it being 3D and IMAX. Peter was supposed make this movie 10 years ago. The film has been in the making

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a fun, light-hearted movie that could easily have been a comedy. I was so wrong, this is really a dark, violent, and violent movie. I found myself wanting more than anything and I couldn't put this one down. The acting is what sells this movie. You don't need a big name to have a great acting performance. You need someone with talent and you can look up to. The cast is just perfect and they do amazing impressions and do it well. There was a moment when the kid was shot in the stomach. I didn't really notice it at the time, but I would have sworn this was happening. And if you think about it, that's when they have the best stuff in the movie.

But after I'd heard that it was a "family movie" I was intrigued and looked forward to it. But my husband was not at all interested in going because he knew a movie about an older couple (he was about 14 when he saw it) that was way more boring. I'm glad he did see it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to watch an interesting family movie.

He's played by Dermot Mulroney, who also played Dermie in the first three Ghostbusters movies. He joins us at the bar to talk about playing a character who is so far in the background, you rarely even think of him. But here he is, one of the most important characters in the movie. Winston tells us about the origins of the Ghostbusters, about what brought Ray back to life, about his friendship with Peter, about how much he enjoys living in New York City. We get to hear a few hilarious stories, including some of Winston's first appearances, the one with the ghost-covered car, and a great one about how he and his friends tried to get out of a date with a girl who turned out to be the ghost. We also talk a bit about his family, his career, and his future plans for a musical.  This is a great interview and it gets us into a fun conversation about a great character.    I hope you enjoy this one, too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I was not expecting this movie. I know a lot of people that saw it, it's a good looking movie and I didn't expect a really good story. It was a little hard to tell what was going on at first. It's just a normal guy gets lost in the woods and finds a girl, which you can probably figure out. When he starts to realize that the girl is his mother (the movie has some great acting by the girls and I thought it was all very well acted) he decides to leave and starts running through the woods. After a while he starts noticing that a few strange things are going on. Like the girl was turning into a tree and all the trees are making this sound which the girl seems to be having trouble with (also the movie has a good song which really got to me). The movie is really good and the ending was really well written. I'm not sure why it got such a negative rating. It seemed to me like the story was just not told at first, and the only reason it became better is the added action scenes and the story really seemed to develop after a while. I was surprised at how good the characters were. They are all very unique and not the average kids I always see on the movies. The story and acting were good, and it is funny at the beginning. I really loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this film had a lot of potential, and I think it was the kind of film that could be interesting, in the long run.  The action scenes were good and exciting, and the character development was done in a well paced manner, which made you care about the story and the characters.  The movie has a great cast of actors:    It was really good to see all of the old time actors return for this movie, and it gave me nostalgic feelings.   There was a great mix of old and new actors.  The actors were all great, and brought their own distinct personality to the film.  I really enjoyed the movie, the cast is good, the director is skilled, the music is good.  What really surprised me about the movie was that I felt it had a "darker" feel and that the story didn't come across as overly violent and disturbing.  It is quite dark and is quite graphic, but it is not as gory and graphic as it could have been.  My favorite part of the movie is the scene where James "Cookie" Williams gets killed in the first fight scene.  In the movie he is fighting a guy who just tried to kill him, and he is knocked out, then he gets revived by some aliens who take him to a space station to train.  This scene was not shown in the movie but it was really fun and it is something that should have been shown.  At the end of the film, there is a long montage where a bunch of characters from the movie come back and all play in a musical number, and then the screen goes dark.  We don't really see what happens, but we see various characters from many years past in various situations with each other.  James "Chucky" Williams appears in a very brief flashback in the ending montage.  Although I felt this movie was a good one and could have made for a decent horror movie, it does have a few flaws.  For one, I thought it should have gone more in depth about the aliens in the film instead of having a whole lot of "just look at the aliens!" scenes.  There were a few scenes where the aliens were being introduced to the audience, and they were kind of bland and did not give any sense of what these aliens were.  Also, at one point, James "Oscar" Williams is just standing there in a hallway, staring at

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This film has a lot of good parts but is only a little more than a mess.  It also has a really great soundtrack but that is hardly enough for what is an overlong film that is more a series of flashbacks than a plot.      I feel that it does what a lot a film needs to do to become a classic.  The plot is a mess and not what I was expecting. The story is about a kid, who was born to a woman who has a secret, that her husband had killed his wife.  In the story, he has to live with this knowledge, and the kid is his surrogate and friend.   The acting is all over the place but at least they don't waste any time doing anything else other than playing kids.  I was surprised by the amount of nudity the director went through.  It is not graphic in the least, just a little bit.  There is some nudity but it is not too much.  When it came to the music it is mostly classical, although the music is also used when a character is in love and has an affair. I was not really sure what to expect from the music.  And I can only recommend the soundtrack.    The story was really a mess of a film, but was still a little better than the ones from the same director.  Overall, a good film but definitely not a classic."

It is also quite entertaining, with excellent performances by Jim Carrey, Diane Keaton, Tom Sizemore, and a young Jennifer Aniston.  "A perfect example of a 'cult classic' that is much better than it's reputation would lead us to believe."  This is an example of the best of the 80's, with a great cast, excellent cinematography and animation and a story that I am sure will be remembered for many years to come.  I am always looking forward to seeing the newest releases, and I look forward to these movies being re-released to theaters and onto DVD and Blu Ray.

It's rather abrupt and unsatisfying, but a great ending nonetheless." I think I'm going to have a hard time not giving this a good review, seeing as how much I really enjoyed this flick, I had a pretty good time watching this and this is not some cheap, shoddy movie. I was expecting something that I could not have really enjoyed, but that's probably due to the fact that the director and his crew are probably really nice guys and, as far as I know, don't like to make movies with cheap stunts, but hey... I'm not complaining, I really enjoy the movie, the set pieces are interesting, the music is good, the story was good, I thought the story progressed well and everything was pretty cool. It was a pretty solid movie and I think that the people who rated it so low are just not really into horror, so you know. I've always loved the movie and it has always been one of my all time favorites and, I don't know, I've been wanting to watch this movie ever since I saw it a while back and I guess now I can watch it... and enjoy it too, because I think it is pretty cool... and pretty cool is cool... ...and, even though this movie is kind of old, I am pretty sure that I'm still going to watch it. What a fun movie! It was pretty interesting to see how this franchise progressed and how this series of movies evolved into this. This was definitely an entertaining watch and I liked it. It wasn't the best film, and there were a few flaws, but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes horror and/or Sci-fi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's an excellent movie with great performances. And the end credits song was just a nice touch." I'm not even going to go into what a great movie this is. This is such a unique and awesome movie. Not just a superhero film, not just a love story, but it has a lot in it to explore. The movie is set in the 70's, but has a different feel to it. This movie is about a woman named Alice who is a part of a group that is trying to protect people. Alice discovers that the only way to defeat the aliens is to defeat their leader and bring him down. And that's where it gets interesting, it's a very different way of fighting. As the aliens make their way to Earth, they're extremely powerful, but they don't attack in any form. They use their minds to get their way and it's up to the group to stop them. Alice and her team must do battle with a lot of different aliens. It takes them many battles, but the end of the movie is pretty special.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would have to say that I had a good time. I am a big fan of the franchise and there was a lot of things that I enjoyed about the movie. I think that the biggest highlight was the scene where he is doing his audition, and the song that he plays to get the part. The song is a very nice addition and I think the performance is pretty awesome. Another highlight is when they put together the video for the song and all the characters are shown and do their part in making the video, that was quite fun to watch. The movie is pretty enjoyable and I would recommend it if you like the movies, but it is not a must see. However, if you are into the movies and have no patience, this movie is really short and very enjoyable and you should watch it for that reason alone. Overall:  I enjoyed the movie a lot. I found it interesting and interesting characters and the actors did their best in portraying them well. The story was a little confusing at times, but I am not really sure why that happened. The animation is very nice, but you can still tell that it is a fan made movie and it has that "fan-service" to it. All in all, I really enjoyed the first one, and I am sure that you will as well, I only give it three stars because there are a few things that need fixing in it, but if you enjoy the movies that much, it should be fine. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this review and would like to see me reviews more often.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have a problem with some aspect of the movie then leave a negative review and if you're not bothered, you can just say what you liked and what you didn't like.  What I didn't care for was the ending - and I don't mean that I didn;t care that they left it as-is.  In the movie there's a very subtle and long scene at the end where a group of people from a neighboring village is walking along, and they encounter a wolf.  After all, wolves aren't seen much on a movie, right?   At one point, a man comes by, and tells everyone to leave.  This was very strange to me.  Why do you tell them to go?  Is there a purpose?  Was there an event that is happening that you want them to know about?  The last part of the scene was very weird and I'm not sure if it was a joke.  In a later scene, there's an attempt to leave but they all say the same line: " We're not leaving!  There's something wrong here.  "  In my opinion, I don' t think they were there to leave the movie.  I don';t think they left the movie because they're sick of being there or they want to get home.  These people are there to make sure that they know everything, and this is a movie about that.   The movie is very important to them, and as we all know, we are connected to the outside world in a more or less real way.  So, they want their village to know.  The movie also focuses on their religion, and their love of animals.  As you can tell, they're people that want to see what is happening and they want everyone else to know so they can do it.  They want everyone to know they're there and to do it so that they can see.   What I liked about the movie was that it did an excellent job in showing the relationship between humans and animals.   I think it is one of the best animals are shown to human characters to date.    The human characters were very human and they didn't try to make anything out of anything that wasn't there.   They were also very interested in their lives and how they had been affected by events.  If you don't like a certain aspect of a movie then you can leave a positive or negative review.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I've seen this movie several times over the years and each time it is even better. The acting is the highlight. You never want to see a guy get shot, or shot again, but that's what we get in this film. It's a well done scene and one that has a profound impact on the entire story. This movie also includes the greatest performance ever from Fred Williamson as a former cop who has to deal with a dangerous ex-girlfriend. The only issue I had with the film was the ending. It feels rushed and a little silly. I loved the character of Richard's father and the scenes between Richard and his dad have a great deal of emotion. If you're a fan of the film "The Godfather" then this is a must see. (9/10)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight (SPOILERS) is an incredible piece of filmmaking, it's beautifully shot, it features some great performances and the story is great, as always it is a great film to watch on the big screen, with a crowd of cheering people, as well as the best musical score ever written.  It's an 80's style of cinema from the first to the last second. The Hateful 8, is probably one of the best films of the year, and is one of my favourite films in a long time.

I felt the movie needed to be a bit more somber for it to really work. I was just too excited about it. This was my favorite movie of the year. It will be on my list of next year's favorite movies. ______________________________ This is an oldie, but a goodie:  I think I finally understand why this movie is so awesome: it's based on a children's book by a Japanese author who is a real fan of the movie. The movie is directed by Kazuo Koike and it's the third in the series (which is a pretty big deal if you're a kids' movie fan). The story follows the little boy Shiro as he goes to visit the girl Miyako (Yukie Aoyagi). When they are alone, the girl tells him to watch out for ghosts: her grandfather is afraid of them. Miyako then runs off to the library and Shiro follows. They're then captured by the ghostly trio of ________, a giant turtle, and ________. Miyako is forced to be one of their sacrifices, but Shiro is able to rescue her. He's then asked to take her to her family. As they're in the car, a driver tries to drive over the ghost truck, but it stops in mid-air. As Shiro and Miyako are riding on the back of the truck, they realize that it's moving on its own. The truck then begins to fall apart as they see the ghosts of _______ and _______ (not the two they had been afraid of) as they ride up on the roof. Shiro's mom (who's also in on the game) shows up and tells him he's going to be haunted for the rest of his life. As he's being taken to his family, he remembers his friend ___________ (the turtle). The turtle tells Shiro that he was the one who saved Miyako's grandfather. Shuro learns this from ________ (the giant turtle) and then tells the turtle that he wants to be with him forever. So he and the turtle kiss and then the turtle pulls out a book and the couple begins their adventure with a lot more people and lots of action. There's a lot going on here: there's ghosts, it's a childrens

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time that I saw this film it was the first time I had seen it.  I had heard that it was an incredible film and that it could not be better.  I was so excited to see it when it was released in the theatres.  The film is set in the city of San Francisco and follows two guys named Paul (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nick (Channing Tatum).  Nick is a beautiful architect but is just about to be fired for being the "boy who cried wolf" in an apartment building project.  Nick decides that he and Paul will make a documentary about their project and to get his own shot as an architect.  There is an elaborate set up for the film in which Nick finds out that he must have two architects work with him to complete the building.    The set up is very elaborate and does not seem like it would be completed and it looks just like a bunch of little kids play building in their backyard.  Paul works with his "partners" and they are in for a great time and they work very hard and are really talented.  Their friend (the girlfriend) is in on the scheme and wants to sell the apartment to the highest bidder, which was a guy she had a crush on.  What I loved most about this movie is that I felt that it did not take itself too seriously.  This is a movie that is made to be fun and entertaining.  It was a good time and one that I will certainly be watching again.  While I was watching this film, there was a moment in the middle where a guy in an apron came out of the apartment and grabbed Nick's shoulder and started to pull on him.  Not only was this very funny and a great way to start the film, but it also did an excellent job of setting the mood for the movie.    I have seen the movie before and it was so fun and enjoyable that I was eager to see what happened next.  They follow the apartment building to the end and it is amazing to see the building finally being completed.  Overall, I have to say that The Boy Who Cried Wolf is a great film and one of the best I have ever seen.  If you are a fan of architectural documentaries, this is a must see.

But that's about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Matrix " - I am not a huge Matrix fan, I am a big fan of the movies, but not a fan of this movie, I liked the book much better than this one, I would suggest to see the book first before you watch the movie, you can get it for free on amazon, you might also be able to buy it at your library, I got it for only $1.99, it was ok, I was not really impressed by the plot, it is more about the characters then it is about the story.  " The Fifth Element " - You need to see this movie if you haven't seen the book, The Fifth Dimension is basically the movie that the book is based on.  The story takes place in post-apocalyptic earth where aliens have come and taken away the 5th dimension. They have also changed it into a prison for people who can't bend to their will. They then try to send an artificial intelligence to earth to get the 5ths back. The movie does have an excellent story, the plot is pretty good, the way the aliens came is pretty interesting, and the movie does a great job of making you care about the character's as they struggle to find a way to escape.  My favorite part of this book is the story about the aliens, they are a great idea for a sci-fi movie, but they did not seem very believable.         - Good luck on your next movie- Goodnight and Good Luck

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lethal Weapon 3" is a very good movie. It has great action and great story lines, but is definitely not the best movie of all time.  It has a great set of supporting characters, and that's about all I have to say about the movie.    But I still liked it, and I enjoyed it.   I'm a sucker for the Lethal Weapon franchise, and this one is a blast.    "Lucky Number Slevin" is another fine film from 1989.  It is based on the book by Michael Crichton, and was directed by Mike Newell.  This movie has an interesting twist at the end of the first act.  The film tells a story about the real life exploits of an actor who plays "Lucky" Slevnin.  He is a talented actor who goes by the name "Slevin."  He was on the set of a film and his co-star is an alcoholic.  When she starts getting too drunk, he is asked to help her off set.  Slevinn gets to the set before she is, and he and his partner go to her apartment to make sure that she's alright.  But once they're there, he and Slevine decide to help the woman that the film's main character, "Saverina" is involved with, and then try to get Slevinel on set to assist.  I didn't like the twist at all.  In the first film, it was a twist that wasn't as strong.  What really bothered me about this twist is that you don't know that Sleviner has done this for a long time. He was asked to do this a few years ago, but he and a friend did it before that.  And the friend is really stupid.  At no point is this explained.  So the character that is on the show is in fact not that character, and it is completely a different movie.   This is another one of those movies where there is really nothing wrong with it.   I just think that it doesn't hold a candle to the first two Lethal Weapon films.  If you liked the first ones, you'll like this one.  Maybe this is an example of the movie making a movie in which the director makes a ton of compromises so that he can make it look as good as possible.  "Lethals" was made in 1990

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was just plain fun to watch. There is just something about a great movie that makes you want to do other things too. For a movie with such an outrageous plot and an amazing cast this one isn't too bad, just very silly. There are so many characters I don't remember too many names and I think this is part of the problem.  The movie is very funny and it's hard not to laugh but I was really looking for a story and I was also hoping for more action and that didn't happen. Overall I recommend watching this movie if you enjoyed "The Big Lebowski".  If you are just looking for something to have a good time with then this isn't for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I had a good time with this one and recommend it to people that like an interesting look at human nature. The plot, set in the 1950's, doesn't really involve human behavior, but it is entertaining nonetheless. There was a lot of humor and character development that came through, but I couldn't help but feel that it should have been a little bit shorter, just because there's so much to be excited about in the first place.  If you're looking for a quick action movie, this might be your ticket. But if you're a person that wants to take a step back and look at the big picture, this one might not have it for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ... I didn't know what to expect. I was expecting some sort of horror movie, because that's what I've heard most horror movies are about. Well, this movie has some things in common with that. The way the monster kills the girl is what really scared me, but it wasn't the monsters that scared me but the way the actors were acting. My only complaint is that there are not enough people in this movie to make it an ensemble. If you're looking for some suspenseful, action-packed horror movies, then this is definitely a movie for you. It was a good way to start my Halloween season. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies but this one made me scared for a little while and that's a good feeling.

He's the man who murdered her father, he's been in prison for a century and he's so rich that he has never paid a cent in taxes. He even has the money to build a giant amusement park in his prison. And then she realizes that he's all talk, he might be crazy but he's not all that crazy. She learns that he can give her the ability to walk and talk and even fly. And she does.

" You never know what's in that dark, mysterious, scary, and sometimes evil place, and it's not necessarily so easy to figure out who's the devil behind the curtain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" is just the kind of movie that is always a blast to see. I have never been a huge horror fan, and I was not immediately drawn to this one. But, then, I was drawn to the first one "The Innocents", because of the actors who were really scary. And, while I never get excited about this kind of movies, it is still a terrific, well-acted and beautifully-made movie. The script was also very well-done, and the performances from the cast are top-notch. In short, you don't need any special skill to understand this movie. Just watch it! The Devil is a Gentleman  is a classic in the category of British horror films that were made in the late 1970's and early 1980's. This is a film by the well-known director John Carpenter, and was the first in his trilogy of "The Thing" and "The Fog".  This is also a great movie for its special effects, as well as for the acting. If you're looking for a great British film about a serial killer, then "The Devil Is a Gentleman" is what you should see. I have not read the book, but I am certain it has a good story to it, and that is one of the reasons I chose to watch it instead of just watching a movie on youtube. The movie is very well done and it has everything you could expect in this genre: a good amount of suspense, and very good special effects. This movie is definitely a worthy film and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first ever cinema, and this is what I saw. It's about the real life of a teenager, who is taken to a hotel by his parents after being told he is too mentally ill to have a normal life. A few days into his stay, his family are attacked in the hotel by a group of robbers, who he sees from the mirror on the mirror. The film shows the real-life struggles of the young boy, as he struggles to adjust to his new reality, while keeping his mental illness under wraps. It is a dark and emotional film, which makes me want to see more films like it. I'll give it 3/5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie did not make me cry like some of the other movies I've seen in the genre that are just trashy for sure. This is more of a comedy that I guess, but it is good, there's a couple funny lines in there, and there's more laughs than I expected to see. It's a nice watch, even though there's not much in the way of a plot. Recommendation: watch it for the laugh, but I'd recommend that you do not watch it if you don't have a sense of humor. I guess the only reason I gave this movie 5 stars is because it's the only comedy I've watched in the last couple of years that doesn't make me angry, I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't such a trashy comedy, there are a couple of funny bits that could have worked if they had been more in the vein of the 80's sitcoms, but they're pretty much the same. So I just finished watching a movie where the main character gets drunk and gets into a fight with his mother. I can't say that I was particularly happy about the ending, the character never really got over the death of his parents and just continued to be a drunk with the main love interest. There was also one of the characters talking about how they are going to kill their mom and have a baby right after she's dead. They're going to be such a great family in the future. I'm sure I'll be reading a lot about the family of one of my favorite shows ever, but at least I'll have more laughs about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The Good: The first film of a trilogy with two sequels (one of which is in the works), this is a great sci-fi/horror film. The Bad: It's not as good as the first movie, but it is the first in the trilogy, and the last one is a worthy successor. I can understand if you didn't like this movie, because it's based on a novel by Dan Simmons (that's me, back from the future). However, this is still a good time at the movies and it holds up. It begins with a ship (the Enterprise, a good sci-fiction ship for this time) being blown into space due to a malfunction of the hyperdrive. After all the trouble and distress the ship experienced the crew has made a choice to take a break (there is a lot of rest in space) for the moment. That's when a small black object falls out of a cloud and crashes into the ship, which makes things very interesting. After several strange events the ship is found by a UFO (there was a UFO movie recently, not to mention that the "alien abduction" movie was a huge success at the box office) and the crew are taken aboard the alien spaceship. There they find themselves in an alien world of the future, where they have to battle against "The Shocker" and his crew to survive. This alien world (called Earth) is a place where humans have become extinct, however there is still one human in the ship named John Harrison, who gets a little help from his "family" of four others: the engineer Will, the doctor Janice, the scientist and the security chief Frank. They meet up with the rest of the crew who are also still alive, and as you'd expect the story is based on these characters. So the question is, where do the aliens come from, why are they so interested in the crew and their ship and how will they manage to get the Enterprise into the orbit of this planet before they do. And if you're not familiar with the novel, here's a brief description: Harrison's father died in a plane crash shortly before he was born, leaving the young Harrison alone in the world. For the next 40 years he has lived on a barren planet, far away from all human contact, surrounded by strange creatures and his own personal "family." He feels that he knows this alien planet, and has always
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I loved this film. It is a simple but interesting story about a young man who decides to leave his family behind and travel the world on his own in order to find a better life. He is followed by his childhood sweetheart, the mother of his children and other people. I felt very sorry for this man when I had to see his film. He was so unhappy and had lost his family in his pursuit for a better future. I thought it was well made, it was really easy to see and I appreciated the cinematography. The cinematography and cinematography are really well done. The soundtrack is good as well. I really enjoyed this film and I recommend it to anyone who likes films with a theme of travel and people who live without families. It can be considered a story about love and travel which is very common. You can watch it as a story with a happy ending as well or as a film that ends in sadness. _________ See More See Less Verdict A good film. I like the story and the acting in the film was good. It's really sad when the girl breaks up with him, but he eventually decides to get away from her.  Crimson Peak (2017) 9/10  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film after it was first released. I was already a fan of the book (and was in the process of reading the screenplay as well) but this film made me feel it was a more realistic take on the story of the story. It was a great mix of old fashioned gothic romance and a more modern film. This film made the experience of going to the film enjoyable because of the fact I knew there would be good things to come, but I would have liked for the film to end a little bit more dramatically.

This game is not just a game, it's actually more like a game where you use your brain to solve the puzzles and you have to watch a cool movie that shows what you are going through. This is the best game i ever played. You can see the brain game in real time, but the movie shows how the brain works. You have to use your reasoning skills to solve your problem. If you have trouble with the puzzles, then just start with the movie and go from there, you will get it. It's one of the best games i have ever played!  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Wandering Boy"  - a small but interesting  film  that shows that the human mind and body are not always sufficient to carry the day. The film  shows  a young boy that is the "wandering boy" (also called a "gift of god").  A gift of God because his mother gave birth to him on the "wrong" side of the street. But despite the handicap, he always manages to show the compassion and kindness that all parents want to instill in their child. And for that, he has been called "a gift of god" by his mother.  The film is narrated by a very shy  boy.  At first the boy doesn't have much to say but eventually he starts explaining how he got this handicap and why he never wants to go back to his mother's house because it is always too crowded. The story begins with his mother telling the story of how she was raped in her home while the boy was six years old and her child became "the gift of god".  The boy's mother was very worried that if he never saw his father again, that her son would lose his mother. But the boy showed her the "grace" of a father by giving her his only pair of socks and his only book with him.  After that, it was a matter of time before he went to live with his father at the "home".  But in the meantime, his father's wife decided to take the child back with her to her home.  The boy soon found out that she had left the child at the side of a road, and that he was never seen again.  His mother and his grandmother decided to search for him on his birthday.  They followed the directions in a Bible that she was given and came to a small village where the boy told them of the "God" that had given him his handicap.  But the grandmothers didn't believe him. They said he was still just a baby and that a "little" child could never have any power over a big man like his great grandfather.  So they said they had to return the child to his "father's house", and the boys mother then left the village for her home as well.  Then the
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A movie with a really big "WOW!" factor. This was one of those "What-ifs?" movies that never seemed to happen. What if the CIA got caught spying on the Russians for two decades instead of just 10 years or so? I guess that's what happened with this one, but at least it's interesting and makes me think. _____________________________________________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by Vee from "One of the best movies" One of the greatest movies ever. It's hard to put into words the feelings I had watching this movie, but it was simply breathtaking. The acting was superb. I loved the fact that they gave these "bad guys" the same kind of powers as the heroes of the movie. I could watch this movie over and over, and never get tired of it. It is such a great story. It gives me hope and a future for our kids. The story is about an alien named Voorhees who comes to earth and destroys it. He then steals a ship and travels to another planet. One of his friends, a young boy, is on a spaceship and they travel to Earth to retrieve him. At first they're in a fight with Voorhies' gang, but then the young boy falls to the earth and is brought back to life. One day the old man on the ship learns the boy is Voorhes, and then he discovers that he is a killer. He tries to kill the boy, but he is too late, and he falls to his death. Voorhen, now a man with powers and powers to kill again, goes to his old gang leader and tells him that he will be back, and that he knows where the young man is. He is too much for his old leader, but the boy escapes and the old gang is all taken away by Voorhin. But, there is one problem. The ship in which the young woman is on is going to be destroyed by the ship, Voorhern, that has been sent to earth, and the ship is going into space. The only way that she will escape is by going into the ship. She doesn't know if Voorher will be able to save her. This is the beginning of her adventure, and she's the only one who can stop Voorhohe. The whole movie just blows my mind. _____________________________________ The film has an amazing plot, but is not without
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last year I watched all four versions of the film, in various theaters, and I cannot help but feel that The Avengers really is a bit overrated. I don't know, maybe they made too much out of some plot points, or some of the effects, but the film is ultimately pretty pedestrian. I can't think of any real flaws with the film - except perhaps the fact that it takes three full movies to get to any real story. But I don  I was fortunate enough to see this at an AMC Theatres theater, and when I said this was the first I'd seen, I meant it. This film is nothing short of amazing - from the opening sequence, which perfectly sets the tone and tone for the entire film, to the fact it even made me smile.   My only real complaint would be that I would have liked to see more scenes with Black Widow. I'm a huge fan of her and I feel like she gets fairly underused in this movie. It also wouldn't have hurt if the ending of the movie was slightly more epic (or at least less of a one-note "oh, we're going to stop the bad guys" ending). Overall though, this is one of the best superhero movies of the last decade, and the first Avengers movie is my favorite of the franchise to date. I would be interested in seeing this again in a theater near you. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I think it was my most spiritual experience in the entire cinema - and that doesn't necessarily mean that I was "spiritual" or "converted". It's that it was a spiritual experience from beginning to end. It's a very powerful experience, but that was also how I was most comfortable." In Conclusion I really like the concept of this movie. It presents a very unique vision of the future. There is definitely a future coming and it will be good. I don't know if it will survive as a movie, but it definitely is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This film is the most enjoyable and most intelligent story I've watched this year, but also the most boring. The first hour is really good, but the last twenty-five minutes are the most tedious I've ever seen a movie. But, like most movies, there are good and bad parts. If you're in to science fiction, the story and science behind the film is incredible. If not, it's just a boring science fiction film. The ending of this film is a complete anticlimax. ___________ The only other thing I'm going to say about this film, is that I actually want to see the sequel, because I think it will be better. _________________  Posted by: JAMES SHORE | Jun 15, 2011 8:16:30 PM  Totally disagree.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I went to the first film and saw the opening scene of the first movie and it was just a lot of fun. It didn't have any "cinematic" feel to it. It was more "I want to play video games." The second movie was more fun and it had the sense of a larger story. I've read the books and watched the movie but I never watched the series in its entirety. I didn't read the book and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the books but I was expecting a little bit more from it and it delivered that in spades. There was a little too much going on at the start and by the time the series was over I was bored by it and really couldn't get into it any longer. However, the movies are still a lot better than the books.

This is a movie that really needs to be seen as a live action film, not just a comic book.  When a man, named "Loki," finds out that his sister is pregnant with a mutant, he and his brother start trying to cure him, since their family's life will be destroyed if Loki is exposed to the mutant. They learn that he has the power to manipulate water into being a mist, but he doesn't want to use it to kill, so he puts it to good use.   Loki also has the ability of telepathy, and he does find out that their mother has been pregnant with the same mutant as him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I am an English teacher, and I was pleased that I finally got to go see a movie that I had loved when I was a kid, and that I still find interesting, and which I thought would make an excellent addition to our current season of films. And I'm glad I did. _____________ It's hard to describe a movie like this in any but the most general terms, because it is so completely unexpected and yet so perfectly executed that there is no way to describe it, except in terms of a movie which is so utterly consistent in its structure, its narrative, its story, that it can be easily described as a movie. As one who is a huge fan of The X-Files, I didn't realize I'd ever seen something like this until I saw the poster. For anyone who has been following this blog, you will find it strange to see this kind of film without a Scully, because there is a part of me that has always been a little disappointed in The X Files, and it is hard not to see XF3 as a return to form, a way of acknowledging the failures of the previous series, while still keeping it relevant and entertaining. It's the kind of movie that feels like a continuation of The Return to Tomorrow, or a sort of reboot of the film, and also the kind that would be great for a small theater movie, because everything happens so fast and so violently that it makes for a really fast paced thriller. The story is fairly straightforward: the FBI Agent is a good friend of the father of a missing girl, who has come to the FBI for help. They meet up at a cafe in New York City, and the Agent has been assigned to investigate a series of bombings in a small town in upstate New York. He starts off by asking some locals how they knew that there was a bomb in the cafe, and they seem to have no idea, or they're too afraid to talk to him, or maybe they don't know, I can't tell you. But it's not long before the local FBI agent, a mysterious man named Mr. X, has turned up in the town and it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary case, and is really something that Mr.X is involved in. After a couple of days, the FBI agent and his partner get an opportunity to go up in a helicopter and fly up to the town to see the evidence themselves. As they fly up there, the agent gets

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pleasant surprise! This movie is very good, and it doesn't disappoint. It has some cool scenes and great action. There is a couple of things that stand out, but I'll let you figure out which ones. The whole movie looks and sounds a lot like The Karate Kid, but this time there is action, which is what I really like about it. It is very entertaining and a great action film. I like the villain, who is very different from the previous ones. I really liked the ending, which was very unique and funny. I definitely recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ __________________________________________  (reviewed the day after viewing) The movie: A young man takes his girlfriend to see the movie The Wizard of Oz (1939) at the local theater, and they sit in the dark and silent audience for some time. They get to talking about it, and the young man tells the older one that he doesn't think he would like it. "There's nothing I can do to turn you on, but what can you do? You're just like your mom, you're just too weak." This is the kind of thing we all say to each other to make ourselves feel better about our feelings about something, especially if the thing in question is not that good. "I'm just weak... I just can't bring myself to care about that stupid stupid thing!" This is, of course, the exact opposite of what the man said. He was able to make it out of his shell to watch the film and tell his girlfriend about it. They talk about the film for some more time, and eventually the older man decides to go and see it. He tries to go out with her, but she rejects him because she just doesn't care about things like that. She goes back to her apartment to look at a painting that she just had framed. "It was just a beautiful picture. Beautiful colors. I'm glad that it was taken. I hope I never see another picture like that." We hear the guy telling her that he wants to tell her about the movie that's been keeping him up at night for a long time now. He tells her that even though she's just too much for him, he's willing to accept her in spite of that. Then the guy says to his girlfriend, "I'll be in there when you get back." He doesn't have a girlfriend, he doesn.t have a lot of things, but he does have the movie theater. It's almost as if the guy wanted to be able to hold this movie over her head so that she'll be aware of what she missed out on, that she might be able tell herself that she loved this film, that it is beautiful and wonderful. He is, and it shows. This movie has the most beautiful production in film history. It looks gorgeous. You can see all the little touches that the camera person put in just so that they would work in this movie, the little details that make this movie beautiful. Every scene of this movie is beautiful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Greatest Story Ever Told " is a wonderful example of what film can do. It's a fun, enjoyable, beautiful, and engaging film with many great moments. The story is interesting and the performances are superb.  The best part about this film is its incredible score. The movie features the song "Love is Strange" by John Barry and its a great piece of music.  I would suggest this to anyone. If you like comedy, a story about a boy and his best friend, or a great score, then watch this!  8.  Little Nicky (1988) A great little comedy about two best friends who get trapped in a tree and can't figure out how to get out.    It's funny, it's cute, it is sweet and it is very good. This is my all-time favorite.  This film is about a young girl, Miss Finkle, who gets trapped in an old oak tree and she is stuck there all day. She is very nice and has a funny way of acting and the movie is a comedy that follows the events of the day. The kids are always hanging out with one another but no one seems to have a clue how to free themselves from the tree. They do not know where to look or what to do.  What makes this great is that it is a very nice film. The acting is really good and it's very heartwarming to see these two kids who are such pals hanging out like they are all of a sudden in a forest. I can't really say any more about this. This little movie is really the best.  As I mentioned, it has a lot of good moments. I like how the parents, Miss Manners and Miss Finkle, act in this film. They are the kindest characters and it just makes you feel like this is their story as well.  I really liked this because it's a funny, sweet little film with good acting. If I'm going to recommend this to someone, I would tell them to watch this movie first.  It's short but it's really very sweet.  If you are looking for a cute movie, then I'd recommend this.   6.  Dazed and Confused (1995) It's a movie about a bunch of kids in a dorm room at college.  When I first saw this movie, I was a little confused. It was hard to follow the movie because

The only thing is, I think it's a bit of a shame that they didn't give the story of the story more time to breathe.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight  should be in every movie-loving, comic-book-loving man's collection, not just among the best films of the century but one of the best movies of the last 30 years (and it's only been released in its original version on VHS, which I highly recommend). It's a great superhero movie (as a lot of films are, but Batman  is the best), and in particular, the first half of it is really just Batman ides. The only problem is that it's a very strange movie. It is so weird it's hard to tell if it's trying to be scary or silly or serious. It's not always obvious what it wants to do, which makes it almost impossible to hate it. The film is, in a way, the story of the relationship between Batman and a teenage girl named Barbara Gordon, and the film manages to be incredibly romantic and romantic-comedy at the same time. And even if it sometimes sounds like it's just trying to write the most ridiculous superhero movie possible, it really is a fun, fun, great movie. 3. Iron Man 2 (2011) "We have a war to win."  That's the opening line of Iron Man, and it's true. The conflict between Iron Man  and a group of terrorists named The Mandarin is a very interesting one, but it's not really the only conflict that the film deals with. This film has a lot going on; it has Tony Stark fighting his old foe The Mandarin, his estranged wife Pepper Potts, a new villain called The Mandarin (and his henchmen), a new threat from space called The Watcher, the return of a beloved character from the previous film, and even a trip to a new location. What makes it so engaging is its complexity. Iron Men  gets to tell a complex story of multiple characters in an interconnected story. There's no way the movie could end with Iron Man defeating The Mandarin. But this film shows us how much is at stake and gives us time to see how it all turns out.  Iron Man  is an enjoyable watch.  2. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) When The Dark Knights was released, it wasn't exactly a big deal. The DC universe was a mess; the new film was a return to form for the franchise, and everyone was getting along with each other. The second film brought in Batman,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________Do you want to win a copy of The Book of Life? Click here! The Book Of Life (2015) Movie Review By: Eric R. From: New Hampshire I had seen the movie adaptation of this great book years ago in a local theatre and then again on DVD a couple years ago. What a great way to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Seuss! I was impressed with how the story was told and the fact that the film could be seen as a sequel to the original book. The book is told in the third person but the movie uses the first person narration from Martin. The film does not tell you that you should read the book (though there are some hints in the beginning of the book) but instead it goes about telling the story as though you are in the person's head, that is until he tells you of the other things he has done. For example, the opening scene where George takes his daughter to the park to play with the toy cars is changed. In the book, he had gone to the beach with his wife to swim. In his book version, he has gone to watch the fireworks with his son. However, you still get the great story of the man who has lost his way and can never find his way back. The movie has many moments of special effects, particularly the sequence of the boat going out of the water and the great sea monsters that emerge. The ending scene with the fireworks is also a bit of a let down. The characters are so well done that the ending, although beautiful, does not match up with the book. Overall a very well done film that brings out the best in its readers. Rating: 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!! The movie was amazing! I really loved it and would recommend it to anyone who loves good sci-fi. I loved the sci-finess of it. Great job!  Reviewed by RYAN FISHER, M.D., M.P.H., FACEPORT IN NURSING HOME MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO  This is one of those movies where I'm glad I'm not the only one that enjoyed it. In fact, I had forgotten how amazing it is until I re-watched it at the screening. This is a movie about how life is one big party and that you want to be a part of the party. That is pretty much the main plot, but there is a LOT of comedy and the plot is really a bunch of fun. That being said, it's not a very profound movie, because it's pretty much a comedy, and comedy is all about being on the edge of your seat. So, it doesn't get deeper than that. It is definitely worth watching for those who like funny movies, and it's really worth the price of admission.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I think this is going to be good. It's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but I've got a lot of respect for director, writer and star, Richard Gere. He's one of my favorite actors and the best comedic actor I've ever seen. I've seen him in many different films and have always enjoyed watching him and I think he'll make this one even better than the others. I'll also say that there's a great deal of dialogue and humor in this film, as well as lots of nudity. I'm a fan of the kind of humor he brings to the screen, and he really makes it interesting. I think I may have seen him a few times before, but this is my first time seeing him in a serious role. He delivers it in a way that just makes you laugh and I'm really looking forward to this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I really enjoyed this movie. It's a slow burn, but it is quite good. The whole thing about this is a very serious and gritty story of a young man with schizophrenia who wants to be able to walk around in society again after he loses his job in a bank. He comes across an elderly couple that seems to know of his situation, and the old couple's son and daughter have taken in a handicapped child from an orphanage. The old couple, not knowing his story, take the boy and bring him home with them as if he were their own son. Well, this goes over pretty well for the boy, until his mother's illness takes a serious toll on her health and the boy finds out that he is handicapped. But, of course, the boy's father, in a fit of rage, kills his own daughter by jumping on top of her and breaking her leg. The boy goes on a rampage as he kills the old man and his son before returning to his old home and killing his father and brother, then going back to the orphanage to kill his mother. The movie seems to get better, with the final scene involving some very good acting. It doesn't quite hit all the right notes, but is still a good little flick. This movie is a good time.  Read more
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this film to be an interesting departure from many horror movies I had seen in my lifetime.  It's got elements of horror, but not the gore that many films of this type tend to have.  The story is about a couple who are on vacation when they stumble upon a strange house, and the events that happen afterward are quite scary, if not a little confusing.   If I had to describe this movie in a few words, it would be 'weird'.    The story:   The movie follows the characters, and their journey through the house, in what seems to be a fairly straightforward, yet effective way.      As for the story, I wasn't too sure at first, but by the end of the movie I felt that I understood what was happening, even if I still wasn't entirely convinced.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film was very confusing, and didn't make any sense.  As a result, I didn't have any fun with this film, and I found myself lost as to what was going on.  If you're a fan of weird and mysterious, then you'll probably love this.  I know this will make some horror movie fans feel like they're missing out, but if you don't like those, then I feel you'll like this as well.  It's a good, though confusing, movie.  There's no explanation, no cliffhangers.  A lot of movies of this nature are better off if they have a good reason for their existence, and this has a great one.  Some will find that it was too strange, too out there, or too weird, but in the end I found it to be very effective.  If you're not a fan, don't watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** ***************************** There is not much going on this movie. That's what is wrong with it, but more than that there is not enough going on. The plot is a little weird at the beginning but it gets more understandable. There is a couple of funny moments, like the old man who is the voice of God. It's a good idea. Also there is the dog with the heart attack. That was fun to watch. The movie ends with the old dude who is in a wheelchair. He talks to a man named Jim, who is a psychic. He gives a message. I don't think it was a coincidence that he was in a chair. So there you have it. "The Secret of NIMH" I think "Nimh" is going to be a really good movie. I don't have a high opinion of the movie. It was alright. I would have liked to see the dog, the guy, and the old guy more. (A review written by an 11 year old who did not watch the movie) I liked it, I really liked it. It has good animation. And it was fun. I was looking forward to watching it and I'm glad I did. This is a great movie and I would give it a 10!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The last scene was probably one of the best I have ever seen in a movie. The movie had so much to offer, it was just so well written and directed. I don't know where to begin talking about the performance of the lead actor, but I will say that you will want to see him in any film he is in from now on. He has an incredible chemistry with his co-star and really gets to show off a lot of the emotions he can muster with him. This is an extremely intelligent film and should be mandatory viewing for anyone wanting to get into the world of American Horror Story.  And if you like horror, you should see the show, because this movie is so much better. A++"
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I had seen all the other versions of this movie before and I was quite disappointed because I was expecting something much better. This is the first time I have seen this one, so I had only seen it once. It starts out with an introduction to the characters and the situation. The lead is Dr. Robert Langdon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a brilliant neurosurgeon who was responsible for saving many people from the plague. It was because of his scientific knowledge that he was given the job of overseeing the medical care of the Queen. However, things get complicated when the Queen falls ill, and he discovers that the Queen's husband, the Duke of York, is infected with the same deadly plague. Langdon gets involved with the Duke's family and learns about the Queen and the Duke. The two families are at war and the Queen is trying to prevent her husband from ever having to fight for his life. Langdons and the Duchess, in order to protect their family from harm, start working together and get closer. Eventually, the Queen must decide what she wants to do with the knowledge that she and her husband will one day die in battle with the infected. It is important to note that all of these characters have their own motivations and actions that are not necessarily related to the plot. There are a lot of interesting and original characters in this movie. It has some of the more dramatic sequences in the film, but it never gets in the way of the comedy that is usually a part of this type of movie. When this movie started I was very disappointed in the movie because I expected a lot more from it. That was until I saw the ending. It's a pretty cool and unexpected ending and one that I didn't expect from the director. I can't wait to see this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- ( ) I watched this movie in the theatre and had an enjoyable time. It was very well made and very well acted. The soundtrack was also very good. --------------- I liked the script for this one, very good and I liked how it started, with a bit of a cliff hanger. However I think that the ending was pretty pointless, and there were some scenes that were not particularly entertaining or exciting (especially the last one where the kids meet the witch...). I thought the film had good visual effects. The animation was very good, some scenes were quite well detailed. The special effects were used very well and I was glad they used this. It would be nice if they used them better in future movies though. (5/5)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It is a fun romp. A classic buddy movie. I liked it so much I watched it again. It was a funny movie to see the two friends fall in love. It wasn't a good comedy, but I enjoyed it. The movie did have a few things that I would change if it was re-released. But I enjoyed the movie. It did make me laugh a little, but it wasn't funny at all. This movie is great fun, for those who love a good buddy movie, and can tell a funny story. It is fun to see two men fall in passion and get married. I gave this movie 3 stars. It just needs a bit of editing and to be edited down to a longer running time. It does get a little repetitive, and I would suggest watching it again, but on the shorter run time."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You might think that a movie like "I'm Still Here" is going to be some kind of weird and scary comedy or horror movie. But it's not. It's a sweet story about a man that tries to survive after the zombie apocalypse. "I Am Still Here," directed by Ryan Coogler, is a well-crafted film that tells the story of a man who was once in a plane crash and somehow manages to survive. It has a lot of the elements of a "The Walking Dead" or "The Revenant" or even "Zombieland." But it has a great cast that really makes the movie enjoyable, a fantastic screenplay and an excellent score from Justin Hurwitz. This movie is worth watching for anyone who loves a good good story about zombies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ This movie was pretty good for the most part. You have your typical "pinkos are cute" type movie and there's even a pinko who looks kind of like a child who doesn't realize that he's being watched. In the first few minutes, they try to get the pinko to come to their camp and spend the night but he just stands on the porch like he's scared. The rest of the movie involves a couple of different parties trying to get to the pinkos' camp. There are some great jokes in this movie like "the little pinkie got his foot caught in a fence and has a limp for a couple hours". This is also the first time that I think I really liked the pinky's friend who is more of a little dude. All in all, a pretty entertaining film.

It is a film with many flaws, not the least of which is its acting, but at least its main characters were interesting. And there's a fun fact for you: Keaton did not direct this film. The film was written by Martin Scorsese and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as two of Wall St's biggest stars. In the movie, Keaton is seen getting into a limo with a hooker (played by Kristen Stewart) when he is confronted by her brother, who is also a Wall St broker. That brother is played by DiCapio (who plays a corrupt New York City cop). He ends up killing Keaton and that's when DiCapo kills him. The movie does not have much going for it, but it does contain its fair share of violent scenes and Keaton's performance as the star-crossed man is still one of the most memorable in cinema history.  Michael Keaton as John Gotti on 'The Wolf of Wal... The Wolf Of Wall Street' - IMDB This movie has it all.  I love the acting of Leonardo Di Caprio. It is one of his best performances and he looks and sounds like an older version of Keaton in that classic movie 'Raging Bull'. The other star of this movie is Jonah Hill. He has that funny, rebellious personality of a lot of young actors who make fun of things.  The movie has some great dialogue and some wonderful music too.  It is well shot, funny and has lots of heart. The only problem of this flick is the terrible, terrible acting. It takes it way too far when Keaton shoots his wife and then kills the broker, but they don't take it so far as to kill the prostitute either.  In conclusion, this movie has everything. I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The Dark Knight Rises was very enjoyable and the performances were great. Christopher Nolan, as always, managed to portray a very dark and gritty Batman character that has a deep and personal reason for killing other people. Batman was given more screen time in this one and the audience didn't have to wait for a long time before he was back in action. The Batmobile was awesome to watch on screen. It was very fast and impressive and a great use of CGI. The Batman movies have become very predictable and predictable is where this one fell a little flat. However, it's not a bad movie. There are some things that I would have preferred to see in this film but I can see why it was made and it was enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It is the year 2027. One hundred years have passed since Earth was destroyed by the alien, and its last human population, which resides in a small town of San Francisco, is still trying to adjust. The citizens there are now part of a secret organization of superheroes called the San Francisco Protectorate. The protectorate was founded in San Francisco at the request of the Justice League in order to counter a new menace that emerged to plague the Earth-616 universe. The menace was the Beyonder, a being whose powers were based on the use of time travel.  The Protectorate is led by the Captain and includes Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, and The Flash. Each member is trained in order for them to fight crime with a superhuman armory.  and includes The Flash (Jesse L. Martin), who is not an American citizen but a former superhero from another universe named Central City. He has not only fought many powerful foes such as Shazam, Superman, and the Dark Knight but also many aliens such as The Chameleon, the alien who stole Superman's Kryptonian powers and the villainous Krona who had the power to control the forces of good and evil in the universe. 'Captain America 2' review - a decent action adventure film with a good villain at its end   This movie has a decent story and characters but it lacks in its characterization and character growth. The main problem with this movie is the plot and the characters are all based on an overly simplistic story line that makes little sense to the audience. The plot is that the alien being Beyonder comes to earth and seeks to conquer it but he has no plans of doing so but instead intends to use the Earth's resources for his own benefit. The movie has several different subplots and while some of them are entertaining enough, none of them really do anything to advance the plot. There are also several of the secondary characters who come in and out of the story line and while they are good enough, they are all overplayed. , by itself, is a decent film. With its story and its characters it is a worthwhile watch. I recommend this movie to all lovers of the comics and the comic book movies. It may not be as visually exciting and colorful as the first Captain America movie or as well designed as its sequels, but it is better in many other ways. The story is fun, the characters look cool, it has some great action

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ The first time I saw the movie, I wasn't really expecting much, but boy, was I surprised. This movie was pretty good and didn't really disappoint at all. This is a classic sci-fi film with some great scenes that show how far technology has come.  The movie starts off with the crew of the spaceship The Oven searching for the source of a distress signal. The crew are being attacked by a mysterious force and their ship is under attack as well, they must leave the Oven and head to the nearest space station for reinforcements. The station's crew, Captain T.O.R.N.G., and his co-pilot, R.E.S.O., are on a routine inspection when they get the call to be picked up. They leave and the ship heads for their destination where they find that the distress signal is from somewhere in deep space.  The Overn manages to escape the destruction of the ship and are soon being tracked by the unknown forces.  After some light space combat they are contacted by an enemy ship, The Cetacean, which attempts to get to the station. This ship is controlled by a sinister villain (one of the best villains ever!) and is constantly trying to sabotage The Oventeer, but the crew is on a mission and must find the source, and the one responsible, before it's too late.  This movie is really good, with good character work, and great performances and ideas.   I really liked the story and didn�t really hate it, because it didn't take itself too seriously, but I felt that it wasn�t the best movie of the series and it wasn't as good as the other two.  My only complaint would be that the movie doesn�t use the original language very much, which is why I gave it a 3, because of that.  There is one movie in the series which is considered better, but it is so much better.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ It's been a while since I've seen a movie so good I kept going back to see how it would end (and was pleasantly surprised with the unexpected twist that followed). But I'm going to end this review on one of the best scenes in this movie. It was such a surprise and it took some effort to find it, but it was worth it. I'm not going to give too much away since you need to watch the movie to understand what is going on, but basically the whole movie is a battle between two groups of soldiers in the trenches. In one group are the elite soldiers who have always been able to hold out against the odds, but the other group has been forced to fight in their own makeshift fortress because the other one has blown up a bridge over a river and is getting a bit too close for comfort. Both sides are on edge and feel the pressure to win, even if they've only just started the war. It's one of those battles where everything comes down to a single decision and each side is trying to get the best outcome possible. One of the soldiers has the advantage in a situation where he can just fire a bunch of bullets at his enemy, but then things get ugly and the whole thing is changed. The sniper is shot, and a sniper rifle is thrown in his face. The guy shoots back and gets his own head blown off, and now everyone is on the run. The whole battle and even the beginning of the movie is based on this point of view. We find out a little later that the sniper has no idea where his sniper rifle and is in such a hurry that he's trying to steal it from someone, and the fact that the snipers aren't shooting at the right places and people causes all kinds of problems. The idea is brilliant, and I would love to see it used again in a future war movie. I'd hate to spoil the ending of the war, but I'd watch it again just for that moment. So yeah, the entire movie is about a big epic battle with no easy solutions. It wasn't a total blow out but it kept us guessing until the end and that's pretty hard to do, but there is definitely some really good action scenes in the movie and a great set piece at the end to keep you hooked.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an amazing movie. If you think about it, all the actors in it seem to have a real connection to the characters, and the story, and there are many memorable moments. It was a nice surprise that it wasn't as "epic" as some of the other movies I've seen, and still made me laugh out loud. You can tell that they tried hard to make the movie look realistic, and even had the actors do the stunt double stuff so that the actors would be "in character". This is a great movie for all ages, especially for people who love action films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "All of the above," is a quote from this review: "a good movie with a very large supporting cast." I really liked it. It was also great that we got to know all the characters as well as we did. The movie had some good jokes, which worked with the rest of the movie, and I'm glad to say that there's a sequel in the works. The only thing I didn't care for was that the movie wasn't as quick as I had hoped it would be. There were a few scenes that went by too fast. There was also a bit of music in it that I thought was a bit obnoxious. I wish there was more time in the movie. There are some decent action scenes and the movie had a great final scene that really was something. So, if you want to see an oldie, you might want to give it a look.

The story has interesting twists. I think the best thing about it is the fact that the movie is made by a non-actor. You'll hear some good stories from people who work on this film. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies. It can also be watched with a group of friends and you'll have a lot of laughs to spare.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "All My Children" is a wonderful film that's so unique. It combines an honest, compelling and funny story with an artistic and beautiful film. It has a message about family, about a love for a family, and about making sure that a family that you love can go on to the next generation, and the film is a powerful and moving depiction of this, all while still being true to the story itself. The story is about four children that have been raised by their foster mother as sisters. However, after her death, all four children have grown up together and are now adults in their own right. It's a beautiful and haunting story about two families, that are so similar in every way, yet so different in every other aspect. It would not be complete without mentioning that it's beautifully shot, especially in the scenes shot in the countryside. The film has beautiful music, and is one of the first documentaries to be shot entirely on a mobile camera. The music is quite haunting, and will leave you with a very memorable experience at the end of the film, all the while leaving you wanting more, and thinking about the amazing film that is all around you. It is a brilliant film that doesn't just make you think, it makes you feel. If you are looking for a wonderful little film that makes you think and feel, that is made in a beautifully intimate and intimate manner, you just may have found it. I cannot recommend it enough. Watch it. You won't be disappointed! All my children is a 2015 British documentary film directed by Kate Bannister. All the children is one-part documentary and two-parts drama. The story of a group of foster children and their loving, but occasionally dysfunctional, foster mother, and their journey through childhood, adolescence and adulthood is a moving one, as well as one of sadness, and of love, and family, with the added element of drama. I don't think that I could have asked for a more wonderful film, or a more moving story. This is a fantastic film with a wonderful ending. There is no doubt in my mind that all four of the main characters, except perhaps for the most cynical of them all, will end up with a happy ending in the end. They're all so well written, and it is so rare for a film to have two actors who can deliver so well with such strong, believable and distinct voices. However, they all have problems. It

The action scenes are wonderful, the movie is not overly dark, and the story makes you think.  This is one of the more thoughtful films I've seen this year, and while I'd recommend it to anyone, I have to confess that I haven't seen any other similar films, so if you love this sort of thing, you may want to give it a shot.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, is one of the best movies ever made. I have seen it many times and it is always in my top five of all time. It is the perfect blend of a sci-fi and a horror film. The premise of the story is that scientists have figured out how to create a "gene bomb" which gives the person who carries it a chance to make another person. The thing that really makes this movie so unique is how the main character, a woman named Dr. Claire Randall is able to survive because of a genetic disease that allows her to turn herself invisible. The film is also pretty good and has an interesting story. The only problem with this movie is that when it comes to the final fight scene, which is awesome and well done, you will realize that the CGI for the scene is far from perfect. The movie is good for what it is and I will still consider it a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the spirit of the first two Hunger Games films I will simply give my score in the genre. I did enjoy this one. I had no idea what was happening or what was in store for Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and the other main characters and was very excited to watch them. The special effects were excellent. They were more like scenes from the books rather than the movie with the special effects that are more cartoonish and not as realistic as the book. The story line is a bit rushed as they are only shooting in the city and the scenes are in the past so the special effect is not as great. The ending is a little too much of a shocker to say the least but the movie is not bad and I can't imagine that anyone would not enjoy it. It would be better as the ending is rushed to make it seem that there is more story to come. There are some good moments throughout the movie such as the beginning of the movie and after the opening credits. Overall this was a pretty good and enjoyable movie and I think I will see more of this series.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last year's Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature was The LEGO Movie. It took nearly a decade from its 1987 original release until it became a hit. And while it has a cult following, it's not as popular as some of its predecessors. The first line of dialogue in the movie has two guys talking about how they should get "something to eat" before a big battle is about to happen. Then they mention that "someone's gonna pay for that" and they turn to the audience for a prediction. And they're right! After that, a giant mech is made and a fight ensues. The film was so well done that there's still a lot of people who think it's the best movie of all time. In fact, if you Google it, you'll find more sites talking about the film than you'll see about Frozen, Inside Out, or even The Lego Movie. If you're interested, you can find a ton of other reviews of The LEGO Batman Movie on my list of the 15 Best Movies in 2017. It's a good film, but if you want something that can actually make you cry, it might be better to wait until next year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Backbone" is a good film. I saw this one at the local theater and thought the acting was good. It was also a nice story and, while it didn't give me any new information or insight, it did leave me with an appreciation for the character of Donny in particular. I don't remember the title but it is about a young man who runs away from home for a job on the railroad in the West. He is an honest guy and gets on the train with the wrong guy who has already been picked up by the police. What follows is some good detective work, as he finds a girl who is really a man and starts to unravel the mystery behind the death of his friend. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I was able to appreciate it more than I thought I would because the movie was not overly violent, and I didn't have any problems with the plot. I did, however, have some problems with some of the acting in the film. In my experience, the acting is generally better in more dramatic films (think "The Man Who Fell To Earth"), so I feel like there was a slight difference here. That said, this movie was good and I would recommend it to people who are interested in detective stories or are simply looking for something that is not as dark as "The Shining."

This movie has great action, and a great ending! And not only that, but the movie is very good! There isn't much suspense in this movie, but there is a great amount of good action and characters. You don't have to have seen the movie to enjoy it, as it is pretty much a fan service movie that goes with the action. But the action is what this movie is about. The best action in a movie this year! There are a lot of different fight scenes in this film. It is also one of the few films with really good fights, and there aren't many. This is not a typical bad fight movie, as you really feel like the characters are in it. The movie was very fun. The film has a great story, which is also what the best action films should have. The Last stand is definitely worth watching, and you won't be sorry, so you should definitely check this out!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  My thoughts on the film  The film is an excellent portrayal of a child going through a lot in his early years in life. The father is an alcoholic who is still trying to get through to his son and who is not afraid to make the situation more difficult for him.  I have seen many movies that focus on families, but this is one of the few that really shows the difficulties that a family goes through at different stages of life. .  for more information about the film you can contact:  Bobby J. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Did you like this movie?: ______________  "I'm going to kill him." "If you kill him, I'll kill you."  I'm not a big fan of the first one, so I was surprised to see this movie as being one of the best of the year. I was also surprised to find out it had a sequel. I liked that the new movie doesn't feel like it takes place during the same timeframe.   The movie takes place in the near future. A virus was released in the US, and has caused a massive outbreak. A special forces team is sent to find a cure for this virus, but the team members are infected first.   (hide spoiler)  One of the things I liked about this movie was that it didn't try to tell a story of love and attraction. This movie is about teamwork, and the bond that forms among the team.  (view spoiler) This movie has a lot of action. It's all quite exciting to watch.  the acting is all really good. I enjoyed the different actors in the movie.  for me it was interesting to see some different actors play the roles of the different team members. I wasn't that impressed by the main male protagonist. Maybe his main role is more to portray the teamwork that forms between the male leads. For me this is a pretty good movie. It didn't have the highest score but it did get a 7 out of 10. This was the movie that gave me goosebumps.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********  The cast is amazing, the director is amazing (although he has done some films that were bad). It's funny. And I didn't find anything wrong with the movie. There are some little things that I really dislike but in the end, they are few. There is a scene in the beginning when the guy who played the father, starts to talk about a movie and he gets to the point with some of his comments. It was a good scene, not like the movies they use to use, with their acting, but I wasn't impressed. But when the man who played one of the moms says something along the lines of a woman is like a little horse or something I started laughing. And it was great, I loved it. And the director, I think, did a good job with it. He said it was funny. But it was just his opinion, he is probably a little biased. I thought that the people who made this movie are good. But they just got it so wrong. And you could see the whole movie and not understand any of it. The people who wrote this movie should be ashamed of themselves. But maybe that is what they are supposed to be like. So many people got hurt when it comes to bad movies.  "I'm a bad boy" says the protagonist as he pulls an alligator out of the pond, and his dad starts to laugh. But the guy, played by Sean Penn says "Don't worry son, the alligator's a lady. I just put a little bit of perfume on it, she's a woman. What is so funny?" Sean says "She's just a guy, don't get your knickers all in a knot, doncha know she's just been in a terrible car wreck!" and we see that she is completely unresponsive and he says that a lot. He keeps saying "she's a guy" or "she is a guy". He starts to make all the wrong assumptions that all of these people who are talking, and then starts to mock and insult their looks, to say things like "they have a woman's head" and things like that. And this guy, this alligator, this lady, is just an extension of the father in the movie who is just a jerk. The man says something to the effect of "I'm sorry to say she is not a good girl", and his father says "Yeah, well she's got the wrong guy."

What a fantastic film to watch after a long day's work and get to have a laugh. I enjoyed every minute of this film, as did my son."   -Nigel O'Bryan  Film & Television  In " The New York Times  "[A] brilliant story about love, sacrifice and courage...The film's script and its themes are a worthy reminder that we are all human. "   –Nick Hornby  Telegraph  New York  Daily News  I highly recommend this film for everyone, I highly recommend for everyone to watch it and understand what the problems and the issues are all about. "In a time when America and Europe are still grieving the sudden deaths of some of the best actors we've ever produced, a film by a British filmmaker is sure to raise many a few eyebrows. But this is the world's most respected living filmmaker in Kenneth Lonergan, who knows how to take the most difficult subject and bring it to life in an elegant, even touching drama. A compelling, affecting film. Lonergan's voice is a compelling voice. You can't help but be taken in by the gentle charm of the lead, who is a fine actor who doesn't need to resort to melodrama and melodramatic dialogue. In other words, Lonergen manages to capture the emotional reality of the real people whose stories he is documenting in his most personal, affecting and beautiful film to date. He shows us what really is there. We learn about courage, love, heartbreak, courage, commitment, love and a lot more, while at the same time taking us on an emotional and poignant journey. The best film that I have seen this year." -Mark Singer From the Director of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and The Impatient Urge: The Movie comes this moving documentary about the lives of three men: a former soldier (Jason Clarke) who's returned to London; an American reporter (Martin Freeman) who finds himself in the center of a worldwide war and a British doctor (Dominic West) who lost his wife and daughter
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" is a great movie!  It is based on an actual novel of the same name by the same author, but it is far from a hack.  The acting was top notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** The Good *****  I've seen so many of these films I can't tell you how many times I've watched a sequel to an earlier movie. The first one was so amazing, so clever, and so funny it was an instant classic, and that made me curious if this movie would live up to that. I'd seen the first movie and I loved it so much I went out and bought the second one to watch in theaters. My wife and I took our friends to see the film one evening after the theater closed, and to my great surprise I found myself in love with the movie. It was funny, smart, and even had a bit of a mystery to it. It also had a very touching, heartfelt ending that I really liked, and I found that it was a nice change of pace from the usual, predictable, and boring movies I've seen at the movies. The movie is a sequel/prequel/spin-off of the original movie, and it takes place about 5 years after the events of the first. This movie is much lighter than the original, and is just as good in some ways and just as bad in others. I was a bit disappointed in this movie, but at the same time I thought it was worth the viewing. The story is great, the movie has a good cast, and the ending was great. I only wish the film was a little darker and that the ending had been a little more personal, but it was still a very good movie. I definitely recommend it if you like comedy, a sequel that isn't a complete let down, or if you're looking for something funny. ********** The Bad ***** I would like to start off by saying that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The writing in this film is so bad, so cheesy, so ridiculous, it's just so stupid it's hard to even continue on with the review. If you think you might like this movie don't watch it. If that's your idea of a good time, then maybe try this one out and see how you like it. The acting in this is also not very good. I have never seen anything so bad and terrible from a person as the acting in the movie was in this. I think the director of the movie (who plays the character of Davey) did a really bad job trying to make a better movie. This was one of those times where the director should have gone off on
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ Reviewer: Meryl, Toronto, Canada Date: Nov. 10, 2013 I love the movie, but it's soooo corny and silly, I can't help but laugh. There are so many people involved in this movie who I think would be better off doing something else, not having people like this around. I like to see a good director work his/her magic, but the movie just has to come off so cheesy because of everyone involved. I don't think that any other movie can get a PG-13 rating, yet they gave it a PG. No one in their right mind would want to see this movie! I could care less about the movie itself, I just hate the people involved. Why can't they do anything else other than be people? I don`t care that this movie took 3 years, but 3 years isn`t enough time to pull off a movie like this. Please people, don`T waste your time with this movie. It will disappoint you, and I don''t care how many stars this movie got because it`s not worth it!  Rated: NC-17 for sexual content and language - June 29, 2011 (Audience ratings may vary by region) A group of young friends go to a lake house party, to be photographed by a popular magazine. They are having a great time, until a strange man in a mask, suddenly enters their tent, taking off their clothes and forcing them to participate in a "date" with him. Soon, the men find themselves naked, all tied to one another with ropes and being forced to pleasure the masked man, who they are told is a "professional" of sexual "extortion". A strange woman is also taken to a location, and forced to give oral sex to the masked person. The film is full of sex and violence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     My favorite movies this year were also the ones I saw first (which, for some reason, I hadn't done in at least ten years). In fact, one of my least favorite movies in recent memory was a cult classic I recently rewatched and thought was so good I even bought it on DVD. The movie is The Road. It's a classic from the 1970s that centers around a road trip between two different groups of people - a group of students and a group who just want to explore their country. It's also a comedy, and there's a lot of comedy in The Road to the finish line. The story is a little bit long, but you'll want to stay through all the movies in this post, so you may as well get through all five in a single day.   The Road isn't a great movie, but it is one of the funniest things you can watch.  I'll never forget how I first saw The Road in college - in a small town on the North Carolina/Virginia border. The theater where I saw it was about 10 miles south of where I lived at the time, and as a high school student it wasn't exactly cheap. A couple of my friends and I were all sitting around in the theater watching it, and all of a sudden one of them looked up at me and said, "You're going to cry." "Of course I am, you know it's all about the road," I said. That really didn't matter to him, but I can still remember being embarrassed at my reaction and feeling like such an idiot.  As I said, this movie was the last thing I saw when I was in college, and it is an important film in American movie history. It was the film that got me into American cinema for good. The Road is so good it has to be on this list. I'm not sure if you've ever seen it, but The Road's most important scene takes place right after the "Tales from the Road" sequence, when the car ride on the road actually begins. The film has a lot more going on in this scene than just a car ride - it's full of real people, people with names, people talking to each other and talking about the places they're going. It really is the perfect road trip film.  The people on the Road talk a lot about their friends and family and their travels and their problems. In the final scene

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you enjoyed the movie, please leave a thumbs up on iTunes or give a nice rating on this page. The movie is based on a novel by the same name, which was written in the late 20th century by John Connolly. This is a fantastic book. It's dark, but that's part of what makes it such a good read. The screenplay was written by Michael Mann, a veteran of such films as Heat, True Romance and All the President's Men. The film has plenty of action and action scenes. The plot centers on a family who moves to a new town. They go through life slowly, but they grow and mature through the years. It is a slow-moving story, but it doesn't drag on for a long time. If you're in the mood for something different, you might want to check this one out. It might not be for everyone, but you'd be missing out if you didn't see it.

I think the best way to describe it is like a horror horror but it has a bit more horror than a horror/fantasy. It is a very interesting and well done movie. The plot is very interesting that if you want something to go into a dark night. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good horror movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jakemccoy from a good old fashioned "horror" movie with plenty of action and a sense of humor The story follows a man who comes across a strange house on a wooded farm. When he gets there, he discovers a strange woman locked in the cellar with no means to get out. He tries to find a way to get her out but finds out that the house is haunted by something and he has to escape through the house. The movie is good and the story is good, the only thing that really got me was the ending. It was very creepy and made me wonder how the people living in the house managed to stay there so long without the house falling apart. I was definitely interested in the next movie, and it did not disappoint. , a good Old-Timey Halloween-esque ghost story with some modern gags thrown in. The film also features a great and unique villain (a sort of witch that is a bit annoying and over-the-top), and the film's soundtrack is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Man Who Fell to Earth (2011) - 7.8 A well-made, and enjoyable, sci-fi thriller. If you love space movies (I mean, why wouldn't you?), then this is definitely a must-see. Director David Mackenzie makes an interesting, if somewhat uninteresting, sci fi movie. The story is not too original, but Mackenzie has plenty of interesting ideas to work with. It also features the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the music from the musical film, Rocky Balboa. Although I found the movie to be a bit of a mess, it's still worth checking out.   The Man Who Came to Dinner (2013) - 8.0 This is, without a doubt, one of the best sci fi movies ever made. It's so good, that you might forget you're watching a movie about a robot falling through space, and landing on Earth. What makes it such a good sci fi film is its story: in a world where humans and robots are on a long war, a robot who is so powerful, it can destroy entire planets with one blow, and humans are trying to stop it. The plot is so intriguing, that the whole thing feels like a movie, not a movie. Director Tim Burton definitely knows what he's doing, and his visual style is so perfect, you can tell that the man really knows how to craft a sci fi story, so there's nothing to complain about in this movie. Burton's cinematography is nothing short of amazing, and one of his most striking scenes involves a man and a robot meeting in a bar, and then the man kills the robot, and gives the gun to the robot's owner, who proceeds to murder the owner's employer. This is a very interesting twist, that should make viewers feel something deep, even though it might not necessarily make sense in the overall story. Burton really knows his way around his craft, and this is one of those rare movies where you're never bored or annoyed by the movie.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "A simple man is caught up in the turmoil of the world, a man in love with a girl, her sister, a girl in love to a girl."  Gone Girl is a good story, even if it is slightly rushed. It is a very good and interesting film. The best thing about it is that the story keeps building up throughout the film, making it a very suspenseful and tense experience. The screenplay is done by Gillian Flynn and she does an excellent job in bringing the characters to life. The two main characters, Nick and Amy, who are played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are wonderful and you feel like you are in their minds. You get to know and love them in the most intimate and personal way. There is a lot of plot and development that happens throughout the movie but not to the point of being annoying. Most of the time, it is in the right places and you get to see the characters grow up and grow apart. It's not perfect, as there is a plot hole that you will think about for days, but it's a very well done and fun movie, especially in the second half when things start to get serious. Overall, I liked this movie a lot and I think it was an excellent choice to be released the same day as The Girl on the Train. It will certainly be a good watch and I would recommend it to everyone.

We didn't have the money to live in New York or Hollywood, but we love this movie."  – Chris Smith  THE FILM  I was never a fan of Michael Bay's previous Transformers movies, and to be honest I wasn't that impressed with the first one at all. I was really excited to see Bay bring the world of G.I. Joe back to the silver screen, though, so I wasn`t disappointed when he announced he was doing a sequel to this 2011 movie. In fact, I was even more excited when it finally came out, and as the first movie in the series since the first season of Nickelodeon`s We Bare Bears, it was definitely a nice movie to watch.  After being abducted by the Decepticons and being forced to fight and train them, and ultimately being used as a test subject for the G.P.S., Cobra Commander is sent back in time to prehistoric times. When he arrives, he discovers that the G1 Transformers are no longer just machines, but a fighting force of their own – and the time-travelling Cybertron is no more. Cobra Commander must use the power of the ancient robots to bring Cybertroids into the 21st century. He must do this before the ancient Cybertronic warriors are awakened by the time travelling, but he needs someone to help him. Cobra Cobra commander! (or 'Cobra Commander', as he prefers to be known.)  So let`s just get this out of the way right now: Cobra Commander and his allies aren`t some kind of secret society or a religious cult. In this movie, the main characters are really just human children who were given the power to transform into mechanical beings. These guys are pretty much just average kids trying to figure out how to fit into the world they live in. One of the main things that makes the movie great is that they`re portrayed as kids, and their struggles to be accepted by other kids, in the 21th century, aren` t portrayed as evil or as some big secret, they are just ordinary kids. , by contrast, is a much darker and more serious story that takes place around World War I.

It had the look and feel of a modern day B movies, but was actually quite realistic. The story is fairly straightforward and there was never a wasted scene. The action is very well choreographed and was much more intense than one would expect for this type of movie. There are some amusing and touching moments that make this movie a must watch, such as the moment where the character has a flashback of the event.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  "You have to look for them in places other people won't look," John Carpenter said in 1979. That's certainly the case with "The Fog." A brilliant idea about how people use and abuse their environments, the film presents an interesting theory about how the fog can affect an individual, and the things he learns about life can be life changing. This is a beautifully-made film about people, as the fog is a metaphor for both human nature and modern society. The film also has great music, with the title track having a unique feel about it.  In conclusion, I highly recommend that you see "The fog." It's a fantastic film that should stand the test of time. I also recommend it to those who think they know something about psychology. It may surprise you, or perhaps you'll find something more important about your own behavior that you didn't know before. , 5 out of 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit that I was initially apprehensive about watching "The Last Starfighter." I didn't know much about this movie, but the reviews I read seemed to indicate that this was going to be a pretty typical space movie. In fact, I thought to myself that the first two quarters were going to get a bit boring before we get to the good stuff. After all, it's always fun to see the main characters get into an epic fight. "The Starfighter" doesn't disappoint in this regard. It has great action sequences, some interesting characters and a great story. I wasn't surprised to learn that this movie was based on an old TV series, and I found it to be fun to watch. The cast is strong with a variety of characters all vying for the attention of Han Solo. Even though he has the occasional scene that's more comic relief than action, he still gets the job done. I have to say that Peter Mayhew as the role of Han has become one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe. Not only do I like his character, but it's refreshing to see a male actor in a Star Wars movie play a female character that's not a damsel in distress. Also, I liked that the movie included a scene where Solo and Chewbacca have a conversation. It seems like the writers realized they had made a movie with an audience that was more open minded and it made sense for them to introduce a scene that allowed the audience to see how Solo and Leia might get along. "The Last Jedi" is another fun and colorful space movie with tons of action and some memorable dialogue. The original series made it very clear that Star Wars was meant to be an adventure and this movie shows that it really was. The movies of Star Wars were known for their high quality, so it's nice to see that the next installment in the saga is going to do so much more than what the original trilogy did. 9.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I was not expecting to like this. I went into the movie with a basic, low expectations. I know how movies work and I know it is all made up of story beats and lines. I don't know how these people make movies and why, but I thought the movie would be cheesy, cheap, stupid, and just plain boring. It was a good looking movie. The costumes and hair were all great. The music was okay, nothing special. The story was stupid, but good for a movie. I had no clue what was going to happen in the movie. It felt like the plot was set up like some kind of parody. I could've watched this movie and laughed. There were some really funny lines. The movie ended with a pretty great song, but it just wasn't good enough to make this movie worth it. For that reason, it was a bit disappointing. But if you enjoy low budget comedies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is a great choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no other place to go to get your mind blown in this year but in the theater.  I cannot recommend this movie enough!  It is an action packed comedy that is one of the best of the year.  It's a wonderful blend of comedy, comedy, action, and a wonderful story.  The cast did a great job of making the audience laugh in the most believable and convincing manner that this film could have had.  I highly recommend this one and it would be a great addition to any movie collections.  4 out of 5 You don't know about the film you are watching, but you know when you are about to experience one.    The film is not afraid to have a dark subject matter.  This film has a story that is very similar to the old classic Black Sheep.    There is no love lost between the two protagonists, they are on opposite ends of the political spectrum.  But, their relationship is more like a brother and sister type of relationship.  They are both trying to find their way through life.  There are more surprises along the way, but it's not all bad.            I'd like to thank this company for providing this service. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ What did you think of "I Can't Believe I Told You So"? This is my first movie and the first time I am in a film. I enjoyed the story and the movie and I hope I am able to see another one of these in the future. It was interesting that it was a romantic movie about a man and his friend with many funny moments. I thought that it would be more like the previous two movies that were quite dark and more depressing. However, this was still a great movie to watch. I gave it an 8 out of 10. I hope it doesn't get a movie sequel like the last two, which had some great actors like Steve McQueen and Anthony Hopkins in them. This is a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is definitely not for everyone. It starts out pretty fast, with the story taking place over a few days. The characters are all somewhat bland, so I didn't have a problem with the plot. The movie has no plot at all, and is rather fast-paced. However, some scenes can get rather graphic, especially the sex scenes. Some of the jokes are funny, but not very often, and some other scenes just seem to be for fun. The story is rather light and light-hearted, but it's not really a bad thing. There is not too much nudity, but there are some. If you're into the kind of stories that are not so lighthearted, this is a good one to check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of science fiction movies, and this movie is one of the better ones in recent years. It's a nice mix of comedy and tension, and the film has some great action. There are some fantastic villains, like the super-smart android-human hybrids, which I think would be a lot of fun to play against as an android. The action is fun and exciting, especially the fight scenes between the android and the army of alien robots. I have a hard time remembering any one particular thing that was great about this movie, but it's a fun ride with some great scenes. I recommend this movie to fans of science-fiction and adventure-fantasy movies, especially those who want to see a story with some interesting twists and a lot to think about.

The director is a little weird, but that's fine, and I found myself smiling at the end of the movie.   I would recommend this film to everyone who likes movies that are a little unique. The story was interesting and the characters were very likeable. I really enjoyed this one and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, little oddball movie.

I really wanted to go but it was sold out. So we rented it at the local mall and it is very good, the special effects were great and the plot was good. My only complaint is that the ending was a little rushed. I had no idea what was going to happen, so it was a bit of a letdown. I did like it though. I hope that they do more films. If I have a movie to watch when I have time, it's this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I saw this on the last day of the summer, and the whole thing ran over the summer break and in the first few weeks after. I've never heard of it or seen it, so I took a chance. I saw it again after watching it a third time, but this time I got more out of it. You have a real emotional arc that builds and builds with each performance. They're really good. I just didn't feel the same. I feel the characters didn't get to have the emotional connection and growth that the lead, Alex, and his mom did. Alex's mother, in particular, feels like the least developed and not the most sympathetic character in the movie. I found her to be annoying and not even remotely likable. Alex is a good actor, but he's not a likable character, in my opinion. Also, there are a couple of scenes where he has to act out of character to be effective. But overall, the movie does a lot right. I can't wait for the sequel. It's definitely worth checking out. - August 24, 2013Best acting I've seen in a long time  Reviewer: katemcg - favorite favorite favorite - August 20, 2013  Subject: I really don't get it... I think there are people who are going to read this and say "This sounds like a movie about a bunch of teens getting into car trouble" and that's exactly how it is. But, I thought there was some deeper meaning to this...   The reason I bring up the other reviews is because there are so many things wrong with this. 1. They took their time writing this. 2. They just don't know how to act or read.  And it seems like they just have no talent, as in not that great at all, either. The acting is mediocre. I think the actor who plays Alex's mom is one of the best acting actors in this movie but you can tell he's just sitting there, not doing anything. I'm sure he did a good job, but I have trouble remembering anything he said. , I think you are going too far with that. I felt like the kids all just jumped in and started fighting and trying to drive the car to safety, which was funny. It would be even funnier if they had just had an incident and then the movie is about the aftermath. It was just a lot of fighting, and none of them were

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. The movie does have the benefit of being a prequel to the original. So the basic plot remains the same. However, it does have some things in it that aren't in the movie. The first thing that pops out at you as you start watching the movie is that, despite its appearance, it's not a live-action movie. It's a computer generated video. There are no actors in the film, and the camera follows the main character as she walks around a city. This leads to some very funny moments, and is a great way to introduce the film. But, it doesn't stay just a computer-generated video, it goes all the way to 3D. There's also a soundtrack in the middle of the movie, which is an absolutely amazing piece of work.  The story revolves around a young girl named Rose and her journey through the world of online dating. A very unusual girl that's never seen before. The game, on the other hand, is a game called "Matchmaker". This game takes the user and guides them through a series of online dates and also gives them hints, as well as helping them to find a date. In the end, Rose gets to meet the one of her matchmakers, who is also her grandfather. And the movie does an excellent job of making the audience feel for Rose. It does make the movie feel a little bit juvenile, but, there's a lot of charm to it.  and I think it's a pretty good movie overall. It is very different, and it does its own thing in the same way that it does what it does. And, in the end it is a very charming and heartwarming movie. I would definitely recommend this movie, as it's definitely a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I really liked this movie as a teen. The acting is ok but the story is too complicated to explain to me. So, the plot is pretty simple. The girl is a shy girl who is so shy her friend asks her to hang out and then when the girl asks her why she says because she doesn't feel like meeting people she usually hangs out with at the local park. She then goes to hang with them and things escalate from there. I think it was well done but I didn't like it at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Logan Lucky (2015) was just what I wanted in a movie: fast paced, fun, smart and funny. I like the movie, I was even a little bit surprised at how much I liked it. Logan is a young woman who, after losing her dad, decides to go into law. She is an expert in everything related to law but she wants more. While doing the interviews she notices a man in her apartment. The guy was in the news because he was arrested on the grounds that his dog had killed a young boy. She immediately gets the police involved and they discover he is guilty. In the end it turns out that the police were investigating him because of a death of a child in the neighborhood. In her investigation she also finds out that he is married and that they were having an affair, a fact that she learns from a friend of the wife who witnessed the affair. The film ends with the man having a very hard time and ending up in jail. Logan then decides to leave the law and go back to her old job as an office worker. However when she gets there she discovers that her old boss is involved in another murder in her neighborhood. It turns out the guy was also having an extra-marital affair with another woman. Logan finds out all of this and gets involved in a huge controversy. What I liked: There is a great pace and it never gets boring. The plot is really well done and it's very fun to watch. The characters are really likable and I liked them a lot. I was also a bit surprised that the movie ends with a big controversy, I thought the film could have ended really easily with no big controversy.  What could have been better: I was really disappointed that the film doesn't finish the controversy but instead with the big scandal. I liked the whole story, but it seemed to me that there was something missing. I know the film is quite short but I would have liked to see more. I hope this movie will be better than it was.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. _________. _______. ______________________. ______________________________________________________________.  Helpful Tips for Watching a Movie  If you have never been to the movies before, take a few minutes and go to the nearest cinema to get a feel for the type of movies that are shown. Theaters will usually have information on the screen that can help you figure out where to sit and what the atmosphere should be like, as well as what time the show begins. If you don't have a time, then you can always find the nearest place where you will be able to see a movie (such as the park). Theater seating can be a bit uncomfortable for people with back problems, so you might want to ask a person at the cinema for help. They can help with some back support, and it might help you with your back pain.    If your favorite movie is not showing at the theater, then go to a video store or a library and find a copy that is available at no charge. Most libraries have a computer that is accessible to the public, but there are some that charge you a fee to access this resource.  a few days later to see what else is available. You should try out new things that you hadn't seen before. You can read books, watch movies, take pictures, and play with electronics.   Some movies are not really for everyone. Some of them are more for young kids, some are more adult oriented, and some are just not very good movies. If a movie has a warning tag on the front cover that says "This movie contains sexual material" then you might consider watching it. Most of the movies that contain sexual material are actually designed to make the viewer feel dirty. So if you have a tendency to feel dirty when you see a certain kind of movie, then maybe you should give this one a try.  of movies, the "normal" people, and the people in the movie theater who are not your friends. Don't expect this movie to make you feel better about yourself. It is just a comedy. But if you do watch it, then it will show you something about yourself that you have not thought about before. That's the whole point of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're a good person, you just gotta try harder" The film's first act was the introduction of the two characters, who play the roles of the older sisters who have gone to school together. A teacher notices their resemblance and has the two of them meet and the teacher gets the idea that they both have some sort of secret. This idea becomes a plot and they find themselves caught in a crime, which makes them realize their hidden motives. As a child I thought this was a good choice as it is a story that kids can relate to. The fact that there is a mystery makes it more believable than most films in which it is used. The movie has a good balance of comedy and emotion which helps the audience. The music in the film is also quite good, and the voice acting is on par with many other Japanese films of this type. Overall the film has a story about two people who have a secret that they are determined to find out. The film's ending gives the audience an ending that I will be sure to watch in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is it: The film is loosely based on the popular novel by Philip Roth. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as Joe, a man who meets the love of his life, Julia (Mia Wasikowska) at a party, which they spend together at the house of their friends. But Joe soon discovers that Julia has a secret and a dark side, while her husband is busy chasing her, and trying to get back at her for something they both did. So Joe is left to try to figure out the truth. (The title comes from a lyric from the song by The Velvet Underground: " What does love mean? It means life / It means death / It doesn't mean anything at all.) What we said before: We can't wait to see the film and will surely be seeing it as soon as it's available. What else: The movie is set for release on Christmas Day in North America. The film was directed by Matthew McConaughey ( True Detective, The Dallas Buyers Club, A Serious Man ) and stars Philip and Mia Wasikowski ( The Talented Mr. Ripley ), Joel Edgerton ( The Master, American Sniper ), and Patrick Stewart ( Star Trek ). The film has received raves for its performances by everyone involved. Here's the trailer:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I'm so happy that this movie is coming back to the cinema screen. I can't wait to see it! " " I've always loved the movies by David Fincher. I'm excited that a remake is being made. " A sequel to David F. Sandberg's cult classic  American Beauty (2009)  was released in 2006 with a much better director, but still failed to capture the critical and commercial attention that was so critical.  The film was directed by David Cronenberg with  a script written by Finchey and David Wain ( The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ). The film's director of photography was Paul Verhoeven ( Fight Club, Total Recall) and the film was filmed in anamorphic Widescreen 35mm film, with 2:35 aspect ratio, and 2.5:1 widescreen 16mm, widespectrum. While Finches original  American beauty  did a pretty good job depicting the relationships of a middle class suburban couple, Finche's remake seemed to play it more for a "you're a loser if you don't" and more for "you'll never amount to anything if you can't be a winner". For me, the story never resonated, while the cast and characters were all pretty good. It was never a terrible film, and the main characters were still pretty likable. However, the storyline of the film seemed to be much more focused on the relationships between two of the protagonists rather than the relationship between the protagonist and the supporting cast.  While I personally didn't enjoy Cronenberg's take on the story of American Beauty, this remake seems to do a much worse job in this regard, especially because of the fact that its director and screenwriter seem to have been inspired by David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Lost Highway). The story opens up at a family reunion at a country club. Two friends from the 1970's who are trying to recapture the innocence of the times, while also trying to impress their parents, have one more thing in mind when they come back to town; a "beautiful girl" they have been meeting at the country club for months and know is an escort. The girls are friends, and although the young woman in question (who is actually an escort in the sense of prostitution) is "sexy" (in the sense that she's a pretty young woman with a nice body and looks), neither

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man With One Red Shoe  is a film that I haven't been able to put down.  It is a dark story about the dark deeds of two men and their attempts to cover up their criminal acts by hiring a corrupt cop to plant evidence.  I was a bit nervous about seeing The Man With Two Red Shoes  on the big screen.  As someone who enjoys a good noir film I don't normally go into a film fearing for my life.  I had seen a few noirs and even seen the first  The Man Without A Face  but this one I thought might be too much for me.  It didn't disappoint.  The story is about a cop that tries to cover for a murderer, who has been locked up for 10 years.  When the cop comes out of jail he finds the body of the murdered man and has to deal with his conscience.   The Man with One Red shoe  has plenty of action.  Some scenes are very violent but this is the way it is done.   This film is based on an excellent book by Anthony Burgess.  Burgess is a great writer who has never really hit it big so he is able to take these lesser known noirs and make them as good as they can be.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________, "Weird Al" Yankovic, "The Day After Tomorrow," is not merely a funny film about how we should take all the good things about the present and throw them away in the hope that some day there'll be a better one, but it is also an intelligent examination of the history of war and the way we've come to understand it. The story of the United States' involvement in World War I, the movie is told by Yankovich's character in flashback in which he is a young Marine Corps officer who decides that "it's time to give a big war speech about why the world must not, shall not, and will not, repeat." The film takes place during the Great War in the modern day. Yankovics great line is: "You may think this is the war to end all wars, but the truth is it could just as easily start a new one."  Director: Joe Berlinger, "I Have to Give It Up" This is a hard to watch film, but I have to give it it's credit for at least trying something different. The film's title comes from the poem by John Keats. "I have to Give it Up" is based on the fact that Keats was a devout alcoholic who left a wife and daughter behind when he went off to fight for the British in the Crimean War in 1854. Keats had left for the war only months before his wife had gone into labor and so his daughter, Alice (who he did not even know was a girl until she told him), was born four days before his death. Keatsy's wife, a devout Methodist minister named Lydia, became his advocate, not only to his daughters but also to him. Keating was deeply touched by the way his daughters would watch him with them, while she was trying to read from the Bible, and would whisper, "You've been a great father," or "You're a great husband," into his ear and then sit down to read. Keaton played this sort of role brilliantly. Keatic has a great performance, and while this was made in the '40s, the character is a great mix of the realistic and the comic. As a soldier on the front line of a war, Keatty's real life war experiences have a kind of intimacy to them that allows him to act on them. He does things that seem stupid, yet he's the only one of the men present
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I just finished the film "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but after I finished it, I sat down to watch another movie that I thought would be as good, but with more action and sex.   So the other day I was watching it, and I'm like, "I wish there was more of that." So then I started listening to the soundtrack to see what it would be like. Turns out that there is a lot of sex in this film, which is great, except for a lot more action in this movie.   He was definitely on to something good when he wrote this one.

It's not really worth watching just for the story but to see the beautiful artistry of the art directors and animation masters at work. The ending could've been better but it's better than anything else out there so no complaints here.]

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My first time to see this movie and it was a great start to a great day of viewing." 4/5 Buddy: A Christmas Carol  (1943) Rated R for the violence, profanity, and suggestive content, this is one of the first Christmas films ever made. It shows a Christmas-themed adventure with the usual family problems, but this time it's about a family's Christmas tradition of putting on a holiday play. The most notable thing is the song, "The Star-Spangled Banner," by Gilbert and Sullivan. 6/5  "I don't think this is the greatest Christmas picture ever made, but it's the best one I've seen in years. It has a great set of characters and a really well-done musical number about Christmas. If you haven't seen it, you will like it. The movie is about a rich man's son, who has come back from a vacation to discover that his father is going to sell the family business. He's not the richest man in the world, so he decides to take the family down a road that will give them a chance to make a living at something else, but not the one their father does. The story is just the same as one in Gilbert and Wagner's 'The Taming of the Shrew,' but with a great Christmas atmosphere. It was one of those rare movies that had all the elements needed to be a great movie. The actors all were great." 6.5/10 "It is the holiday season. The theme of the film is the merry season and the family is looking forward to the Christmas party. They all have a great time playing and singing. It is a fine picture that has a fine Christmas story. I don't mind singing this film as I enjoy the music. It isn't too musical and has a good story. There is nothing else to say about this picture, and it is a very enjoyable one." 8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Did I like this movie? __________ Do I want to see it again? _____ What did I like best about this movie: How the two brothers are portrayed as a couple and the way they try to be friends to each other. The way the girls react to their relationship is also quite funny. I was a little disappointed that most of the movie is about the brothers fighting each other rather than being together. Was this movie worth it?    This was my first time watching this movie. I really enjoyed it, though. It had the same ending that all the Disney movies have: the brother gets the girl, but they don't end up together. I'm glad this movie made it on the list, as it really was a good comedy movie that you should definitely check out. It's just that, when you think about it, why would two brothers ever be in a relationship with each other? It's a strange thing to put together, but it's a very entertaining movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" is a good film, but it has some problems.  I will start with its dialogue.  Luke is a bad guy but the dialogue is a big part of this.   The dialog is cheesy, unoriginal and feels like it came out of an 80s B-movie (it does).  But the dialogue still manages to be humorous.  It makes me smile and laugh out loud.  This isn't all.  The cinematography is a little bland, although the visual effects are spectacular.  We even get the lightsaber that is seen in the first two films.  Also, the "The Force Awakens" is on here.  And it is amazing.  You will notice the new creatures in "The Last Jedi."  And the first scene with the new characters is hilarious.  But I must say that the music that is used in "Star Wars The Last Jedi" has a "Lonely Hearts" feel.  Maybe that is because it has the same composer as the first film, who also scored the first movie.  If you like the first three "Star wars" films, you will like "The Jedi Journey."  If not, you can find more enjoyment in the other three movies.  What does work for me are the performances, and I'll try to keep them short.  Rian Johnson's directing is fantastic.  He is very skilled and I love him.  My only complaint is that I wish that he used a different composer, or a new score, as his music is wonderful.  So, a very good movie with some problems, but good all the same. Share this: Reddit The film is based on the classic Star Wars novel "The Phantom Menace" by Alan Dean Foster.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ I saw this film at the movie theater. I think I should have seen it in a theater. It has the best action I have seen in a long time, I have to give it that. It's really exciting to watch the main character, Boon Bong Joon, destroy an enemy ship with an air shot. He gets really good at it, and it is a great way to end the movie. There is some good dialog, and I loved when Boon tries to win the girl. The action is good, there are also some funny scenes and a little bit of romance. You should see this if you are a fan of action. You will love it!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "An awesome film about a young woman who is trying to survive in the city after the war and has her life turned upside down by the death of her boyfriend and her best friend, who are both killed in the same car accident."  - John Adams, Boston Globe  © 2016 IFC Midnight  Watch the trailer, then read the article below.  Bruised and damaged by her father's death in the war, a beautiful young woman named Rachel (Natalie Portman) gets the unexpected surprise of a lifetime when she is thrust into a situation that will force her to reevaluate everything she has ever known.    The film was shot in an extremely challenging period and the cinematography is extremely well-judged and detailed. The performances are phenomenal: Portman in particular is one of the best actors of her generation, but she is also an extraordinary director as she manages to capture the raw emotion of a life-and-death situation in a compellingly naturalistic way. .

The worst was one where the entire movie felt like it was trying to be something it wasn't. I'll be trying to watch one of these next, just to get to the end. A movie like this is not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the funniest movie I have ever seen. The characters are so likable. There are great gags. It is great that these kids don't even look that much like their parents. They all seem to have the same voice. I can't believe how well this movie turned out to be. I don't know how this was able to be done in the time frame that it was. This was made in 1987, the same year that "The Breakfast Club" was made. This movie has a lot of great qualities. It was funny, it was sad, it had some action, and it was a pretty good movie. The only thing I don' t really like about this movie is the ending. The ending left me feeling cheated. The music was great. A good soundtrack can really make a movie. I would like to see another sequel. A second part with the two teenage siblings, with a little more time and a better ending. And a third part with all of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ "It was all going so well." This is the main theme to my review, and it comes from the most honest and realistic viewpoint I can imagine, as I was able to relate to how people would react to the death of a beloved family member, or to the devastation of a great loss, and also how they would react in a positive way to a simple act of kindness from a stranger. You can not help but be moved by the film's depiction of these situations, as it makes it so relatable. Even though the events of the film might not make much sense at first, it really is all about a simple gesture, and one man's attempt to make things right. This is an absolute masterpiece, and you won't regret spending the time to watch it. I give it a 5.0/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ "Sons of Anarchy: The Series" - I have enjoyed all six seasons of "Sesame Street" as well as the early episodes. They are very similar in style and have been fun to watch, but have some really great scenes. The "Sopranos" TV series is more like "The Big Bang Theory" which is a good show, but doesn't offer much humor or characters that are funny or that I enjoyed watching. I will say, "Sisters of Battle" was much more fun and it's good to see that the TV series can hold its own against the big TV shows of today. _________________________________________ "The Man With The Golden Gun" - If you don't like "Star Wars," then don't watch this. The plot involves a thief who is a bit of a psychopath who kills an old man with a golden gun and steals it back from a museum. The thieves that are with him are more like a motley crew of thugs and a few people who are a bit more innocent and try to help the old man find his gun.  If you like the "Star Trek" movies, you'll like this. There's a lot of "Star Wards" that seem to exist in "StarWars," but they don't have any influence of "The Empire Strikes Back" (and I've heard of other "Star" Wars films being more influenced by "A New Hope" than they are by "The Revenge of the Sith.") "The Matrix" and "The Hunger Games" are both really good, but "The Golden Gun," "The Exorcist" and the "Blade" films are good too, but you can get "Starwars" movies cheaply in stores these days, so it's worth buying and watching if you're a fan of the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I'm having a hard time understanding the critics of this movie. For starters, the story line is so good and the acting is superb! The story is very basic, but this doesn't matter. We have very good story telling. The only thing I hate about this movie is that there are no real bad guys and the only villains are some of the soldiers in the movie. I also dislike the ending, but I guess this is because it's too easy for the soldiers to escape. If the bad guys don't try and stop the soldiers, then you wouldn't have any problems. I'd love to see a sequel in the future! --------------- (0 out of 10)

It's a solid movie, if not quite as good as Gravity, which has me very intrigued to see what Ridley Scott comes up with next. I just wish this story had been fleshed out a bit more before being so easily dismissed.  But that's the thing about science fiction: it can take the worst things about us and put them to better use than we would have come up with ourselves. So while I won't argue that the science fiction genre is better than science reality, I will tell you that this movie does a fantastic job of highlighting the problems that a future with robots that can walk on Mars will have on us.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- (4 out of 5) --------------- This is a good, solid, low-budget horror movie that's really fun to watch. I can't see it being anything more than that, but if it got a little more promotion and more money, it could have been really good. --------------- Rating: 4/5 (Not very good)  The trailer for this film is actually quite well done. It starts out with a group of friends at a camp. The girl that is a camp counselor is being asked by the camp leader to play his guitar with the boys. While she is playing, the leader says, "Now, there's something you don't learn very often at camp, boys... I was once a musician, and you know how it is... It's hard, it's lonely, and it's very frustrating, but I'll tell you what, it sure is fun! It's like music, except you can play it all day!" Well that is the basic premise. The movie is a fairly simple tale that is told in a funny and amusing manner. The director clearly put a lot of thought and effort into it and made it look easy. He uses a lot different angles and angles to make the film seem more realistic. For example, the boys (especially one) have no idea where the camp is, they have no clue what music is, or even what a camp is. The boys try to start an orchestra in the woods and get into a fight with the camp counselor. As you might expect, it all gets out of hand when the director cuts to a close up of the counselor beating one of the boys and screaming, "YOU'RE NOT MY BITCH, YOU'RE ALL MY BOTS!" The director also cuts to the other boy who has never been in the water before. Well, he is in the middle of the river and just getting out of the water, and he is scared to death, especially since the water is cold and dark. ------------- The Director of the movie used a lot more comedy than the director of the book. This movie is all about camp. It is more of a comedy then horror. There are a lot fewer scary scenes. Also, I wish they had made a sequel. If you loved the book, you are going to love the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What did you like about The Great Gatsby? What did we do wrong? A lot of great things. But as is the way with movies, there's always some problems that I don't see. That's a tough film to make, because you have to have the whole story so you can tell it from one point of view. But we were able to give the viewer a great feeling, like I'm watching a story unfold, and then I see different characters. What I like is that the story unfolds through flashbacks. The film really builds itself around flashbacks and how the film deals with those flashbacks. They're used very creatively in the film. I really like the way that the film has a very distinct look and feel. The cinematography is stunning. The photography is beautiful, even the action, and the direction. There's lots of visual effects that we used, but the lighting and the music are also really cool. We worked with a wonderful team of producers, who worked with us on this movie. They really got me and made this happen. So that's great. What did they do wrong for the movie? Well, there were a couple of things. I think that in the original screenplay, he was called "the rich man's Gatsbys". I was going to have him wear a tie instead of a pocket square, but he's not wearing a pocket, so that didn't work out. The way that he was referred to in the script was that he's "the man in a tie", but I thought that that was kind of insulting. We had a great cast, so I'm very happy with the way we did it. And I think a lot of it was trying to have some fun with the characters. The fact that he has a huge ego and doesn't want to be the one that's talking is a big part of the movie. He seems like an arrogant man in this movie, but it doesn't make him evil. It just makes him very, very vain. How would you describe your characters? They're both charming, but very different. They come from very different backgrounds. Charlie's from the streets of New York. He was a musician before this happened to him, but that's where his heart lies. I would like to say he's the kind of guy that you want to have a beer with, but then he can have a conversation with you, or he can make you laugh. He really is just a great

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The film is called THE BLOOD ON THE ASHES of GOD. It's not an actual movie, just a series of excerpts and extracts that give a view of a world of terror and anarchy. A man named Jack is found by a group of monks in the middle of the desert and taken to a place called the Ashram. Jack is told that he is the reincarnation of a fallen man from that man's previous life, and that he must help save the world. What the film does is it shows a future of terror in the future, a future where people have lost their humanity and become the brutal beasts we know them to be, a world where people fight over their territory, and one where everyone is in some way connected to the military machine. While it's not a completely convincing future that the film presents, I think that it's a fair depiction of what a future society of this kind could look like. I think I was most shocked by the scenes that follow. It was a very emotional and unsettling experience, one that I have not been through before. It made me think about how little I know about this world we live in, and how little knowledge I have of the people in this society, their history, their beliefs, the nature of the world in which they live. In order to learn more about this strange place, I took it upon myself to spend some time on the Internet and try and find out a bit more about the religion and history of the Ashrams. I've seen a few movies that deal with religious sects, I knew some of the basic details, but there was a lot I was not familiar with. I had read a lot of books and articles that tried to portray the Ashrama's culture in a very realistic light, but I had never seen a film that did that. I'm glad I saw it. It has some of my favorite moments in a movie. The way it shows the world's religions and beliefs is not a subtle way, and the way it portrays Jack's own personal beliefs is equally as interesting. I really liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  1) The way you make a movie is, you must know the story of the movie. And if the story isn't good, then the plot will never make sense. And, if the plot makes no sense, you should give it up! This is why a lot of the movies you like don't get made. 2) When you shoot, you can't go wrong with a good actor. In this movie, you have a very nice and experienced actor (Rajinikanth) who brings in a lot to the film and makes you feel it. And the acting of the lead is not too bad either. 3) So, what was the big problem with the film? The biggest problem that a lot people have with this movie is that it is long, which is what most people like. But, that's the way the market is. But if the budget is good enough, then they should shoot it. But it was the biggest problem for this film. 4) The dialogues are like a joke to the audience. For a film like this, the dialogue has to be funny. Otherwise, the story will not make sense and it won't be funny to the people. The problem with it is that some of the lines are very funny, while others are very boring. 5) The story that is in the movie is pretty lame, like a romance movie. That's because no one really gets married in this film, that can be said. No one gets married except the love interest. And when the love interests gets married, the two are always getting married with the help of someone else. 6) In the ending, the film is quite cheesy. But the movie didn't last long enough and it would've made a great film. The ending is just a love story. In the end, the characters in the film are just talking about how they were married and how they are still married, then in the end they have nothing to do with each other, because they have got married without each other knowing about it.  7) It was just a bad movie that was made to make money for the producer. If the producer made a good film like in the old days, it would be a good thing. But when you make this type of movie, the money that you make it will be more for the producers than you. 8) A good movie is made from the script, then it should be made according to the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I watched "The Princess Bride" on Sunday at 7 PM. I have never been so excited by a movie. I can't even describe what it is like. The best way to describe it is to imagine a giant, green, sword-wielding dragon (ROBERT DOUGLAS!). He is a total badass and I just love him so much. This is a comedy about a princess (REBEKAH HARRIS) who falls in love with a guy (EDWARD BURNS) she had never met before and who is a bit of a buffoon (THOMAS HAMILTON). He is rich and arrogant and it is impossible to deal with him on the first date. He treats his maid (GORDON HURMAN) like crap and she does not treat him as well. So finally on the date, they find the two of them together in a park where he takes her to a nearby palace where they make out. On their way back to his place they are confronted by an army of men. The princess runs and gets into a car driven by ROBERT DUMBRA, her childhood friend, and they drive off. After a car chase, they arrive at the palace where her father, the king, holds the princess captive. When the king hears of her love, he makes ROBERT and EDWARD his ambassadors to find the princess. EDWARD, a war veteran (ROCKY BANKS), is in the army and is determined to find his love. He finds her and they marry but then she wants to leave him so he has to put his own son, BRIAN (LANCE LUCAS), in a position to be king. When they get married, they live in a castle. They have a son, EDWARD. However, EDDIE and REBEKah have an ugly fight and they split. Eddie and Rebeca fall in love and it goes bad when the war comes back home. Eddie is the general in the war and the princess is captured in the middle of it. REBEKKah wants Eddie to help her but he just wants the princess back. He thinks he has found her. She escapes but Eddie wants to find her and she runs. Eddies army goes after her. When EDDY sees the army he is so devastated he says, "I don't know how much more I can take." At the end, he goes to the castle

It was a terrific, fun, funny, and well made film. I saw it on the way home from the movie festival and I thought it was really a fun idea. The characters were fun to watch and it kept me interested. It is a comedy and the jokes worked well. It wasn't anything that I haven't seen before. The actors did a great job. The best part of the film were the jokes and the characters. I felt as if I was watching the film with my wife and it was entertaining watching her laugh at the jokes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was not great. Not a great movie in general. I know it's a comedy, but I don't think the writer got a good handle on the subject matter. The writing wasn't good enough, I was not laugh out loud funny at any point, and I thought it was bad. I'm sure I didn't like every minute of it, because I just didn't enjoy the subject. The acting is good, and the directing is not the best, but it wasn't bad and it didn't ruin the movie. A couple of things bother me. The one with the "Nerd's Guide to Sex" was a bad decision. I don' know why they even thought it would be a good idea. It wasn't funny, and it wasn' t a good reference to a popular TV show. And one of the best things about the movie was that I didn' t have to pay money to see a movie in a theater. It was free on Youtube for a week. Not sure why people would want to pay $10 to see this crap. If you can't see it on Youtube, then I don t think you can see it at all. The movie just doesn't work, and in all honesty, it didn' ts even a bad movie. Its just not good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The movie itself was pretty decent in that it was a lot of fun to watch. The way that they made the movie for us was really clever, as they kept the plot line of the main character, "Nell", alive and in the forefront throughout the entire movie. In fact, in the last half hour, the movie even gave us Nell's perspective on the world and her problems, instead of being spoon fed in the end. The main character Nell is a "superhero" who is always getting into trouble and making bad decisions because she's so full of self-pity and anger, but at the end of the day, she is still able to pull her weight by helping others and being a super hero to the world. That's not something that we see in many films today. What the movie had over the average "super hero" movie of the 90's, is that we really were able to see the pain that Nell was going through. In many movies, the character that we are watching becomes so much more important than the characters that are in the actual movie that we watch. They tell us that the movie was really about the relationship between Nell and her daughter and that it would affect our perception of Nell, but all of that was just a facade. We saw the relationship of Nelly and her father, who was always away from home, and we saw the struggles that Nelly had trying to be a good mother and raising a super child. This movie was not just about the characters, but about the world that Nella, Nells daughter, was living in. Her mother, Nelly was in the military, and her husband, was always trying to get her to do things that his wife didn't want her to be doing. That was the backdrop for Nell to feel the pain of having an unhappy family life. It was also really nice to see Nell as a parent in this movie. We were able see how Nell would give up her daughter to the soldiers and their children when they came over for a stay of a few days, just so that Nello could see her again and she could feel a little more like a mother. I really liked the fact that they didn't go overboard on the cheesy "sadistic military" theme that we saw a lot in this year, as it really doesn't add anything to the film, and honestly, I think it was probably a better choice. I don
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that this film would feature a lesbian romance between two women and that both were trans women, I was shocked. After hearing the news, I went online to look at trailers, reviews, etc... and found that many of them were very negative and even transphobic, and I was saddened by that. I didn't know that there were lesbian/trans relationships in trans-positive films and, in fact, a lot of them don't even feature anyone who is trans. This was a big disappointment for me. I love queer films and I love film festivals and films and theater and art, but when you're a cisgendered white dude, sometimes you are not welcome and sometimes people take offense and that makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. And it makes me hate the film, which is not a bad thing because it's very good. If you're looking for something else like this, I highly recommend The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald because it stars two trans women. I also really enjoyed the movies I've seen that have included trans characters, most of which are biographical films about the lives of famous trans people, so if you're into that kind of thing, I'd suggest you check those out. This film does not fit into any of those categories and while I think there are some interesting things in it, it's really not my cup of tea.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************** ***Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace***** (1998) - I am going to say right from the start that I did not have any particular interest in Star Wars Episode I. I have not read the books or seen the movie but I know that it is the "origin" and the first time that the "dark side" of the Force is truly introduced. I am not really sure what it means. I can certainly tell you what is not in it. At least, in terms of "star wars" movies, I have never been interested in that kind of thing. But I don't really know what kind of film that would be. It has to be a good story and the acting is good. I really like the sound of that "Bite of the Sith." I did, however, like the character of Jar Jar Binks. He was funny and the plot had some "dark" elements and some things that were not so dark but just sort of interesting. I liked the special effects. I thought they were okay. But again, I didn't think they were very good. Maybe it was just my opinion but I think that this is where the story of the dark side of the force first begins. In the end, this kind of movie just doesn't seem to have much to do with the "main" saga of the film. I could have gotten more out of it if I had. But still, I don�t really know how I feel about it. I know it is my least favorite of the six movies. It was interesting, though, seeing how many of the things that I had seen before would become new to me and I could tell that they would take a lot of time. I had always liked "Attack of the Clones" but I was never the biggest fan of the prequels. This time around, I found that I liked "Empire" very much and I thought that the idea of Luke and Obi-Wan training together was very interesting. The plot seems to be about the beginning of the destruction of the Jedi, a group of Jedi that have always worked together in the past. What the heck is going on? In the movie, the destruction takes place at Endor. This is where "Raiders of the Lost Ark" came from. They are called "Sith" and they come out of the clouds and swoop down and attack the Rebel base at Endore, which is an important one,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ Don't miss this one! Watch the trailer below!  I have no idea why this movie is so popular but it is, it is good, not bad at all but it has some scenes which are just stupid and it is not an action movie but rather a comedy movie and if you like comedy and action together then it is for you!   The movie starts with a guy named John (played by Kevin Sorbo) who has decided that he wants to become an adventurer so he buys a book and the book tells you to "get off your butt and get in a fight!"   John takes the advice of the book and starts traveling to do battle and he has just arrived in a big city named Coney Island. As John wanders around he finds that the people there don't like him. A couple of guys give him a look and then they start to fight with each other. The guy he's with starts to make fun of John which makes John mad and then he fights with the guy and kicks him in the butt which makes him angry which in turn makes him punch the guy in the face which causes him to fall to the ground and break his nose which makes the guy start to run away which makes everyone start to chase him which is good because it gives John time to run around, and then the hero comes upon a place where a woman named Molly (played with perfect timing by Janeane Garofalo) is playing with a bunch of other girls. John asks Molly if he can play with her and she is happy to let him do so so he gets on the swings and swings around doing some cool moves on the swing but as he is doing it one of the girls yells out to John that he is getting dirty and it makes John really mad which makes his ass break.   One of the main things that the movie does well is that it shows the characters with a certain amount of personality which is important especially when we are watching movies like these. These are people who just want to play around and get out and are willing to do anything to play which makes for an interesting story. The movie takes it's time to give you the people and the environment so we don't have to sit around and wonder what the characters are up to. This is also a good thing because there is no need to ask questions and we don  ear the characters, so there is more to think about and it adds to the movie.   a lot of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a time when everyone is saying that the last two years have made for a bad time to be a fan of cinema, I say that there has been some really good and original movies released this year.  The reason for this is because we've had a lot of good movies on the smaller screens and we're not going to get to see many more in theatres, so we have to find new ways to express our love for cinema.  A great movie on the small screens:  If you've ever watched movies like The Fifth Element or The Last Starfighter, you know that these films have been very influential to the action genre, especially as they have inspired the use of special effects for a lot more of the sequels.  The Fifth- Element, which was released in 1988, was a science fiction movie based off the story of an alien spaceship crashing to Earth and an expedition looking to get samples for science.  This story has become one of the main influences for a great number of movies, particularly those that have been made in the last ten years.  It's not the most original film, but it is a very important film in the action movie genre that has helped create the special effects that have become synonymous with this genre, which has resulted in many more movies in the same genre being made since the film.  However, when it came out, it wasn't the most well-known film in its genre, and many of the fans who had seen it, saw it as too different to be considered an action movie.  Now this is where  Star Wars: The Force Awakens comes in, because with it came a sequel that has a lot in common with The Fifth Elements, including a focus on a space ship in search for a missing pilot.  In fact, many of its story elements and plot lines are very similar to The Fifth Empeirant  as it features a character who has just arrived on planet Jakku after being shot down and who has to survive against an oppressive regime before he can be reunited with his ship.  Also, the opening credits are almost identical, both movies being set on the same planet, the desert world of Jakku.   There are some obvious differences though between the two films and there are also some obvious similarities in terms of plot and characters, but ultimately, I found that the two movies were quite different and both were good films that have a lot to offer.  One of the things that Star

The story is interesting and the ending is nice. The acting is excellent, and the special effects make the movie look so real. I'd give it a four or a five if not for the ending. If you are like me, you didn't want the ending to be that bad. It was just a little too easy for me. There were some good bits and not so much bad bits, but I'll take the bad bits over a good story any day. It has some nice effects, and a story that is interesting, but the ending just didn't work for me, and I'll have to wait for a better one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  | Share your opinions  I've read quite a lot of books about the history of Russia, most of them written by foreigners. There is not much that I can add that hasn't already been written. However, a book that I have never read is by a native Russian that was published by the Yuzhnoye (Cultural Institute of the Peoples of the Far East) in 1987. I can't recall ever being told that a book was about the early history of the Russian nation, and that is a good thing. In addition to the book being written by a Russian, the authors are Russian and the book is published in Russian. It's a fascinating read and the Russian language is used to excellent effect. There are very little mistakes. I have yet to read the Russian version of the book but the book will be coming to my library.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ [The above text is a paraphrased, condensed version of a post which appeared on the movie website at http://www.theglorioushollywoodfilm.com/index_e.html ] A couple of years ago I read a review of a film written by someone named Richard Dyer who, while not actually a Hollywood film critic, had made a good number of movies himself. His review of the film "The Great Outdoors" (1997) included this observation: "For a moment I forgot that I was watching a movie. It was like the best way to experience film: to forget what is in front of you and to just have a little glimpse, almost, of the world behind it." I have heard this sentiment repeated by a number of other people who have enjoyed good movies -- it is one of those sayings that seems true. Some have said it as they are being absorbed by the narrative; others have said as they find themselves on their couch watching "Beverly Hills Cop II." The movie, for me, is not a "viewing of the 'world' behind it," but rather a peek into the very nature of what makes an action film an action movie. But, in order to understand the movie we must first understand the world which this movie depicts: the life, and death, and romance of an all-male ski team. What I found most unusual about the movie was the very fact that this is what we are presented with. And I had no idea that this was a possibility. One of the most common stereotypes about Hollywood is that we are supposed to imagine a world that is a very simple one. We expect to see our heroes living in large mansions, shooting lots of bad guys, and making lots of money. But in this movie, we are given an unusual world where the entire team lives in a trailer park. The trailers themselves were small, with lots of space, and the trailer life was not much different than what we know. And yet it is so very much like ours. There were all the usual problems: a need to pay the rent, a need for a good place to live, and, occasionally, a little trouble with the landlord. I was also intrigued by the fact that the team is all about having fun -- not that I thought this was actually happening. They played volleyball, went camping, and went to the movie theater, all things that we do, as do many men (and

Starring: Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, David Threlfall, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, Michael Caine, and Tom Hanks. This is a nice mix of genres and ideas and it should please both audiences who prefer a nice crime movie as well as people who prefer films of a different genre. It's about a guy named James Bond who is the head of MI6, the secret British intelligence agency and is trying to figure out a way to get out of a high-pressure situation he is in. What a mess that is. This film is also very cleverly told, with cleverly plotted, well-made action sequences, brilliant dialogue, and excellent cinematography.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a movie that any Lebucophiles should watch.  It is also a good film that any serious movie fan should watch too.  This movie is the story of a group of people who run a bowling alley in the middle of nowhere, a little bowling alley that has been around for 70 years, and have become the most famous bowling alley on earth.  All that, but for one thing... Lebbeus Woods.   Leb beus Woods is a pretty funny character, and one that is not funny all the time, and there are times where it seems as though he is actually an old man, who just plays a character for the sake of it.  He is one of the most memorable and entertaining characters of the movie, and he has many funny lines that make the movie worth watching.  Lebeus doesn't just make the scene, he actually plays the role for 90% of the time.  It is a nice change of pace for some of the more comedic movies out there.  Some of the other people at the bowling alley include Mr. Leb, his friend Stan, his girlfriend Trudy, his best friend Hank, and his secretary.   The best part about this movie is that there is a lot of great action that never ceases to amuse.  There are some great scenes of characters who are completely out of their element, and yet somehow manage to find a way to take down the bad guys.  The bowling alley actually has a very dark and serious sense of humor at times, and it seems that they actually took the time to develop this movie well.   When you watch this movie it makes you realize that not all bowling alleys have a lot going on and they actually do it all for the fun of it, but there are some that do it out of love, for the experience and for what it is really about.  There are a lot things in the world that will make people laugh and it was that sense of fun that kept me going through the long bowling night.  I highly recommend this movie to any Lebenaphiles out there!

I would suggest watching it on a big screen with some popcorn and a few drinks. You will be rewarded with a fun, silly, fun filled time. I only hope that this does not become a trend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Boy Scout (2017)  is a fine and moving tale of a boy, his dog and the dangers of life in the big city, which I would call both gritty and uplifting in its overall message. I can't stress enough how much this movie made me feel. The story centers around a homeless kid named Ryan (Benson Henderson) who has just been picked up by the police who are investigating a series of brutal crimes he's been involved in. It's unclear when, where or why Ryan went from being just another homeless person to the victim of a series brutal murders, but as the days go on and the cold begins to bite he becomes increasingly frustrated at not being able to trust people or go anywhere without his dog. His anger is well-earned, but I think it is only human to have feelings of anger. In my opinion, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with having a little bit of anger at the world in order to deal with the difficulties in one's life, but in this case the movie seems to use Ryan's anger for something that isn't very appealing. I suppose it's possible this was a film that needed a little more time to get everything right, but at this point I'm not sure how much longer this could have been given that the story felt so effective in its delivery. The ending seemed to hit the spot in terms of its narrative purpose, but it still leaves a bit of question marks. Still, it's a well-written movie and I recommend it. I'll watch it again one day.

I have not seen the original movie but i heard its a good film. I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone that likes a good story well told well done. I do not know why the movie didn't get a wide release but i can guess they didn't want to promote the original. It was definitely worth the watch and will be one of my movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The thing about a zombie movie is that you never know if it's going to be awesome or not. I had the misfortune of seeing this movie at a midnight show where it ran for nearly 4 hours. I came away thinking this is going to go one of two ways. It is either the best zombie film ever made or it is just one of those shitty, boring, slow-moving, and very boring zombie films. My recommendation is that, if you are a fan of the genre, skip this movie for the most part. There are enough great zombie films out there that you can make a list and just go watch those instead. But if you want to know what happens when a bunch of people are stuck on a deserted island for 3 months, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Outdoors  is a classic. You can check out the trailer HERE  but for the sake of my sanity I suggest you give it a watch. I can't tell you how much I love this movie. As a teenager, I loved this movie as well. When I saw it, I was so excited I literally jumped for joy. You know what I mean? But as you get older, you realize that it's a bit over the top. Yes, it's campy but that's to be expected for this kind of movie. Now, that's not to say that this isn't a fun movie. I mean, it is. But that's where the similarities to "Big Lebowski" stop. There's no way I could watch this movie without a smile on my face. The story revolves around a man named Ed Harris. The story revolves about his quest to find his missing wife, who has disappeared while on a hunting trip. He and his friends decide to go on an expedition to try to find her. But things are not as they seem at first. Along the way, Ed encounters some strange and unexplained occurrences. Things that are too strange to be explained. Things so crazy you don't believe it could possibly be real. Things with names like the "Great Outdoors" and "The Secret". These things are all just so strange that you think, "I bet those people just made it up." But as it turns out, Ed and his buddies are right in the middle of a huge conspiracy. It's time for him to go undercover and find out what's really going on in this crazy world. It takes the movie to the next level. As the movie goes on, you will find yourself laughing out loud, because it's so far off the deep end, it would be comical. It will be the kind of flick you wish you could actually see. When you watch this film, you don`t have to be a kid to love it. Ed Harris will make you laugh, you'll feel sad, you might cry. It`s a movie for everyone.  Here is a small clip I recorded at the screening. It doesn't get any better than that. The movie is funny as hell and I can not wait for you to see it. You don't need to have seen it, but I think you will be surprised by some things that you didn't think about. Now let's get to the

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Star Wars: A New Hope - The Empire Strikes Back is the second in my series of retrospectives on the Star Wars prequels, the first being Attack of the Clones. I've already written an in depth and detailed look at the original trilogy, so this will only serve as an update of the story. _______________ I love the story of Star Wars. The franchise that brought to the world the most famous line in pop culture, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away" is simply amazing and one of the greatest stories in the history of cinema. The films are fun, thrilling, funny, thrilling. They also contain a ton of great story, characters, and scenes, so I'll be focusing my analysis on those elements, rather than on the movies themselves. I'll try to talk about the films in their own terms, without having to analyze each individual movie's narrative and character moments. This means, if I'm discussing the first film, I won't be talking about the original novel. If I'm talking about Empire, I'll only be discussing Empire Strikes back. _________________ ______________________________________________ In Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) is on a mission to bring the Jedi to justice. In the process he encounters Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who had been turned to the Dark Side.  So there's a reason I keep saying the sequels are better than the first movie, right?   As I mentioned in an earlier post, the original movie is good. It's fun, it's action packed, it has a lot of fun lines, it sets up the first two films, and it contains some good story. So there's good to great to good. The sequel movies (including the prequel, but excluding Episodes II and III) are, in my opinion, worse.  They're not bad movies. The prequeltics are great. I just don't think they can hold up to the original films.  The prequelinics are a mix of new characters, from new planets, a new race, and from an entirely different time period. As a fan of Star Trek, the whole premise of StarTrek is that everything is a product of the past. That includes your ships and your uniforms. Your time on board the Enterprise and your time on the bridge of the Enterprise-A. Star Trek is about the past

I loved the scenes with the real-life characters - the movie was definitely a treat to watch. Thanks for sharing. Reply Delete Thanks for this post. I am a big fan of movies, but I have found that films I like better can be quite hard to find. I just came across this movie on YouTube. I haven't been much of a film fan to be honest, I'm a bit of a TV and radio junkie, however this movie really hooked me and I was completely blown away by it. I don't know who directed it but I like the look of the movie, and the performances are superb, especially the one's by Michael Caine and Julie Walters. I thought it was a great idea for a movie. Reply Reply @Michael @Anonymous I have to confess, I hadn't seen this one. The soundtrack and editing are what caught my attention though. There's a really great scene in it with David Beckham's character, and I found it quite funny. Thank you, I was very excited to see this at the cinema, and it was good fun. Reply A fantastic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This movie is a perfect blend of the two. One of the things that made it so appealing was the fact that it was not so much an action movie as it was a psychological thriller, where the characters you care about are also very interesting. The film also takes you through the events of the film, giving you the full picture, from the initial meeting of the main characters, to their first meeting in a restaurant, to the last night at the hotel before they are killed. This is not a film that you just watch once, but it is a film you want to keep watching. The story is just right - you want something really awful to happen to someone, but not something like The Shining or Psycho, but something more tragic and dramatic. It is like watching a movie about the murder of a love.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Bad: ______________________    "The World's End" (2013) is a bad movie. The concept is not terrible, but it is a lot of the same problems that plague most of the other "End" movies. The character of Kevin Spacey is a pathetic attempt to use actors to advance a political agenda and he does it well. This character is a parody of every liberal politician you could think of from the 1970s. I would not take a chance on a Democrat that acted this way or a Republican who did.  What makes this a better than average movie is that the concept is so awful it becomes amusing. I can imagine this movie being the kind of movie George Clooney would watch to relax after a stressful day at work. I am sure many will not be impressed but for those that are, this film will be enjoyable to laugh about. ____________________________________________________________________________ What is worth noting is that "The World End" is directed by  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World director Edgar Wright.  I do not agree with much of what he does, but this film seems like a very good take on the concept.   The film is rated PG-13 for some violence and a brief amount of nudity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's not a problem in itself." I've never been a big fan of 'Gravity,' but I was in awe of its visuals. And I'm always intrigued by how the visual effects are rendered. From the opening shot to the final, I couldn't stop watching the film. The action, scenery, and music were top notch. I think the film is great, but the visual effect work and editing was fantastic. I've read and watched many reviews and articles that called it boring, pretentious, and a bad science fiction movie. I didn't disagree. But there was nothing boring about this movie. It was one of the best science fiction movies I've seen, and it definitely changed the way I look at the genre. 'Grav' isn't just a visually stunning movie, it's also a great, entertaining science fiction story. I loved the world building, and the characters are interesting and engaging. If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, 'Grave' is an absolute must-see. The only negative thing I can say about 'Gravedigger' is the ending. The ending left me a bit confused. I wanted more from the story and I was left a bit disappointed. I don't think it's a big deal, but I just want to know where the story is headed. I know I'm going to see this movie again. I hope that it's better than the first one. 'The Martian' 'The Martian,' in my opinion, is a film that could be the best Sci-fi film ever made. It's set in space. It stars Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain. It has a story about a Martian that is lost on Mars and must make his way back home. I love that it has a real sense of science behind it. I always appreciate when a sci-fi movie has a lot to say about the future of space travel, and 'The Mars Rover' really does that. It also has some truly stunning visuals. The music, as well as the editing, are great. And it's got an amazing soundtrack. I'm sure it won't win any Oscars or anything, but 'The MARTIAN' is one of my favorite sci-fis. 'Life' The premise of 'Life,' in an odd way, reminds me of '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They are both sci-fy movies, that

It's probably best to see it in IMAX so that your face is forced to look directly into the screen. It still makes me want to throw up. I loved the fact that the action scenes are real fights. No CGI and no special effects. It was actually pretty good. There were only a couple of parts where I felt that there was a little too much CGI going on, but otherwise, it was all good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    1.5 out of 5 stars     I was hoping for a more well-developed story, and what I got was a well acted, well-written, and very well acted film, which I have seen many times before, but it had a little something new to it. I don't know how they managed to get so many different characters to play, but in the end, it turned out very well. I didn't have a very hard time keeping up, but I wasn't even expecting that. Story:     The film follows one man, named Nick, who has been in a lot of bad situations, but his love for his dog and the good old life he was living seemed to draw him to an area known as "the desert" where there were no rules and no one to help.  I was expecting a little more depth than the script actually gave me, but Nick and his dog seem to really bond with each other, and even though he was always struggling, they were always there to help him through.     I'm not saying it's a love story, but what it does have is a bit more heart than some other romantic films, like "A Christmas Story."          Characterization:  There were a couple of characters that I didn,t really get a lot out of, but they did their jobs well, and had nice personality quirks that made them a fun to watch.    Overall:  I'm definitely going to see this film again, and again, but not expecting much more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai is a wonderful film and my favorite of the Samurai movies by director Tatsuya Nakadai. The story begins when a Japanese soldier, Takaya Matsuda (played by Ken Watanabe), returns to his homeland to take his father's place as a shogun. Unfortunately, the Japanese soldier is killed in action during a failed invasion, causing his father to be killed when he was a young child. Now, the only way to avenge the death of his father is to enlist in the army, and he does so, joining the 7th Samurai, who are also the Japanese Army's greatest warriors. He soon finds out that he is not the only one that can wield the Samurai sword, as a young warrior named Kanomasa (Yutaka Takenouchi) joins his group, which means they must battle every group of Japanese men and women in the 7 Samurai before they can gain enough power to take over the land. This is where the story really starts to shine and become one of the best Samurai movies ever made. This movie is set in a wonderful feudal world of Japan, but with a modern touch, which gives it a real feeling that you're in Japan and is not a fantasy setting. The world of this movie is filled with beautiful scenery and great historical details. It's clear that this movie was made for the big screen, and that was evident with the use of CGI (computer generated images) and special effects that make everything from the samurai uniforms to the battles look real. The fights between the samurai and the invading soldiers are truly a sight to behold, and the fights are just a joy to watch. The film has a wonderful soundtrack, which is great for the movie, but it is also a lot of fun to listen to and the songs are memorable. It was a little frustrating that one of my favorites in this film (the song "You Are My Friend") didn't make the list, but that was because I watched the movie with headphones, so I wasn't able to hear the song. Overall, The Last Samurai was a very enjoyable, action packed movie that will have you in a great state of mind for the film. It has some of the most entertaining sequences in the movie and even the ending is really well done and brings in one of Nakadaii's best performances.

I was a little disappointed it was not on the opening day. This was a film that I saw because of the trailer. I love this type of film because the storyline is very simple, but the actors are great. The acting is mostly done by two actors, and they both do a great job. I would like to see more movies like this. If you are looking for a good film that is short and sweet, then this is the film for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not saying this is the best movie in the world. It doesn't even come close to that. But I can say this movie is good. It was written in 1986 by the great Charles Band and directed by Brian De Palma. This is a movie about a young kid who lives on an old abandoned ranch that has all the classic ranch ambiance. But all the ranch inhabitants have mysteriously vanished. The only one still around is a young girl. She gets on the wrong bus, gets caught in a blizzard and falls off a horse. It's only a matter of time before a strange figure attacks her and kidnaps her. The girl is rescued by a mysterious man. He gives her a rifle and tells her to get out of the old house. He then has her take her clothes off and climb into his bed. It is there that the girl sees something she's never seen before. It takes her to a world in which she is the center of attention and no one is as she thought. She is sent into the past in which her family is the most influential people in all the land. Now there's a story. If you're looking for a decent Western to watch this movie with then I highly recommend it.

The story is interesting and the acting is pretty good, but it is hard to take seriously a film called "The Good Dinosaur" with such a silly title, and with this title alone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Babylon A.D. is a great looking, fast paced, action packed thriller starring Jason Clarke and Katee Sackhoff.  I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see it again.   It was a fun film to watch and the only thing holding it back from a 10 is the occasional jump cut. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm just a pretty boy. No powers, no special abilities, just a handsome, intelligent guy, and I like to sing."  That's what I would call a pretty good movie, although the main character is a bit too handsome.  I'm also just not a fan of big names, and even if I did know what was going on in the movie, I might just want to look away.  "I can't go without my wife, not anymore."  "Don't worry. I'm going to make her happy."  The best thing in the entire movie is when the evil wizard in the middle of the woods tells the hero he is a wizard and the hero turns around and says "Yeah, I know that" and then he kicks the wizard through a barn.  I mean, that's pretty much the only good thing to come out of this whole film, because most of the characters are just annoying, selfish, and stupid.   If there was a happy ending, I would have to check the script to see if they were going to kill off the villain, because the plot and characters just do not make sense.  However, there is some good in this film, as it has one of the best music tracks in a movie ever.  If you like any of the "Hercules" movies and you want a good story, you should check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Just Go With It is a film that works on multiple levels. First off, this is a love story of a young couple. Their story is unique because the love and the love that they share makes the film a story that has a beginning, middle, and end. The film is not just about a couple and their love, but it is also about a man who can only get through life when his love is there. So, it's not just a love letter to a young lady, it is a letter to life. But, it was not only a love movie, but a love comedy. It's an extremely unique and unique movie. This movie was so well made, that it has become one of my favorite movies of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my experience, the more interesting the movie, the less likely I am to give it a negative rating. A few years ago I thought that the best way to avoid watching a horror movie was to pretend that the monster is never really there. I thought I was doing a good job, until I got sucked into watching the remake of The Amityville Horror. What was I thinking? I know that I shouldn't have gone back in time, but I did! It's a really well done remake of the original, but it's not scary. No it's very very scary, but not as scary as I was hoping for. The movie does make the reader feel like they're in the house where the murder took place, but most of the scares come from characters going into the room where the blood was spilt. Also the murders themselves don't feel realistic. I've always been a fan of the books and movies that take place in Amity Island, but this movie just doesn't do it justice. It just isn't a good horror movie, no matter how many times it is watched. I really wanted to like it, but the script is terrible, the acting is poor, the writing is terrible and the monsters just don't have the same impact as they had in the original. It's hard to watch and very frustrating. The remake is available on Blu-Ray and DVD, but you'll have to pay extra for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Kiss" is an impressive horror film about a small town full of vampires and a small time family man, Danny, who accidentally discovers his mother, an elderly lady who has been bitten by one of the vampires, while taking a stroll in the woods. Danny takes up a job as a handyman and eventually tries to help his mom out by going on a weekend fishing trip. After going through the woods, Danny is discovered by the vampire and the two engage in a fight that causes her to be turned. As her mother's blood flow goes out, her mother tells Danny that she has a choice... either to keep going or to die. It doesn't take much more than a few minutes for this to become the most horrifying thing I have seen in a while. There is something very wrong with the way this story is told. Not only does Danny have to keep his mouth shut the whole time, but it seems as though he is actually in fear of the creature that he can't even see. His mother is unable to speak, and the only time she shows emotion is when Danny has to go pick her up. Not wanting to disappoint his mother Danny runs out of the house and leaves her to fend for herself, and it's here that the film shows it's true strength: making us root for the little girl. As far as monsters go, this is one of my favorites. The story is so well written that we feel that the character can never be completely alone because we always have the thought of Danny, the mother's son, in our heads. The film doesn't let us forget how much this story means to him and how much it will affect him moving forward. The vampire is terrifying and there are some really intense scenes in the film that make me feel like I'm almost terrified by the creature. As you can imagine, the family isn't completely safe, as the town has been completely transformed. Now, there are vampires in the town, and more than one of them has a crush on Danny's mother. The creature is so vicious, so real, and so creepy that you'll want to watch the film over and over, no matter what. Even though I don't want to give too much away, I can safely say that you won't want for a second to put this movie away. Not once did I feel like this movie was trying to take me away, and when I do watch it over and again I find myself feeling a little nauseous.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the best tradition of Hollywood, it is a story about a girl who has to kill people for the good of the people.  Yes, a film with that title about killing people. No, it isn't about a monster, but it is about a man who comes up with an idea to save the people from the monster.  It's a little late for that, isn't it? Well, maybe a little earlier than this was a terrible film, but at least it is not as bad as that of its predecessor, I'm sorry, I was not a fan of the previous film.  The main characters are all bad, but some are very charming and funny.  It's a short film, though, and you shouldn't watch it before you know how to speak French.  After the third act, it becomes somewhat interesting.  In my opinion, the film's best scenes are the first, second, and third, which I won't spoil, because I think they make it more interesting than in the last part of the film. Don't give me that "un-French" joke.   In the end, it's just a bad, bad, movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is an absolutely amazing flick. It has so much going on and the movie is absolutely packed with great scenes.  It's one of those movies that you can't stop watching once you start. The characters are all well developed and the story keeps you interested for the entire runtime of the movie. This movie is definitely worth a watch! I can say that this movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The story is actually quite solid but there are a couple of things that detract from the movie being a masterpiece. The movie itself can be rather dark at times. I feel that it could have benefited more from an introduction that didn't require a lot of explanation. I also feel that the pacing could have been a bit quicker, especially when the film shifts from a more serious story to an action packed one.  The movie also has some of the most awesome set pieces ever and the ending is great.  A lot of this movie relies on the characters to get the audience involved in the story, but it isn't always easy. One thing that I liked about this movie was that it didn't try to do anything too special and the rest of the cast delivered fantastic performances in their roles.  Overall, this was an amazing horror flick that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bambi  (1941) Bambir:   A very important movie. I can't remember if I saw this as a child or as a teenager but this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It was the first time I had heard of the Bambi and I was thrilled to be in a world where it existed. A gentle story told from the Bammies perspective, it is beautifully simple and the humour is superb. This is a very moving and beautiful story. The Bambir was born to a mother who had had a miscarriage and her husband was away. He is brought back and his mother dies, his father dies and his little sister is taken by a bear, she is then raised by a wolf pack. When Bambid grows up she is the only one of the pack that doesn't hate the other wolves. The wolf pack, now the main pack, is very cruel and her dad, Bambit, who is only 6, has to be taken care of and is taken to the woods and the wolf pack is very strict to him. The wolf pack are very strict and Bambil hates their wolf pack and they keep her away from them. She wants to go back to her dad and is told that he is dead and that the wolves have become very bad and are hunting her father. When she wants to be with them she is told she is too young and the wolves are cruel and want her to run away and become their prey. But then she is given a Bambis backpack by her father and she is able to travel with the wolves and she becomes very friends with them. They all think that she is just a little girl and her mother and father hate the wolves for what they do. The wolves go into the forest in search of a bear and get attacked by a polar bear who wants to eat Bambits backpack. The polar bear is also a good friend of Bambini and they help each other get over this difficult situation. The bear then takes Bambin to the cave to be made a new friend of her father, but it turns out he is still alive, but the polar bear have not forgotten him and are in search for him to eat. There are a few changes in the wolf family after this. The mother of Bambert becomes very strict, and the father goes for a walk in the woods with his wolf pack friends, but he doesn't get very far
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Catch a train to London by hopping aboard a train and going to London! The only downside to going to a train is there are a few spots that are hard to find in the London area and there is a long wait at the platform. But you can take a chance and go on the train. Just go into the ticket office and ask for a seat close to the end and then the conductor will lead you to the right platform. The ride was amazing! The scenery was fantastic, it was a beautiful scenery with a few other people on board and I found myself looking at them more than me.  This is one of those rare train rides where you feel you are on a train ride, not just a commuter train ride. This was one of my favorite train rides I have been on in a while.  It took about an hour and twenty minutes and the train was very relaxing! I recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of the best movies I've seen all year. If you love a good spy movie this is the one. It's a story about a man that has a good life with his wife, his kids and his job. He loves his life so much that he can't stop wanting to get out, but his wife won't let him. He goes to Mexico to do something illegal, but the CIA has his passport so they follow him in to get him. As they try to get the information out of him, they find out he's a CIA agent. He tells them about the guy in Mexico, who's a double agent. When the CIA finds out he knows about the assassination of the President, they start sending out assassins to kill him. So they get a guy that's known for killing people to find out who his boss is. This is the best movie I've ever seen, especially with a cast that can do so much more. And it has one of those "oh man, this is a movie from 2001" kind of feel. I would definitely recommend it to a lot of people, I just hope someone comes out with a sequel!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Sold the World"  is the fourth James Bond movie and the second to be directed by Pierce Brosnan. In this film we're introduced to a mysterious character by the name of Q who appears to be an intelligent man of science. Q gives Bond one of his gadgets, a device that allows him to see into the future, but it has the side effect of making Bond's skin color "black", making him instantly recognizable and causing him to be considered an enemy. When Bond visits Q in the future and meets with him, the two talk about everything from their shared love for women, to the destruction of Earth and how they had been destined to meet. Q explains to Bond that he has created a machine that can see into future time that would allow him to meet with Bond in the past. However, the device is only activated in the "golden age", and when Q travels to the past in the form of his own helicopter to get a better view, the machine is not activated. The scene is cut off to show Bond and Q leaving. Bond tells Q that he must be careful, as he cannot change the past, but Q tells him "The future doesn't change because you do things, it changes because you wait". We then see a video of the destruction done by the Nazis in World War II. Bond says that he cannot stay and watch, but they are interrupted by a phone call and they head back. This time, however, Bond sees that the machine has been activated. When Q goes back to the future to see Bond, he finds that Bond has just arrived there himself and is walking towards his door. Q tells Bond that they must go back to where they came in time, but Bond wants to go to the end of the universe to meet a woman named Eva. Q, however tells Bond it is not possible, and they return to the present to find Bond in Eva's place. They talk briefly and Bond learns that Q gave Eva a diamond watch he had been working on, but he cannot use it and she throws it away. They then decide to go back in time together, and as Bond leaves Q tells Eva she will have to wait a while longer for her diamond. This film is a good sequel to "GoldenEye", not only because it has a better story than "Golden Eye", but also because it was better than "Live and Let Die". "The Man With The Golden Gun" is also the final Bond

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I just saw this movie a couple weeks ago, I was so impressed by its action and how well it matches the setting of the novel. There is nothing worse than reading about a man trying to win a woman's heart while the world around him goes mad. This movie is all about the love story of two men, one a soldier, one an artist. The soldier is a very bad man, he can't be loved and no one in the world can, even if you have done the right thing for them they will think you are a liar for loving them. Then there's the artist, he's very good with his art and loves the girl but he can never be her true love. But then there is this war, a war that is so huge its taking everything in a world around it, not to mention the two men in the middle of it. They are the only people who have had a chance at the happiness they deserve, they've had the same love for so long they have seen it through to the end and that's all they want to do is win the girl and keep her safe. What a wonderful story. So the first thing I loved about the film, is the way it shows how large and powerful this war really is. We see the destruction in the air, a plane crash landing in the trees, we see how far they are flying and the destruction they cause. Then we see the people running and screaming as the war takes a life, a man dies and a child, a young boy, watches his father and his father's friends get killed. This is when the action begins. The way the action is executed makes me want to watch it over and over again, each scene is perfect, the actors and director know how to use each frame to their advantage, each hit is a good hit, the way that the scenes go from beginning to end makes it all worth it. Then when the movie reaches it's climax they get a nice explosion and the action becomes even better. The actors are great, they are so well acted that I could hardly believe this was real and it does seem very real because we have to see how they can keep the tension up when they are killing people at this scale, it's unbelievable. The action and direction is also so good that I really feel like I'm watching real war films and it's great to see that the directors know how important the battle scenes are to the success of their film, and how important
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A simple, yet extremely powerful film that has been used in several studies to help young people avoid some of the pitfalls of addiction.  It's a good film if you have the stomach for it, and can handle the scenes. In this short but sweet and sweet short film the narrator talks about the effects of drugs on a friend who is addicted to cocaine, he also goes on to talk about how people should be free to choose their own path. A classic short film that features a very good plot line, but isn't for everyone.  My favorite film to use as a "sample" to give someone a chance to see the short films of the day, it gives an interesting insight to what the short film is about.    When I was a child I watched these films as they came out on television, they were short and short but very entertaining.  It shows the effects that alcoholism has on a person.   A nice short film, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a good story.    When my mother passed away I felt like she was watching over me so I decided to put my faith in her and to "live for her", the only thing that I did was drink.  What I saw and felt inside the last 3 years of my life changed my life.  My story is told in my new short film which shows how the world has changed since I watched this film. My first feature film, it is based on my experiences as a teenager.  I hope to see this film get more recognition in the future.  The only flaw is that the ending is not very positive. I think that most short films are made for people who want to see something short but can handle longer films.  This one is a little bit longer than most, but it's fun and entertaining.    It's been a few years since I last watched a short film in which the characters take their clothes off.  Not for everyone, but a good short film to give people a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was an extremely well done movie! It is the first movie I saw from the director, Robert Rodriguez, and I have to say, he did an awesome job, and he has done it again, in this second part of the series. He does a great job with the characters, the action, and the special effects, and this movie really shows it all off. This is one of the better action movies I have seen in a long time, and for that I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. My only gripe is that I didn't care for the "Sugar Daddy" storyline at all, and that the ending was just a little too simple and predictable. I can't say for sure if I will continue to watch the series, but if I do, I think that Rodriguez will definitely add some more twists to this series. I give This Is The End (or Sugar Daddies) a 9 out of 9.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest movies ever made. It has a simple plot and some really funny moments, but it is also the kind of film that will have you in a deep slumber at the end. The film stars John Turturro as a high school dropout who has just arrived to the Big Lebowksi State Penitentiary. As the story develops, it becomes clear that the Lebowsky family is not what you think it is. A review by Peter Hessler  on Amazon.com:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKV8E7KHZD8C2D5A5KVU5K A very low-budget, but pretty good, comedy film that has a plot that involves an elderly couple who have a dispute over who has the right to move in on their new granddaughter's house and use the bathroom.   The plot revolves around the main character's attempts to get a housewarming present from his grandmother.     A film by Robert McKee:   A woman named Sarah is the daughter of the sheriff in her small town and works part-time as a waitress at the local diner. One night she sees a strange man in a dark hoodie walking around and soon she is convinced that he is the killer of her cousin who disappeared a few days ago. After she finds out that her cousin's murderer is still at large, Sarah goes in search of him and finds herself following his trail all over the town.   This is a very funny film and I think it may be the best one-woman movie ever made, and the acting is excellent. The movie is also full of interesting ideas about religion, race relations, and what constitutes a crime.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Would you like to write a review about an awful movie: Yes  The Best Picture of the 20th Century  There are two things I have to say about "The Best Movie of the Millennium", "Saving Private Ryan" and "Lincoln": They are aces. In a world where only two or three movies in a decade can compete with the classics, I was shocked to see that the same three have had such a large impact on my life. I had no idea that a movie could have such a long and enduring legacy. The Best Picture winner for the 20's might seem a little low when compared to "The King's Speech" or "The Sound of Music", but for some reason, it still makes me laugh out loud. In fact, even more than I expected. To make my own Top Ten, I added to it the film "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", which is a movie I really wish had won. "Life" is, however, a much more thoughtful film than either of these two. It's an excellent film that shows off many of the great movie actors of all time. The story is so rich, and the acting and cinematography are absolutely stunning. I will now give you the list: 1. "Saved by the Bell" 2. "Lolita" 3. "King's Speech", 4. "The Godfather" 5. "Gone with the Wind" 6. "Forrest Gump", 7. "Annie Hall", 8. "Apocalypse Now" 9. "Jaws" 10. "Field of Dreams" I could go on for a long time, but I think you see where I am going with this. What is fascinating to me is that these three great films, along with other great films such as "The Conversation" and the like, have had so much impact on the way we see the world, and have impacted us for decades. So much so, that people now claim that these movies have influenced many of their own choices, and that they have even become favorites in their own right. And of course, I hope you will take the time to watch these great movies, and perhaps even learn from them.  See the original review here
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gattaca" is an excellent movie.  It's also an excellent example of how to depict the future.  If you're not already watching it, please do.   I'm in. "GATTACA" tells the story of "Tardigrada" and her crew on the new frontier - Earth.  It shows us how their journey will change our lives and the fate of the human race as we know it.  Tardigrades are intelligent, furry, long-lived, extremely short-lived microscopic organisms.  They travel by the least aerodynamic, slowest known means - their ability to survive on and travel through the planet's surface and its layers.  This story is a cautionary tale about how humanity can go too far down a path to destruction.  The world that the Tardigards live in is a barren, inhospitable place of extremes and extremes.  When they begin to migrate, a race of parasites, known as the "Eggs" invade the Earth. The Tardigs have a "Tower" - a base which is protected by massive force fields.  Unfortunately, the forces are weak - and in some cases weak against the Eggs.  There's an ancient race of beings which created the force fields, the "Lords" or the "Dawn."  The E.V.U.I.T. are a group of humans who work to protect the Tards - but when the E.v.u.i.t. are attacked, the Eternals are forced to intervene. The Eternal heroes - known as "Dwarves" - are a species of humans.  Their goal is to help the Tarts - and to destroy the Ettins. "Gattuca" is a beautifully filmed story of human evolution, and of the struggle of one human species to survive the other.  I thought the film was very interesting, both to watch and to understand.  "GATTACIA" is also a lesson in how we can see the future of our world.  If we don't take action, the future that we're creating and driving toward is, in many ways, inevitable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was entertaining and fun, even though there was a little bit too much of a slow burn. I was more interested in the romance between Rufus and the woman from the bookstore, and I really enjoyed seeing how Rufo's backstory came to light in the final scene. I especially loved Rufi's reaction when Rufu told him he was his brother.   Rufus is very open about his life, and he has many great family and friends.   I recommend the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   "It's all been a dream"   By: T.E.L.   This is the very first movie I saw with director John Carpenter. A short-ish film, it was in fact, the very next one after this one (a very long night of watching films and trying to find something to get me to sleep!). After that, I got the impression that there were a lot of interesting films to be made by him, and that this would definitely be one of them. I must confess that I was not entirely impressed by this short film (although I am not a big fan of the director's work as it is), and I did not find it to be a very original film.   and here is my review of it:   I really wanted to like this film. I liked the story very much. I really liked the performances and the special effects. I like how the director kept the viewer involved at all times, and how he gave the character of John Carpenter something to do. I was even convinced for a short while that this film was going to be so much better than the others, as I was a huge fan of Carpenter and everything he had ever done.   was it a masterpiece or was it just a short film? If you ask me, a short, original film is definitely better than a masterpiece. It's a bit like when someone who's a fan of a particular sport says that the most exciting part of that sport is when one player makes the winning goal in a goal that was obviously scored by a teammate.  , I loved the story, the characters and the characters' emotions. The film is quite short but its shortness did not deter me in the least. I found it really interesting that this was a short and the story so original. But it was probably not meant to be an original film, but an introduction to a film that could make the audience really see what a true classic movie is like. I am still wondering if this was all an elaborate trick and I was actually meant to think that it was a masterpiece! I was really intrigued by the first part. It was quite simple. It started out in a small little town, and the narrator's name is John. It describes how the narrator lives his life in this small town and his struggles with his job. John is an ordinary man. He works hard at his job and has a lot to offer his family and his friends. He is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: A New Hope" (1977) is a film I will remember forever.  I watched it as a little kid on VHS when I was in my early teens and will never forget it.  It was a classic, a great story that I think most people who watch it can agree with, but it's also a film that people forget because of the decades that have passed and what not.  My friend, a film student I used to work with, told me how she got to the set and how she did not know how to get there.  She said she was driving through her neighborhood one day and then saw "Star Wars" on TV, the lights in the sky and she thought "Oh, my goodness!"  She was a kid that never thought about that kind of thing.  What she meant was that she saw the lights and the lights looked just like those that she was used to seeing and how did she not know where to go?  She had no idea. I will never watch another Star Wars movie again I guess that was the reason why it wasn't a success at the box office.  The thing is that, when you are in the film industry you are always trying to make a hit film.  You are always on your toes for a little while in order to not have a flop like "Jaws".  It is not uncommon to hear about films that were rejected and later re-filmed or even just re-titled.  With that in mind, why is it that "Jaw" was successful and "J.J. Abrams" had to reboot "Star Trek"?  Because the first "Star wars" was a hit, and it got people interested in seeing the next "Star war".  In fact, when the "New Jedi Order" was announced "Jedi" was not even in the news.  "Star lord" is the film that started the resurgence of "Star War".  We know that "Star knight" is going to be a good film, it will have great characters, and will probably be better than the first, but "Starlord" has to be considered more of an alternate sequel.  Why was this film a "stinker"?  I think it has to do with the writing, and the acting.  Both Chris and Andy were great as Luke and Ben and Andy made me a fan of his later in his career as a director

The ending was so satisfying and funny that you will find yourself in the middle of the story again and again. There were times I found myself laughing out loud. If you're a fan of horror movies, the ending of this movie will keep you coming back for more." 9. Night of the Living Dead  (1968) The last time I saw Romero's classic Night of The Living Dead, I had just turned 13 and I remember the sheer fear and excitement I felt seeing the zombie movie in IMAX for the first time. It is hard to put into words what makes this film so great but it is in the acting that it wins for me. As a child I found the acting in Night of THE Living Dead extremely impressive but now that I'm an adult and a member of the Horror community, I feel even more honored and impressed with how these people were able to capture the essence of a young boy and turn it into something so powerful. The film also contains a great twist at the end that will leave you feeling like you've just experienced the worst day of your life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Babette's Feast is an unusual comedy about a poor Irish girl who takes a job at a diner and becomes a best friend to a bumbling, overweight waitress. It has plenty of great scenes but never quite manages to crack any jokes. This one has the same story as the other French films I've watched so far and the main character is not as well-developed as in the others. The film had a good time introducing the character but didn't really get in any funny moments. The characters are very well-acted with the best performance of the film going to the lead, Patricia Clarkson.

It's just a bunch of characters sitting around doing a buncha things, and no one does anything. I had no desire to see it again. I wish I would have had the sense to turn it off when it was over."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing good in this movie. It has been said that this film's director John Carpenter was so sick of the Hollywood machine, he wanted to do something different. The result was a film about aliens that looked like teenagers and played a game with people who think that it's a real alien invasion. Well, it's not really an alien invasion if they look like teenagers. So what is it then? It's a film that has nothing good about it. It doesn't even have any good parts. This movie is a failure, I'll tell you that. I wouldn't want to watch this movie because I don't like teenagers, so if anyone did find this movie interesting, they would be better off watching a movie about teenagers. Watch this film if you want to see the director's first movie. I mean, what other choice is there? It is on Netflix. The film's quality is so bad, so low, that I would rather not watch it. I just don't care for it. Just don't watch this film and I won't tell anyone about it or give it any stars. That's all you need to know about this movie, really. If you enjoy this type of movie, you are not going to like much else in this world.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I would like to give this movie an eight out of ten. My expectations were set low by the last two entries in the franchise (aside from my dislike of the last film). I'm happy to be wrong about that. The movie begins with the usual opening credits followed by the familiar music, then a close up of a young boy in a dark, shadowy alley. After that is followed by a brief scene of a police officer approaching the alley, then the familiar voice of Tom Hanks saying "And we have to go," followed by his character sitting on a bench waiting for the ambulance to arrive. We are then shown the familiar faces of Tom and Marjorie (Hank's daughter), his wife Lois (Mary Steenburgen) and the two kids: Charlie and Tiana. The boys are playing with a firework and Marjaie wants to put it out, but is interrupted by Charlie and she accidentally sets the firework on fire. The two boys then rush to Marjory's aid, only to find that it is a prank by the little boy they just saved. Tom and Lois then enter the alleyway in a hurry, but the two boys start to leave the scene and a fight breaks out. It's then revealed that the two teens are really a group of bullies who just want to cause trouble. After a few tense minutes the boys get into the ambulance and leave the alley to help out the other kids. I was glad that the police came and the boys leave the group for a while. It gave me the chance to think about the characters, I felt a sense of sadness because they were so un-fortunate in their lives, like I said, their life just didn't work out as planned. After all, they are young and just trying to have fun. After Marjie and Charlie leave the area, Tom and the kids are left alone and it's time for the boys to do some more hijinx. It seems that the boys are being bullied by another group of kids, so when they get to the park they decide to do their hijinx there. They pull a fire hydrant over and throw it at the kids, which just makes them laugh. The next morning they meet up with Lois, but she isn't there. A few more kids run away and Marjeie decides to search the area for her. She then finds the fire hydractor and they head out to have a look. After the boys have a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed " The Last Jedi." I don't think I've ever enjoyed a Star Wars movie quite this much. This movie has the potential to get better over time, but it's too soon to tell for sure. The story is the most interesting element of the movie and I really want to see how it all comes together. I am eager to see where it all goes and I can't wait to see the second film. It's got everything we want. Great cast, a compelling story, interesting action, and great visuals.  My only real criticism is that it took me long enough to get used to the idea of a new Star Wars trilogy. After seeing the trailers, I was sold. But "The Last Jedi" is going to require a lot of time to sink into and I didn't get a lot out of it until the very end.  I am looking forward to seeing where "The Star Wars: The Last Hope" goes in 2019. I think that it will end up being even better than "The Force Awakens."  Here's a photo of me with "The Lost Stars" after I had just finished the movie:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love 'Crazy Rich Asians' - I had a feeling that this would be great, but the cast (especially Elizabeth) is a huge surprise. I'm going to say this was a good move. It really doesn't help that it's a remake of a hit movie from 15 years ago.  It's more a sequel than a remake - the main story stays the same.        It feels like the filmmakers were hoping they could just recreate the success of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and it really doesn, but I love this so much I can't help but love it all over again.    It's the same story, but it's not your typical Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood script.

You can tell they're trying to make it creepier by putting more of the monsters in it. A few of the zombies were very scary. The actors are all doing really well here.  The characters are all well acted. "It's funny because the main character seems to be pretty cool, but the other people seem to be kinda mean. So you can tell that the actors are just playing themselves, not the real life people, although I think they're pretty good at that. But I don't know, I'm kind of creeped out by it already.  I'm just watching it in a hotel room."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good film, good actors and great set and costume. I had no expectations. I had no ideas. It was like watching a car crash. It's a good car crash, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't enjoy slow films. The story is very simple. A couple go to a concert at an old hotel to celebrate the birthday of one of their relatives. A stranger appears and attacks them with a knife. The couple has to find the killer. That's it. The story is only about two things: the first is the struggle of the couple to escape, and the second is the pursuit of the killer who is obviously the most interesting character in the movie. There is a lot of fighting going on, but it's very low-key. There's a lot to this movie and it's fun to watch, but the film never really takes off. I felt the film was just there.   The film uses slow, deliberate shots and the characters are never given a chance to breathe.  This film is too slow and there's not enough time to get anything going, which results in a lot more fighting than the film has.  I've watched more films that are more exciting.  Even when they are a bit too fast, they have more action and it feels more like a movie and less like a horror movie.  It feels like the whole film is there just to get the killer, as opposed to the couple and the hotel.  The performances are not bad. I've seen a lot worse actors play worse roles.  But I feel the acting in the film is very bad and that's what really kept me from liking it.  While it's a really interesting set and a great look at a different time in history, it was also a bit boring for me.  After all, the movie has no purpose other than to get to the killer's hideout and that was enough for me to turn it off.  At first, I felt this movie could have been a lot better. Now, I think it could have had a lot easier time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took me a good amount of time to watch this movie and I'm not going to lie, I was hoping the first part was going to be a decent action film that actually made some sense, but no, it wasn't. What it did make sense of however was the concept of the movie, which was to have two actors, one a veteran and the other inexperienced, working together and having a "battle" in a small town to try and rescue a little girl. They had to travel from one end of the town to another in order to do it, and when they went to a diner, they met a bunch of crazy people in the bar. One of them got shot and got left behind by the two guys who were with him. So the two men decided to go after the little girl, and they were successful in getting her, but then the guy who was shot decided that the best way to get her back was to kill the older guy with the gun and take his place. He tried, but the older man pulled out his gun and shot him in the face. I'm a little confused as to how he didn't just put the gun down, but instead he took out his brother's gun and started shooting.  It wasn't the action the film made me like though, the acting. All of the roles in this movie were either played by young people who were extremely inexperienced or played by actors who played the same type of character in many other movies. It just was a bad mess of a movie. 4. The Best That Never Was (1995) This was the only film I've ever seen where I didn't laugh when the title card popped up.  This film actually had one of my favorite performances I've seen in a horror film and my favorite of all-time is in here. This movie also had a lot of gore, but when it was necessary it was done in a good way. I can't really go on with anything about the movie because it was a fairly long film and I just watched it about an hour ago and I couldn't really tell you much about it, but this movie was amazing, and if you have seen this one, then you have to see it. 5. Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1987) Hellraiser was one of the most influential horror films of all time, and Hellbound was another of those films that managed to be even more popular than the first one.

D. Milla on 29 June 2016  "Django Unchained" has always been a movie about an underdog. But on Saturday night, in an extraordinary, heart-stopping scene, it was also a movie that proved the power of the underdog — an underdog whose own courage, grit and tenacity overcame enormous odds. "Dj Unchained," which won the Best Picture Oscar at the 2012 Oscars, may never be mistaken for a historical document about slavery. But it is not only a historical story. It's also a story of an individual, an unrivaled individual, who has not only stood up to the odds, but overcome them in the end. "I can't tell you how much this movie meant to me," said Charlize Theron, the Oscar winner and "Mad Max" heroine, during a rare, candid moment before Sunday night's ceremony. "It's my first role as an African-American female, and it's a film that was so true to life — so real, and yet a film about a slave. And it is so much more than that." "Dirty Harry" is the obvious analogy here, with all the parallels in the story. And Theron has no intention of losing to "Drew Barrymore," nor is she worried about her status as one of Hollywood's few female movie stars. But what "Djon" says about how Hollywood — and the American people — will see her in the future is worth pondering.  This is the part where I tell you why you should see this movie. Theron is excellent. She delivers one of her finest performances as a woman who is determined not to let something — racism, sexism, whatever — keep her down. She's also one of the most physically intimidating and charming actresses on the planet. (Even in blackface! She can't really be white, right?) She plays the love interest, Dom, for Leonardo DiCaprio, who makes for an unforgettable performance. Dom is the one who sets the story in motion, is the guy whose actions and words force Django to face reality, the one person who can take the slave to the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The most memorable scene in the film is when a group of teenagers are hanging out, smoking and talking about how much they love each other.  One of them tells the other: 'Don't you think this place is hot?  They go on to talk about how hot everything is.   They are so right.  If this movie was filmed in a more liberal city than Berkeley, they would have no trouble finding a place to smoke pot or watch porn in peace.    A truly excellent movie. - - - The review ends there. The movie is set in Berkeley in the 1970s.  They try to get away from Berkeley as much as possible so they can have some peace and quiet.  I loved this movie for several reasons.  For one, this is a young girl, playing a girl.  It shows us that it can be difficult to become a woman.  There are times when you feel like a girl or boy for a day or a week or even longer.  Then you are forced into a masculine role and it is hard to get out of.  This is a movie that shows a girl dealing with the issue.  And it is a fun time to see a girl have fun.  Another good reason for my love for this movie is the fact that the people in this movie are so honest.  These guys are so open about their personal struggles, but they are not ashamed.  But they are more than that.  One character comes across as having mental and emotional problems.  You want to help him, but you don't.  The guy is like one of the kids on my high school swim team.  He is also one of those people who always tells you what you want to hear, but that is not a good thing.  A movie like this could be made today, but this is not it.  After reading a couple of reviews, I thought I would be upset with the story.  No, I wasn't. If you don´t know who these people are, don't be.  In fact, I think it is the best thing the movie does. It shows people who do not fit the stereotypes.     This movie would have made a great movie if I had seen it in the late 70s when the idea of coming out was new.

The script was actually good (though not great), the direction was perfect, and the film made me laugh, cry and cheer all at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it now, and if you do, I'd love to hear about it! The film is rated PG-13 due to the violence.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** This film is an example of what a Hollywood movie ought to be. It is a good and solid film that doesn't try to be something it is not. It's just good storytelling in the classic thriller genre. It also has the added feature of being a movie about a group of guys who are constantly trying to keep their friendship together when things start going south. The story is about a bunch of friends and their attempt to win over a new girl in their group who is a bit too "wild" for their tastes. The movie itself is very well acted and is full of interesting and exciting characters. It has it all. You'll definitely have a good time with it. It doesn't make many "gimmicks" but rather has great character development and a fun and fast-paced plot. It does have it's problems as well as good ones but overall it's a solid and enjoyable film. There are a lot of scenes in the film that are a bit confusing. That being said, for those who can handle a little confusion it's definitely worth a watch and certainly one of the best films of the year. *********  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I got to see this as part of the Toronto Film Festival and was surprised with it, it was funny and made me laugh a few times.  The film was about a young couple (Beth and Mark) who were very wealthy people. They had a very large home in the Hollywood Hills and drove around in a very fancy car that had four black leather-covered chairs in the back. They were so successful in their life and were so famous that it made them a target for everyone and anyone in their lives, including their very close friends. They met a wealthy couple (Molly and Kevin) with whom they were having an affair. Beth's friend Sue (Shawne Merriman) is an aspiring actress but was still interested in Kevin's advances. The couple decided to tell the people who they were and it lead to the couple getting caught. Molly then tells Mark that she and Kevin were having sex because they were madly in love. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Short, the biggest and most entertaining insider movie on Wall Street, may have done something most movies don't do. It didn't just make money. It made millions. The film, based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis, features some of the best acting and writing I've seen in a film. It's hilarious. It gets into the nitty gritty of how the world works and why people do things they shouldn't. It is a brilliant piece of reporting. It explains how the financial crisis began and how it affected the country. It does a really good job of giving us a sense of the real world where Wall Street works. It makes for interesting viewing and is, I think, a film that could teach us a lot about what we can do to fix what's going wrong. I enjoyed it.  It's not perfect, but it is very entertaining. A few of the dialogue exchanges were a little funny, but the whole movie is.  The film also stars Steve Buscemi, Michael K. Williams, Adam Scott, Chris Messina, Jason Schwartzman, John Goodman, Kate Hudson, Robert De Niro and Kevin Costner.  The Big Short is being distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I enjoyed this film, but not in the way I was expecting. I enjoyed it a lot, not the least of which is the acting, which is really, really good. I liked the story of how the film came to be and how they had to make a film out of a book that nobody had read, and I liked how they managed to adapt a novel into a film without giving away any major plot points. I felt that the author, Eoin Colfer, had his hand in this one, as there were quite a few Easter eggs and references to the book throughout the film. If you're a fan of Colfer's books, then this is definitely a film you don't want to miss. The film is rated PG-13 for some violence. _____________________________________________________ "It's like a dream come true. There's a great story inside this film. You just have to sit and let it unfold in front of you." I just loved this movie. I really loved it. There's a lot of action, violence and suspense in this film and it's definitely a must-see for fans of the book series. If the novel series is something that's not for you, I don't think I'll be disappointed.  I hope you enjoyed this review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Candy Cane is a film that reminds me of the old time silent movies. The main character (the story is narrated by the mother of the main character, a black woman who works as a housekeeper in an American hotel) makes a deal with the devil. In the Devil's bargain she is forced to kill someone, a white man. The killer is an African-American and the motive for the crime is greed. At the end the woman is caught in an act of violence and goes to jail. In a scene that is extremely reminiscent of The Exorcist, she is tortured in a room which looks like a black man's home and her mother-in-law has been set afire and dies. In her cell she is told that the Devil has come to collect and that the black man (whom the film never identifies) is in a mental asylum, in fact an African American asylum. When the film ends the film goes on with the usual scenes of African American women in prison, a funeral and the police chasing the killer. I guess this makes it a kind of Black Horror film and a Black Horror movie does not need to make an issue of race, because it is a Black film.  It is clear that in this movie the African American woman (who is black and who happens to be the main female character) is a victim and is in prison because of her race and gender. If this movie was not made by a black filmmaker then it would just be one more example of the exploitation of the African-Americans in the United States. But even this is not what I find so offensive about this movie. Instead I think this movie reveals a kind the hypocrisy of African- Americans in America today and is the most important and profound film of the year that I have seen.   Black horror movies like Candy Cane are always a response to a racist society. They can be a form of escape or escape into a different world. As a genre they are not always explicit, however they are often about the African Americans in a more or less negative way. The stories in these movies are often deeply spiritual in nature and often refer to the spirit world. This is an important movie, if only because it has made me think. It gives me hope that black Americans can be strong, independent people who can do good things for each other. -G
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Beauty" has to be the one movie I saw this year that made me feel truly sad. I was sitting alone in my apartment in the dark, listening to it on loop for the first 10-15 minutes, as if I was actually sitting there at the cinema with my headphones on the whole time.   My thoughts were "Wow, if you love this movie at all, I cannot recommend it enough. It's well worth your money".  But then I remembered something.  I'm a person who loves horror movies, and I love horror films, but I love them in a different way. I love their fear. I feel it. And I love the way it's done. It doesn't feel like an exercise in psychological torture. It feels more like a performance art. I can see why people loved it so much, and that makes me sad, because this movie is not a horror movie. It is a performance piece. It makes me feel sad to see a movie where the audience just sits there silently and applauds a lot, just like the movie itself. I am sad.    This is not the last time I'll say this. I believe this movie isn't a horror film. It has a lot of horror in it, but there is also the way the audience can be sucked in and take the role of the monster. I don't think it's an action movie. I think it is a horror performance piece, and it's not the best horror performance performance I've ever seen. But the horror is there, and the audience is just like me.  They want to be frightened. It isn't meant to be scary, but it is meant to keep them scared. And in some way, that is what the movie is about. It is a tribute to horror movies in general. I'm not saying I love every single one of them. But I am saying, that The Great Beauty is more than just a tribute. It actually is a homage. It brings out the true nature of the horror genre, and how the genre has been able to transcend time and time again. Horror is timeless. The story follows a small group of friends, mostly teenagers, who go to an all-night party called the Great Beauty. But, as they get drunker, they begin to lose their grip on reality, and are drawn into the nightmare. In the end, this movie doesn't have a plot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A beautiful, well-made film that's at least two degrees above the average schlock. This film is so good, I can't believe it came from a Hollywood director, or a studio, or any outlet for that matter. It's like one of the last great family movies, if you're a kid in the late '50s, a few good actors and a well-acted script can make anything 'good' but in this case, it's like it was filmed in the early '70s."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** A well made action flick with great story lines. It really has a very good plot line for a movie about a young man going on a journey. The story line is really cool and has alot of great scenes. It is also good that the character is different in every scene. You really get to feel what the character feels at a given time and is also different in each scene. For some scenes it's a bit too much and you feel a bit bored. But for the most part the plot is interesting and the story line was nice. I would recommend this to any fan of action movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I had never heard of this movie until I saw the trailer for the new season of 'The Voice'. I must admit I did not watch the new show, but the trailer made me go to the web site and watch the trailer, thinking that it might be interesting. I got the DVD at the local video store, and I was not disappointed! This was a great movie. A nice mixture of drama, comedy, and the occasional emotional moment was done with some skill and creativity. It is a beautiful and powerful piece of film-making and well worth a watch. ______________________________ I am a big fan of a good romantic comedy. And it has always seemed that many of those movies were in the form of comedies of manners, because it was almost impossible to make a romance movie that was really any good. But one of the most memorable comedies that I can remember is 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. I think it is only fair to say that 'A Beautiful Mind' has that movie in it too. A Beautiful Mind may not be the funniest movie out there, but it is certainly the funnest movie about a great mind that I have ever seen. And a good mind like Richard Feynman's is no easy task. For most of the time, the movie centers on Feyn mania and his search for truth. But as the movie progresses, the story takes a darker turn, and it becomes an intense emotional roller coaster. If you are the type of person that enjoys a good dramatic, suspenseful and emotional movie, then 'A beautiful mind' is for you. If not, then you will find it a little boring. But it does have something for everyone. It will appeal to the person who wants a good rom-com, but don't expect to feel the emotions of a romantic comedy on a grand scale. I would say that it is for people who enjoy a good thriller as well as a romantic movie, and a good emotional film on top. And if you are not a great romantic comedy fan, I would still say that this is one of those great movies that is perfect for your viewing tastes.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Sick  was written and directed by Kumail Nanjiani, who is an actor who is very funny and knows how to play a character well.  He plays the father of a man who has an STD that prevents him from having sex and who falls in love with a woman who is living with her mother.  The film is loosely based on Nanjian's own experiences and it deals with issues that plague young men and women.   It is one of the most talked about movies on Twitter, so we decided to go to the movie theater to see it before writing an opinion.  I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised to see a good comedy with an amazing cast, and one of our favorite films of the summer.  It follows a man named Kumail (Nanjiani) who is diagnosed with a fatal virus.  He has sex and then has to get tested.  There are things happening in his life that make this an interesting journey for Kumail.  His friends have sex, his girlfriend is a hooker, and he does a lot of drugs.  So much so that he is hospitalized with a drug overdose, which causes him to miss a great baseball game.  Kumail's life takes a big turn when a girl named Mary (Lily Tomlin) walks into his life, and the two fall in love.  The movie follows their relationship and their relationships to each other.  They have to take time out to get each other through sickness, sex, and drugs. The movie's acting is top notch and there are some really nice scenes in it.  One of the more interesting parts of the movie is that there is a woman living with Mary.  This woman comes from a broken home and has always had an issue with sex, but never with her own mother.  This woman, in the beginning, tries to get Mary pregnant with her.  While that is happening, she is constantly being raped and raped again by Kumails friends and the rest of the guys in the movie.  Mary also has some issues with her mom and it makes for some really interesting scenes.  Some of the best moments of the film are when they get in the car and Mary says to Kumail, "I don't think you'll make it."  When he gets to her house, he tells her that he's going to have sex and he is afraid it will kill her.

It was a great film. __________________ Why is it terrible? _____________________________ There are too many mistakes. There are not enough good moments. The story is lame. The editing is lame because it was done by someone who never worked on a film like this before. I can't remember the name of the director, but I remember being embarrassed by this film, even though I had to pay to see it because it's a "mockumentary". __________________________ Is it worth seeing? ____________________ Yes, just the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Airbender is a good film. I really enjoyed the story and its plot, the characters are really cool and funny, I like the way the music is used. My favorite scene from the film is probably the end and its animation. I also really liked how there is a scene in the beginning of the film where the main characters are in their dream. I think its a very important scene to the story since it really shows how the dream can connect us and become a connection to the world in the real world. I like how there are many different elements in the film, like a love story, action, magic, and humor. The music is also good and fitting for the film. The animation of the character design is pretty cool. It has a lot of detail and its great. The opening song is pretty good and I really liked it. Overall I really like the film and I recommend it. It is a great film to watch with your family or friends.

It may not make you laugh out loud or anything, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. If you have some time for your Saturday night and some good movies on the menu, this is one I would recommend. It is a fun watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm going to go into a lot of details but basically they had a movie set in a high school, the main character is the nerd. The other kids are the jocks that want to be more than they are and in their world there's a competition of "coolness". This movie is basically a battle of who's the coolest. The nerd has to fight off the jock and eventually the jocker comes out and takes down the nerd with the help of the bully. The final act of the movie is the joker, in a sense the nerd is the bad guy and he's a "dark" jock that takes part in the jokers competition.  This is one of the most violent, disturbing movies I have ever seen. There are scenes of gore, body horror and violence that would make any parent in the late 80's cringe. Some of the scenes are over the top and hard to watch. It's a good thing the cast doesn't look like the people in the movie but they do get beat up and are all beaten to death. I'm not a big horror movie fan so I didn't expect anything great from this but this really is one hard to take seriously. -Stars: James McAvoy, Michael Sheen, Jeremy Sisto, Kaya Scodelario, Michael Pena, Paul Schneider  I enjoyed this. I found it somewhat hard to stomach for some reason but it's not that bad. I also found that some of the more violent scenes were not that funny and I wasn't the least bit shocked or shocked that the jokers killed the nerd so quickly. This movie doesn't really hold my interest. I'll see it once a month or so at least to keep my interest going and the cast is really good in it. I won't say it's a bad movie but it is very entertaining.

In my memory, it's a classic. In fact, "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Dark Knight" are close to it. The best thing about it is it's story, the plot! When I think about what that means to me, I feel proud. I also remember when I saw it the first time in my school's theatre, I had tears in my eyes. I think everyone in my class loved it. I know I did. I loved the film and the ending. I'll never forget it, it was an indescribable feeling. "The Emperor Strikes Back", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and even "The Fugitive" are films that really made a big impact in my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** The fact that this movie got such a great critical reception is a testament to the fact that it has a great cast and the great script.  I can't say enough good things about the movie, and if you've ever wondered what it would have been like to have a big budget blockbuster made in the 80's that involved women in the lead roles, I think you'll enjoy this movie.   I enjoyed it a lot, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes action movies and likes their female characters in them to be complex, strong and not just as sex objects.  There's nothing worse than watching a big Hollywood movie where there's no interesting female characters.  It's as if the producers thought "Well, the audience is too stupid to know what to do with these women anyway, so let's just leave them in the movie and pretend they're real." I give this movie a rating of *******************  (Out of ****). ************************** Here's a picture of the cast of THE ROCKET GRUDGE in action!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You know it's a little hard to believe a little guy named Michael Douglas and a gorgeous redhead with glasses can co-star in a film with such a plot line, but here's the first look at that, and in this case you can believe it.  A.J. Abrams' Abrams, and Steven Spielberg's Spielberg, do great work making the big-budget films that cost $100 million to make, which seems to be the only thing that matters in this world.     But they couldn't have done it without the talented and devoted casts that are supporting the cast of this film and all the characters they have to portray, especially the one of the father.  Abrams is one of those producers that can just do whatever he wants to do, and here you have a family that has gone down the same path that they had before. Michael Douglas plays Johnnie Cochran, a guy who has his own show in the form of a talk show, where he meets his new wife, and the couple have their first child, who is called Lila. The baby has very dark hair, but he doesn't look like he is the first child to have dark hair. The next child is called Johnny, and he has blonde hair. Lila's husband (played by Bradley Cooper) was trying to take care of his son and was having trouble because his son didn't seem to have any mother in his life. So he was looking around for someone who would take care. That's when he found his wife, whose name is played by Penelope Cruz.  in a nutshell, there's a new family of people in town and everyone seems to look at them as outsiders, because they have children with black hair.   It was a difficult time for Cochran and he needed help. He found his own family, the McCarthys, who were a great family, but now they are no longer a family. Cochran's wife was killed in a car accident and then it is his kids to keep his world together, because he had a baby with the wife that he had killed, and now the kids have to take charge.   This is an excellent film for both black people and parents of kids of different races. In this particular situation, the kids play this game, and if they fail, they are punished. That happens quite often in the movie,

This is one of the only times I am willing to go back to the movies I've seen before and re-watch the same movie to see how well it does in terms of its story and acting. I also did not think the movie was that good at the beginning, I thought I would be disappointed because I had seen it too many times already. This movie had a good beginning.  I like the story and the characters so far. I am not a fan of the bad guy who looks like a zombie but has the face of a man.

A fantastic film about a man and a woman who, in a battle of wits and skill, become the most unlikely partners ever. They both face incredible trials in their journey to find love and to be married. One thing I find very impressive is that the cast is fantastic and the performances are outstanding. One of my favorite performances is from Robert Preston as their landlord. He has a terrific chemistry with the woman and even has one of the funnier moments in the movie. I love the way he portrays a guy who thinks he is so clever and is so completely and utterly clueless that he has to go and find someone else to play along with him. I like to think that Preston is the best actor of his generation. The movie is wonderful and one of my favorites. ____________________________________ -B.F. - October 22, 2004A timeless masterpiece

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The Boy Next Door was filmed on location in and around downtown L.A. and also in the San Fernando Valley and Beverly Hills. It has a strong script, great characters, and a superb special effects performance by the always underrated John Frankenheimer. The picture was also produced by the great Francis Ford Coppola. There is a very well put together cast, including some very fine supporting cast. John Frankenheim, as a young boy in the 1940s, is a lot like me, so I like to think that this is a true tale of love. I like the contrast between the adult world, the city and the suburbs and the kid world. It is very cleverly done and it gives you a sense of where all of this came from. For a time I was one of the fans, but after awhile I had to think again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I have not seen the movie "Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" in a long time. I thought that "20,000 L's" was a pretty good movie, but, I liked "Jule". "Juls" is another story about Jules Vernes in this time period. His brother, and his son, have just become old and decrepit, and he is forced to do odd jobs to pay the bills. When he discovers an abandoned ship, and it seems that it could be for his brother, he decides to take the vessel, and to travel to the other side of the earth to save his brother. But, as they have little to no supplies, and a great deal of trouble with the locals, he eventually runs out of gas and can only wait until the next day, when they will have to leave and they will need to find another way to the ship. But then, as it so happens, they find a submarine that has been abandoned for many years, and they use it to escape and reach the other world, and save Jules.  I liked this movie, it has a lot of humour and fun and just really had a fun and interesting time. The special effects are really pretty good, and the film itself was really pretty fun.   It took a while for me to get into this film, but once I did, I really liked it." #2, #3 and #4.  #5, #6 and #7 are "H.G. Wells" movies.

I am not kidding, it's that bad. I thought at first I was going to get a punch in the face, but then I realized it was just a cut to black. What was so weird was that when the movie ended, the next scene showed the killer, but the audience wasn't shown the killer.   and here's why I love the scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you enjoyed The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, or watched it without knowing it was based on Stieg Larsson's book, then this film is worth a watch. If you are familiar with the book, you'll find much of the same story told, with a few changes that you won't see coming. There is much more to the story than what you find in the movie, which is not always a bad thing, and Larsson has a knack for keeping the characters you love. There are two endings, and both are very good, and the film is definitely worth a look. If nothing else, I found a bit of humor in the film, and it is not the type of humor that you would get in a movie like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoos. The music is much like the music in the book. Some of it is good, some of it isn't, and there is some heavy metal that comes in and out of the music, but it's not a bad soundtrack by any stretch. If it's the type you like, there is enough that you will like it. It's not an easy watch, and you can definitely see why this film was so popular, and so well received. I would suggest giving it a shot, but only after you've seen the book (which you should probably do), and really dig into the book and the character, because the movie is just a little bit more than the book in some areas, and a little more than Larsson in other areas. I give The Girl Without A Dragon Tatt on the Run a 7/10.

You know how you feel when you just find something that is just so... special that you just can't put your finger on it? That was definitely a thing with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. There are a ton of things to like about the film. The CGI is incredible, the direction, music, and of course the acting. The film takes a few too many time jumping and stopping to allow the viewer to get comfortable. This is a movie I just had to see. I've been looking forward to this one for so long, and I'm sure others are as well. If you have seen all the other movies, you'll probably love this one too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gotham City Sirens is a terrific, fun movie.  My favorite of the three DCAU movies, and certainly one of the best DCAU films.  I have no desire to read a graphic novel about a teenage girl's transformation into a bat.  But I do have an interest in getting my hands on the graphic novel version, as it was really fun to see this version of a popular comic character turned into the next big thing.  While Batman doesn't go all out in this film, he doesn't really have anything to really complain about.   The plot is good, and there are some really great scenes.  The only part I didn't like was when Batman and Robin take an impromptu trip to Gotham City in search of The Penguin.  I don't mind the action in a good action movie, but it does come off a bit "forced."  I'm not really sure how the Penguin fits into the story, but I do think that it could have been used as a better tool for the villains.  At least, I think the Penguin would have had more of a chance to grow as a villain.  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is my favorite movie in the DCEU, and I look forward to seeing the other three films when they come out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) The Dude (1998 - The Coen brothers remake) The Big Lebowksi is a movie based on a comic strip by the same name. The character is a drug dealer who is in search of his brother. It tells a story about life in the south of the USA. This is a comedy, which is very funny and easy to watch. The Coens are also credited in this movie as executive producers. A lot of actors (especially in the film The Coon) played themselves. This film is very interesting, as it shows a very different type of south american culture and society. This movie is one of the most underrated movies ever made.  My personal favorite Coen Brothers film.  Read a positive reviews from critics: The Coen's The Big Short (2014) A Serious Man (2015) The Biglebowski  is a comedy and an art film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The movie was released on April 1, 1998. It is a story of two brothers living together and living their days to the fullest. One of the brothers, named Leb, is a notorious drug dealer that tries his hardest to hide his criminal activities. The other brother, called The Dude, is the kind of guy that just lives his life in a "happy bubble" and doesn't care about anyone but himself. Their parents, played by John Goodman and Jeff Bridges respectively, are both absent and don't bother to help out, making The Dude's life miserable. In order to find his missing father (played by Jeff Bridges) the two brothers make a deal with a shady gambler called "The Big" who claims to have money from God and is willing to pay them a lot of money to find their missing father.  The movie is very well written and is well cast, especially in the main role. The Dude and Leb are a great comedic duo that are perfect for each other. The actors do a great job in playing opposite each other and the movie is perfect in its style of comedy. The plot of The Big lebowski is very similar to their other films, The Big Red One and No Country for Old Men, which made the plot easier to understand and watch.  This is probably one of my favorite films from Joel and the brothers. Read more bad reviews for The Biglebuck  : Read some positive reviews about this film: This
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ "I want to know who you are!" In the early 1970's a high school basketball player named Robert Johnson was found dead in a hotel room with a woman he met that night. The police found no clear motive for his death, but did find out he was in a relationship with a waitress named Betty Davis. She didn't want to press charges, but Johnson's family was adamant she needed to be investigated, and the two went to the local sheriff to ask for help. In 1979 Betty and Johnson's daughter, Joelle, went to California to investigate her father's death, and ended up meeting a group called The Family, who claimed he was still alive, and had no reason to kill himself. The Family claimed that Betty had been involved in a sexual relationship with Johnson before her death, though the facts of the case have never been clear. It seemed as though Betty had a lot of reasons to want to kill her ex-husband, but she's not the only one. The film opens with Joelle driving through the forest with her father (Michael C. Hall), and he seems a bit confused. He seems to be having trouble with the idea that he's in another country. He then proceeds to drive the car into a ditch, and Joelle notices he's wearing a ring that doesn't seem to fit. He continues to drive, and a long, long shot of him driving down a road. In the background, there's a group of men doing some kind of job. One of them starts shooting at them, but they're too far away to be seen by the audience, except for the bullet holes in the window of the car. Later, at the local bar, Joellene's brother Johnny (Will Forte) starts drinking, and starts to have an emotional breakdown. Betty shows up at the bar, and Johnny's drunk and disoriented. He ends up getting a drink, but ends up passing out again. He falls asleep, but the bartender says, "You can't drink alcohol. You're too drunk." He wakes up, and finds his ex-wife in a very compromising situation. Then, Betty calls Joelle and brings her back to the hotel to meet Robert. She tries to make excuses for why she doesn't want him to leave, but Joelle refuses to believe anything Betty says. In their conversation, Robert's sister (Kathy Bates) comes into the room, and sits on the couch

I enjoyed the story, it's not so dark, as I think it should have been, and the music was good. This movie had some nice special effects. It doesn't feel like a huge story, but it does a good job of setting it up and then letting you explore it. The special effects were a nice change from the dark and gory style of the other Godzilla movies and the characters are nice. A good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a Hollywood world that seems obsessed with "what-ifs" (what if the lead had been a less attractive actress?), "The Room" is not so much about a potential love triangle as it is about an awkward situation that could've been easily avoided.  If the producers had listened to the director's vision instead of being obsessed with getting it "right", the entire movie could have played out differently.  A big reason the movie was so successful:    The film's success is largely due to its humor, and the fact that it's not all serious and serious-ish.   The comedy works as much as it does for the fact it has a story behind it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film which is not about religion, but about the love that can grow between two brothers over many years is a film to be savoured. The story revolves around the lives of two brothers. After their father leaves them as a teenager, they start a family of their own, with their father as a grandfather figure. When their father and mother have a disagreement in their old age, it eventually leads to a battle between them that would change both the sons' lives and the lives as a whole. A touching story about two brothers who have grown up to become the loving parents their son deserves to have. The film begins with a beautiful shot of a sunrise that is reminiscent of the film's main title:     A gentle light rises from the horizon, casting an atmosphere of tranquility. In front of the sun, a small and smiling family with a baby in tow waits for the sunrise to take them to their new life. The family, the baby, the man, and the woman share a special bond that cannot be described. The camera slowly follows their every move, as the baby cries for the sun to come out and the young girl is waiting with hope.  The children's family is happy with the arrival of the dawn.    As the sun rises over the horizon with a bright smile, the children are in the center of the picture, their smiles bright and hopeful. They are so pleased with their new lives that they are full of happiness.  One day while walking in the field, a man who is in the family of the girl and her husband catches sight of the children in the middle of the field. As he is admiring them, his attention is caught by a woman in the group. As she looks at him, the husband approaches her, asking what she is looking at. He is curious about the girl because he noticed she had been with a man. He asks her to tell him everything about herself, and in a few moments, he tells her the reason she is there. She is there to look after her elderly father, who is unable to walk, and her daughter has been with him for a long time.  The woman is shocked to learn what her children have done, and tells her husband to leave her alone.  Then she proceeds to tell her husband everything she knew about the children. When the husband hears this, his eyes begin to water, and he calls his wife to stop lying.  She tells her story to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Towering Inferno" by Katerina Sarafian has a lot of humor and action. The main character's girlfriend (the sister of the director) is in a relationship with a rich guy who owns a zoo, where the main character is her pet. The girlfriend's boyfriend, a former military officer, sees this as a way to get to the rich guy's family. So he gets her on board and off he goes to get the girl. The girl, in turn, gets kidnapped by the rich dude and put up for sale. The wealthy guy has a new lover who is a former cop and so there is a lot on the line. The only problem is that he wants to keep it a secret so she has to figure out a way not to get killed. A good mix of comedy and action with some romance. Great stuff. I saw it at the Venice Film Festival and a number of the reviews have mentioned the great costume design of Sarafyan. This one is a "sizzle reel" with all sorts of great costumes. The movie is not as good as the first movie but it is still an entertaining movie. There is something to be said about the fact that Sarafyaian was a former police officer and the humor in the movie is very police based. I think this movie will appeal to some of the younger fans of the first.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few years back I was asked by a reader, who was a fan of the classic '80s TV show 'Camelot' (which ran for 8 seasons, from 1978 to 1983), if I wanted to write a screenplay based on the series. So I went out to buy some books that I had written in the 1980s and took a lot of notes. I knew that the series was based on a 16th century Irish legend, so I did the necessary research to get the story into the right period and then came up with the story which was inspired by this real Irish legend. It was written for a small theater production with an emphasis on story telling and dialogue that really gets under your skin.  After working on it for a year, I thought the screenplay would be a good idea for my screenwriting class at the University of Wisconsin. I taught it over a few weekends to the other students as part of the class. The students loved the script and I thought they would love it a lot. So, in the summer of 1988 I sold the script to a small screenwriter, who wrote a spec for a feature film with some of my original character ideas.  I thought that would be it for me and that I would never write another screenplay for another movie ever again, but about six months later I was contacted by a new producer and screenwriter for another feature film in my old genre, the romance genre. They wanted me to write the screenplay for their new feature. The new producer, Michael Dippold, asked me what my thoughts were on the new genre, which I loved, and he also asked me to do the screenwriting course he was teaching at the Screenwriting School in Hollywood.   As I was sitting in the office, Michael started to tell me what he wanted the students to learn from the class: the rules of screenwriting. I was very skeptical at first because I was not familiar with many of the rules. I just wanted to learn how to write great scripts. I told him about the three basic rules:   * The Story Rule - tell a compelling story, the most basic rule of any screenwriting screenplay. This is so important that every great screenplay is told in that format.  * Dialogue Rule - keep your dialogue to a minimum and keep your scene structure simple, keeping the dialog free of unnecessary lines that will bog down your movie.  - keep the dialogue free of unnecessarily long words that will slow down the movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the spirit of all things 'Hurt Locker', this film is pretty good. I don't think there was anything that came near being a 'Hollywood blockbuster', but it was definitely entertaining and had some really cool action. In this film, we learn more about the relationship between the characters and how the CIA are handling the situation with the Russians. If you are a fan of the movie 'A Few Good Men', this is a pretty good way to take a breather from the action and see more of the characters. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan (or even just a fan) of the James Bond movies. There was not much to complain about as far as story and characters went, and I'm glad I got to see this. It was fun to see James Bond in a fun film, and a good way of ending my Bond Week. I think we are still getting more James Bond, and if you love the James Bonds, then this is definitely one to watch out for.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Do you believe in magic? Do you think your life is a mystery? Maybe not. You're not alone, though. Your life is full of mysteries, all of them just as amazing and mysterious as the next one. The question we need to ask is whether you believe or not in the existence of any of them. Do you accept that there are no miracles, no miracles possible? It's a long list, isn't it? There are so many that they're practically one-dimensional. We can't see more than a quarter of what's going on and it's all so mysterious and we can't put our finger on it. Then there are all these things that are so obvious and simple that we can see them right away and they're not miraculous, either. In fact, we know they're just facts of life. How often do you hear somebody say, "Yeah, I've known for a long time that the world's going to end tomorrow. There are just too many things going on. It'll all be a lot simpler." Now, I'm not saying it will all be so simple, but it's very likely that a lot of them are going to be simplified. I do believe in miracles, but only in those that are really miraculous. I believe in them. There will be more than enough miracles to keep me happy. I have to believe in a miracle, though, or else I'm just a fool. I can't have that. I mean, how many people can say they know what's gonna happen in the world tomorrow? It has to be some kind of miracle. If it isn't, it's just another case of wishful thinking.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Let me start off by saying that The Grand Budapest Hotel was a movie that I had completely forgotten about. I saw it as an 8.25am Sunday morning and the whole thing was just starting to fade away. I was so bored that I forgot about it and put it in the "maybe see it again" pile. As I started to read this review, it just got stronger and stronger. The film tells the story of the hotel manager, Paul Verhoeven, who is tasked with running the Grand Budapest hotel after its previous owner, a Russian prince, was mysteriously murdered. The Grand is a luxury hotel that is extremely extravagant, as it is located in the middle of a city of about half a million people. The hotel is in need of some serious refurbishment, which is why Paul Verhoefen is hired to look after it. The previous owner had kept it in a state of disrepair from the day it was built, and although it was the crown jewel of the city, it was now in dire need of renovation and needed a new owner to put it on the right track. It also needed some much needed money. Paul Verhouefen knows nothing about hotels, but it does not matter. He takes charge of the renovation and works his way through a number of contractors and workers, taking on a number things that could never be completed on his own, such as renovating the bathrooms. The problem is that Paul is unable to fully comprehend the nature of the business and what is required. He is unaware of the need for new tenants or the need to sell or give away the existing tenants, which eventually results in Paul Verhuest getting embroiled in a dispute with a Russian businessman, Boris. Boris is the new owner of the Grand, but he is reluctant to sell it to Verhoven, as the money he would get from selling it to Paul Verhofven is much more than he can afford. Boris has a number more tenants that Verhohen will have to evict. These tenants include a young woman named Tatiana, who works as a maid in the hotel, who has a penchant for gambling. She gambles every night in the casino, which leads to Paul being accused of breaking the "no gambling" rule in the house. As a result, Paul is placed under house arrest and is being watched over by a security guard named Dr. Frikkin. Paul becomes angry at Dr.frikkin when he discovers that he is sleeping with

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** This movie is the best one of 2012 and it is not only for it's acting it is also for the story line it presents. ******** The movie is about a young couple that goes to stay with their aunt and uncle in her family who is a famous doctor. There is a problem because the uncle, he has a secret love for his sister. So he has this idea that he can get rid of the uncle by seducing her sister. It works perfectly and the uncle is now married to the niece. There are some weird moments and weird choices with the story.  The acting and the soundtrack is really good with some great acting.   I give this movie 7 out of 10 because some parts are really weird with the characters and the music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  is a movie that is all about the heroine, Lisbeth Salander, played by Daniel Craig. Her character is very complex and she is the main antagonist of the story. She is the sole protagonist, the female protagonist, and she comes from a family of thieves that has been in business for many generations. The story has many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, and it is a thrill to watch her fight off and outwit a whole host of foes. She is very intelligent and is a formidable warrior. In a word, she is great. As a movie, The Girl with a Dragon Tatt on's strengths are its acting and cinematography. The film is a real thriller and the character development is superb. In the end, I am more of a Daniel Craig fan so I enjoyed the story of The Girl who didn't say anything in the movie. Her character is really not that great and it seems to be a shame to let such a great actor play such a small role. In the end the story is very good, the story being one that will keep you guessing and keep you interested. The Girl also has some great music. The soundtrack and sound effects is awesome and it works very well with the movie, and the film's atmosphere is also great. In conclusion, The girl with a dragon tattoo is a good, good, great movie. The acting is very decent and the cinematography is very great. The music is good as well and the soundtrack has that special touch that makes it stand out from most others. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies of this nature and especially to fans of Daniel Craig and LisbETH Salander. It is a great film.  In fact, it is one of the best films of 2014. I give The Girl without a Dragon TATTOO a rating of  8.0 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gravity" is an outstanding movie and an all time favorite of mine. I am currently in the middle of rewatching it and am enjoying every minute of it.  It is a beautiful film with a unique style that will be enjoyed by many, especially those who have never seen it before. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that I was pretty surprised at how well the music fits the tone and pace of the film. It was one of the only parts I noticed during the film that I liked.  A man with no wings is sent to Earth.  He finds that he has no wings.  In fact he is completely paralyzed.  The man struggles against the forces of gravity and comes up with a plan to escape Earth. What he has created is a device which would allow him to be able to soar above Earth with nothing but air.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed it very much.  It was a good change of pace from the more violent movies I usually enjoy.  Overall:   I don't want to make this review sound like I was complaining or complaining too much, but I didn't think it was as good as the previous one.    There's a slight difference in tone between the second and third, but that's not really enough to tell me anything about the quality of the films.  My rating: 3 stars out of 5
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  I really liked the movie: This is my first time watching an action movie and I am very excited for this movie.  It is not like a regular action movie like "Iron Man" or "The Dark Knight". This movie is very well made. The characters were well developed. The special effects are good. I liked the idea of the movie, that it is about the human spirit and the struggle to be a true man.  of course I loved the song, the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ I had seen it in theaters a couple of times before it came out. It wasn't until it was nominated for a Golden Globe that I finally watched it. So I was excited when I saw the new trailer. I was especially excited because I like the film, but I'm also not a huge sci fi fan. The film looks great and the special effects are incredible. The main plot that they are going through now are about a group of soldiers that are stranded in an alien land, but the trailer also showed more of the characters as the film develops. This film has lots of action scenes, which I love, and the film's plot really intrigues me. The special effects really sell the movie as well. I am still undecided if I will watch it again. ____________________________________________________ The plot of the movie, as of right now: The crew are soldiers, who are traveling to a planet where a new civilization has been formed. While on the ship, one soldier is shot, but he doesn't die. After they leave the planet, the survivors realize that they were on the wrong planet. On their way home, the ship starts to get damaged and they are forced to leave. The movie will have a little different style than your usual sci fi movie, because it was based off a book. It's about a new alien civilization that is trying to colonize the earth and they don't have a huge fleet like the aliens in most of the Sci Fi films. The new alien race is less violent, but more intelligent. The aliens also have a strange alien language and they speak their own language. You'll also see a lot of other alien races, because the film will show off more of how the aliens interact with humans. As I said before, I enjoyed the movie's storyline, but it has a little bit of a different style from a typical Sci Fi film. The action scenes were great, but also pretty much what you would expect from a Sci Fi movie. I liked it a lot, but probably wouldn't be my first choice to watch it on the big screen. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ The trailer I watched: ___________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Is there a better movie?  "I'm coming for your life!"  And then it was over. I looked at the time. It was 3:20. It had been over twenty minutes.  The phone rang.  a male voice. I knew that voice. It sounded the same as the voice I'd been talking to. And like the last three phone calls.  I knew it was him. I know it was the same guy on the phone. He'd had the same idea. . It was the police. The person in question. My husband. 1 1/2 hours after I'd left my husband's residence and driven off the state line, the police came to my house and arrested me on two counts of manslaughter. And I was being held in the Franklin County Jail in Pittsburgh for the night. I was in jail because I'd refused to return to my husband. He had not only threatened to kill me; he'd used his gun, in the most brutal and despicable way. He wasn't just saying that he was going to shoot me; that was all it took. He wanted to kill his wife, and he went ahead and did it. I had to go to court the next day. The police had the warrant to take me into custody, but I had an attorney who said he would file a motion for the judge to put the case on hold so I could get some sleep, go to the hospital and get checked out, and be back in court by tomorrow. There was a man in the courtroom. He was the prosecutor. The guy on his side. The thing that's going to happen if you let me go, the things I'm going to say, are gonna make them look bad. It's not gonna get any better. It isn't going to get any worse. They're gonna have to charge me with murder, the same way they charged him. Because when he died, they were able to say he shot me in self-defense, as opposed to the way they had charged him with murder. It wasn't a close call; he did it before my eyes. The court date was Monday. The judge set my bail at $200,000 and put it on hold. I asked him if I could come back and testify at his trial. He said he didn't have time for that. He didn't want me there. They hadn't even charged him yet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd never heard of this one until I read this review, but that's because it's not that good.  It's a really cheesy movie.    No big surprises there.  There are some good jokes, but none of them are great.  That's mostly because they are in bad taste, but also because this film is just too long to be enjoyable.  But what it is a really bad, stupid movie that makes it impossible to rate it as a masterpiece.  The story is pretty predictable, but is at least interesting.  It follows the adventures of two guys who go to Japan to visit a girl's house on a dare.  After a lot of running around, they end up in a city called Gure Gure Mountain where they try to find her but end up having a little...fun.  One thing that bothered me is that it doesn't go all the way to the real world.  This movie has a lot more to say in the first half of the film.  I wish the movie were longer, but it is still a pretty silly movie, so you can at least laugh at the stupid people in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Great Gatsby" is the story of Daisy and Nick, both lovers of the great American novel "The GreatGatsby". While Nick is a lawyer, Daisy is a former journalist who is now a journalist. Both of them decide to go out and get drunk together and have a night of passion, only to have Nick find out about her affair with the rich but very mysterious Jay Gatsbys, and the fact that she lives in the same town. The novel itself has a strong female protagonist and is a romantic novel. While it's a book that deals with some adult situations, it has a sense of innocence about it. While I had some issues with the book, I thought that it was great. If you love American literature and love drinking, then you will love this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ If this movie is for you, do it for your wife, your son, your mother or your husband. I saw it with a wife in the early evening, who was crying because of the movie. She was a very smart woman, and we both thought that a lot of the things happening in this movie made perfect sense. When I came home, she got her husband to watch it, and he was shocked. He said, "It doesn't make any sense at all." And it is not easy for her to understand the kind of relationships that are required for the marriage. So, we recommend this movie for people who are trying to do the best for their marriage. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how marriage works. And of course, it will be fun for people to go to the movie for the first time. _______________ 1. A lot of people were worried that the movie would show the sexual acts without any of the other aspects of the relationship.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** THE GUILTY (2014) - A "dark" fantasy drama about a young man who can't seem to find a girlfriend. He and his best friend go to a party and come across a beautiful young girl who tells him she was saved by a mysterious being. He asks her to take off her clothes, but the girl says she only wants to talk and that she's a virgin. He goes home and says no, but then gets his sister, his mom and his friends to go too. The story is somewhat predictable, and as the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly frustrating that the main guy who doesn't want to have sex is trying to find out what he is. While I appreciate that this is an R-rated movie and it's about "dark", I felt that there was a lot more to this movie than was shown in the beginning. Also, I was disappointed to see the ending left hanging. Overall: ************ THE GUILLY is a "dark fantasy" that is set in a universe where magic exists and the "dark side" has its own army. It has a good beginning, but after the first few minutes, it goes down hill as the main character doesn't get to have an adventure that he wants. But when the sex scenes come, it's one of the most intense scenes in this movie I have ever seen. This movie was enjoyable, but I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I guess I have high expectations for this type of movie, but when the movie tries to be so serious about it, I found it to be a bit childish. It still deserves a watch because it's a fun and cool movie with an intriguing story.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, It is a brilliant and a thrilling film, a film of a kind that has never been made before and is never likely to be made again. What made this movie even more brilliant was the fact that it had a script which was a masterpiece. You can feel the whole movie is built on a premise that is so original, that even today, I do not think there is a film like this that is being made today. The whole film is built around a love story which goes from the simple love between two people to the relationship between the father and the son. I think the script was so well written that we are in no way forced to follow this love story. We have seen so many stories and love stories in the past that it feels like we have been hearing the same song and dance forever, but this film is a different kind of movie, and if you do not understand what makes it different then it will feel like you did not take the time to see it. The music in this film, with the haunting and the uplifting song, gives us the right mood of the story and the way the music and words work together, make the whole film a very special one. The sound design and cinematography were so well done and the costumes and costumes were also very well designed. I cannot even express the awesomeness of the characters which were so beautiful and realistic. I was very much in love with the entire movie from the very beginning to the end and was very impressed with the whole process which was amazing. The movie ends on a very uplifting note and is a wonderful film that you should definitely go and watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Best of the '80s, by far. I am absolutely convinced this movie is THE BEST of that decade, and it is the one to own. I've watched this movie twice now, and I am more than pleased with every second I've seen of it. I can see why it has been called "the ultimate action movie" and "the quintessential action movie of the 1980s." That's all good and well, but what I really care about here is the acting, and the cast is just incredible. Yes, it is kind of a cliché to call a cast all actors, but these are some of the best in the business, so it is worth saying that. So many great performances in this movie! I can't really tell you how awesome John McTiernan was. His first on screen movie is really good, but this movie just nails it, and does it in a way that makes it even better. I loved when he says, "I don't give a damn for the press" (which is a pretty good "I didn't want to write this"), and it also makes him sound like he has no idea what he's talking about, and like he's an idiot. He's not an idiot, he's a genius, and if he was just a bit more self aware and a little less arrogant, he could have had a great career. But the thing that makes this movie so great, is that it is really a comedy. It has that sort of goofy feel, but it's still serious, and really fun, and funny at the same time. And the special effects are just so amazing. It's amazing, in fact, how perfect they are, and they work with the comedy wonderfully. It is, however, a little too long, which is why I would recommend a rental of it before watching it for the first time, because I believe you will only want to watch it a third of the way through, if at all. I have only seen this movie once in its entirety, but I felt as though I got the feeling that I had seen it before, but in the right way. I mean, it's basically an X-Men movie, but with more humor, and less violence. I feel like I've said that about nearly every good X-men movie in recent memory, and to see it done in this way, was just really fun and cool, and made me feel like the best, or at least

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. I'm very much interested in exploring new territory (see my reviews of the original Star Wars Trilogy and The Empire Strikes Back). In this respect, The Empire has many of the attributes that I look for in a Star Wars film. If you've seen both the prequels, this is not a film for you - but if you're a Star Destroyer-worshipping fan, this could prove to be a good starting point. I can't imagine any other Star Destroyer episode being as good as this one. The acting is really great, with very strong supporting roles for all. A big compliment here is the cinematography, which captures a lot of the atmosphere. The only real problem I see with the story is that it's very simple. It's not quite the complex sci-fi we know and love. However, I find that when a film has a simple plot, it is always better than something that is very complicated. And in this case, I think that's exactly what this film is. With the original movie being a complicated sci-fier, I found The Empire more satisfying. That said, I wouldn't say that this is really a bad movie. It would be too easy to see this as simply another Star Destroyer movie, and I don't think it's quite as good an entry into the Star Destroyer universe as the others. The Empire is a great movie, with one of the best acting performances from the original actors. I wouldn  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Mummy Returns' has everything we want from a reboot: action, great characters and an epic climax.  There were plenty of questions left unanswered, including the question of whether the Mummy is now evil or not, and how his old nemesis, Dracula, could be behind it all.  While we're not fans of a lot of the recent cinematic versions of the character (there are a lot that are pretty bad), the new film does a great job of staying faithful to the source material, and that's a good thing.   The Mummify-Taker:   This is the first of a two part analysis, so please do not read it in one sitting!   Part II:  Rapture (1981)   The Mummy (1992)     Here we go:  A long-haired, bearded man is shown to be an ex-convict, with a penchant for picking up women at bars.  Then we're shown a group of other characters including the title character, who is played by actor Nick Nolte.  They are talking in front of a statue of Queen Elizabeth I when they are attacked by the evil-looking Mummy.  It's a little over a minute of screen time in the film.  Now we know how the story of the Mummified Man would end, but we can also make a few assumptions about the final scenes, and I'll be doing that.  This would seem to be the final confrontation between the two (we've already seen their showdown in the opening credits of 'The Mummies').  The Mummification process involves the body being removed from its clothes and tied to a stake, then a stake is passed through the corpse, causing a chemical reaction which creates a mummy.  The mummy is then given to a priestess, and given a new name, "Glamour".  If you haven't read the original story by Richard Matheson, there is a section of it that discusses what he calls the "mystery".  There are a number of reasons why I think he might not have been so sure of the story's truth, but I'll get to those later in the analysis.  After the priestess makes the mummy, it gets stuck to the stake, and it becomes a walking, talking walking dead.  So, basically, it's the Mummies' story. The first thing you see when you
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can always count on a good time when you see an old movie like this.  The movie itself was not bad at all but the story line was kind of boring.  I didn't have a good laugh out of this movie.  The character of Billy who has been going to the graveyard almost every day has always been a little creepy but this time he was really creepy.  He just kept on trying to get in through the hole that the grave was in.  It really made me feel like he was trying to make some type of weird love to his dead girlfriend.  Not my cup of tea but I enjoyed the whole movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Thing with Two Heads (1984) was a fantastic little film, set in the not so distant future and starring John Carpenter.  Its cast is a veritable Who's Who of sci-fi films with Carpenter starring as the lead, a small town cop who gets involved in an alien-invasion and ends up having to team up with an even bigger alien to combat the forces of the evil Thing.  The Thing With Two Heads John Carpenter as the Thing, who has two heads and a tongue Carpenter plays the part well and we follow his career from his first professional acting job in New York and his later roles on TV and in films.  He played his part with a great amount of energy and menace.    The Thing was the sequel to The Thing (1982) which was made before The Thing With A Billion Pounds  (1982) and is also quite good.  There are several memorable scenes from that film that would work well in The Thing with a Bead, though the script by J. Michael Straczynski was not very good. There was not too much to do with The Thing in terms of story, though there was one very interesting idea which Straczysnki would follow with his The Fog (1985).   It was one of the many stories on the cover of this special edition of The Thing From Another World, released in 1997, released by a small independent studio called The Films of Frank O'Connor. The film was based on a story by John Schoenherr and was also directed by Carpenter, with a script by Carpenter. Carmine Incendo as a young soldier Cameos and guest star appearances are abundant in this film, including John Turturro playing his character in the final scenes.  The film was actually filmed for approximately $3.2 million, which was a small budget compared to the much bigger budgets of The Fog and The Thing and The Fog 2.  It was also made using an early version of the same stock footage which is used on the box set The Thing.  Although there was not much action on screen, the film still manages to show the horror of being on the alien home planet, which is shown by an amazing amount of imagery and footage.  This is a classic Carpenter film and should be seen in theaters, though it is not quite as good as the two earlier films in the series.  Also,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I really liked the first movie. It was a very cool sci-fi movie about a bunch of guys that find a rare gem of a starship, and one of them, an old alien woman, helps them get it back to Earth. Then there's a buncha aliens, and they come and steal it back, but they have to do it in order. It's really a cool idea, but the movie never really builds anything that would be worth mentioning. The next movie is much better, it has some great action scenes, and it's got a buncho cool stuff in it. But there's one problem with that movie: it's the same old story. It just moves around. There are some good things in there too. It gets a little darker at the end, and the plot is really interesting. I just thought it was a good thing to watch, but there are a few flaws. It wasn't very good. I would have rated it more if it weren't about a spaceship. I guess the best thing I can say about it is that it was an idea, and if you're a fan of this kind of sci- fi, I'd give it a try.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ "The Man Who Knew Infinity" is a film from the 1950s that has no hope of ever being revived. It is a strange film in that its whole plot is based around the concept that in the future a scientist has discovered a way to contact aliens. The scientist goes out to the place where he thought he found them and is able to communicate with them. As a result he begins to grow extremely tall and is soon able to talk with them and to convince them to be his friends. One of the most bizarre things in the film is that the aliens come to Earth to see if it could be their new planet, and to see what sort of life they would find here. The film is also weird in that it is about a man (Tom Cruise) who is very tall and very short at the same time. He spends his time trying to be a "normal" human and to stay away from the aliens who are much taller than him. After several weeks in the alien land of New Zealand the aliens become very angry with him for making them their enemies. They decide that they will destroy him so they take him to the top of Mount Everest and drop him in the middle of a volcano where he dies. There they have their revenge and take the money they stole from him. The ending of the film leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of the action in the end seems to be cut together from different clips which makes things more confusing. What really makes the film bizarre is that it seems to take place in two time periods. At the start of the movie it seems that the movie is set in the 1950's, but at the end the movie seems to have taken place in the 2070's. There is also a bizarre scene in which Tom Cruise is trying to talk to the aliens using a radio that is as thick as a brick. As you can imagine this is one of the things that you have to watch for. It does make for a bizarre film but if it is just that the film has a very odd story then it makes up for a lot of things that the rest of the plot lacks.

The movie looks good but it's not a huge budgeted film. The only time I really felt the budget was when the car that was going through a fence on the train tracks was so fast that I thought they were taking the train to catch it but it was actually the cameraman driving the train through the fence. It's pretty bad, pretty uneventful and very bland but I wouldn't say it's bad it's just bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Greed is Good" is a movie that is more about greed in general than it is about anything in particular.  That is to say, while it's a good flick, it's not exactly the sort of movie that you would watch over and over and laugh at its absurdist comedy.    And while it can be fun to see a story about greed unfold, it will inevitably come to a point where the audience is ready to stop laughing.   This may be an effect of the fact that the movie is written and directed by Michael Mann, who is one of the most prolific and well-respected horror directors in recent years, but the ending does sort of make you question whether or not the movie was ever intended to be funny.  "Gruesome Business" is just the sort (pun intended) of film that makes a good night of the town, but only if you're at least 18 years of age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like to watch movies with friends that I have not seen before and it has been a long time since I was a child when my parents made me watch this.  Now, we all know this is a horror movie, so to each their own, but the gore that we see in this is pretty well done.  "We can kill one another" This is a good looking film, which has a great cast.   The movie follows a group of friends that go to a small farm that has a haunted house.  There are a number of gory scenes here that are well done, and the movie has a good plot.  The story is set up quite well as the family of two young girls are forced to hide the body of a boy who was killed in a farm accident.  While on the road they pick up two hitchhikers that they believe are the ghost's, but soon learn that the two hitch hikers aren't the ghost.    Soon after that we meet the mother of one of the girls and her father who are trying to hide their son's body.  And, of course, the ghost is not done with the two girls, but they aren't doing much better.  This is a fairly straight forward horror movie that is pretty good.  So, go and see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this one and really have no reason to, since I haven't even seen the movie.  But if you do, and you're a fan of David Lynch and Twin Peaks (which I am), then this is for you.  On a side note, I'm glad there's a new David Lynch movie in theaters.  In an interview, Lynch has stated that he wanted to work with a very young child actor (presumably James Gordon) but was passed over for a 15 year old, who he thinks is perfect for the role.    The new movie is called Inland Empire, and if you've seen the series, then you already know about it.  Twin Peaks is one of Lynch's most beloved movies, and it's been over 30 years since the original TV series.  While the plot doesn't change much, the setting of the movie remains the same: the sleepy town of Twin Peaks.  Here's the synopsis from IMDb: For decades, the secret town of Black Lodge has been a place of fascination and terror, drawing souls to its doors for its many terrors.  However, the sinister nature of Black Lodges and the souls that find their way there have never been more dangerous, as two supernatural forces converge on the town – a shadowy figure from the past and the modern day daughter of Laura Palmer – who will stop at nothing to end Laura's life and claim the town's soul. The pair have come together, but will their deadly collision cause a bloody apocalypse that could destroy the town forever?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was amazing. It has a unique, quirky, well-acted ensemble of characters and a beautiful story that's very good at making you feel good and happy to be a part of a family. The plot is simple - a boy discovers his parents are ghosts.  He uses his mother's ghost powers to bring them back to life and bring up his sister. There is a lot of action and very good characters. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, ghosts, and good movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The only thing that could have made this even better is if we could have had the whole crew in there, because it's very well done. If I have a gripe with the movie it's that the ending isn't so good."  That's just the kind of snooty shit that comes out of a white person's mouth.  They were right, because there were no white people in that movie.  The white people were there:  "We were just standing at the back of the crowd, but I think we made a big impression on some of the people there. When the credits started rolling, one of the big white guys started running down the line and gave some kids all of this attention, and I think that's where they ended up making the big impression. I mean, it was so cool to watch them go off. " -  @CurtisBortman  4:10 "If you want to see one of my favorite films from a year or two ago, I would definitely recommend the classic 'Funny People.'  The story's simple, but it is told in such a way that really gives it a sense of humor.  It's also got some really great acting and some of my favorites of the year." - @mattjamesdickson  6:36 "If I had to choose just one of 2015, it would be 'The Death Of Stalin.' It was so much fun.   There's something really satisfying about watching a film about the rise of Stalin, and how he really changed and how much he was loved by so many people.  " - R.L. Stine  7:16 "My favorite movie this year has to be 'Get Out.'    It was great.  In fact, I went back to see it this weekend.  I didn't like it, and it's a really good film, but the moment where the main character decides to run from the FBI is what gets me.  And so that moment, I just remember being terrified by it, but really feeling it, because I know it's going to be a really scary movie at the end." - @Kendra_Meyer 10:48 "I liked 'The Killing Of A Sacred Deer.'  For me, this is a movie about human empathy and human connection and people coming together to make the world a better place."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I was hoping to watch this because it is a good, albeit dated film, about a young, attractive, handsome, and well-endowed detective in the 1940's who has an affair with the wife of the head of a powerful mob-connected organization, only to be murdered the next day. While the story is compelling, the acting and pacing could be improved. The plot makes for some very interesting drama and as the story drags on, the film loses its steam, with the tension only growing as the characters realize the horrible truth about their fate, and they try to move on in their lives. The film begins with the main character, the Detective Jack Ryan, in his office, writing a letter to the boss of the mob boss, who in turn is writing the letter to his wife, who's in the hospital with a broken leg. Jack's letter to "The Boss" is a typical letter from a young man to an old, married woman, and as Jack attempts to explain himself to the lady, we see the detective grow more and more frustrated, until his frustration leads to violence on the crime scene. While Ryan's actions are the catalyst for the story, I found that the supporting characters seemed to have little to no screen time or presence, while the mob bosses character never really comes alive, although I did enjoy the way he was portrayed. It is difficult to believe this was made in the 40's, because the acting could not have been better, and the script is well-written and easy to follow. While some scenes are not as compelling as others, the movie is worth seeing for the compelling story, especially if you are a fan of crime films of the 1930's and 1940's.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from A little too close to reality I thought this movie was a great deal of fun, but it does have an element that seems too close for comfort. The main character and wife are a couple and both are very attractive women. It seems that there is something going on between these two women, I didn't see any evidence for that. As the story progresses the plot seems to be developing nicely, the main villain is introduced, but doesn't really do much to threaten the characters. There are some pretty good performances here, however I felt that they were very over the top. The music and sound effects were also very over-the-top. I was in my car and my wife looked out the window at the action
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________, I love it. This movie makes me laugh my ass off. It was very funny. Very funny. I thought it was a good comedy. I like it because of how fast it goes. It's not like other comedy's where they're making a joke and then the camera stops. This one went off the rails very fast and was fast paced. You would know something was off if the camera didn't go off. You see what happens and they go over this stuff. This goes on and on and they're not even done. This was very much like a comedy of errors. It didn't work. There was a scene where they were in the bathroom and all these crazy people were doing their things and you had to look away because it's too much. I loved that they had a lot of fun with the stupid stuff and it makes you laugh a lot. I know a lot people hated this movie, but it had a great cast and I thought they all had good chemistry. It took me a while to understand how this movie got made. I think it was like a Hollywood movie but with a very low budget. It did well for what it was but I think people are just mad that they got burned. They were mad that the guy won't admit that he lied.  I liked it when they did the scene when they went into the hotel room. That was funny. It really was. It made it funnier. But the problem with that movie was that it's very low in budget. They only had the one guy. There is no room to do many things because they had to keep the cost down. If they had had more people they could have done many more things. I've read some reviews that say it was too long and it's not. I don't think they're even done yet. This is the one they can't get out of the theater. I liked the ending where it said, "Whoa, there's a problem." It was a big mistake to do the movie that way. I wanted the ending to go, "Oh boy, we just came from the airport." They never get out to the airport. I did a good job in the end of making that clear. I'd like to see it again but I don  like to see more. That's the thing I thought was funny about it. It could be one of the greatest movies ever made if it had more money. It would be a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   A great little thriller.   You could put this one in with the classics, but I don't think it belongs in the same group with:   (1) Casablanca (1942) - a beautiful, simple story, but it was a lot harder to do in 1941.  (2) Rebecca (1941) - I've already watched this and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film with a bit more substance.  to give it a bit of a run for it's money.   for those who haven't seen Rebecca yet, watch it if you haven't yet.   The setting is England. A man (played by Humphrey Bogart) who has been missing for 2 days starts appearing again. He brings some gifts for a couple who don't want anything. He has become a legend in England and is the subject of a book. The book is published in the USA and has a great plot. He's brought back to the English town he was kidnapped in. It's a small, sleepy village. He starts being recognized by the local kids. He runs into the local shopkeeper. The shopkeeper is a woman. She runs the shop. She's married. Her husband is an American who is also an author. They run their shop with their two kids, and the kids are the focus of the film. The two kids are played by Humphreys (who is also the owner) and John Barrymore. I think both were great. They are both actors I like. I'm not sure if Humphrey really knows John Barrymeade (I think he didn't) because the two are kind of interchangeable. The only thing that makes them different is their accents and it's not a huge deal. At the beginning, they make a deal with a local man who owns a bar. The man is played by Robert Mitchum. He is known for playing very strong and bad guys, and I thought he did a great job. He doesn't seem like a bad guy but the movie takes place over the course of one day and he has very few lines, but they are important. He gives the main character a deal to sell him a box of cigars. He wants to give the box to the local police and he won't touch it. The police try to break into his store. He tells them to leave. The policeman is played the great James Mason. The police go

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have been watching this movie for weeks now. I am amazed how it kept me laughing and how it was a movie I could not wait to watch again. So here we go, we meet Sam Carter and his two friends, he goes with them to see the town they will be staying in (as most of their friends are away for some reason). Sam is a young man who likes to do things on his own, but when he meets Sam's old friend Kevin (played by a wonderful Gary Busey), he begins to realize that they might have more in common than he thought. The story takes place in New York City and involves lots of cool characters who get to see everything that New York has to offer: the Empire State Building, the Empire Hotel, the Museum of Modern Art and the Statue of Liberty. It also contains a few funny parts, so this movie is not really just a comedy but also a romance.  I loved the scenes with Sam's girlfriend Mary (played as if by Jane Fonda) and their relationship. It just kept getting better and better with each and every episode. I also loved the relationship between Sam and Kevin, they are both intelligent and fun to be around. It is obvious that Sam's parents are not thrilled with Sam and his friends. They constantly try to find ways to stop Sam's freedom to do what he likes, but we all know that the best things in life are free.   I was completely captivated in this movie, I will definitely watch it over and over again, this movie could be an adult's favorite.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pixar's Up: Good, Not Great - A Pixar Movie - Movieguide.org I was at the film in a theater, about two blocks from the cinema, when I realized the film is about as perfect of a movie as we can hope for.  It's got all the heart we need from Pixar.  I am a huge fan of all of their movies (I would like to think that my love is only the result of my parents paying close attention to them).  The characters, their worlds, and their adventures are just so well done.  All of the little characters are well played and are very likable.  The Pixar style of animation was at its best on this one, it was fluid and smooth.  And there was plenty of that, with lots of animation in action scenes.  This is a nice blend of a film about friendship and a film of the environment of a city. The cast is strong.  Even though this is a movie about a bunch of kids, you still feel like you know them.  Not that the story is too complex or that they have a lot going on, just that you know who they are and what they are doing.  There is the usual cast of good looking young boys and girls, some of whom make excellent points about who they want to be when they grow up, and you can feel them trying to figure things out as the story unfolds.  Plus the voice actors (who have done several movies together) do great in their roles and really shine. And as a movie, it is just fun.  It has a good story, lots of humor and a good dose of action, and even though it is not the best Pixar movie, that doesn't mean it is bad.  Like most Pixar films, it just has its moments, and this one was no exception.  If you are looking for a good summer action film, then I think this is pretty great.  One of the greatest things about this movie is that it is a film that can take a little bit of time to get you into it.  You do get to see some more of the background of the characters as they grow, but it is fun seeing the characters in action as they do what they do in the film, because you do really get to know them and they all have their own personality.  Also, because of the time frame in which it is set, it doesn't feel like it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (It's a joke.) ______________ The film is set in a "cave where the humans are extinct and the monster is a mutant bear". The movie starts with a prologue about "a long-dead man and his son" who have a cave in the middle of nowhere where they are "dormant, looking like the skeletons they once were". They go to the cave to get some supplies, which are found out by some monster. The man gets kidnapped by the monster and a cave wall collapses causing the monster to emerge from the hole he came out of. They escape, but when they are about to leave the place is attacked by the creature. They fight back and the man is killed and the cave becomes overrun by the beast. The group is split into two groups, one led by the man and the other by a woman who has a special magic wand. The two groups are to fight against the monster. After a while the group that's led by a boy and a girl are the last. They manage to kill the monster by breaking through its barrier. It gets back up and kills the girl and the boy. The girl and her father run away and get on a train. They are rescued by a human woman who runs off with the boy, and they run to New York. The boy gets a job at the office of a man named Paul Raskolnikov, a character played by the legendary Peter Sellers. He works with the mysterious Dr. Wozniak, who is the scientist who developed the virus that caused the extinction of the humans. The characters that I remember are Paul, Dr.Wozniack, Dr Woz, Dr M, and a female scientist named Dr.S. who gets a man who is being held prisoner by Dr.M who he has a son with. In New York, they are captured and sent to Los Angeles to the military base of Dr. M. There, Paul is held captive again, Dr Raskulikov is killed, and Paul and the girl are reunited with the guy who they rescued. ____________________ A sequel, this one called the "Homo Deus" was released in 1979 and was a direct follow up to "The Creature From the Black Lagoon". It was the last film to be made in the Alien franchise. _________ I can't stand horror movies... I usually hate them because of their cliche themes, but this one really made me laugh

It's a good film and it made me want to go out and watch more of the good-looking actors and actresses who star in it. I especially enjoyed the performance of John Travolta who plays the bad-guy character, but he doesn't carry the movie by himself.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The original 'Titanic' had a very high score at Rotten Tomatoes and it was one of my most anticipated films. 'Tron: Legacy' is the sequel to 'Tethered' and I believe that it can satisfy the 'Tropic Thunder' fans, too. 'The Telling' is based on a short story by Joe Haldeman and directed by Alex Proyas, both of whom have an excellent track record. I think that it is the director's job to not just capture a moment but to create the right atmosphere. In my humble opinion, 'The Tell' is very much a work of art. If you are looking for a well-made and enjoyable film, I suggest you give it a shot. It's got action, humor and some real emotional moments. The Telling is a very unique film, you'll get a kick out of it. If the movie does not make you smile, you must be a masochist. _________________________________ I saw 'The Transformers: Age of Extinction' at the cinema on opening day. It is a fun film with some serious scenes. I personally liked the first film much more than the second, but if you've seen the first movie I think you'll like it. __________________________ Have you seen 'The Terminator'?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The following review contains major spoilers about the ending of "Racing Extinction". *********** "Riding Extinction" is a great and thrilling horror/sci-fi film that will surely be noticed by those who are looking for horror/fantasy films that are different from the norm. The story of "The Rising" starts with a man who, after a massive meteorite hits earth, finds himself in a strange world of monsters. This man is a pilot for the spaceship "The Last Hope" who finds himself on a new planet that seems to be inhabited by human survivors of the great disaster that happened on earth some years ago. As the men travel around the planet, they encounter the most dangerous and unpredictable monsters known to man: A giant rat-like monster, a wolf-like beast that can be seen only at night, and a terrifying flying reptile. After a fierce battle against the monsters, the men reach the place where the ship was last seen by a meteorite crashing into the Earth. On the other hand, the monsters are using their powers to find human survivors to use as their slaves, and to make a breeding ground for their very own creatures. Written by Anh Ng

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This is a very good movie. It is not for everyone, it is not a love story or a story about love. But it is a film which you can see from beginning to end and can sit and watch and watch till the end. It has many surprises and is very much a good film which gives us the best of it's genre. The main story line takes us to the jungles of the Philippines and the country of Malaya where we see a young man who has been sent to work on a plantation by his father, an old, but proud plantation owner.  He does not know how to work and is treated poorly, he is not given any food to eat. He is forced to work very hard for very little pay and only has one day off a week.  Soon he realizes how wrong he is to be working in a plantation and he escapes from the plantation with a few fellow inmates.  However when they arrive at a town they discover that there is nothing to do in the town. There are no jobs, no work and no people.  They then see a newspaper in the street, the advertisement for a new film has been written on the back of the newspaper and the advertisement says a young lady will take us to a jungle and bring us to her parents.  What they don't know is that the young woman is actually a young girl from Malaysia.  She is from a poor and isolated village. She is hungry, has no clothes and no idea where she is.  There is also something else that is bothering her. She has had a lot of contact with a man on the plantation and she does not feel the same about him as she feels about her father.  At first it seems the young girl will try to run away but then the girl is caught and taken to her father's home.  The young girl and her father start having a relationship and things really get interesting when she finds out she has a twin sister.  This story really starts to grow and you will find out a lot about the Philippines, the jungle and the people of the country. The story itself is very strong and very well told, it moves you along and you do not want it to end. I think this movie was a great movie for everyone who loves a good mystery and love to watch the world of the unknown, this film does all that well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I don't know why this is rated PG-13, but it really isn't that bad. The character relationships are interesting, the plot is interesting, and the special effects are great. I know this has a lot of negative reviews, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. The bad reviews are mostly about the character relationships. The movie isn't just about a guy who can't stop hurting girls. The main character, John Henry, is really a tragic hero. He's a super man, but he's damaged in a bad way. He doesn't know what love is, he can't find his place in society, and his relationship with his sister is really tragic. He has to deal with his issues, but as soon as he tries to be a superhero, he becomes a superhero. The problems he faces with his power are a lot more real in this movie than in most superhero movies. The special effects in this are also amazing. There's no doubt that when you're 12 you can see the CGI in this. The effects, especially the effects in the shower scene, are really impressive. I like that the movie doesn't have the traditional ending of a movie that takes place in a movie theater. This movie is really different, and I can see it being a lot like the comics. It's sad, really sad, and it really brings a sense of sadness to the audience. It doesn't really try to be funny, but the humor is really good. The cast is really great, and they all seem to have fun with their roles. If you like the comic book movies, you'll love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we left off, the two of them had been kidnapped by three different gunmen who would shoot them and take their money. The money had gone to the cartel. What had they done to be shot down? We had not seen it all happen, and we wanted to know what they were going to do next. The story had a good mystery element to it, but the action sequences were quite tedious. Then we come to the final act, and the final scene is so beautifully done. After a long shootout, they are all dead, but you can't help but feel sorry for the two guys. They did not live to tell their story. They are buried in the rubble of a building, and it's hard to picture the life that they led after they were shot down. And in an instant the final scenes are put to bed. There are some moments that I had not expected from the film, but it all made sense later in the story. It made the film a great ending to what was otherwise a fairly boring movie.  "Dogs of War"   (2013) "I saw it in the theaters. I enjoyed the movie. It was a good experience." -Kris Kringle The film tells the story of two Vietnam veterans in the 70's who go to Vietnam, and see the atrocities that have occurred there. This film had a few flaws, but in my opinion it did a great job at telling this story. One of the characters, Sgt. George (Holt McCallany) is in the army for a long time, and he has a few flashbacks to the events in Vietnam. George also sees the horrors that these soldiers have to live with, and when he is on a run to a safe place, he makes an unexpected discovery: a woman (Christina Ricci) who is dying from the cancer she was going to receive. George realizes that this woman is also a veteran of the Vietnam War, and that she died for no good reason. The two soldiers are then forced to work together to find the killer, as he had killed the woman's parents. There is a beautiful scene when George and the other soldier, Bill (Anthony Lemke) are driving to the same safe house and go to check it out. There they find the woman in her final moments. It is a very moving scene. In the film's final moments, we also hear a lot of music, and after the credits, you get a little
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1958) - a classic American western starring Clint Eastwood, Roy Rogers and James Stewart. This film is a solid entry point into the genre and an excellent piece of work. Stewart plays a rascally cowpoke who becomes a sheriff and his posse of cowpokes have to do some good old fashioned outlawing on their way to the desert. Stewart is brilliant as the sheriff who doesn't let his emotions or his temper get in the way of his job. This is also the first western to feature an African-American (played by John Cleese), who helps the sheriff with some of his more sensitive and emotional moments.  This film is excellent as it takes the genre into a whole new direction.  A more recent entry into the western genre is the recent Dirty Harry (2014)  Gone are the days of "westerns" as the genre is now referred to as "western crime drama". The film in question is the fifth in the  True Grit series.  The movie tells the story of John Ruth (played with a surprising amount of gravitas by Daniel Craig) and his friendship with Brent and Nick (Chris Pine and Jack Huston) who, although they are cowboys are more than willing to get in trouble and fight for justice when necessary. Craig is good in this film as he shows a certain amount of vulnerability when dealing with his friends. The other major aspect of this movie is the lead up to the shoot that takes place in a small Texas town. This movie is excellent because there is not really a "big bad" that would drive people away from the movie but rather an individual or group of individuals that are more concerned with the town's reputation. I was pleased with the amount of character development in this movie as it shows the growth of each character's relationship with one another. There is also great chemistry between all of the actors, which is evident in the dialogue and character development. There were some interesting character moments where one character does something that another character finds to be strange. This kind of interplay works well because it gives us more insight into their personalities. There are two interesting scenes that are great: One in which we see one of the protagonists, Mike (Chris Pratt) at the bar in the town of Eastland (with a great cast of characters including Jesse Plemons, Ben Foster, John Leguizamo and John Cleaveland).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I will always remember the moment that I sat down and watched The Devil Wears Prada, the first time I saw it at the cinema. I'd seen the original three Hellboy films and had seen most of the Hellboy animated films, but had never heard anything about this one. My friend had heard of it, so I asked him if he thought this film was any good. He thought it was good, but he wasn't sure that it was a "classic". After I saw the film a second time, he had more reason to think that it could be a classic, as well as the fact that he was very impressed by the animation and the music, so much that he thought the film had a lot of potential. When I finally saw the final cut of The Devil's Advocate, I was very much surprised to find that the movie was actually, despite what I thought, a classic. I can't really put it into words to convey how good it is, but I'll try. The film opens with two very likable, young teenagers. Peter (Mike Colter) and Mikey (James Badge Dale) are friends and are going to the same high school. As the two are walking home, they get involved in a car accident, which is a real surprise to both of them. As they are sitting on the curb, Mikey is knocked unconscious, which causes Peter to think it was his fault. He is so devastated by what happened that he decides he will never drive again. It's almost like he forgot all about the accident, and this is really disappointing to both Peter and Mike. After the accident occurs, Peter gets back in his car, and he thinks that it will be okay, but a few days later, Peter's mom, who doesn't want her son to go to the hospital, tells him about his accident. Because of this, Peter can't drive and decides to go home. When he gets home, he is immediately greeted by his girlfriend Lisa (Melissa Rauch), who is in town for a visit, and she gives him a letter, which she is giving to her uncle. This letter tells Peter that Mikey will be going to college and that he will have to help Mikey out. He asks Mikey if he has any questions, but Mikey doesn't have any, so Peter does. Peter asks Mike if he wants to go back to college or not, but as Mikey's mother is in the house

They showed it in my class on a Sunday, so I watched it on a Monday morning. It's one of my favorite films, and I loved how the boys lived in a basement (at least I think they did). This is an awesome movie, and if you are a fan of the blues, you have to see it. It also has some great singing.

I enjoyed the story very much, and I enjoyed how it was all handled with a lot of humor and some great characters. I had high hopes for this film to get a good response, as I had enjoyed the Star Wars film, and had hoped that the Trek universe would be better. It definitely wasn't a bad film, it was just not what I hoped it to be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that is a good time. It is fun, exciting, and a good looking film. It's one of the better animated films I have seen in the last couple of years. It has a great story that is more of a mystery and not too hard on the ears. It also has a lot of humour in the film and I laughed out loud several times. The film is well done, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. I suggest watching this film if you are a fan of animation and are looking for something different. I gave it a 4/5 and would recommend to people who like animation that likes a good story and laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has an ending that is completely unexpected. It could have easily ended with the main characters escaping, but instead they stay to defeat the evil witch (who we never see), only for it to reveal that she's just a woman! After that, all we see are the characters playing out their roles, and the movie ends with the evil witches in handcuffs, still evil (even though the movie doesn't show anything that would make you believe that's actually what happened), but they're finally imprisoned by the police! I'd rather have had a happier ending, but I guess this movie has a happy ending.  There's no doubt that this movie is still good. I'm not a witch, and I certainly can't do magic, but this movie shows how well this kind of story can be told, and how much people will want to see a movie like this.  How about you, has anyone seen this movie?   If you liked this review, check out my review of the second movie: My Bloody Valentine (2009)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ If you are not a fan of comedies about high school girls (or if you were not amused by "Logan Lucky" or by "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" or any of the other teen comedies, you might be surprised to find that most of my movies are comedies and not dramas. This is because in my opinion, comedies are the funniest movies to make because they have a lot of fun with a lot silly situations. You know that scene in "Blazing Saddles" where the townspeople are waiting for the train and they are all laughing at a horse getting thrown off a cliff? Well this is exactly how I would have written this movie. As with "Lucky Luke", the characters would have been written very seriously and then everything would have just exploded. _________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The most interesting thing about The Raid (2014) is how well it combines action and drama. When we meet the film's main character, the villain, he is in jail. But, after a chance meeting, the two become allies against a powerful crime lord. This is where The Raid begins. The Raid is a movie about a man in a prison who is a little crazy and a little selfish. In one scene, his prison guards are ordered to execute a man because they are sick of him. The man does not know any better, and decides to use the opportunity to escape. The scene is reminiscent of a scene in the Bourne series. One of the first things I noticed about The Good: The Good is a very different movie than its predecessors. I was surprised that a sequel to the original The Raid film was not made, even though the film is a remake of the Japanese original. The Good was not a "mature" film, but rather an action-packed film. The movie does not take itself too seriously, and takes an unconventional approach with the use of guns. The action scenes were fun to watch and well choreographed. The use of the guns in the Good is not what I expected from a remake. The film does take a lot of creative liberties, and some of these creative liberties include the use the Chinese-made AK47, which is known for its accuracy and accuracy. The main character's signature weapon of choice is a samurai sword (which is not a real sword). As a viewer, I am a big fan of the samurai and am not surprised that he carries a sword. The first few action scenes in the movie are not spectacular. There are a lot that I could criticize and I will point them out. The gun battle, however, is exciting and the gunplay was quite well choregraphed. There is also the scene in which a guy named Shonosuke (played by Masaya Matsukawa) is a hostage being held by a criminal. He is captured by two thugs. The thugs are trying to take him hostage because they believe Shonoko will help them with their extortion efforts. In the gun battle which follows, the bad guys take care to use maximum firepower. The bad guys are also shown to be very efficient with their weaponry and, especially, with their knives. The third main character in the film, who is known as "The Boss", is the one who actually orchestrates the whole raid, which takes

The cast was amazing. I really liked Jennifer Connelly and had so much fun. I also really liked the scene with the girls. The movie wasn't really for the younger audience so if you are over the age of 18 then this won't be for you. If you are under 18 please be careful. The plot is a lot more serious than what we normally expect from the girls but that's just the way the story was told. It is a very good movie and a fun watch at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** A great old-school, pulp adventure film from 1966. The film is set in the small Louisiana town of Dixieland, and features a group of men who must battle a cult known as The Cult of the Unholy Three, and their leader, Father Jekyll (John Huston). The film focuses mostly on Jekyl, but there's a lot of action, as the heroes use the local sheriff (Cliff Robertson) to help them. The script is pretty good, but the film has some really awful acting, most especially by Humphrey Bogart, who is constantly on screen. It's a shame, because the acting was actually pretty good. The acting is not great, but it was pretty good to begin with, and the film isn't really known for great acting. I just think the dialogue was really bad. There was a lot wrong with the script, but that's why it was written. Overall the film is about 80 minutes long, and it's set in Dixieland. It features the following stars: Humphrey Alec Bogart J.P. McBride Charles Bronson Gene Hackman Henry Fonda Tom Mix Dixielands in the Mist was written by the great James M. Cain (The Big Sleep) and produced by Vincent Mancuso, who later would go on to direct some of the most well-regarded and influential westerns, including The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), Apocalypse Now (1979) and The Godfather (1972). It was also the first film directed by John Huston, who would also direct the next four films on the list (The Searchers (1956), Apocalypse now, True Grit (1970) and Seven (1976)).  This is an easy pick for a "must see".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl on the Train has a lot of good points. Most importantly, its main character has a unique, sympathetic, and relatable plot arc that makes for a good flick. A young, homeless girl is kidnapped and dumped onto a train. The girl is left in the care of a young man with a troubled past, and it takes a lot more than just a nice voiceover to get the audience to care about her. Also, the plot is pretty good. The story unfolds through a series of vignettes, and they get increasingly complex and surreal, especially as the plot progresses. The cinematography and music work really well to set the tone, and the performances are good, too. It's a solid movie, but it doesn't really have the same depth of character or tension as other great movies from the '90s.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** The film is based on a book by Jack London and the film's title is taken from it. Jack London is well known for writing about such matters as prostitution, gambling, and murder. In this movie the title of the book, "The Maltese Falcon", is changed to "The Falcon of the Snake" and the main character is renamed "Gibbs". Although the original novel, "Maltese Falcon" is a short story, the movie's screenplay has been heavily altered to take the novel's plot and plot structure. The film's plot revolves around a gangster named Joe Cobb who is in trouble with the law. A gangster by the name of James "Lucky" Luciano is in debt to Joe Cobb, but Joe doesn't like this, so he turns to James Luciano. Soon the whole crew are in trouble. After a shootout, Lucky Luciano flees into a bar where he meets a young woman named Mary Lee (Natalie Wood). Lucky Luc in this film is the one with the plan. When they meet in the bar, Lucky tells Mary Lee to "have a good time, you know, 'cause we got all the action in town". Soon Lucky Luc joins the gangster gang, and while there they pick up a woman named Jenny (Marion Cotillard). However, the plan doesn't work out well for Lucky Luc, and he has to flee from the cops. It's here that the film diverges from the original story. The original story has a love triangle between the three main characters. In the film, this romance is not there. Also, in the original plot, Joe Cobb has to pay his debt to the man who killed him, so in this movie, he does not have to. Also there is no love triangle and no gun fighting. As for the shooting, the action sequences are really quite good. The shooting sequences are very smooth, and there are some shots of bullets hitting the ground or walls. The gun battles are not too intense, and the action is more about character interactions and the environment rather than the gun fights. There is an interesting point about the gun fighting: When the police arrive, the gun fight is interrupted and everyone runs away. When the cops go back in and shoot Mary Lee in the head, the group takes off. The police have to chase them down and eventually catch them. There are a few other things to like about the film. The music is good and the

As the spirit starts to make people disappear, the group, along with their young friend, are trying to uncover the cause of this and bring it to an end. The film was written and directed by Jean-Baptiste Lucht, who also wrote "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." It was also produced by George S. Patton, and produced by William L.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  I saw the movie once. My friends and I drove up in the morning to watch it on a Monday. We got there around 7 and the theater was absolutely packed, with people sitting on the floor and walking around with large popcorn. When the movie started it was loud but not unbearable, and the actors were all doing their best. In the middle of the movie we heard a woman scream "F*** you!" which was the first I had heard the whole movie and it was the only thing that made me turn around and look at her. It was so clear to me she was not going to be offended. It seems as if this has been a common phrase in cinema since the first movie we saw. But I wasn't offended, and my friends weren't either. The movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed it. The ending was not one I was expecting, and was actually quite surprising. It wasn't even the ending of the film but the end of the scene that played over and over in the movie.  If you've never been to a movie where a woman yells at a man for something like this I'm sorry. You will be surprised how often it happens, and how little respect these women get. You can be sure that if you were a man, you wouldn't have a problem with this. The women you see screaming at other women at the movies are not just being "crazy."  __________________________________________  The main reason for the movie was to prove the lack of respect women have for one another. It also makes an excellent film in and of itself!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   This movie is not just for nerds. The cast and crew are very professional, but it's not an easy movie to get into. For those who have watched movies with a bit of nerd in them, this should not be a surprise. I think this movie is the type of movie you watch for the laugh and for the entertainment. It's really fun and entertaining, but if you want to have a deeper understanding of these two characters, I strongly suggest you watch the first movie, "Rattlesnake". The cast is very good. It is a very funny movie, but also one with some heart. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but I can tell you that you should watch the movies before you watch this one.   I'm not going to say that this is a movie to watch on your birthday, but hey, I was young and lucky enough to get a copy of this movie. I'm really glad I had this. I've never been able to go into a movie theater with a group of friends, so this is the first time I got to go watch a movie with my friends and family. This movie is a bit different from the other movies you've seen. This one is a little more adult, and you definitely won't be missing out on anything. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Book of Eli is a great, smart, poignant and moving love story with a well-paced plot that's worth the price of admission alone.  I loved the way the story unfolded.   The only thing that bugged me about the movie was the acting and directing.  The cast seemed to be in their 20s, with most of the characters having very shallow personalities and it was difficult to understand them.  I was pleasantly surprised by the acting.  They did a great job with their acting and they had the talent and potential to be much better at it.  Some of the actors did a good job and others like the lead, Zach Gilford were so bad that they made me wish they'd been cast in the first place.  It made the movie less interesting and the acting seemed a little forced and unnatural to me.  Overall the acting was good and I really liked it. I was able to identify with a few of the main characters.  Although they didn't have the depth of the real relationship between these characters it was still enjoyable.  What I would like to know is what the author intended by the way this movie was edited.  To me it seemed a bit rushed, a few scenes were cut and the movie just seemed to run a little long.  While some of the scenes were fun and interesting I also think the ending was somewhat rushed.  I know that was intended to be a one-shot but there should have been a little more time given to the characters and their growth.  A few days ago I read a post about the end of this movie and I'm still confused by it. It seemed pretty clear to me that it ended with a cliffhanger and the writer was clearly trying to end the movie as quickly as possible.  If I'm not mistaken that ending is in the third book of the trilogy so it could've been avoided.  In addition, there was also some sort of dream sequence in which the main character went to the past.  Maybe that was to make us believe he went back in time to help with his own marriage?  The ending seemed forced and abrupt and didn't seem to work as well as the other endings from the movies.  So while it wasn't a perfect movie it was a great one and it's worth a watch for those who love a good love story.  Thanks for reading! My thoughts:  The Book of Eni's final words to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Christmas Tale  is an excellent Christmas story. The only problem is that the story is almost completely pointless because it follows an extremely contrived premise. The Christmas theme is one that is familiar to millions of children. The problem is the Christmas themes in this film are a complete and total waste of time. The entire film takes place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. As a matter of fact, the entire movie is about Christmas. It has no other purposes in mind but to promote the Christian religion.  This is exactly why I hated the movie. In a nutshell, the movie portrays an awkward and overly enthusiastic Christian who attends a family event and becomes trapped in a life-threatening situation.  In a nutshell: A Christmas Tale is a terrible film that makes the viewer miserable. It features an overbearing Christian who thinks he is special because he is wearing his Christmas attire, which includes a Santa Claus costume. As the movie progresses, the Christian's personality develops and it becomes clear that he is not as special as he thinks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty surprised by this. For the most part, the story was fine. There were two characters I didn't get along with, and one character I had no real clue who he was. There was also a couple of plot holes that I'm sure could be covered in a better film, but I'm going to pass on that because I think you get a good read on the action and you don't lose that much. I didn'say I'd actually watch this, but since it's pretty light (especially for the series), I decided to give it a shot. I found it pretty funny. It took me about an hour to get through all the scenes, but once I did, I was thoroughly entertained.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two very different movies within this movie. One is the story of a couple who get a beautiful home and live out their lives happily with their young children. This is a pretty straightforward story. The second is the more fantastical story of an old man who is transported back in time to the time before the human race. He then becomes a guardian of the future and must defeat a dark, evil lord. The story is good but the characters are a bit weak. There is also a strange, yet charming, old man that gets his backstory from an old woman's ghost. It's really a fascinating, interesting concept. It just feels a little cheap. If this had been a full length, we would have probably been able to put it up against a few more interesting films. It isn't the worst film of the year, it's just not the best. 5/10

Yet I felt that I had to share this one because it is a really fun watch. I felt as if I was on a mission and it was just as fun as it should have been. The animation is well done and it looks amazing. The story line is really interesting and it kept me interested throughout. The characters have a good chemistry with each other and it is nice to see. The action scenes in this film were fun and some were quite awesome. "The Five Element" is a great film and it should be seen by all. If you liked "The Sixth Sense" you should probably try it as well. This is a fun, exciting, and well made film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The Good: - The best scene of the movie, when Jake gets his head smashed into a rock. _________________________________________ The Bad: - I loved this movie, but it was not very strong. _______________________________________________________________________________  Crazy Taxi [2001] (1998) 8.5  A lot of people don't like this movie.  The story, which takes place on a train, is very simple: A driver (Jack Nicholson), his girlfriend, and his best friend go on a ride with the intention of winning a lottery. Unfortunately for them, they are the only ones left on the train after the other passengers decide to jump off. A lot of things happen while they're on the ride, from an accident to a love triangle, a police chase to an encounter with the bad guys. The movie has a strong premise, but I was never very satisfied with the execution.  I found it hard to believe that the crew of Crazy Taxi (Nicholson, Martin Sheen, and Tom Selleck) could actually pull off all the crazy things they do during the ride.    There were also some problems with the script. While it was well-written, it was too repetitive and seemed too far out to have any sort of impact on the story.  There is also a little bit of violence in this movie and it does get to the point where it's not funny, but the fact that it's so over-the-top makes it worth watching at least once.  After the first movie, you will never forget the character of Jackie Chan, because he is so fun.  This movie has some of the best action sequences and is one of the better comedies that I've seen. The main plot of this movie would have worked better if it were adapted into a series, as it doesn't have any real character growth, which would be nice to see.   I'll leave you with a very odd and amusing scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was released in theaters on September 25, 2003, it was the biggest box office success ever, making more than three times the box office of all the other films combined that year, including The Matrix, Star Wars, The Lord Of The Rings and Spider-Man: The Animated Series." It should be noted that Peter Jackson has stated, "All the films of the trilogy were created using computer generated imagery to give the films an unparalleled quality and level of realism in the motion picture medium" (source). As for the "fantasy" aspect of these movies, "The Lord of The Rings: Return of The King" was considered one of the most realistic movies of the genre. For this reason, "Rings" was able to achieve great box office and critical success (source). But then we have "The Hobbit" and "The Return of  The King." The films based on the fantasy book series "The Silmarillion" were released on December 13, 2002. The films are set in a fantasy realm of Valinor in Middle-earth. But "The Chronicles of Narnia" were also released on Christmas Day and on the 23rd of December. The sequels to the book series were released as well. So we can say that the popularity of these books can be considered to be on the higher level, in comparison to that of "The Ring" films. 7. The Characters in "The Two Towers" and the Characters in The Return Of The King "Lord of the Ring" is probably considered to have some of the best characters, such as the dwarves, hobbits, Elves, Orcs, Elves and the Rohirrim. The "Two Towers" were the first trilogy of the movies.  They were released in 2003. They are considered to the highest in the genre, which we have just discussed. 8. The Story Line of The Two Towers The first three books in the "Lord of The Ring" series have many similarities. They start with a battle of the three rings, and ends with the return of the One Ring to Sauron.  The story is very similar to that in The Bible, The History of the Franks and other Biblical Books. One of the interesting details that I noticed from the first three "Lord Of The Ring's" is that there are many characters like Gandalf and Frodo Baggins. In

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What's Good: ______________________________ Is good, is funny, interesting, and not too much, this is what you need if you have the money to be a fan of the movie. I really liked this movie as a fan, if you want to be entertained, I would recommend to watch this movie. What's Not: ___________________________________ 5 out of 5 stars  I think most people will be interested to know about a movie called "Walking Dead" it is one of the biggest hit show that's currently running the tv. This show is all about the story of Rick Grimes and what's going to happen to him and his friends after their fight with the zombie. But before we got to that, we will have to watch one more thing of this show and that's "Wounded" It is the first season of this television show and it is set at the same time as season 1 and season 2. In the first episode, we are watching a couple of episodes of "Wicked" that were not as good as season 2 because of the lack of action, which is bad because a lot of the show was set in the future and we need more action. And after that episode, this show will continue in "Wound" we are seeing what happened to Rick and his group after they were shot by the zombies and it was a bad ending that showed what happened in season 1 to those people. I recommend this show if you like zombies and action and if you also like the idea of this zombie show but not the series to follow. It is also the first time we are getting to know what this "Wasted" world is about. For me, it was also a good season because it didn't show that much of a zombie apocalypse as I was looking forward to seeing. I was not excited to see many people get killed by zombies but it was ok because we knew there was a zombie uprising and that it would not stop. It was a good time for this zombie TV show and if someone like me who hasn't seen any of this "Survivor" TV show will watch it, I think I would enjoy it also. So if you're interested in watching this show, I recommend watching this if you get the chance. __________________________________  See full review
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ "It's so easy for a filmmaker to have all the answers," said John Waters (the late). "The best thing about this film is how it's shot." I agree. Waters' vision is gorgeous. You'll know exactly what you're in for the minute you sit down and watch it. A very nice cast and crew, as well. I didn't find the ending too "surprising," which is probably for the best. I think a more mature audience would not be overly surprised by the end of the film. But, I'm sure if you were expecting to see any kind of happy ending, you'll be disappointed. The movie could very easily be one long scene of destruction and despair. I love a good story. I don't think it's a total surprise that there's a happy ending to this film, but it's definitely nice to see a happy end. I give The Exorcist an 8.5 out of 10, though it's nothing special.

For those of you that don't know, here are the trailer  for  " The Man Who Would Be King  (also known as "The King's Speech" in the UK).  It's my favorite of the movie and my favorite musical in general.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ I was very happy to discover this DVD collection. I saw it for the first time at a public screening, and I couldn't believe how beautiful this film is. I was drawn into this film, and it kept me on the edge of my seat as it moved along. The quality of this film couldn't be better. You just have to sit back and enjoy it. It's one of those rare instances where watching a film and having the image that you see it on the screen can make it a whole new experience. It is a great story. I thought it had great visual appeal, and a great plot that took you on a very different ride. My favorite parts were the sequences with the two boys and the father and the three young boys. I also liked some of the sequences where the mother and the daughters came in, and the mother was very good at handling her children. I've seen this film twice now, and both times have been completely different. I have enjoyed it a great deal this time, and will probably see it again.

The only thing that made me want to skip the movie is the ending. It is way too abrupt. Overall great movie.

I'm sure that some people will like this movie, and others will hate it.   I have to say that I liked this movie a lot more than I expected to.  If you liked this film you probably like "Lovers In America," "Sucker Punch" and "Ender's Game."

It's not perfect, and it's not as good as the other books in the series (which it very much improves on), but it is a very well acted and acted out film, and is very well produced. I'm also glad that the book has such a rich background to it, and I'll be curious to see how this film does with its own rich background.

I would highly recommend this movie to all.  is not about the characters, and this movie does a good job at not focusing on them. Instead, the movie focuses on the human characters and their interactions with eachother. But that's what you want when it comes to a movie like this.

What I like about this movie, is it does a nice job at showing us how these people think, and what makes them tick.

The family lives about a mile away from the hospital. "We like to walk to work, because we have lots of neighborhood stores nearby and a good grocery store, and we can get food to work," Lisa said.  She doesn't use birth control because she was worried it might change the baby's gender. "It doesn't feel natural," she said. "You don't know. I want her to grow up to be a guy. It's not right that she was born with a girl's anatomy. And she's really, really cute, so I don't want to lose her to sex change surgery."

A transgender person may also be unable to be legally married because of his or her gender identity.  it's hard to know the legal status of someone who doesn't know whether he or she is married or single because many states don't have laws that include gender identity in their marriage definition.

I am a convert to the faith of the character, and I can say that this is my favorite movie in the series so far. It is a very dark and intense work, and if it wasn't for the wonderful direction of Christopher Nolan, I would probably not have the same reaction. ********* What more can you ask for than to sit in a beautiful forest and to have an epic and emotional experience. I'm sorry, this is just too amazing. I was totally moved, and the story just went on and on and was just really, really well written. The acting is superb in this, and is not to be missed. The cinematography, special effects, and beautiful music are all excellent, and give a wonderful feel to this movie. And the final fight scene, it's epic. It's so beautiful to watch it, you really feel like you are there.

My friends who work at a local mall and I are watching a Christmas movie together. We have seen so many over the years and are just getting sick of them. There are so many bad Christmas movies that we get tired of. Then we see this new one and are completely sold. The film itself was well done and was a Christmas story. Our mall had a Christmas parade on Christmas day and this movie is based on that parade. As we watched this movie, we felt the whole time it was true. We don't think our mall has anything like it at all. It is very good. Thank you.  I saw a good Christmas movie last year and it was bad. It made me want to throw the thing out. So I will be putting on a good show this year. If you see it, then tell your friends! You will never get tired!  This movie was great. I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and this was the first Star Wars Christmas ever! There were tons of lights and everything. It really made me feel like Christmas was really here. If that doesn't give you an idea of how much I loved this movie. The music was excellent. Thank goodness it's Christmas Eve. . "My wife and I watched a Christmas film last night. It ended with a Christmas tree and everyone was dressed in their best."  We watched this about a week ago, and I'm pretty sure I'll be watching it every time I have a chance this holiday season.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby is a very good movie. It is not as good as some other Hollywood blockbusters (such as Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace), but it is an excellent film nonetheless.  It is a story about a man named Nick Carraway, who comes from a wealthy background and is very interested in becoming a writer.    He begins working as an apprentice to an older man, who is very skilled at writing, and the film is set over a period of five years.  As the film goes on, Nick comes to realize that this "master" is not actually his mentor but an old man who has passed away.   This is where the film begins to develop an interesting character arc for the lead.  While Nick is very unhappy at this time and is a bit of a fool, he eventually learns how important he is to this old man.  When Nick begins to realize just how much he is important, he decides that he wants to become a great writer. This is an incredibly interesting concept for a movie, but it makes no sense on the big screen.  It is too simplistic to be considered an interesting movie.  The film is filled with moments where Nick is simply acting out of rage, and it never gets any better than that.  On the other hand, the artistry of the film comes through quite nicely.  I can't praise this film enough, but that will have to wait until some of my other reviews.

It would be nice to see a remake, as it seems this is one of those films that gets better with age, but I feel that this is the best version. 1.  The Princess Bride 2.   Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 2b.    The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 4.     The Silence of the Lambs 5.  6.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I will not go on and on about it. It is worth the price. If you want to watch something different, go ahead.  Review by: Eric G. - April 17, 2009, 7:17:47 PM  This is a fine movie. Very well-acted. Excellent acting by each of the five leads, which makes it a great film. The movie is good. It's also funny. It just feels as if it were shot in one of those low budget "television" programs with one person acting as director. It takes place in a town in the American south, in the late 1950's. There are no actors who are really good. In fact, some of them are pretty much "joke characters." The story is fairly straightforward. The town is being bombarded by a mysterious, powerful entity. A young girl named Linda, who works as a nurse, gets involved with a man named Bill who is involved with this force. Linda, Bill, Linda, and Bill all go into the house of a friend of Bill's, and see the entity. The film really takes off in the second half. We get a much clearer picture of what is going on, and the various characters are more fully developed. The end is a bit rushed. There is a scene in the last fifteen minutes which is a little strange. You will need to have seen the first part to see it. Overall, a good film.  "This one is for everyone"  Reviewer: Robert M - March 31, 2009  Subject: I'm surprised the review score is even 3.5, considering that I agree with most of it. However, I disagree with many of the statements made above, but I really do enjoy the movie. The acting is outstanding, and everyone involved is very well cast. It was great to see the original cast, who played such wonderful roles. Even though the film is in color, it still has that warm, romantic feel, so it doesn't feel dated or generic. There isn't too much of a plot and a lot of characters, but the action and atmosphere are still very enjoyable to watch. It also features some good music that really helps build the atmosphere. If I hadn't watched this as part of the "Walt Disney Channel " series I would've given the movie a higher rating. I really enjoyed it, and I look forward to seeing more of these classic stories. - March 30, 2009
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I like about this film is that it's just about what you think it is.   The plot starts out as a murder mystery, with a dead body showing up at the local inn and a witness who claims he saw the person getting on a bus at the time of the murder.   A murder mystery that is the product of a well made mystery movie.   You can tell that the director of this film has done a lot of research into the crime scene and the witnesses.   In fact, the way the director does his investigation is so meticulous, that he's a little disappointed with the film at times.   This isn't a bad film by any means.   It's a good mystery and a well crafted movie.     It's definitely worth seeing.     I really liked this movie.  It's just that some people will have different opinions than others. Â I recommend this to people who are looking for a good good mystery movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie, well worth the time to watch. I would like to note that the story was great. The way they handled the death of the character was very poignant. It was very nice to see them using a different way to explain the death rather than just showing it. This was a very well acted movie. The only problem I have with it is it was too long.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Godzilla' is the monster movie I never expected to see. The original 1954 film had some problems, but the director (Godzuki Ishiyama) and the cast really made it work. This Godzilla doesn't look nearly as big and powerful as the original monster, but he is just as scary as the film's title character. I'm always partial to a monster movie that features the most humanized monster, and this one is no exception. Godzilla and the entire cast have an amazing chemistry in this movie, and it shines through in the monster battles. The monster designs are really amazing and the special effects are also amazing. The film has a really good villain, and that guy is the only bad guy you'll care about (that's really saying something for a monster film, but I digress). The plot is kind of cliche and simple, but that just adds to the experience. A lot of people I've shown it to have said that it reminds them of the classic 'Tetris' or 'Mario Brothers'. It's very fun to look back on old movies and see how they managed to make them fresh in their own ways. If you want a quick monster film with a cool monster in it, this is definitely worth a look. It is definitely on the short list of great monster movies, but you can get a feel for how the Godzilla monster worked from the original 1954 movie. Watch it and tell me what you think.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This movie is really funny, though maybe not for everybody, since the "romance" part is the weakest part. I was hoping that they could do a parody of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", which would've been the most obvious parody, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The only similarity was that they both had "bad guys", the vampires and the police. And they were really bad guys, the cops being the most evil and vicious. The movie is a bit hard to follow, but you get the point. And if you're the sort of person who likes a good spoof, it is great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the second one, which was great.  I was glad to see that he had the idea for the "Shit" song to be a duet.    If there's one thing I love about my films, it's when a writer/director/producers/actors team up to create something awesome.  There was no doubt that Mr. Spielberg was in it, but this movie would have been much different if it wasn't for the performances of all the people in it.  The film has a very unique set of people playing all of the roles.  I love when filmmakers and actors work together like this.  Also, I love a song as much as the next guy, but there was a lot of "shit" in this movie.  For the record, the song that was played was the song from The Goonies called "Mystery Train."  So I think we're all on the same page.  This movie was released on VHS in 1995 and it has been available on DVD in 2006.  It is a great film with an awesome song.  If you want to check it out, then you're in luck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In an age where movie makers are trying to make their films seem relevant (that is, making the same film over and over again), The House with a Clock in its Walls is one of the very few films of this age that is still fresh and original. It's not a very popular movie today, but for a time when it was, it was an excellent film.  If you're looking for something slightly more adult in your horror fare, look no further.  See More:      The House at the End of Time (2009) and The House With No Name (2010) The House on the Edge of Forever (1931) and A Little Night Music (1939) Both films were adapted from the  Robert Louis Stevenson short story of the same name.  The House On The Edge of Eternity (1934) and House of the Spirits (1945) are both in the same vein as The House.   The House with the Clock in Its Walls (1923) and   House of No Return (1928) This year, I was lucky enough to go to the Criterion Collection's annual New York Film Festival, which is often considered to be the best film festival in the world. I saw a few films that I haven't seen before, and the one I picked to see was The House.  This one is a little different than the other films of the year, but it still retains its feel and charm.  It's got a unique tone that's a little off-putting at first, but when it's all said and done, this is a very entertaining film.  It's also a fascinating look into the life of a young woman who was living in a mansion, and is eventually abandoned.  So I had the opportunity to talk to the film's director, James Whale, and get his thoughts on the film, and also his thoughts of the film as a whole.  James was a great interview, and he shared quite a lot with me, about the history of The House, his thoughts regarding its reception and his thoughts about his own films. It turns out that this is actually James' first film in two decades, which is a pretty long time for a director to go without making another feature.  While I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of James' work or not, I found him to be a very friendly person, and I hope he keeps making more films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've been wanting to go to a film festival for a while, but the idea of driving all the way from Atlanta with my wife and kids just to be a spectator at the premiere of this movie was too much. It was like traveling to the premiere for an event you didn't really want to attend. And to think that was just a few years ago. The whole experience of seeing this movie in a theater is worth the drive, and to this day I don't regret it. I was also impressed by the production quality. They had some very nice extras which made the film a lot more enjoyable to watch than a lot of other films, and they also have some good music to go with it, too. I just don't know if I can go back and see the movie on the big screen again. I would just enjoy it a lot better if I were at home with my family watching it. Hopefully they make a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bored to Death. A beautiful movie, but with a great cast and a fantastic plot, this is one of the best indie comedies of the decade, it's a great comedy about a group of friends who get drunk one night and decide to start robbing banks and sell their loot. What they don't know is that they are about to get caught by their friends who are also on the run, and so they decide to make a getaway. The best part about the movie is the way that it is funny. It's like a bunch of drunk high school kids running around in a big city robbing banks, and the fact that they always find the right place to hide and how they always figure out a way to get out of the situation they find themselves in. It has some really great plot twists and the characters are all different, which really makes the movie special, it isn't the typical type of comedy that just takes the formula and makes it better. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh and good characters, and I would say that you shouldn't miss this if you ever have the chance to see it. It can be found on the iTunes Store for $.99. Posted by Jeff at 2:24 AM I saw this and it's definitely one of my favorites. Great actors and a great script, one of those really solid indie comedys that you can't help but laugh at. It is actually really funny. I would love to see a sequel. July 20, 2013 at 6:04 PM Garrett said... I'm not sure how you can be surprised by this. I can only remember seeing this a year or two ago and loved it. The comedy just flows. I've seen this twice now and both times the lines have come out funny. The cast is good and the script is great. July 28, 2013At the Film Society of Lincoln Center

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai  is a movie that not only captures the essence of the samurai genre, but also tells a story that is far more than just an average story of revenge.  A young samurai named Kitai (played by Hideto Nagasaki) goes to Japan to make his fortune and to avenge his father's death.  Kitai's new lover is Tadao (played  by Yuuhei Ohtani) who is a famous war hero and is being sent by his country to retrieve Kitai from the evil Japanese samurai Togashi (played in the movie by Yuichi Nakamura).  The movie goes back and forth in time in order to show the past and the present and show the struggle between good and evil as both characters try to win Kitai back.  It's interesting to see a samurai movie done in 3 different time periods in such a short film.  The story is simple enough to be told in any time period and is very clever in telling the story in such short length.  There's also some action that is quite impressive and the action scenes are also done well in such small time.  I thought the ending was great.  For a movie with such a strong action plot, the movie had to have a good ending as well.    There are some very clever plot twists throughout the movie and it was always fun watching those twists play out and seeing what the fate of the two characters will be.  Hidoto Nagasaki's portrayal of Kitai is very convincing and he was a lot of fun to watch.  Ohtane's portrayal as Tadaoi is also pretty well done.  This is one of those times when you can tell what the actor is playing as Togaki is so similar to him and their voices sound so similar.  Tadaoyu's acting is well done as well and it is not often that we get a character who actually sounds like Tadaiyu.  Nagasaki also did a pretty good job with the acting of Nakamura as well who is probably my favourite character of the movie.  As for the supporting cast, they're mostly very well done but I did feel there were a few inconsistencies in certain characters.  But that just goes to show how good the movie is and how well it captures the character of samurai and its traditions.      What I didn't like about this movie: The pacing of the film can sometimes be

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a beautiful looking movie that doesn't go for spectacle at all. I feel this movie is much more about the characters and the people they meet as they travel the world. It's a very peaceful and quiet film that doesn the best job of capturing the mood of the world without sacrificing its message. It has one of the best endings I've ever seen as well as the film itself ending on a huge cliffhanger that will keep me interested in seeing the next instalment.  The Good:  • A beautiful and peaceful world • The performances from the cast are outstanding. I especially loved when the two main characters have a conversation and the film ends on that very note. • One of the greatest scenes in an action movie. I love the scene in the hotel where they go around the building, the wind blowing through the building and the snow on the ground. The Bad:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me" (2001) is a wonderful, funny film about a man (Matthew Perry) who falls in love with his neighbor, a woman (Naomi Watts) who lives down the street and who has a great big house with a lot of history. But when Matthew's father gets hurt on the job and his mother loses her job as a teacher, she decides to retire early and move to Los Angeles with Matthew, hoping that the two of them would become great friends. But things don't go so well. When Matthew begins to doubt the value of friendship, his mother (Janet McTeer) is quick to explain that his father's love is just the best thing that ever happened to him. But soon, the two men must find new ways to bond. There's chemistry, there's chemistry and then there's some really, really bad chemistry.  Some of the bad stuff includes some of the weirdest editing in movie history and one of the best movie monsters (a snake-like creature with a voice that can make everyone it is talking to act like it's about to eat them).  The movie also features a wonderful score by Robert Wise, but this is about the best part of the movie: Matthew Perry.  The man who made Matthew Perry great was his father.  When Perry was growing up, he was the only one who knew how much his father cared for him.   A rare and beautiful shot of Matthew Perry in his early twenties.  In the film, Perry's father takes a job on a ship that's set to sail out of a hurricane (a scene you may have seen somewhere, like in one of those "You've been here before" movie trailers, but in this case you'll actually see it). But before the ship can leave, the weather turns around and the ship crashes, and the crew is stranded on the island.  The island is inhabited by some beautiful people who are willing to let Matthew and his father go on a journey to the mainland to get supplies, but Perry is not one to go.  Because he's been feeling guilty for not wanting his father to suffer, he vows to fight for the rest of his life against his father by whatever means necessary.  One of the reasons why this is such a great movie is because it tells a story about a person who doesn't always follow the rules, but is determined to keep fighting for what he believes

Anderson | |  - The film begins with the main characters discussing why this new breed of film is called a "documentary".  A long time ago I was very disappointed with the doc format. It was always a film that I would not enjoy watching, I never had the chance to watch a good doc until now. The best way to put it is that I was surprised at how good this documentary was. I can say that even with the best actors and best directors in the world, it's still possible for this to be good.  "The Best of The Best" is a movie I can see myself and all other people who loved documentaries watching over and over. This movie is simply amazing and it shows how hard it is for even the best documentary to get made. This documentary gives you everything you need to know as well as a movie to watch.  the movie tells you about every aspect of the filmmaking process. The movie talks about the writing of the script, editing the script and even the location of the shooting. In this documentary, the movie is just so entertaining. The story about the real life of David Fincher is amazing as well. Even more amazing is the fact that this film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary last year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers  is the best superhero movie I have seen in ages.  Not only do the stories of each of the Avengers work together well and make sense as a whole, but each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses which are clearly shown in this movie.  I just have to make one big comment about the film - its action scenes.   In one scene the Avengers are battling Iron Man and Thor (both heroes have their strengths and weakness and I can easily understand where they are coming from) and they are fighting each other instead of just being enemies.  And even though I don't know a lot about comic books, they clearly understand how to utilize this to their advantage.  The action scenes in this film are awesome and the visual effects work really well.  As I said above, it doesn't have the same sense of grandeur that Iron Man has and the way Thor and Iron Man fight feels pretty silly at first. But when the fight is properly executed the action is extremely fluid and fun.  But in the end, it's just not that fun. But what this movie does best is what every good superhero film should do - it just has the right level of fun for all ages and for everyone.  If you have any idea how to play a video game, it should probably play on your Playstation 2 or Xbox because if you want to play this movie you need to have a Playstation 2, Xbox, or Wii.  My favorite part of this movie is the battle between Thor and Hawkeye at the end.  This scene really showed how each of these heroes have strengths and limitations and you see that from the beginning in the first scene when Thor is saying he is not ready to battle Hulk and Hawkguy says he has never lost before and is prepared. But Hawkguie is a bit too slow for Thor to have the upper hand so it comes down to the action between the two.  Thor is able to easily break Hawkgutie's spear and is able take down all of Hawkgugaie's warriors just by standing there.  All of Thor's teammates come back with him and the group is able defend themselves against Hulk who has no respect for his father and the power of a god.   So Thor, the main character, has some flaws.  He gets in trouble when he thinks his mother doesn't love him anymore.  His powers are a little too strong for him to handle, which is also a

It has been a few months since I saw it, but the re-release on DVD was a big deal for me, so I was excited to try it again (I haven't seen it since my teens). I'm sure it is a "classic" by most standards, but it's a great movie and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did. I'm not a horror movie expert (I was raised Catholic, so this is a whole different world) and I'll admit that I didn't understand a lot of the movie until I got to the end (it's really not a long film at all, and if you are up for a long haul, you could see it all in one night). But all in all, I loved it, and I'm glad I finally watched it. I don't think I would have even considered seeing it at the time had I not seen it on DVD, which is a big plus.  John H. Review by - - September 29, 2004 __________________  Review by: Mark S. I've seen the "first" (1974, dir. Steven Spielberg) and the second (1982, dir., George Lucas). Now I've finally watched the 1983 version, and it's good. The film has great story and characters (with no real plot twists). I liked the film so much I took my son, a huge fan of Spielberg's (and Lucas' "Star Wars") to see it. (I know, I know, his "Star Trek" has been out a little longer but I'm pretty sure he enjoyed "E.T." even less.) One thing that caught me off guard (and is one of the reasons why I like the movie) is the way Spielberg created the character of Peter Quill (Peter's son), a completely normal, average guy that was raised on a farm. (But I guess not in a typical way.) While he is "normal" by any standards, he is not typical (like me). He has very little empathy. He is just like every other average person you know (I don't know why), but he is different. He's "special". Spielberg (who also directed "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") didn't really try to make the kid a little bit more than he was, but he didn't try to hide that. He didn't give us an example of a

The movie starts off with a group of kids drinking at a bar. We then start to see them in their own world. Their life goes from bad to worse, and then back to good again.  This movie has everything. It has action, drama, laughs and romance. The action is good, the drama is good and the comedy is amazing.    It will take you away from your life for an entire afternoon. And it is free.  The only thing I did not like about this movie was the story line.  The only thing that really bothered me was the fact that they did not give the characters any back story.  I mean if this were a movie, why would they do this?   I know I may have some other complaints about this. But I just want to say thank you for making such a wonderful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I was on a break when I went to see "I Feel Pretty". It was the only movie that I saw in that theater on my break, so I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but my girlfriend was and was very excited about it. I felt like it was going to be really dull. I had no idea how bad it would turn out. I expected a simple romantic comedy with no twists and no surprises, but I ended up watching a romantic comedy that I was really excited to watch. I'm pretty much not into romance at all. I just liked to watch it.I thought the cast were great. I enjoyed all of them and I hope to see them all again. The chemistry between the characters was so well put. There was a lot of kissing, some touching but most of the focus was on the two characters. I thought the acting was great, all the actors were amazing. They really made it seem like they were enjoying themselves. I would recommend this movie to everyone that liked a romantic movie, but not just a romantic one. It's funny, it's sweet, but it is still a real romantic comedy. It has all the same elements and moments you would expect from a good romantic comedy such as the kissing, the touching and the acting. It was definitely worth watching.

In many ways, the story of these films is his life. It is an epic tale of heartbreak, triumph, friendship, death and redemption, told through the eyes of a man who has seen it all. Wayne is a man of deep convictions and a man's man at heart." - Jeff Davis, ScreenCrush
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is quite the eye candy, in fact I think it's the perfect Christmas movie. It does not take itself too seriously, nor does it try to be too big. This movie is very kid friendly and is the perfect choice for your little ones who just want to come sit on Santa's lap and see his reindeer (although Santa can also be seen in this movie). I really like this movie because it has a lot of heart and is a family movie. I'm a big fan of the movies because it's not too complicated, it just has some heart and a little bit of humor. I think this movie is the best Christmas movie ever!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ ೧ಾಗ್  Drama: 『Nights of Cabiria』  Rating: ★★★★★  This anime took me away in a totally different way. I would describe this anime as the epitome of a good horror movie. The idea of this anime is very simple and straightforward; a woman goes into a mansion that is known for having supernatural and ghostly activity and is told that she has been possessed by the ghost of a deceased woman, and is thus haunted by the spirit. The woman is given a pair of glasses and begins to see the ghost, and she is then told to seek help, which she does by going into the mansion. She soon learns that the ghost is her sister, and has been hiding in her room since their parents died. The first half of the story follows the sister as she tries to save the soul of her sister that is being possessed by a ghost. The second half is the sister discovering that there are others that are being possessed. I've never watched any horror anime before, and this one was so intriguing that I immediately went into it and was amazed by what the show did. The story is so interesting, and I was able to fully immerse myself into it, and then watch it over and over again. The ending to the anime was also really neat, as it ended as a complete cliffhanger. The reason why this is rated as a drama is because of the actual plot being very realistic. In real life, if a family member suddenly died in the house, it would probably be hard to not freak out. The fact that there is ghost activity here is a very real thing, as the ghost in question is a ghost that is also a living person who has been dead for centuries. They don't really have a choice in the matter, as their mother has become the ghost to the mansion after her death. The ghost in this anime, however, is not just a ghost who has gone insane, as she is actually a very powerful spirit that is haunting the house. It seems as if this spirit is not fully dead, as in the beginning, she was able keep the life that was once living in the girl, as a daughter that she had adopted years ago. After the girl began to develop a sense of self, however (in the anime, this begins as a girl who was once the maid in the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A little bit of drama about a young girl and the man who cares for her. This film is about a little girl who is lost and scared. As her mother and grandparents help her get to the clinic, we find out that this little girl has the same problem that all the other little girls had when they were babies. She has a very specific problem that affects her health. It has nothing to do with gender. In fact, this girl has no problem with her body.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There is a feeling of a certain cosmic justice that I feel when the good guys prevail, and when a movie like The Right Stuff is a work of art, I am left speechless." I can't tell you how many times I saw this movie as a kid. It was a kid's movie, so it was really good. It had a fun feel to it, and it was a great time. The action was fun and cool, the characters were funny, and the music was great. My parents had an arcade system in our house, so we would play games on it. It always seemed like this movie had a lot of good old-fashioned fun going on, and I guess it did. But I had no clue it would be such a popular movie.  I thought it would have a smaller, more lighthearted tone.  The movie is about a group of people who are in a spaceship together in space. As the movie starts out, the ship is in a battle with the other ship in orbit. There are lots of explosions and shooting going on. One of the crew members (Tom Skerritt) tells another crew member (Bill Paxton) to stay close and be sure to look for a red switch that will shut off the engine so that the ship can be repaired while it's in orbit, but Paxton ignores the warning and stays out of range of the weapons, and soon the ship begins to fall out of orbit. In the movie's climax, the spaceship crashes into a nearby city, where it takes on water, and sinks. The movie ends with the ship sinking.  I remember seeing this movie in the 80s and the story felt more like it was an action movie rather than a sci-fi movie, but the characters in the film were all likeable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I am not a professional actor, but here's my take on this movie: First of all, this is definitely NOT a good horror movie. The acting is horrible and the story is stupid and not scary at all. Second, a group of kids find a "ghost" (or whatever the hell the hell that is). This ghost is a girl (who was a woman in the real world). She then attacks the kids and makes them eat their own fingers. She then goes on to kill all the kids, leaving the house empty. The scene where the kids see her is just... creepy. And a total piece of garbage. But as I said, I am not an actor. The movie is just bad. I am also not a fan of horror, and I have seen the other 4 movies in this series many times, but I just don't give a fuck about this crap. It was so bad that my only regret is that I didn't give it a one star rating, but that was probably a stupid thing to do. I was watching this movie for the first time at the age of 10. The reason why I gave it a 2 star rating is because I am sick of seeing this garbage in the theater. I don't even watch horror movies anymore. I wish my parents would stop showing this movie to me. The only reason why the rating doesn't mean a lot to me is because this movie is still rated a 8 by Rotten Tomatoes, which means it has a 90% approval rating and I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of the top rated movies of all time if RottenTomatoes were to actually include movies that are actually good. This movie is one piece of crap after another. I can't say anything more about this movie without going off my soapbox, but the only good thing I can say about it is that it had to be in the top 100 of all-time, since it was made in 1987 and I don`t know how many other movies have made the list. I have never been so disgusted by a movie that I couldn't even continue to look at it without having a panic attack. I would have given this a 1 star rating if I could. I really have to think about the fact that I gave this a 3 star rating. I give this movie a 5 out of 5 stars because I have watched it again about 5 years ago and I was able to turn the channel. I know that some people don
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________I've been watching this film for some time now, and I am extremely impressed by this movie. I think it is one of the best movies ever made. I like to watch movies where the plot doesn't revolve around an action sequence or some special effects, and this one just is. It is a story that is easy to follow, there is not much exposition at all in the film. It starts with a guy who is trapped in the forest. It seems like this guy is not an ordinary guy, he keeps making noise. This guy keeps saying "help me" over and over again. I don't know who is this guy but I like him. His story doesn't seem to have a point, he just keeps repeating the same phrase over and again. There's a group of guys, all the guys keep saying "Help me" in a repetitive way. The forest isn't a safe place for these guys either, the forest is very dangerous and they get attacked by wolves. When they get back to the village, the man who started the whole thing is found dead in the woods, and there are no signs of anyone in the village. The woman who died was the woman who had been with the man all this time. She has left her son with the village for the day, and now he has gone missing. So the villagers are searching the woods for the man. There is a scene when the man gets out of the forest and starts walking. He doesn't want to go, he says he doesn't feel good, but it is a guy and so he goes to continue his journey. The scene doesn't end there, the whole forest is full of wolves, and some guys are about to attack them. The guy with the group says "Look, I can handle them, they can't handle me." The guy is talking back at them, and it looks like he might not be the right guy, but they don't hear the other guy, and the guy says, "You can't. It's my story." The rest of the film follows this man as he continues to walk through the forest, and he starts to get attacked in different ways. When he finally reaches the village he finds out that his story hasn't changed at all. He has been found by the wife of his brother and he is stuck in a relationship with her, and they start fighting. She starts stabbing him, and then he ends up in the hospital, and she is

The original Chinese title of the film, called "A Taste of Honey," was later changed to "Cake" and was released on a Chinese video-on-demand site called Mianyun.  At the time, director Hou Hsiao-hsien was considered one of China's best directors and was making his name in the international cinema scene with films such as "The Grandmaster" and "The Great Wall." It seemed like the perfect choice for China to get their first taste of a foreign, mainstream Hollywood film in over a decade. , starring Michael J. Fox, was a hit in Japan. It is now one of the most successful movies in the history of China and one of Hou Hsi-hsiung's most well-known films. The film was also nominated for the Golden Bear, the prestigious best foreign film prize.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ Starring: _____ (Tom Sizemore, George Clooney) A movie in which George Clo the actor is a bad guy in a good way and Tom Siz emore a bad actor who does his best to play a good guy in the movie. The plot is set in the near future where a government agency has developed a super soldier with the ability to control the minds of criminals. But as the movie starts out you know it's going to be bad from the first scene with the guy who was going to join the team but he ends up quitting. And the movie has a few other scenes where it's a lot of bad guys and not very interesting except in the beginning. But eventually the bad guys are mostly just in it for the money. The first act is a lot like a horror film. You know you're not going to like the end of the movie but there you go. Then the second half of the film is very different than the first half and I was very interested. I think that it's because it has Tom Size in it. I also thought he was very good in it and he is very believable as a bad bad guy. I was shocked when he was supposed to be a good actor but they were playing around with the idea and I guess it was better than I had expected. The movie was made in 1989 but it is just as good today as it was back then. I had never seen it before because I had just moved to Hollywood in 1991 and I had always hated movies like this. Now I can see why they made a movie like this in 1989 and it wasn't that bad. But it has been a long time since I had seen it so I have to rate this movie at 2 stars. It does have a great actor in Tom Siza but his performance is not as good as his co star's. It was a good start for Clooney. ______________ Watch this movie. _________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Wedding is just a great comedy.  It's a perfect example of what you can do with a good script.  I love the main character, Josh (Drew Barrymore), and the plot is very clever.   There's no way you won't enjoy this movie.  The movie is shot in very beautiful, colorful colors, and features the talents of everyone in the cast.  Josh is just such a likable character.  He's got a great personality, he's got an amazing job, and he just has an amazing time.  You can tell there's a lot of care put into this movie from the way the story is told to the characters and how they react to the things happening around them.  Drew Barrymore was so great in the movie. I loved her every part of her.  We see her getting flirty and funny, and I can't help but think that she'd make a great girlfriend for Josh.  It's really surprising how great this movie is.  There were a lot more good movies this year, but The Big Wedding was one that made my list.   So there you have it!  If you've not seen The Big Wig, do yourself a favor, watch it right now!  There are only a couple of people who I would recommend this movie to, and you can tell that it's a true labor of love from everyone involved.  Enjoy the movie, and if you have any more suggestions for The Big Christmas Movie, let me know in the comments!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ I was looking for an older film to see in theaters. I saw the trailer and I was intrigued enough to pick it up for a week. I have to admit, it took me awhile to really get into it and I found myself at times really lost. I guess I should start off by saying that I do find this movie to be quite entertaining and it is entertaining in a humorous way. When you first watch it, it seems like the main character is being chased by a serial killer. The main character, Jeff is the victim of a serial murders and is being pursued by him. Jeff is able to find his way back to the woman who saved his life and was supposed to take care of him for the rest of his life. The whole movie is about how Jeff manages to outrun the guy he thought was the serial killer and it isn't until he meets a woman, who is also looking for someone who's been disappeared, that the truth comes out about the serial killers. It's really quite a bit of entertainment to watch as well as a good read. The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Stephen King. It has a couple of great endings that are quite a few years old. Overall, this movie does have the potential to be very entertaining to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Stephen King, as it is quite a great movie. _______________ Score: ______________ 4 out of 5  Director, screenwriter: Dan Kwan  Cast: Christopher McDonald, Jennifer Garner, Michael Douglas, Robert Forster, William Hurt, Richard Jenkins, James Marsden, Laura Linney, Jason Patric

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The third installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise (the first two films in the series were "Furious" and "Fast Five" respectively) has had me excited for its release. While the original "Fast" was set up as a PG-13 movie, it never quite hit the mark for me. But it did have some nice elements. The movie opens with a beautiful vista as a white Porsche drives by (although it should have been an orange Porsche, haha). The movie quickly moves into a scene that was shot in Los Angeles. A beautiful couple are walking through the street when they see a young girl walking down the street. They call out to her. She responds to their call and they begin walking together. The young girl smiles at the couple and walks over to them. She then asks them if they have anything she could do for them. The guy says that he needs to ask his wife if he can buy her a cup of coffee and the young girl says that she is going to buy him one, then she turns and walks away. So the movie ends with the couple walking through their streets and the couple finally ask the young woman "How is it working with you?" The woman smiles and walks off. __________________________________________________________ So what happens after the girl does that? The movie is set up for a sequel, and this time they have gone to Paris, France.  The scene from "Fast 5" that the car was seen at the beginning of the movie. And this time, they have changed the car to a very different model. While driving in Paris, it is quite obvious that the guy who is in the car has had a car accident and has lost his driving license. While he is still in the middle of the road, he is pulled over by a police officer who explains to him that he is speeding and driving with a suspended license. Then the guy turns to the officer and says, "Is this France or the United States?"  Not quite the same car.  Then the cop says, and I quote, "Yeah, it's both."  So it seems that the "F" word is back in the movie, and that is the best thing that could have happened.  The police officer then asks the guy if he has been drinking and the guy says "No, but you have a girlfriend." After some discussion, the police officer says that "You must not be cheating on her and if you are

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** "A simple, quiet film that makes for an interesting watch. This is a very well-done, quiet and very low-budget film about a couple of brothers who have to find money and then pay a debt to the bank and get to the hospital to see their mother after her illness. The acting is decent but the story is quite boring. The story is told from the point of view of one of the brothers who is trying to figure out how he has come to be in this position and how to repay the money he owes. The film doesn't tell a great deal of detail about this, which is a good thing. It tells what the audience needs to know to understand the film."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Gatsby" is one of those movies that I can enjoy as a young girl. It's a classic of a movie and that's the kind of movie that I would like to watch with my kids if the family got together.  A few of the scenes are very funny but most of them are more on the scary side.    This is one for the books.  The Greats is a book by Jules Feiffer.    The book was published in 1961 and was the story of the young writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.   In it, a man named Tom Wolfe meets the mysterious and famous writer F Scott Fitzgerald as Wolfe was preparing to take his life by writing a book.   Wolfe gets a job at the Gatsbys' hotel and becomes involved with the eccentric millionaire Gats by giving him books and helping him write the novel about his own life.                This movie was filmed in 1951 and directed by Frank Capra.  It's based on Fitzgerald's book and stars George Raft, Gene Hackman and Robert Ryan.    This movie has some great scenes such as Gats and Tom's meeting. I also like some of the parts where Gats tells Tom how the hotel has an extra room that can only be used by the gatsby's family.  Also, the scene where Tom and Gats sit on the bed watching a movie is a nice scene and I really enjoyed seeing Gats being like a kid again.  Gats is definitely like a normal kid again at the end of the movie.  Also, I really liked Gats giving his father a bottle of whiskey.  This scene really shows how much he misses his father.  I can totally relate to the movie because I have a younger brother who is going through a hard time.  The father figure in our family is usually the man we see around the house, and we see him as a mentor to our brother, and for good reason too.  We don't often see that with our father.          I have to say, that this is a great movie. I would definitely recommend it.  My kids loved it and enjoyed it with their parents.  If you are a fan of classic movies like this one, you'll definitely enjoy this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you think this review is helpful to you, please do yourself a favor and buy the movie. It really is great, especially with the music. I highly recommend it.  __________  My only complaint with The Hunger Games is that it wasn't a good film in the first place. It was a disappointing and confusing movie with a huge disconnect between its premise and execution, one that makes it impossible to love. The first two hours or so are great, as it gives you a chance to see the characters interact and learn about the world around them, but then things get weird. The main villain of the movie, the game designer Katniss Everdeen, turns out to be this horrible person, and I was not excited for her to be in the movie until she had killed hundreds of people. She has an entire movie dedicated to this, and it is completely unnecessary. The fact that she's a woman and the one character that seems human, gives her this terrible air of evil, but the only humanizing thing about her is that she is so strong and able to kill hundreds of men in a matter of seconds. The rest of the world she inhabits is completely dehumanized, and she has no emotional or human connection with them. This is the first thing that gets you going for the first few minutes, but it's completely lost in the second half of the film. But that's the only real complaint I have about the movie—it's really great and a lot of fun to watch. For a movie that has all of its heart and soul in its theme, it ends up being incredibly shallow and boring. You spend most of the time rooting for the villain, and by the end she's completely useless to the plot and the story is completely over. I really enjoyed the books by Suzanne Collins, but I still think that she should've made the second movie a prequel. Instead of making this movie a continuation of the books, as I have suggested, she could've explored different points in the series. And not make it a horror movie, but an epic action film.

And I must say, Jackson is very good in this. His singing is not quite what it was on "Bad". However, there are many great pieces of music that are worth listening to. I really did enjoy Jackson's music. I was very surprised by the soundtrack for this movie. It did not seem to be out of character for Jackson. The soundtrack did not feel like a Michael Jackson movie in any way. It was just an enjoyable movie with good music. It didn't have the same impact on me like I thought it might, but it was still pretty good. The only thing that I would change if I could is the ending. It just seems to go on forever. It does get better at the end, but not enough. Jackson has many great music tracks in this movie, but "Bad" did not show them well. The ending is also very hard to watch, but I will not take it out of the score. Overall, it is a very good movie and it is worth a listen. /watch?v=5V5V3K-vzF8 _________________________________________________

I got it off of the iTunes list a couple of days ago and have been watching it everyday. The actors do a fantastic job portraying the characters that they play, and the story, while not overly complex, is a very interesting one. I have to say that the voice acting is great. My wife is a big fan of the voice actors, and even though she is not a huge fan of voice actors I'm sure you will be pleased.

I will not sit still, I will NOT BE SITTING STILL! This is a great movie. Not perfect but very good." -Barry N. H. -BHW  _____________________________________________ _______________________________________________  'Tales from the Far East' is a story of three young men who encounter a fantastic prehistoric creature known as a 'Makura' and try to capture the creature before it causes havoc in Japan. It's a classic monster-of-the-week film, and is the perfect example of a well-done monster movie. Director Katsuhiro Otomo's script is a masterful creation, and his direction is flawless, particularly in the film's climax. It captures a wonderful mixture of humor, tension, and action, and it's clear that this is an extremely important film for a lot of people. The characters are perfectly suited to the character work of Akira Ifukube, and the screenplay is superbly adapted by Hirokazu Koreeda. This is one of the better action films of the 1970s. Director Kenji Mizoguchi is a man of great vision, and this film showcases his talent and expertise as a director, including the great sense of scale and atmosphere.  The acting, particularly that of Toho's own Ryohei Suzuki, is also quite good. Suzuki is a very good actor who really plays the character well, although his performance as Toho President Goro Majima is a bit uneven. It makes me wish that the other two characters had had more roles to play in the story. It seems like a shame that he doesn't get more scenes. And speaking of Goro, his character is quite strong. He plays a very strong boss, who's not afraid to step in and protect his subordinates when they're being threatened. His character does not get any lines in this film, but it's very clear that he has a strong and strong will to fight. 's main weakness lies in the animation. It may look fantastic on the TV and DVD release, but the animation is dated and doesn't do a good job of conveying the sense of movement. It is apparent that many of the animals, most of them very large and imposing, are merely moved on a very large computer screen. For a film about prehistoric animals, it's a little disheartening to see that there is little effort

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film takes place in a future that we are currently living in. There are no space aliens, or time travelers. There's a guy named Alex from the future named John. And John is a time traveler. John is traveling back in time. Alex and John are traveling back a day before John's death to when Alex was born. And Alex is born to a woman named Laura. The only time she's ever had sex is the first time she gets it in her life. A week after her mother died. John and Alex are going to have to deal with Laura and her boyfriends. They're going to be very, very bad. You know you're going into this film thinking it's going to get extremely bad, but you'll be pleasantly surprised. There is a very well-written screenplay, and an interesting central character that you can relate to. There were some very creative and funny things that I didn't think were possible for the time period. When John and Laura first see each other, they're both dressed in a wedding gown. When Alex and Laura are first introduced, they start off dating, and John and the future Laura start off sleeping together. They both have very, kind of awkward sex, and that's all you need to know about their sex life. And you don't need to see anything else in this film. They get along fine. They have a lot of sex. But once they get the future Alex and future Laura together, you see how they work out. You see how it all comes together. And I think they have a good time, but then they get married and start having kids. And those kids have a great time. But they've come a long way from the two-month sex experiment they had in the film. In the original film, there is a lot less sex. It's all in short bursts. This film has a great deal more sex, a lot more romance, and a lot greater chemistry than the original. If I had to pick one thing that really surprised me, it would have to be how well the music came to life. I thought, "This is going to sound crazy, but I actually like the music here." So when I watch the film, I don't think, "Oh, this is going too far. This is going wrong. This isn't working." Instead, I think, "[Music] is going well, so it must be a good idea."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ _________________________________________  _________________________________________________  in the end, it all comes down to the film's message and it does a pretty good job. there's an old saying about the most dangerous people in the world are those who keep quiet, well this film has plenty of both, as it takes the form of a horror-fantasy featuring all the elements of a well written story (the creepy old women, creepy old men, creepy evil looking creatures, etc.) in a manner that's just as entertaining. there are also a lot of things in this that I was never really interested in watching but which I ended up enjoying. i'll admit that i wasn't particularly a fan of the creepy old woman thing going on, but then again i was also not a huge fan of a lot, so i'm not really surprised. the creature scenes were probably my favorites. the acting is very strong here, though i think that most of the time the characters are not very distinguishable. i don't think i'm alone in thinking that this is a fairly straightforward, straightforward horror film, and not the sort of thing that you could make fun of, or that it was going to be that hard to get across. but it's so good, and so effective in making you think, and then it just ends up leaving you feeling totally satisfied. this is exactly what a good horror movie should do, and i think it does it well. __________________________________________________ ______________________  _______________________________  A very fine film, this one, a true classic. It's a little difficult to describe this film without giving too much away, but to say it's a psychological thriller would be a disservice. it's very much a horror movie with a little bit of a supernatural twist. there aren't really that many "shivers" in the film; there's a certain dread that hangs around the edges of the film and there is a sort of creeping unease that hangs about. it would be hard for anyone not to enjoy it, although i would say the film is not exactly easy to watch. the film has a lot going on and at first glance you'd think you've seen this before (i did, on a few occasions), but you'd be surprised at how much is new. the pacing is perfect, it's not long enough for things to become tiresome, it doesn't have to be taken too seriously but it does have to get you wondering. i
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of this is more action filled and intense than the other two movies. It is not for everyone. It starts with some quick montages that will quickly get you hooked to the story. The movie picks up with a guy who has gone insane and he tries to get some help from a doctor in the hospital. As soon as he walks in, he realizes that he is a monster. In this world of monsters, only humans can be saved. The doctor is a great addition to the film and he really brings this story to life. The second half of the movie is just more of the same with some added scenes of suspense.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I have had a great time seeing this movie. I have no problem with the movie being made by a woman. The actresses are very good in the role and they have a great chemistry. However, the movie lacks the sparkle to make the whole thing work. It's just not an original movie at all. The movie is good for the first 20 minutes, but it becomes a chore to keep watching. It may have been better if there had been a stronger message. If a woman can play a role like this and be as good as she was, why does she have to be the only one? The ending is not too bad either, but I wish the story had ended with a better ending. ___________ Review from an unimpressed fan: When I saw the film, I was disappointed in the fact that it was directed by a female. I wanted more from the script and the way the story was presented. It was so slow and I felt like I was in a dark and boring basement. It wasn't the most original story or movie I have seen but it was not bad. The whole concept of the film was nice, but for the movie, to end in a boring place is disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ಡಿ ೤ೇಸ್ಯ  DankMemes   Favorite IMDb page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1145962/  I can't tell you how much I love this movie. It's one of those movies that makes you feel like you're actually there, on a small boat on the Mississippi. There's so many little details that you can only see when you're in the boat, and I think that's what makes it so special. It has some very simple, simple plot, but it's so well crafted that it really makes it seem like you don't need much to make this one stand out. I love how the movie is structured, it's a very calm, almost dreamlike way of telling the story. All the characters are so distinct and you really feel like your just seeing the world through their eyes. I don't know how many people have experienced the river, but I've actually been on the river. I feel so lucky that I was able to have the opportunity to see the film when it first came out.  And no, you're not watching an entirely realistic version of what it was like to live on the water. It was actually the worst. I mean, look at this, you don;t even get to see what they ate, what they drank, and the food they ate while they were waiting for the boat to sail. I'm pretty sure they didn't even have toilet paper and they just took what they could. It is also an extremely long film and probably has less going for it than it does.   I'm gonna be honest, and it probably won't come as a surprise to anyone who's heard this movie before. It doesn't hold up well today. It probably has the most annoying ending of any movie I've ever seen. The ending makes no sense and it's absolutely awful. This is another one of the movies that I'd recommend to people, if they've never heard of the original, but if they have, then it would probably only be because they've seen the movie, and have a little idea of what the film is about.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ Movie: In the Company of Boys / Nacho Libre [2010] Director: Pedro Almodóvar Director: Miguel Gomes Cast: Gael Garcia Bernal, Miguel Ángel Marín, Pablo Iglesias, Jafar Panahi Director: Nacho Vigalondo A short film from Spain based on the novel of the same name by Julio Cortázar. It is about a man who, with the help of his son, is driven to the edge of insanity after watching a movie that is more than a little "disturbing." I don't think I've ever seen a more boring movie, though I haven't seen much of Almodovar's work. His direction is weak, and all the acting is either painfully bad or comical. The acting is probably the weakest aspect of the film, and even the funny parts are a bit too forced. I think it's a shame that the film was made, because the characters are funny, and the humor is at its best when there's a sense of urgency. I don`t know how anyone would make a better Nacho than this. ____________________________________________________ Movie: My Left Foot [2000] Director / screenwriter: Mark Lachman Director: Tom Green A film that is so full of clichés that it could have been made just to sell copies of The Blair Witch Project. I have no idea what to think about it. It's a strange film, with a weird plot and nonsensical characters, and if this was just a cheap horror flick, it would have a chance of staying with me. But the performances are so terrible, the dialog so bizarre, and this is supposedly a comedy, there is just nothing in the way of humor. It might be funny to watch a group of kids go through some sort of weird psychological ordeal, but this movie is just as nonsensical as it is silly. ______________________________ Movie: The Great Train Robbery [2006] Director and screenwriter (and former editor at Rolling Stone) Chris Smith. A film about a train robber who is hired to kill President John F. Kennedy. Yes, there are interesting plot details, but it's all over the place. The plot is so ridiculous that I had to keep stopping the movie over and over again to just take it all in. Smith tried to write a bit of a mystery that was too bizarre to be a mystery. Instead, it's just a bunch of absurdities. At least
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. That's the gist of my review of "Mystery of the Haunted Castle." In this movie, two detectives are investigating a case at a haunted castle. They don't get very far, and then they get very scared. If you enjoyed the movie, and if you like spooky things, you will like this one. It was very entertaining, very creepy, and very scary. It's a good way to end the first film. It leaves you with a good sense of fear, not quite at the level you are feeling right now, but still very creepy. It is well worth the watch. Also, the movie is called "Mysterys." If you are one of those people who loves to see numbers and the like appear on screen in their heads, you might as well turn the channel. You will be bored by this. This is just a story about a detective and a ghost. The story isn't very original, and doesn't come off as original, but it's pretty good and if people like stories like this, I can't imagine how many people might like this movie. For someone who doesn't care to see scary movies, this is a good one. There's some good acting in it, and a good story. If it were a little more scary, I might give it a higher rating. Otherwise, it's about as close to scary as you can get without actually being scary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen all the films in the new Star Wars trilogy. They were great. They are the best of the series. I was disappointed they weren't going to be longer, but I didn't have a problem with the movie being shorter than what we were used to. I also loved the fact that it has a strong female lead. I think it's awesome that we get to see Leia as a complete character. I do have some gripes with the ending of the movie. The way it ends kind of gives the impression that there will be no more Star Wars. Not sure if this is the film's intent, but it did give me that sense of being left out. I would love to see the trilogy continue but the ending is a little too much for me. I have not seen the prequels. I don't know if they are any good or not. It's hard to tell at the time. They can't tell me if they were bad because they only have these films to compare it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The King's Speech is a masterpiece that will be remembered for a very long time.  There was a time when everyone loved it but it is sadly no longer regarded as a classic.  The movie is about how the king and queen are at war with each other. The king (played by the brilliant Tom Hanks) is being pressured to allow some of his subjects to marry with the queen (played amazingly by Cate Blanchett).  The queen is on the side of the king but the movie is really about the queen and her struggle to get what she believes to be right.  Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of the King was also fantastic, a great actor.   I was surprised at how quickly I loved the movie as it had some of the most beautiful and moving scenes of my life.  Blanchetto's performance as the Queen was also amazing.  Although she is not as likable as Cate in the movie, the movie does show us some of her character development and how she changed.  I highly recommend this movie as a love letter to the movies and it was the best of the classics.  If you don't have a copy of the movie but you still want to watch it, you should know that it was remade as a musical and it is very good.   If you liked this movie, you may also like:   The Best Of The King's Confectioners
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  The best thing about this movie is the performance by John Cleese. I have loved his characters since I saw him on Monty Python's Flying Circus (1979). This is just the next step up in his comedy repertoire. It is easy to understand, and easy to like. The story is simple, and entertaining. And the comedy is good, I loved the scenes with Peter Sellers and the other British actors, even if they are not of the caliber of Cleese or Bill Hicks. The only disappointment was that the screenplay was a bit lacking. The plot is very good, but it had too much unnecessary humor. And I was hoping there would be some romance, but the movie was a little too short. Overall, I had a good time watching this, and I would recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Dark Knight Rises The Dark Tower  No movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has felt like such a disappointment to me since Guardians of the Galaxy. I was so happy to have Spider-Man 3 come out this year. I had no idea it was even coming out before I saw the trailer, but I'm glad that it was finally here. The Dark Towers, as I've been calling it, isn't even close to good enough to warrant an IMDb rating of 8.5. The action scenes are lame, the action is slow, and the dialogue is almost laughably cheesy. It just doesn't work for me. The fact that it's a prequel to The Dark tower trilogy, and not a sequel, has me a little confused, since I thought it was a movie I'd be eager to see. This is an epic failure. I'll give it 4 out of 10. My only real gripe is that the action scenes weren't as exciting as they had been in the first two films, but even so, this is still an easy 6.5 out of ten. This movie has been rated Mature, but the PG rating doesn't make up for the fact that the plot is incredibly stupid and boring. I've seen better movies, but nothing that compares to the utter stupidity of this film. I have no idea how this was produced, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  If you liked Dark tower then you'll love this one too. Don't bother with the sequel, The Dark and the Light, if you want to be entertained.

This movie was not a total disaster. I think it may have had a little too much humor for some people, but for me it was really enjoyable. I will be getting the DVD for this one, and plan to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very similar to the tv show: a police detective who has to solve a crime in the woods, and while doing so, finds out about a secret organisation that helps the bad guys and hides the good guys from the police. The main difference between the show and the movie is that in the movie, it takes place at night, while in the tv series it takes the action at night. The movie and the tv-series are both excellent, but the tv version of the movie seems to take the action to a darker place than the film does. There is a lot of nudity in this movie, some sex scenes, and it is not really the kind of movie that you can watch in the living room without getting a hard-on, but I found the movie to be more exciting and fun than the tv special, and I have seen it in the cinema and I can see why it was so popular. The only thing that I think is a little bit of a letdown is the film adaptation of The Twilight Zone, although that isn't the fault of this movie itself. The first 5 minutes of the film is really a slow build up to the final battle scene. However, once the fight scene starts the first two hours or so of the flick is really fun. The film is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is very entertaining. There was no real plot twist in this film, but with the tv specials, it would have been nice to have the twist that the detective is from the good side. I give this movie 4/5. Next week I will look at a little film about a man who thinks he is a werewolf.

I didn't really think that the movie would go along this way, so I'm really glad that it went well. I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but I can certainly see why some people loved this movie. The acting is very good (especially the cast's performance) and I thought the film's story was great. The music (by Jens Thijssen, and I believe also by Jens-Henrik Iveberg) was very nice and it was very atmospheric. The only thing that I don't really like is the whole "slash-and-stab" part. In a way, it did make the movie a bit more "dark", but in some scenes, it was just too much. The film's length makes it too short, but that's not the fault of the director. In fact, the film is actually longer than many others that have the exact same name. But anyway, this is a great movie and I hope that a few more will be made.

The final shot is a little weak. _______________ The Scary Scenes: _____ _____ The scene where a child is killed, then we see the man and woman and boy running through the snow, and the girl sees the creature and it's cold...the film just goes on for a long time, it's scary!    But it's so well made, I was fascinated by it!  It had a very interesting mix of horror, adventure, suspense, humour and romance.  The Blair Witch Project (1999) One of the best horror films of my lifetime, the Blair Witch is a supernatural thriller about a young girl who returns to her family home after a year-long absence.  After discovering that the house is haunted, she is led to explore the woods surrounding her house.  She soon discovers that something is trying to get to her, and she has no choice but to run for her life.  While not necessarily a horror film per se, it is an incredible psychological horror that is frightening and thought-provoking.  Blair Witch will scare the living daylights out of you and leave you begging for more.  I can think of no other film that
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!The best way to describe this movie is just the best. I would describe it as an action packed, adrenaline pumping, over the top action film that is so much fun to watch. The cast is just a bunch of guys who love to have fun and there is so many great action scenes in this movie. The action is very fast paced, the stunts are amazing and the fight scenes are so intense. I can see that people would get very frustrated and angry when watching this movie since it is such a fast paced action movie. There is one part of the film that I did not like and that is when our hero goes to the local bar to drink. When he goes in, his friend from school (who plays a big part in the film) comes over and starts harassing the bar owner and then starts making threats about how he will break his arm or shoot him. The bar owner turns around and says "Well I guess you won't be coming back". He goes back to the bar and tells the owner that his friend is a piece of crap and should not be in that place. The owner gets upset and says that if our friend comes back, he will kill him. He then says that he will be the one to do the killing. So he turns around again and says something that I found to be the most offensive thing I have ever heard. He says "I will go kill you and eat you." I don't even know where to begin. I know this is just one small scene but what it did was it made me laugh and make me feel sick. It was such an over the line thing to say and I am sorry if you were offended by it but I just felt that it wasn't funny at all and I wasn't sure how to take it. This is a great movie that will make you go "WOW". If you have not seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend it. If you did watch it and liked it, do yourself a favor and watch the sequel right away.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Watch out for this movie. This film is terrible. It looks nice from the front, but the film itself is bad. The plot consists of a bunch of people in a church talking about how God will come back one day and then a weird guy enters the room and kills everyone in the first 30 seconds of the movie. I did not like the idea of this film. It's like a poorly written horror film, except that the film only has one set of jump scares, and they were not really good. The story just seemed out of place. The acting is all over the place, from the people that did the talking, to the people watching. I can't even call this film good. It was a complete waste of time and money. I gave this a C.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The story of a boy who dreams of flying like a bird and is accepted as such by his school and friends was, overall, well done. The movie had a well put together story of how this boy gets accepted as a pilot by the flying club he is a member of. But, the story ends at the end of the third act when the character of this boy is not only accepted as the pilot, but as a member by the school and the students are also showing support to him. It is great that this character grows as a person and becomes a great pilot, while being the only person in his class who actually wants to fly. There were times when it was very obvious that this movie was going to end at a certain point. The story is interesting enough. The voice acting was excellent. The animation was fantastic. It could be considered that this was made as an homage to an old Japanese movie called "Atsumare!" It had an animation style which was not too different from "The Karate Kid" which is pretty much the only movie I have seen that has an animation that was similar to that of "Aces!" I'm not sure if the film is supposed to be an homage or not, but it didn't feel like it was an actual homage. I would have loved for it to have been a full on homage. It did however feel like an old movie. I also had my doubts whether or not the director knew what he was doing. At the end, I had a feeling that it was either an homage film or the director was simply unable to do anything right. I'm sure it was a very interesting and well put-together movie, but I feel like the director simply couldn't do anything more than what he had. That is just a minor gripe that I have with the movie. So, overall: _________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Why would you like to watch a movie about a guy with two horns that has a crazy, crazy personality? It's totally crazy, isn't it? He's crazy. But he's so fun to watch because he's really got a good heart, a nice soul, a great heart, and a great love for his wife. He knows she's not going to change him, but he's got a real respect for her and he really respects her. He's got to be the smartest guy in the room, but when he goes on these things he is a little crazy. His wife was just a victim of his madness. She didn't understand his craziness, and I think he wanted to change the whole world so that he could change her too. He didn't know that she wasn't going to be there to support him, she was just his vessel. So when he gets a little mad at people, he's a little more than a normal person, he gets to that place where it's like I'm on fire and I can't be controlled anymore. He doesn't know what he's doing. He thinks he's in control of this crazy world and he's not. The things that he does are insane, but I think at the same time, in spite of all the craziness and the silliness, it's a really good movie. It's really hard to watch, but at the end you're like, "He's crazy." It's not funny. It doesn't make sense, and it's all on the surface. It is like watching a crazy person at a crazy party, but it's the best party ever. There's something about a man with two heads that, even if he doesn't feel good about anything, he doesn`t make the most sense. But if you look into his eyes, if you ask him a question and he thinks about it, you think he`s doing the right thing. He`s really got that great heart. I don't know if that's like a bad thing, but to me it makes sense, that it makes perfect sense. I think that`s what makes it a good story. And I hope that`ll make some people cry, and see it again, and make them go "Wow, I didn't see that coming!" And maybe someone else will see it and go, "Wait a minute, I see what you're talking about. That's exactly what he did.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Dear Director, When I first saw you in my movie "Sneakers", I loved your performance, the story, the idea of a new girl who is in a group of thieves who do bad things. However, you didn't do a good job with acting. The reason is that there is a very serious scene where one of your characters is hit in the face by a baseball bat. I liked your characters, so I thought that I would be in a good mood for the rest of the movie. However I found out that I had to leave the movie to get a band-aid on my nose. The scene is extremely disturbing and makes me sick. I can't watch the rest. I will never work with you again. Please direct any future movies with more respect to the actors. I am sure that I will see you again one day. Thank you. Yours truly,   -T.J. [See the attached photo]
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'll give you a minute to imagine yourself riding the train back to your apartment with the lights out after midnight, listening to the car doors slam shut behind you and all your old friends sitting up in their beds and laughing at the fact that it was nearly four years since you went out.  Suddenly, you hear a voice saying, "It's dark outside, so let's not do anything."   What a brilliant idea. Â You've been waiting your whole life for a girl to show up at your door. ÃƒÆ'Ã†'Â If you could have any animal on this list, what would it be and why?  The platypus is pretty weird, but I really don't think it deserves this particular spot.    I don't want to ruin the surprise, but that's just a little bit about my own pet platypi.  Which animal do you think has the worst luck of any animal?   If I had to choose, I'd probably say that we're all a little nuts.  You know, like the weather.  I think that's the number one thing in our lives that sucks, because we can't control it.  It's like, "Oh, I'm going to go out there and do my thing and it's gonna be great.  But the next moment it's just not gonna work out. "   Why did you have a baby?  I had a baby because I didn't want the baby to grow up alone, so I had it. You have the ability to do some really amazing things and help other people, but sometimes it's hard, it's a little tough, you have to really want it. That's why I was scared to have kids, because I wasn't sure if I could take the care of a baby and, you know, it is, I don' t know, I just don't know.  So I had the baby, and it was a challenge, it was scary, but when I think of all those people who have been through that, it just, I know that it's an amazing opportunity, and there's a lot of people who don't have that, so it's wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cinemax's 'Sons of Anarchy' (the show) is the greatest series to ever hit TV. "  -Kirkus Reviews "Sons' Season 2 is the best S1 yet. " -Indiewire  Sons Of Anarchy Season 2 (TV Series) Review Sons has a strong story arc and a great group of characters.  The plot focuses on the dysfunctional dysfunctional family in West Hollywood and the family of the main character, Frankie Dart, who is trying to survive his father's addiction to the painkillers. Frankie Dart - This season brings Frankie back for his second season and he gets to do a lot of things he hasn't done in seasons one and two. Â  Frankie is back and there is no more drug dealing.    Frankie finally gets over the abuse of drugs in the season finale, and goes back to what he does best, which is getting in trouble.   Franklin Zarcone - Frank is an interesting character and he has some great character development.  He is an incredibly gifted athlete who has had a lot going on in his life, and has spent time in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  Zarconey was introduced in season one as an ex-con who wanted revenge on Frank, and the two are now friends. Jax Teller - Jax is a great character and the season does a good job in bringing Jax's character forward and having him evolve a little bit more.  Jax has an ex and a drug problem, and now he has a father who is addicted to pills, and Frankie Dart who is also addicted to painkillers, and there are two of them.  The story is really interesting, and very different from the previous seasons, but I think it does a great job in giving the story some depth.  Sugar Ray Leonard -  It is hard to say just how good Sugar Ray is.  It is very different than the other Sons of Anarchy characters and it is very intense and has its own voice.  I have heard some people who don't like it, saying it is like watching one of the most violent movies of all time.  However, I think the intensity of the drama is what makes it so good.    Tara Reid -  Tara is a character that comes to the show and is very annoying.  Tara is the perfect antagonist for Frankie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you get to the end of a film, even an interesting one, you have to say, "Is this it? I can't imagine what else is left." There are a lot of movies with that feeling, but few that make you feel so utterly exhausted that you feel you should just lie down. I've always wanted to make movies. My parents were artists and my grandfather was an animator and my mother was an actress. They encouraged my interest in film and I found myself drawn to stories that challenged and moved me. But it was when I was very young that my interest really got into full swing, and in my late teens and early twenties I was working as a graphic artist for a record label. I was making a lot more money than I had been making at art school. I moved to LA with my fiancé (and eventual husband), my friend, and my boyfriend's father. We all worked for a video production company that produced videos for major bands and for various celebrity clients. We were in a lot less pressure than I'd been, so the creative and artistic side of me really started coming out. The job was great, and I loved the fact that I could work with really amazing people, but the money was never enough. So, I decided to move back to NYC.   In 2005, I got a job at an advertising agency, and it was there I learned that the art department at my company had started to hire people with a film background. At that point, the film industry was so small in New York that it didn't make sense to be pigeonholed into a certain kind of work. A few years later, I was hired at a marketing and development company. It was there that I met my partner, John, who is a director of photography and a writer and editor, too. Over the next few years, our company grew from a two-person operation to a ten-person company, and that included hiring five of our friends from the advertising industry and our friend who was a writer.   the five of us are working at the same time, but John is also a novelist, and he has an original series that is coming out later this year called "The Darkest Minds."   So, a few years after we started, we decided to branch out and do our own thing. We realized we weren't going to make as much money as we thought we would because of our lack of experience,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the summer of 2009, John Carter, about a space-faring astronaut, made a huge splash. When it was all said and done, it earned more than $370 million in box office receipts. That's a record for a live-action film. And now, the film's director, J.J. Abrams, has revealed that a sequel has been greenlit and will be released in 2016. This is huge news, as the film took in almost $200 million in its first three weeks of release. What makes this news even more impressive is that Abrams is an executive producer on the sequel and will direct it himself. This will be the first time that a man has helmed a sequel to a movie in theaters. That, in itself, is a remarkable feat. And it's a sign of how important J. J. Abrams is to the Star Wars universe."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wolf of Wall Street is a solid film that is entertaining, though it has a few too many weak points.  I do not mean it as an attack on the film, though, as the story is a bit simplistic and the characters are generally unlikable.  As someone who is a fan of the film's director Martin Scorsese, I can say it is a pretty entertaining film.  The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are strong, and both are fun to watch.  ScorsESE has created another entertaining film, and is still one of the best directors around.  He is just not one to take criticism well.  All in all, this film is entertaining and worth watching, if only for the entertaining characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid action-adventure flick that's a bit on the slow side but never loses the plot. This is an excellent action movie with some real heart. I thought I was going to fall asleep but ended up staying awake for the entire runtime because of the cool stunts and the special effects. The cast is pretty good too. My only concern is that it has so much going on but they never seem to get caught up in it all.

The harassment and abuse that women like Whedon and Sarkeesian have endured is simply a continuation of a long tradition of abusive behavior. The "Aurora" shooting was horrifically tragic but sadly it does not change the fact that there are many, many other men out there who think the only reason a woman would want to be raped is so she can be "a good feminist."  There is no doubt in my mind that this incident will inspire the current wave of "women are ruining everything" arguments. But there are plenty of men who don't share Whedon's and Sarandon's sense of entitlement to women's bodies. Men who, if they had the chance to, would not have assaulted Sarkeesians and Whedon.  The sad fact is that while Sarkees, Whedon and other women are being shamed and threatened, many men are continuing to abuse women with impunity. The good news is that women are beginning to speak up about this problem, because it is time to stop tolerating it. , I am not an expert on this.

She called the police, who informed her that she should be careful, because 4chan had recently been implicated in a hacking attack that affected some 200,000 iCloud accounts, and was therefore under increased scrutiny. That person also said that they had a "very powerful connection" to the local FBI office (one of the few things I knew about the local government back then). After I read, I decided that if someone was going to get harassed, I wanted to find out who it was. I called the local sheriff's department, who referred me to the Fayetteville Police Department.

The story is a mixture of dark and light, action and adventure. There is some humor and a lot of drama. The book takes place in a world of magic and creatures, not unlike the one found in the Dark Knight. It is a world where guns are no longer the most effective tool against the demons, but the only tool against another human. In this world you can't fight the demons with guns or swords but only with magic. Now, magic is not always as wonderful as it might seem. It can turn you into a mindless killing machine, take control of your mind, and have some very strange effects on those that are unfortunate enough to come in contact with it. However, once again, this is not the case in The Gunslinger. The guns, swords, and magic can be used in creative ways, but they are still guns, and swords, magic, and everything else in The Dark Tower is used in a similar fashion. The action scenes are awesome, and the world of the gunslinger is fascinating to the readers, as it is to me. The only complaint I can think of is the fact that the book is long. This book is definitely over 150 pages in length. This makes the action scenes to the best in the series. While there are several major characters, most of them are only featured for a few scenes. That being said, The Gunslingers is a must read for everyone. The first book was great, and now we get the second one, and it is sure to be even better. This first book is not a complete book, but a nice beginning to what could be a very exciting story. As with all great fantasy books, it is one thing to read, but

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ The movie starts of slow, but you see it's going to be different. As you sit there, you realize that it is not like most movies. Most movies I see are one big generic plot. It's usually very predictable. There is not much emotion in them. This movie is different. There are great characters that you can sympathize with. They are all doing something that they are not supposed to. They're doing something wrong. The one that really sticks out is that one of them is a prostitute. He's a former college athlete that was turned down by a lot of big-time sports programs to enter the NFL, and he ended up doing this. He was going to have a normal life, and now he's out on the streets doing this, and it's pretty cool that he is doing it because he wants to leave this life behind him. It is all done really well. It seems like there is a purpose to everything, and that this whole movie is for a greater purpose. The film has a very heavy, very emotional ending. It leaves you wondering what could have been. It also had a great ending of all the money that is going to help people. _____________________________________ 4.0/5 The story has to be done well if you want to get a positive rating. As with most of my reviews, I am going to start it off with my feelings. It is a very positive, uplifting movie. It really doesn't have to have any big events or anything like that, but it is good. It gives you an idea of what a great person could do in life, but does it in such a way that does not make the viewer feel like you just read a great book or watched an excellent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is a wonderful movie and has many wonderful moments and lines. It's a great film because it has a fantastic cast of characters, the best performances in the 80's and even though it's not as visually pleasing as "The Big Sleep", it's still pretty great. If you've never seen "The Good The Bad and The UGLY" then you're in for a treat. It has a classic tale of a cowboy and a bull. It is one of the rare movies that I have seen in theaters in which the film is so beautiful and has such a strong story that you don't want it to end. If you like the cowboy movie then this one is definitely worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Movietone (2016)  is a movie of the highest order. It tells the story of a black student (Anthony James) who is forced to sit for a state exam to get into an elite university. His mother is on trial for fraud and his father (Chris Evans) has a reputation as a ruthless killer (even if that's not the case). He is forced, against his will, to participate in the test and his only chance of passing is to take off his tie. As if this wasn't enough, his family is being investigated by the cops for alleged child molestation. As the exam proceeds and the pressure mounts, things only get more complicated. A wonderful cast of characters (with no less than Robert Redford in the lead) play off each other wonderfully. Evans and Redford's character go from being the most ridiculous and over the top characters I've seen to being an effective team. It is a shame that the movie doesn't go any further with its plot, as it is the best example of film-making in this century. The acting and script make the movie's two hour run time seem almost impossible. The pacing of the film and the characters make it a great movie for any audience.  It is probably the only movie in recent memory that deserves its reputation as the "film that should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture" for a reason.  One of the great things about the movie is that, unlike a lot of the horror movies I've loved, it is based on true events. The movie is inspired by the real story of Anthony James (who was also an aspiring rapper) who was murdered by his father. He was 13.   The murder happened in 1994. Anthony was about to begin a promising career as an aspiring rap artist when his life was cut short in an absolutely brutal way.  The story is told from his point of view through interviews he conducted in his final year of high school. It's so easy to read into this book.  James and his friends had a lot to face. Anthony's story is just as interesting, but I'm not sure how to put it into words. It was hard to put the book into words while trying to figure out what to write about.  It's like watching a movie that doesn't make sense to someone else. I know I'm in the minority here, but it was hard for me to enjoy the film as a fan of the book

It's a fun and heartwarming little story of a group of people who have a plan to get rid of a terrible villain called the Demon. It is hilarious and is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the music is really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ It is not perfect. Yes it has a few flaws, like the story being a bit vague at times. Yes there are a few scenes that were just a bit too predictable. Yes the ending was a bit predictable too. No it has been a bit difficult to believe. There were some really good scenes here. This is not a movie where you can watch this and go "Well I have seen it all before" Yes there was a certain plot twist which is also not typical. Yes things were left ambiguous. But I was not disappointed with this movie and I was excited for what was to come next. _________ A very good movie with good acting and good cinematography. It had a lot of plot twists and it was very interesting to watch. I am really glad that this movie is now being released for us to enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ What I liked: _______ What I didn't: _____ The only thing I found disappointing was the fact that, not to mention the music, this movie was just plain cheesy.   I was really hoping that there would be some clever tricks to pull out of the movie in order to make the audience laugh and/or enjoy themselves (if nothing else to create the same kind of surprise/puzzlement in the audience). But, of course, it was the old "what the heck is going on" trope.   I'm sorry but this movie is just kind of lame. I'd have rated it a 1 but for the fact there were some really cool "joke" sequences.  Read More

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I am a massive fan of the original Star Wars trilogy and its prequel trilogy. The first two movies were great, but they were not good enough to put me in the mood to watch the final two movies and I am always disappointed when they are released. The prequels were great but not really enough to get me to go see them. The last 3 movies all suck, except for Rogue One which is a great movie. This movie is good, I wish it had some more action, but it is still pretty good. They have really done a good job with the special effects and special effects in the previous movies were outstanding. I would not change anything about this movie other than if they made it a bit shorter and it had a bit more action I think the movie would be fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ The movie is a remake of the 1987 movie of the same name. The new director is the same as the director of the first one. This film has been remade to include many more of the characters and many more scenes. All the action is well shot and has been edited into a more coherent movie. There are a few scenes which are so stupid that I couldn't tell what the point of the scene is. But I thought that the movie was worth seeing as there is a lot more to it than a lot of people realize. __________________________________________________________ "S.E.A.T.", the movie stars: Mireille Enos and Mark Boone Junior. The movie begins with a group of teenagers from New York doing a school project about the S.EA.R.s, which stand for Security Emergency Response Teams. A group of police officers, with the help of a former S.U.S.F.C. Officer, begin to investigate the "suspects" and the real S.D.S., which is an elite paramilitary group. The film shows how one of the members of S. D.S.. turns out to be a man that is in love with his girlfriend. In the first scene, we see how he tries to recruit the girl's family. The girl's brother and her father both turn down his advances. The S. E.A.... R.I.P. is a long running, old fashioned, gangster film. It is full of street-racing cars, guns, and good-time raps and drug use. The police officer who investigates the SES. is played by the late, great and greats Frank Zappa. The rest of the S E. A. T. cast includes a younger actor, Mark Boone Jr. as the leader of the gang called S.I.. I don't know much about this group but I'm sure that they have some good music on their records. The only negative I can find in the film is that it could have been a bit longer. It ends pretty abruptly but it wasn't long enough to make me want to sit through the next one. A movie that is worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  I had seen the movie many years ago, but I was really surprised when I first saw it. I remember thinking to myself, "wow, this could really go well." I'm not sure if the plot had changed since I saw the movie, but the premise seemed to be as good as it ever was. I would like to see this one a lot more often. __________________________________________________  This was a good film. There was something for everyone in it. It's about a man (Michael Douglas) who was able to use his own mind to make a lot of money, but then a little guy (Jack Black) shows up and takes all his money. There were plenty of laughs, although the ending was a little over the top. But it is still a good flick and worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014  It is the summer of 2014, and the great apes are once again on the verge of extinction. The military is desperately trying to rescue a group of surviving primates, but first, they have to get past a small army of humans who have come to their rescue. The army is led by the charismatic leader and former circus performer (and now war hero) John Rambo, played by Brad Pitt.  At times the movie is a bit confused, and this is made worse by the fact that the movie does not seem to be really trying to be clever. This means that there are numerous scenes where we are not sure what is going on. In one scene, we see a young boy and his parents being held captive by a group that is trying to get rid of them, but in the next, we are told that the boy was kidnapped, and that they are on the move for his "protection." That makes no sense to me, as that is the entire purpose of this movie, and it simply does not work. ...  The film is paced well, and while it does have its share of action sequences, the pacing is not so frenetic as to keep us from enjoying it. The film is also quite funny, and is often very tongue-in-cheek. However, the movie has very little to say about race relations in a post-apocalyptic world. I could understand it being more satirical in this regard, but it would have been nice to get a bit more out of the topic than this.. , 2015

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  A lot of people, who are watching this movie for the first time, are very confused by the whole concept of "the evil monster". They think, that a creature that looks like the film's bad guy, is a "monster", but it's not. It's a human being.   The director does a great job in making the audience think this. Every time we see this monster, it has a different voice and expression. When he first appears, he is very serious and cold. Later on, he says some funny lines, makes some jokes, and even starts having some fun, but he is still an angry monster who will stop at nothing. And it is very well done.  's the evil monster' is, for me, the best monster movie I have ever seen, and it is also one of the best horror films ever made. The acting is very good, and the story is a well thought out one.     I highly recommend this movie, and I am sure that you will not be disappointed if you see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  - It was not the first movie with this premise, but the main character was different. He's a detective with good intelligence but he's only able to learn about crimes because of the knowledge that he gained in a previous case. He has a sister and he goes to school with them, and they were all part of his mentor's "puppy army." It's not very interesting. The plot seems to be moving and is good, but there is a lot of talk and a lot less action. The movie is about the police and they're doing well and the hero is a policeman, so he does well. The bad guys are not as good or as smart, and the movie does a good job of showing that. I enjoyed this movie, and there were a few scenes that I didn't understand at first, but I've learned a lot about the criminal world and I'm sure it will be something I remember. I have no idea what the main police detective is like.  *I found the police uniforms to be very sexy and it was a great way to make them seem more dangerous than the regular bad guys.  "You Can't Catch a Kid": __________________________________________  (1990)  When a boy is brought back to life, a doctor finds that his mind is missing. He decides to give the boy to the man who brought him back from the dead, but not before having a baby with him. A few months later, the doctor finds out that the baby is a girl.  I think this was made at a time when the concept of the zombie was still unknown. The idea that the child would be raised in a human family seemed to make a lot more sense, but it didn't seem to have any impact on the story. The boy was really not developed at all. I can't explain it. The main characters are kind of weird. They were the doctor's ex-wife, who is now his wife again. I liked the guy, but he didn't have a lot going for him, as the film was lacking in action. I think the character development could have been better. I didn;t understand his motivations or why he thought he needed to kill this boy. I also thought it was silly that he had to kill the boy because he was a zombie. It was a bit confusing. There was a lot, but nothing really worth noticing. It doesn't really deserve to be in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm not sure it really needed another re-make, but it needed it a hell of a lot more, as this was the only movie this year that completely blew me away with its gorgeous art, memorable characters, great soundtrack, and just about everything else. It's as if the directors had finally realized that every movie needs a good story, and that no story is as important as the world itself, and this film certainly has a lot to say about the state of the world, as well as the state and state of mind of its lead character, a very conflicted yet very strong protagonist with a very important role to play in the future of the human race. I was absolutely blown away by this movie." I was blown away, and it's not that I expected much out of a reboot (well, maybe more of an evolution of the formula than anything), but what happened to this film was absolutely astounding. It felt like an entirely new film that had been in production for years, but the fact that it still manages to be so powerful and satisfying in spite of its many differences is just remarkable. "The Fifth Element" is an epic science fiction film about two alien races, the humans, and the Vy'keen, that's been through a lot of turmoil in the past and has finally come to a fork in the road. The humans have made peace with the Vykkers by taking them in and training them to serve the Empire as well, but one of the Vys, a female named Elena (Berenice Bejo) has a secret that she needs to protect. She and her family have been hiding a secret which has a profound impact on the fate of the Empire itself. "The Fifth Planet" was directed by Terry Gilliam, and based on his novel of the same name. The story takes place in the near future, where humans are at the pinnacle of their technology and culture. The Vykker Empire is a powerful force on the planet, but as technology and science advances, more and more of the empire is being threatened. At the heart of the threat are the Vygers themselves, the human-vampire hybrids. When the human world is threatened by their own expansionist tendencies, the Vyss, the leaders of the vy'kker species, go into hiding. One of these leaders is a male named Tuvok (John Larroquette), who is working with the Empire in an attempt to find
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most underrated film of the year was definitely "This is the End."  I don't think the critics gave it the proper credit it deserved, but it was a very well-made film, with an interesting premise that just happened to involve a bunch of robots fighting aliens.  It was not a great film, but "This" was worth watching.  This is also one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in the last few years.  It was very enjoyable to watch the various characters play their part, as it allowed them to interact with one another in a more intimate way.  "This." also had very subtle humor, as the aliens and the robots all behaved like humans at times, and at other times, they acted like little alien people.   It was a good, simple concept, but the execution was not perfect.  A few scenes were somewhat rushed, so some of the jokes were not really executed as well.  What really made "This," however, was the acting and the character development, and that is what really made this film a worthwhile one.  Overall, "This Is the End" is not a bad movie, but if you are looking for an entertaining action-packed romp, look elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What is it about the last two weeks that has kept me turning to the screen after all these years? The movie 'Cinderella' with its fantastic performance from the incomparable Gwyneth Paltrow as the villainous step-mother and it's Oscar winning composer Alan Menken, the movie 'The Phantom of the Opera' with it's stunning performance from a true star and the movie I would call 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', the last movie, was the best Christmas movie I have ever seen and the first movie that I have seen in the last 25 years, ever since the movie in which Tom Cruise was in the title, 'The Hunt for Red October'. And I am not sure that my love for this movie, or for the movie, the musical and the films in general is going to come to an end anytime soon. I was a little hesitant to watch the movie but I was hooked by the first two minutes, the dancing girls in a fairy tale, the magnificent singing voices and the beautiful choreography that was the hallmark of the movies from the 60's and 70's. The story of the movie had a unique plot twist that was absolutely shocking and I can't wait to see what the movie will do in the next 2 weeks. This review is for the DVD and I think it is worth the money spent because this is the best movie ever made, and it was made by someone who really knew how to tell a story, who could make a beautiful film and tell a beautiful story. I just hope the DVD isn't delayed any more because I would love to get it when it comes out. It is a beautiful movie, one of the best ever made. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is that it's an "American" movie about a non-American. There are a number of themes and topics that could be explored on other countries' films. However, the fact that the people in this movie represent a non "American nation" is a nice touch that I found very refreshing and enjoyable. The "M" rating for this movie can be due to the fact it is an old movie with the actors having a pretty good body of work. They played their parts well and were fun to watch. The only thing that I would have done differently with this movie was the "trouble" that comes up at the beginning of the film. It should have been done in a different way. I think it could have been a little more subdued, because the main character is pretty much constantly in trouble. The story of this movie involves an aging baseball star and his wife who were forced to take a road trip to find their missing son. I love the idea behind this story because it's a pretty sad one, but it had a nice balance. I also like how it is structured into a series of flashbacks. It helps the story become more real and interesting. The acting was pretty solid as well. The main character was really relatable and relatable can be a very important part of the story. It helped me feel more connected to the main characters and the story, which was wonderful.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ Why I Like It: It's a fairly simple film with a simple plot. It's set in a future where the earth has become a dead and barren place, where mankind has spread through the planet, but all the planets have become barren as well, with few plants, and the only thing that is edible are the meat and bones of dead and extinct creatures. Humans are now a minor species, living on the ground in the forests or on the ships in the clouds, or in the cities, living in little houses in the dark. We don't even eat meat. It feels like a future version of The Road.  The story isn't all too exciting, but it's fairly well-paced. The ending is just as strange as it sounds. There are a few different versions of events, and it's just as weird as the original. It isn't the most interesting film, but in my book, it ranks pretty high. I enjoyed it. I had a great time watching it.  of 6 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ A film about a beautiful girl (the same age as me!) and the gang of boys who are going to save her life. The film is one of my favs for its beautiful scenery and its beautiful romance. The guys are in good shape and you can tell that they are all in love with each other. The movie is really well made, I especially like the love scene and the ending.  The characters are not particularly complicated, but they have their own distinct personalities. There's a beautiful, young girl who has the body of an angel and the soul of a fairy, the little boy who is always worried about something and the old man who just wants to get a little peace and quiet, although he sometimes thinks he's going to die from old age. All the characters are really unique and you get to know all their motives and emotions. The animation is excellent and the characters do move well. The cinematography is very good and I really love the look of the film. I think you would really enjoy the story. . I hope you like this one too!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I'm a sucker for anything with a motorcycle and I think we can all agree that the first MotoGP movie was absolutely brilliant. I have a soft spot for it (even though I wasn't particularly fond of the first movie, but I'll be damned if it wasn't at least a solid attempt to do a '50s movie that had motorcycle racing, which was absolutely, undeniably awesome back then).  This film is basically an extended, extended, and extended version of the previous film, and although it does have some changes from it that I thought were worth mentioning, it's a decent movie, and the cast all seem to work with each other well, and there are a couple of genuinely cool sequences that I loved.  As for the story, it doesn't go too out of its way to set itself up as anything new, so there are quite a few references to the earlier film, but the movie does move along pretty quickly and doesn't overstay its welcome, and I'm really glad about that. It's just that I do think it's getting a bit on the nose at times (one of the worst offenders being the scene where Giorgio's girlfriend is riding the bikes, and she's sitting on one of them and her back wheel ends up in the mud), but this film has a lot of good gags and good, fun action sequences and, honestly, I think it was more successful than the first film was at capturing the joy of motorcycling as it is. 's characters are also more interesting and more interesting personalities, and if you're into bike racing and are looking for a good, silly movie that has motorcycles and racing, it seems like you should try this one out. It isn't one of the best movies ever, but it's fun and it does a good job of capturing what motorcyle racing and motorcycle riding was in the mid 50s. It is, however, not the best, but then I don't really care too much about the best in most things, and this is not one of those movies. , 7 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a bad movie. It just doesn't do much for me. The story is very interesting. It doesn't seem to be telling a very complete story, as much as the characters are. There are plenty of scenes and lines of dialogue, but I wouldn't say it was very exciting. The main character does try hard, but sometimes just seems lost, like an old man who just can't find his way. The soundtrack was a little different and the characters, while not that interesting, seem to have some kind of personalities, though I can't remember them well. It's a very good movie, but does seem to lack a bit of interest. Still, it's a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Weird Science" has all the makings of a great horror comedy, even if it is a bit long in the tooth to fit into that genre.  If you are a fan of horror, this is a great pick to watch as you will laugh all the way through the whole movie.  If you have seen or heard about "Weird science", you know that it was directed by one John Carpenter.    John Carpenter's only other feature film is "The Fog", which is one of the most underrated horror movies of all time.  Carpenter also made the original "The Thing" and  "Tobe Hooper's "Spirits of Voo doo".   This movie is actually a sequel to the original movie which was a huge flop when it was released.  This was supposed to be the follow up to the cult classic "We Want the Weird Science", but the studio felt like it was not a very good movie. That's why they took the movie out.  And while the movie didn't do well in the box office, it still holds up and will probably be remembered for years to come.  In the original, it was the late 80s, and we are introduced to a young man named John (Robert Carlyle) who is a fanatical fan of science fiction.  John and his friends all think that they are too cool to be a scientist.  So one day, John goes on a vacation to a museum and ends up being haunted by the creature that was seen in the movie, a giant squid.   While John is off exploring, he is suddenly attacked by a giant tentacle that grabs him and pulls him to the bottom of the museum.  While on his quest, he meets some scientists, one of which happens to be played by  David Cronenberg.  Cronenberg was an artist, and an extremely talented actor.  The movie starts off with a fairly standard ghost story, but as it progresses, we find out that it is actually the future.  It is the year 2088 and everyone who is alive is trapped in a giant city under the sea called San Diego.  With the help of a giant robot called "Vader", the city was able to escape its earth bound existence and now the scientists want to go to the future to try and stop the aliens that have attacked Earth.  However, it is hard for the people to go back to the past because they are

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good film about a man who doesn't know why he was sent on this mission. It's a good time for a horror film and a good change of pace.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace: Star Wars is a big part of my childhood. It was the first movie I ever bought. I remember thinking it was the coolest thing ever! It was also my favorite movie in the entire Star Wars franchise. Star Wars The Clone Wars: This show is the best. The first season is the funniest. It also has the best acting! I thought the second season was pretty good as well. Star Trek: The Next Generation: A little dated but still very funny. Star trek: Deep Space 9: This is the show I watch when I have a free weekend. It's not the best science fiction but it's still funny. I have the Blu Ray of this one. It is so much funnier then the DVD. I know I'm just rambling now but I just can't stop myself. I recommend you check out all of these great movies and hopefully you like them as much as I do! Posted by Alex at 5:44 PM I like Star Wars better because they get some funny stuff right, and the plot is pretty good. I think it's probably one of the best sci fi/fantasy movies ever made. I watched it in 4D with a pair of 3D glasses (as if it really needed them) and a blu ray player. It looked awesome. And I just have to admit that a good chunk of the characters are not even that interesting (i.e. Anakin). But then the movie had a great score and a really good director (Steven Spielberg), I'm not going to criticize the movie too much, it's a classic. 4 people found this useful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know who to credit as the first to put this out there, but we have to start somewhere and for that we would have to thank the people of Reddit, for the reason you see in the title of this review, this movie was so fucking good that it just had to be put here.  The movie itself is directed by Mark Mylod and he is not one of the better directors in the movie industry.  He is nothing but a glorified television and video editor, with the exception of the movie he did with Paul Walker for a couple of years, where he got to be a very talented director.  So what you have is a very amateurish director who made this bad film because he really had no other option, so he did what any other amateurs would do, he made a film that looks like a crappy television show and does exactly what it says on the tin.  I mean this movie is about a couple that goes to a lake that is being used as a wedding venue for the night of the wedding.  One of the two wedding guests, who has been watching the lake from a distance the entire time, hears a noise and calls out to them.  They then see a big guy walking towards them, who tells them to shut up and walks off.  The other guest calls out for him and they eventually come to him, and the big guy is then taken down and the wedding is cancelled.  But the bride is still a bit mad and doesn't want her fiance to go through with it, and she gets her best friend to take him home to her, but the big man is then killed by her ex-boyfriend, and because she is too much of a coward, she goes to take revenge on him, but then she gets hit by a bus that is speeding down the road, and falls off, but luckily the guy driving it is going too slow for her to die, and he gets hit too, and dies himself.  This all leads to her being taken in by the local police and she becomes a cop, because this movie takes place in California.  As she starts her career she is immediately promoted and becomes a captain, and even though she is a good officer, she has a few bad apples in her squad, and when the new guy gets killed, she tries to get back at him and the one bad apple who isn't that bad, she uses her power to put him on trial for the
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This film is an interesting film in terms of the politics of the time. The film deals with the fact that the United States was trying to build its own nuclear weapons by the mid-1970s and then that this weapon was to be used to prevent China and Russia from getting a hold of them. The whole idea of "probing" the country is very reminiscent of the film "Project Pegasus" by Steven Spielberg. This movie is not the same as "Project Apollo". It is a true story of a man whose daughter was murdered by her husband and who is involved in an effort to prove it, though it involves quite a bit of drama. The story is also interesting because of its focus on a young woman (Carrie Preston) who is in love with a man (Everett McGill) who was accused of his wife's murder. That she is trying to prove the truth of her claim is fascinating to me. Another point that I found to be interesting was that the main character, Harold (David Carradine) seems to be an extremely intelligent person, yet he was very much a product of his upbringing, which is why I find it difficult to believe that he would have been a political person. I also found it interesting that Harold is the only man that Carrie knows who does not want her to marry Everett McGill. He is also the only person that Carrie trusts and who has any kind of sexual interest in her. The fact that Carrie had such a great time in the movie I find fascinating. _________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film does not go very far in terms of plot development. However, it does manage to capture what you would expect a good "action" movie to be. The cast is excellent, the fight scenes are cool and exciting. The action sequences look great as the bad guys fire blanks at you at ridiculous speeds. The only problem is that the film doesn't have enough time to build it's world, but it does a good job of introducing the world. The actors are also good and the script is written as if you were there with them and they're all in on the humor. Overall, a very fun action movie.  (4/5)

I know the other reviews are saying that it's not a good comedy but I just thought it was a perfect joke. I loved the joke on the fact that they were trying to sell us all these different types of food. I think that the ending was funny but the whole movie wasn't that great, I can't see how anybody can like this. The story didn't really go anywhere, they just ended up at a restaurant and when they went back out the way they came and they saw a dead dog. The one thing that I liked about this movie was that it had the "I Love Lucy" feeling, you know the one that went on for like 6 hours and never stopped.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Mulan (1980)   For those of you that have seen the film, you know it is about a young female who is assigned to serve in the army when she is only 12. She discovers she is a half-human half-Siberian princess who has been separated from her parents in the distant past. After getting a little help from her older brother, she is given the opportunity to come home, learn more about her people and learn to be a better person. However, after returning home and being sent off to her father's military academy, Mulan quickly learns she must become a soldier. Mulan has one of the most beautiful voices I've heard in my life, with a strong Eastern Asian accent and she does not hesitate to use it when it's necessary. Mul the Mighty   I can't imagine how Mulan would have fared had she not been cast as the main character. She's so full of life and charm, she's like a little sister to me. The film has no musical numbers (which was unusual at the time) and it is just as well, because Mulan does not need any in order to shine. The story is simple, but a very interesting one and it makes for a good family film, too. Mul-a-Manu-sul is the story of Mulan, the beautiful and brave girl who has learned much more about herself and her people by serving in the Chinese army. I've always found Mulan's story enchanting, even if the whole story makes no sense (which is more a problem with the story than with the film) as it has a good story, but unfortunately there's so much wrong with it. The production values are good, but the story is just plain silly. If I had to sum up Mulan with one word, it would have to be "unoriginal". The only way to truly describe Mulan is "over-produced" and while Mulan did well at the box office, I think the whole production value was far superior to the film. So if you love the story and the voice-acting of Mul-Hsiu, then this is a very good choice. The Mandarin is also quite charming, but it seems to me he was used quite a lot because the Mandarin is the most stereotyped character in Chinese history. I'm not saying the film's story is bad, but for all its faults, the film still has its fans, just

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I can say that this movie is a very good movie and you will enjoy it. The story follows a man who goes to his grave hoping to find the love of his life. The movie's director did a great job and the movie is very much memorable. It's also worth to watch in full high definition. The film was made in 1987 and there were some great special effects. I give the movie a 10/10, very good. The Sound: 4/5. This movie's music was not very good, but I'm not going to complain since it's not good anyway. The special effects are not that spectacular, and the special effects do not match the action well. I am not a fan of the special effect in this movie. The Ending: 4.5/5 I feel like I should not write an ending. The ending in this movies is like I didn't care in the end, I just felt bored with the movie. It does not really matter, because I did not like this movie, and it's an average movie. I think I should let you have your say, my thoughts about the movie were.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why do people watch bad movies? If I had to answer that question, I'd say it's mostly because they don't get what they're watching, and the more they see it, the worse they think of it. However, I believe the real answer is much simpler: "They watch bad because they love it." What they're really saying is that they really want to be entertained, so they're willing to be fooled, even if the illusion of entertainment isn't very good. The film has a bit of this in it, but mostly it has just the barest hint of badness, or so it seems. As with any bad film, you'll find yourself wondering whether it was written well, or just badly written. However when the film begins, you're never sure of anything. The dialogue in this movie is a little odd and it's also the only movie I've seen in which everyone wears white, even though they're all in the desert. There's something about the setting that just works; the desert feels like the most unapproachable place in the world. You can really appreciate the beauty of it, even when the action is pretty low-budget and the production values are even lower. The desert is the most extreme of desert, the most barren. There is a lot of dust, and there's really no wind; it's absolutely silent. It's the ultimate "you can't go home again" environment. I'm not sure how much of a reason it has to be as barren as it is, but I think the people in this film are completely alone, in a place they've never been. And so the film comes to us as something of a romance, with the two protagonists meeting and being led by the hand. It has great dialogue, and you can just feel the desire to understand what's happening. It starts out slow, with nothing to distinguish itself from other films of the same genre. However it picks up pace, slowly, and by the end, it's so intense that it's almost painful. And as a bad romance, it can be really good. I didn't think it would work, but this is a good romance. It doesn't have much sex, but there's enough to keep your interest. There isn't much plot, but it has that "here's some interesting ideas, but they are just tossed at the screen like hot tater tots" feeling that is so important in a bad film. In

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this one last night on a Friday night, which means I was able to see it a day early. I had my wife sit me down on a couch in the basement, we were about 25 minutes into the movie when the screen went white for some reason. I waited about 20 minutes while my wife searched for an off the shelf HDMI cable and a DVI to DVI cable and I got on to my PC. I pulled up the IMDb page and looked at the reviews for this one. There was a lot of positive feedback about how it was a comedy, and a very unique movie for an IMAX 3D movie.  I didn't think anything would be too special about it, but then it was revealed to me by a friend who had seen it a few years back that it actually is about a very special group of people in that group of a theater, and is not just a spoof of an I'm having fun with a movie with an I was surprised to find this very touching movie in this day and age that doesn't care much for any of its tropes and feels the need to have a happy ending to its story. I saw this at a special preview night for the film at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood in February. There is a lot about this movie that I really liked. The acting was a mixture of good and bad, but I felt that the good characters were the ones who I felt were really developed. I would love to see this movie again, but perhaps it won't be this year since this is a very pricey film to produce and distribute.    I haven't seen this movie yet, but this will be one of those movies that has stuck with me for a long time. So sad I'm not going to have the opportunity to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ This movie is pretty good. It's got a lot of heart, and the acting is really good. I liked the story, and it's interesting to me that it was set in Australia, and there was a lot going on in a very small town. However, I found the ending a little rushed, and I found it quite hard to suspend my disbelief enough to buy into the mystery at the end. So, not for the most experienced horror aficionado, but if you're looking for a good "small town mystery" that won't make you scream and jump out of your chair, this is a good place to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** My brother and I had been waiting for this movie for the longest time, I remember that on the day we saw it at his house (he is a very good friend of mine) I was a bit upset that I couldn't play the game with him since the game was supposed to take place about 5 years before the movie. I was disappointed that it was just a video game. But as time went by the longer we waited the more I became interested in the movie and finally we watched it last night with a movie in between. I have to say it was a very interesting movie. It felt as if a big dream come true had happened when the movie was released. It was really awesome to see the movie that many fans were waiting for and I really loved how it is written. The movie really took me by surprise as the game didn't even have a script that was released yet. It seems like the developers themselves wanted to let people know that this wasn't just a game, it's a movie and it was worth watching. If you want to see a movie you can't have in real life then watch The Matrix, if you like a good story, then go watch this movie, and if you have any questions just ask me. Overall a very enjoyable movie and I recommend it to all people.

As far as the actual making of the movie, we had a great time. A number of the film's ideas were our own, and several were taken from existing science fiction or horror films. We also had the pleasure of working with several actors, writers and directors who are all equally deserving of the title of "Fantastic Four" fan. The special effects team and stunt man were also very impressive. We hope everyone has as much fun watching the movie as we did making it. Thank you for watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ In any case, I am just here to say I am very happy with the movie. It is an excellent example of film. In my view the greatest Hollywood movie. The only problem is that there are quite a lot of bad pictures in this movie. There is too much "bad" in this film and I don't like it. This film is an amazing masterpiece and it should be seen by everyone who loves movies. The film is about a movie star who starts to die and then is brought back by his friend. He is then forced to work in a bar and is forced to watch all the dirty acts of women. It's a movie of sex, drugs, sex, sex and more sex. The movie is a big hit with audiences and the producers knew that so they created it. The characters are not realistic or complex but they are very funny, well acted and are all very well made. I give this a 9 and I have never seen a movie that was more entertaining, more intelligent and more intelligent, in my view, than this film. I recommend everyone to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* The film's biggest strength is the acting. Noir fans have waited for years for a good, authentic take on the character. It's not all that long and so far, the acting is strong and believable. However, it's not the most interesting part. That's Detective Hagen's (Alfred Molina) performance. As the new police chief in the big city of Los Angeles, he is a rookie, but that doesn't mean he isn't smart. His skills are well developed and he can be relied on to use them. It helps that he's also an experienced cop, having been a police officer in New York City and Los Angeles. There is a bit of a 'narrative' element, which is very welcome, but there are elements that would be better handled without it. It works when the film's good acting, characterisation and acting work, but the film can be a bit predictable when the plot or dialogue are at odds with the characters' actions. That said, this movie is one of the best-written films of the year, and it's well worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ What do you think of this film? __________________________________________________ I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan of the movies from the 90's and I think it is great. I think they are better than the original and in my opinion the story was more enjoyable. I do not think the movie would have worked if it was a direct sequel but it worked by having so many other characters to play with, they were in the same boat and they all have their own little things to worry about. The director could do a lot better than he does in the music but I thought the music was good. I could not tell what was happening to the character in the movie or if they were dead or alive until I saw it in the theater. A lot of the time it just showed pictures on the screen and I did not know what to do with the picture. But the movie was worth watching and if it wasn't for the music I would have given it a 10/10. I'm giving it a 8.5 out of 10 for a movie that you can see anywhere with 3 or 4 people, it is a good way to start a movie night out. And the film was fun. Thanks for reading.

There are alot of twists in this movie, so if you are a fan of supernatural films, then this is a must see! The only complaint I have is that there was no dialogue on some of the scenes, but I believe that this was done in order to fit in the time restraints of the story, so no one is going to know what is going on! If you enjoy seeing blood and gore, then you will LOVE this movie. This is not a good horror movie, but a great horror movie! If anything, this movie will make you laugh out loud, and then scream, when the final monster is coming for you! Highly Recommended!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Girl Next Door " is an interesting look at a girl and her father. The movie is based on a true story about a 13 year old who goes to visit her father on the day of his wedding. As the story goes, her father is a very private guy and won't even go to his own wedding. Her mother is the same way. The father then tries to get her to go but she won't let him. The rest of the movie is about their struggles. Their relationship is not really good and it all comes from the father. It's all very interesting stuff but not really something that will keep you watching. It would be fun to see it again and again, but it probably won't hold a lot of interest. Grade: D- " The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo " is the third movie in the "Munich" series. It has a lot in common with the previous movies. As a director, it's J. Michael Straczynski. He had the first movie, " Eragon," which won several awards and went on to be a very good movie, but the second, " The Lovely Bones," isn't really his best work. He took the film down a few notches in this movie. It looks better than the two earlier movies, but that isn't saying much. The story is pretty generic and there are some elements of the Dresden Files in there. It does have its share of great action scenes. They are quite good though, and we get to see a more sympathetic side of Lisbeth Salander. It was another nice film to look at from Straczynszky. It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but still pretty good. He's still a very capable director, and I think it's an excellent film.

What's great about this film, is that despite all of the love it gets, its not just a love tale.    It's about two people finding out that they are meant for each other, which is what makes the film so special.  If you're looking for a love letter to the 90's, then "Rides Along" is definitely worth a watch, however if you are looking for something new, then this film will not satisfy you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film about a woman who is trying to help her brother to move out from his alcoholic mother's house. She is trying with the help of a family friend to make sure that the man does not return to his mother. It is a very interesting film with many interesting ideas. "I don't like you. I don't trust you. You are not your own man. And I don�t love you". - the brother about his mother, who has died after a long illness. He feels that he is an abandoned little brother in his mother's life. She has abandoned him a long time ago. It was her husband that raised her, his mother was a cruel person, and her husband was an alcoholic. This is what drove her into the life of the drunk. Now that she has died he feels abandoned. And she has not been his mother for a very long time. He is just like her son and just like his mother is the father of his son. He just feels that the two of them are not his parents anymore. He finds it sad that he has no mother. So he tries to make her life better and better. He tries to fix her problems, trying to change the alcoholic in her. He wants her to come back. He does not like being alone. When he meets the girl who is staying in the house with her mother he thinks that she is his mother and then it becomes complicated. What I like about the film: Very interesting story and it deals with the different elements of human life. The brother and his new girlfriend are very important characters in this film. The film deals with all the elements of the human life - the good and the bad. The emotions and feelings of the brother and the girl. It deals with several topics of life - love, relationships, family, etc. The story is interesting. The ending is very sad. The story is also very emotional but the way they portray the characters. They have very different and real feelings. There are many good and bad things to the characters in the film. It does not have a happy ending but it does have a good ending. And the ending is not sad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Sick" is a beautiful film about a single mom and her three young children. As the title says it follows the life of Kumail Nanjiani and the life changes he undergoes in the span of just one night. The film is based off a screenplay by the director himself and star Emily V. Gordon. "The Big Gay Sketch Show" is about the struggles of a young man named Sam, who struggles with having no one to do his work for him. The comedy is very well made with amazing performances all around. I found it a little hard to watch at first but after the first few minutes I found the humor funny and I loved it a lot. "Get Out" is an amazingly well made film. You can not tell the difference between the director, writer, actors and the camera crew. The only thing that was a little off with this film was the pacing, it felt rushed as if the director was just wanting to show the first half of the film. The cast was really good with each having their own strong qualities. The writing is strong with a great performance by Daniel Kaluuya and the story is well told and well paced. I have to mention that the ending of the movie is pretty awful but the ending to the first act of the second half of "Get out" was amazing. "Kinky Boots" is one of those horror films that I think most people think "it's a horror movie" but I feel like most of the people who saw it are totally different than what I think about this film. This movie is not scary at all, it is just so strange and funny, it makes me think that maybe the writer and director didn't want to scare the audience. "Crazy Rich Asians" is another movie that is great. There are some interesting jokes about Chinese people that were funny to me. The director of the comedy is Adam Wingard and he is very funny and great to watch. "All Eyez on Me" is the sequel to this movie, and I feel as if it has a better ending than the first one. "I'm Not There" is just an amazing movie. This is a great character study that really showed how a character changes over the course of a year. The performances are fantastic in this movie and it feels like an episode of "My Name is Earl." "This is Not a Film" is like the horror comedy "The Bling Ring," "The Ring" is very enjoyable and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Dear Mr. Nolan: I wanted to thank you for choosing to film "Inception" in Australia, as I have not seen an American movie with such incredible effects and use of technology, and I would also like to congratulate your team on the wonderful job of getting the Australian cast. I was impressed with the Australian accent of the main character, Mr. Finch (Domhnall Gleeson) and I am a big fan of his, and even though the movie was well written I found it a little repetitive, and the ending was a bit too much for me. I hope that in the next film you will have someone who can really pull of an Australian accent, because I think that would add a lot to the character of Mr. Batman. My favourite scenes of the movie were the last ones, when we see Mr. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) with Mr. Miranda (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Mr. Cobb (John Krasinski), and I just enjoyed watching these three characters interacting as we see all the layers of their personalities. The casting was excellent and the story was very believable. I would love to see a few more of these characters in your movies, such as Mr. Alfred Pennyworth (Brendan Gleeson), Mr. Gordon (Jesse Eisenberg) and Dr. Harvey Dent (Michael Caine) etc. I really enjoyed watching it, and it really impressed me as being such an amazing film with great effects, and great characters that the audience will get to see and have fun with. Your choice to film in Australia has allowed us to see some of the most exciting movies made in the last 20 years. Thank you very much for giving your audiences something new to look forward to. I wish you all the best of luck with the rest of your filmography, and if you have any further comment, please feel free to contact me. Best wishes, ___________  If it wasn't so obvious, the comments section in the email is pretty brutal. A few people mention that the movie is great, and that it doesn't take itself too seriously. But the vast majority of the responses are a mix of praise, rage, and condescension. Many of these are the typical Nolan-y comments about "not making the audience feel anything," and "being more realistic." "In fact," one commenter writes, "I would take the time to learn a little bit more about the history of cinema to get a better understanding of your choice

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It has so much potential and can be an awesome movie if the people behind it know what they are doing. This is the first movie I have seen that was not in my top 10 list of movies to watch. But it definitely deserves to be in the top 5, or even the top 10. It does get a little slow at points but it still has some great moments and it will keep you interested. It is also worth noting that it has some fantastic special effects, especially the monster making stuff look really real. I could not put this movie down and it was a great way to start the new year. You can get this movie for about 20 bucks online and it is definitely worth it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It's the story of how an average guy discovers his ability to teleport a huge chunk of the planet to wherever he wants. It's a little silly, but this movie has a lot of clever ideas about how to play on your instincts. It also has a hilarious plot that is easy to relate to. And it's really hard to find anything wrong with it. If you're looking for a really good science fiction movie then you should probably go see this one. The plot is fairly simple and I don't want to say much about it because it would be spoilery for some. It does, however, have some good character development and the effects are really well done. _____________

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I don't think the trailer was enough to show this movie    The first thing that caught my eye was that it was a romantic comedy. What the hell is that? I guess I have been spoiled by the romance in the past. Also the director of the movie is the same guy who did the "How to make a girl fall in love with you". And here I was excited because he was the one that gave me that movie. The movie really starts out slow but I kept expecting the pace to pick up a lot. It just didn't happen. I was a little worried about the ending though. Maybe it was too soon for a happy ending. I know how much people want their endings to come quickly and the last half of the story was pretty depressing. But I guess that was because I had seen too many movies where this kind of thing happens and it just makes the whole thing sad.  A very sweet movie about a guy (Gretchen Wieners) and his best friend (John Cusack) and the fact that they are both in love. The main point of the romance was when Gretchen finally got to know John Cusacks body after they were separated for almost 2 months.  I thought that the scene at the end was nice. I think it was really sweet. The second half is about a family holiday. There were a lot of little scenes but I think the best scenes were when John Cussack and Gretchen were talking in the kitchen, which was the first time I saw the two of them. I like the way they handled the whole scene in the diner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of the Worst" (2011) is a film that will certainly keep you coming back for more. This movie was about the aftermath of a fatal car accident and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation was still taking place in the immediate aftermath of the crash, police officer Frank Ruddy (Michael Keaton) and his partner Detective Bob Smith (John Turturro) arrive on the scene. Ruddy is initially reluctant to join Smith's team, as his own son was in the car that crashed and had not survived. Smith's partner, Det. Ed Brubaker (Peter Coyote) is equally opposed to joining Ruddy's team. When both teams discover evidence to the contrary, it quickly turns into a firefight that turns the tables. In the course of the film, we get to witness the incredible physicality of one of the greatest action heroes of all time. In fact, we don't get to see much of Ruddy until the film's final third. When Ruddy finally appears on-screen, he is dressed as a police officer, complete with police uniform, tactical vest, gun, and radio. In addition to the physicality, he has the emotional strength and focus of a saint. I was very impressed by the physical aspects of this movie, even though we have some of the worst acting in cinema history, with Turtorro being one of my least favorite actors in recent memory. I had high hopes for this film. This film was originally created for the American television series The Untouchables. When that series was cancelled in 1993, the film was adapted into an hour-long special. Despite the fact that we are not given a chance to see what Ruddy and Brubakers are doing the whole time, there is enough information presented to make it very clear that they are working to find out who caused the accident, and not who is at fault. This does not make the film perfect, but I can't say I wasn't impressed. There are also some other elements that I would like to see adapted into other action films. The scene with the police car with the body in it and the "dead" car being towed from the crime scene is one of those scenes that has become very well known in recent years. This scene really takes the character of Frank Ritchie and makes him something very special. It also adds a bit of mystery to the film. It would have been nice to see a more involved investigation in the film
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Starring: _____________________________________________________________ Aaron Eckhart (Jason Statham) is a mercenary who is hired to steal a very important item from a Russian billionaire, Alexander Skarsgård (Alfie Allen). Skarsgard gives him two choices: 1. To deliver the item on time to his employer's safe. 2. To take the item in his car and drive off with it. Skarsgrod is afraid that his boss is going to take offense and kill him if he refuses. The only thing that stops Skarsgrord from killing Aaron is his girlfriend, Elle Fanning, who is going out with a much older gentleman named Sean Connery. It's very confusing when a "cool" man (like Skars grander), is willing to kill a good-looking man like Aaron. In the movie it's mostly a mystery as to why Aaron, Elen, and Sean Conner (Elle's boyfriend) end up in Moscow together. Aaron wants to be famous, but Elen doesn't and she doesn't want him to either. Sean is a man with a good job, but his girlfriend is in love with someone else, and she'll never be happy with him. Both Aaron and Elen try to talk the other out of what they're doing, but they both feel they have to do it, or die trying. I don't think either of them realize how dangerous this plan is. It gets very confusing, especially the first half of the movie. It also takes a lot of time for us to really get to know Elen's character and find out why she does what she does. Even though the story is confusing, it's still very enjoyable, and if you're a fan of Jason Statham movies, you'll like this one. The acting is very good here, and Aaron Eckharts chemistry with Alfie Allen is also really great. It doesn't really get better in the second half of this film. __________ Aaron Eckhart is a fun, sexy, and extremely charismatic character. He can't help himself from being cool, and he's got the body of a wrestler, the wit of a comedian, and the acting talent of an action star. There are some problems with the plot here. This movie is more about the movie, and less about the story. There's no real reason why they have all these characters together, and in a good way, so I can understand why some people

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I enjoyed the film. Very good action with a good storyline. I liked the fact that they are all working together for the betterment of mankind, they're all on the same team and have the same goals. There's the whole idea of the alien ship being behind the attacks on the earth to make people think that aliens are out there. It's pretty cool. I guess I liked it because of it's action scenes and the fact it is a sci-fi film and not just a action movie. If you like sci-fis with action sequences, then this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In his first year as president, Eisenhower had a hard time getting a budget passed; however, he continued to use the press as his personal weapon. During the summer of 1957, he ordered that news stories about his administration be printed under his signature. Eisenhower wanted the world to know he was doing his job, not that he was being helped by the press. " The CIA's Operation Mockingbird is the first in a series of stories that will describe how the intelligence agencies of the United States attempted to manipulate the news media. For several years after the Cold War ended, journalists were required to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDA), which prevented them from publishing stories or interviewing sources who had access to information that they could be prosecuted for disclosing. The NDA made journalists nervous. In 1958, an internal CIA memo reported that "a complete media blackout would not only be embarrassing to the CIA, it would also be unwise. The Agency is constantly under attack from the American public. For the country's safety, its intelligence operations should not be exposed to the world. " But this "blackout" was no longer necessary. The CIA had been given a budget of $3 million for each of its five "screens" for domestic news coverage. It had also been given the legal authority to "take the bull by the horns" and "create the news." This included using journalists to plant stories and "give the president an 'on the one hand, on the other hand' look." According to author Philip Agee, "The CIA was able to put reporters at work and get the stories they wanted in the newspapers and magazines, no matter how embarrassing they found them." As part of Operation MOCKINGBIRD, the CIA infiltrated the staffs of some of the country newspapers. It then created "journalist's notebooks" that the journalists could turn over to the agency after publication, so that the CIA could check up on their sources and follow up with them. CIA officers would often write down the news they wanted to publish and the reporters would run with it without verifying its accuracy. They also wrote down any information the CIA wanted them to keep confidential, such as the names of government officials that the reporters thought might be sources for their stories. CIA documents show that in the early 1950s, the agency started to use journalists as "patsies," providing them with "canned" stories and then having them write up stories that portrayed the agency in a good light.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of both Worlds" Synopsis: An alien invasion force is threatening the Earth and it's up to Captain Jack Harkness (David Tennant) and the other crew members on the planet Harmony to prevent the planet from becoming a planet of the dead. Analysis: The story and the dialogue were really well put together and this story was a lot of fun to watch. It was a really different kind of story for David Tennant, who was only playing a couple of characters here. I thought it was a very original story and I liked how David Tennancy didn't just play a straight man but was very much in the moment as he was trying to figure out what to do with his crew. I think this is going to be the best part of his acting career. One thing that I thought was a bit silly was that after all the trouble the crew was going through, they managed to figure a way to make a spaceship (with an oxygen tank) go back to Harmony. Another thing I thought to be a bit annoying was the fact that the aliens were a lot more smart than the humans. They also had weapons that could kill human beings, which would make it a lot easier for them to destroy Earth. The other good thing about this film was the way in which it was shot. The movie was shot in 3.35:1 with the standard 35mm cameras. This is really good for a science fiction film. It makes the science fiction look really natural and realistic. It also allows the director and the actors to play the scene really fast because there are very few takes. This movie was also a great sci-fi action film with a great cast of actors. It's definitely a great action film that takes a great amount of humor out of the movie. I thought it's a great space adventure movie, which is what the science fantasy genre is all about. It had a really funny script that had a lot to say and I really liked it. This movie also shows how the cast is developing and improving as a group. 5 out of 5 For more from the great cast and crew of "Doctor Who" check out my post here: "Doctor What?"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid sequel, if nothing else, to the excellent sci-fi thriller, "Alien."   The same cast are on top form, as they did in "Alien" - and the film plays like a good old fashioned science fiction thriller, but one that doesn't feel like it's trying to be anything more than that.   The cast is pretty good, too, and the director has the skill and imagination to keep this one from being a complete waste of time.   While it has a strong story, I'd like to see more of the "aliens" and their planet as I've seen a couple of the aliens that don't get a lot of screen time. It's worth a watch, but the final act is one-note.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "All the people who are offended by my saying all this stuff are just a bunch of bigoted bigots who think everyone is equal and can have all the opinions they want. I think if I have to spend my money and time and life on making a film, to piss off these bigots is a waste of time and money. I have a lot of respect for everyone and all beliefs, but it doesn't make any difference if they believe in what I believe or not. I am a good person, and I want everyone to know that." The Good: This is the first film I watched that wasn't a comedy. I'm not big on comedies, especially with the exception of some of the Disney films like Beauty and the Beast. But if the film was any more fun to watch it would have been a comedy and it definitely wasn't. It is also the first time I was able to say, "Wow! That was a good acting performance". In all honesty I was so impressed that I didn't even recognize the people I was with at that time. The film was funny and was fun to sit through. The only thing I really didn't like about the film, was the ending. It was very cheap. As a person who has seen the "Frozen" series many times and loved each and every film I was expecting a bit more. I thought that I would be able to find something in the movie that was different, but what I got was just a boring story. I would have preferred to see it with more of a twist and ending. The Bad: I feel like I have gone on a lot about this film. If you don't know, here's my review for the second film "Moana" (another Disney movie). I really do love both of these films and the fact that they have changed the animation style has made it way better. I've never really been a big fan of animated films but I think it's because the characters don't look real to me. But "Moai" did the character designs and animation really well. This film was also the best Disney movie I've ever seen. I was very impressed by the songs, the visual effects and the action. The voice cast is also good and I really enjoyed the banter. Overall I think this is the best film Disney has produced. The bad is that I was disappointed when I saw the ending because I thought it was something that they should have changed. The good:

I was a little bit worried about the story since it was so fast and furious. But it is good enough. It's not too slow either. It does have a lot of violence, but that's to be expected from a story where the killer can be called a ghost. But that doesn't mean it's too depressing. Instead it's very uplifting and entertaining. The ending is satisfying and surprising for the reader. I wouldn't change the plot, because it's a good one. But, since there were so many aspects of the plot that you wouldn't expect, I felt that it needed a little more time to be fleshed out, like the other stories in the collection.

Overall, this is just another one of those movies that is too long to watch in one sitting and is really depressing. The plot is also very cliche.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I was in a dark mood the night I watched this movie. I don't know why. It was not a very interesting movie at all. I felt as if the director wanted us to think of the movie as something out of the "War of the Worlds" books. The "experimental" way of filming was probably the main reason I liked it. At the beginning, everything is black. The camera is just a few inches from the camera person's face. At some points, a bright light is put on the camera. It makes us feel as if we are in the dark. It almost feels like a film noir style of film. The lights go out and there is an eerie sound of a generator. Then the lights come on, and we start to see some people in the foreground. They are wearing clothes that are not the typical clothes that were worn in those days. The people in front of us were wearing hats with no hats. They were wearing the same clothes that we were wearing, which are a little more expensive. The movie made the viewer feel that it was not the world of people who lived during the first two days of December that we are used to, but the world that we would have lived during those dark times. The characters were very small and made no sense at all, so you don't get attached to anyone, even though the film does say that some of them survived. The ending is what I call a "one in a million" ending, but there is something else about it. The fact that the people who survived were the kind that you might know, made me feel that we could make a new world, but it is not like in the movies. It will be very hard to make a real world with the new technology we have today. I thought that was a cool way of telling the story, which, in the end, didn't satisfy me. I like the idea of making a world, in fact, we are going to make one in this movie, but I'm not sure it is something we can make a reality. We are going too far. It has the feeling of a movie with no plot. I have seen that movie, and it had the same kind of feeling as this. I would rather watch the film in the theatre, rather than on a computer. I liked the movie, not because it was good or bad, but because it is a good way to reflect a movie that was made in the 1920's

One of the best movies I saw this year. I would like to see a movie with even more action. The actors all had a great character. I love that they were not really actors, they were just real people, and people with a good heart. I think that it's too bad that there are no sequels. It would have been great to see the brothers in the big movies. The movie doesn't have anything for me. The acting is good, but I can't think of anything that really stands out. It is a pretty well made movie with good characters. The only problem is that it doesn't stand out from the other movie that it is a sequel to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There are many things about "Frozen" that are not to be found in its own story line. But it is not just that; it is that the film is a beautiful, moving, magical story told with the grace and beauty of music that should be appreciated." "Frozen," directed by Chris Buck, features the voices of Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel. They are best friends (the film opens with an awkward hug between the two) and are part of a family of nine. Their mother, Elsa (Bell), is a princess who lives in Arendelle, a fairy-tale-like kingdom. She is the daughter of the king and queen of the land of the same name, and is the heir to the throne. But Elsa is also a terrible cook who doesn't want her sister Anna (Menzel) to inherit the throne, and she is a tyrannical ruler. The family lives in a castle called the palace. It has many turrets and towers, as well as a huge ice palace that seems to be built on top of the ground. The prince, Kristoff (voiced by Josh Gad), and his friends, Sven (voices of Jonathan Groff and Idris Elba), Olaf (voice of Chris Buck), and Olaf's dog, Svengali (voiceles of Billy Eichner and Robert Lopez), come to the castle to ask for help saving their kingdom from a terrible ice monster named Olaf. The film was released in December. It stars Michael Giacchino, Josh Gad, Idina Manzel, and Kristen Bell. The film will be released in 3D on December 23. I'm excited for this film and can't wait for it to come out. This film will keep you warm this winter. It is a fun movie and the soundtrack is amazing! The film is written by Jennifer Lee. I was thrilled to get a sneak peek at Frozen and I am really looking forward to this film. The trailer does an amazing job of getting the characters, the setting, and the story all in one shot. I loved the way it starts off. You start to see Elsa's room at the palace and you get a glimpse into the past and then you see Elsa in the present. Anna is the main character in the film and she makes a lot of appearances throughout the movie. She's a very different character from Elsa, the way that she dresses and how she talks.

A solid and enjoyable movie that really gets the story across with a couple of nice bits of humor. Plus, a solid supporting cast including some memorable character actors. I hope it's made available on DVD someday and will absolutely rent this from my local video store. I give it four out of five stars.  Comments: Added by John "The Movie Guy" P.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have no problem with this film, it's really entertaining and I found myself laughing my ass off throughout.  The story is pretty straight forward, but the way it was told really pulled my heart strings at certain points and made me laugh, it didn't take long for me to get caught up in the story.  I know some people find this type of thing a bit sacrilegious to watch, but I find it to be really well acted and even funny at certain times, you would be hard pressed to find a better performance out of anyone in this film.  One thing I really appreciated was the fact that they don't go for the usual "witty banter" and instead go for a more serious tone, which I think works really well in this story.  The best way I can describe it is that it is like a modern day version of The Black Stallion.  The story of the film follows a young man who has just arrived in an unknown town and is unsure of everything around him.  It's not long before his first friend, whom he only knows from the stories they have heard around the campfire, gives him the opportunity to prove his bravery.  After a long and difficult battle the boy emerges victorious and makes friends with a group of boys.  They quickly learn that they are the new pack leader and are quickly thrown into action for the greater good of the camp.  However, while things are going well the young boy is slowly going mad and is left to his own devices.  Slowly things become more and more dark and scary as the boy tries to find his way back home.  Eventually he begins to believe that he is a demon who has been left to wander the world with the sole purpose of tormenting everyone who finds him.  As the film progresses and the story progresses, it is easy to see what the film was trying to accomplish.  Not only does it try and tell a story, but it tries to get your emotions stirred up by the characters and events that take place.  When you are watching this film you will feel everything going on, which is one of the reasons I really enjoyed it.  You will be left wanting more and this film doesn't disappoint.  There are times when you think you know what is going to happen but the film gives you the time to think things over and I think that is where the film really shines.  If you are a fan of ghost stories, this film is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fantastic remake of the classic film. The new director does a great job with the remake and the story is amazing. The main character is a boy with a special ability that allows him to control the weather. This special ability gets him into trouble though and he ends up trying to save the girl that he loves from the monsters. The film does have a few problems though. The first problem I had was that I kept thinking that they were just trying to shoehorn a supernatural element into the story. It does not come out in a nice way and it would have been nice if they had shown something other than the supernatural. The second problem I have with the film was the acting. There were many times when I did not understand who was who and who was acting who. I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever enjoyed a horror movie.

This movie has it all- romance, magic, monsters, dragons, and the story is set in a world where humans and animals live in harmony. The main character is a boy named Noah and he is a human boy who finds out that he is actually a fairy. The girl is called the Sorceress and she is in love with Noah and she becomes his mentor in order to help him defeat the dragon called the Kraken. The movie does a very good job of telling a story that is very unique and well told, The art is beautiful, the music is very memorable and the romance that is depicted on screen is very very well done. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes fairy tales and wants to see the original work of Maurice Sendek as well as to kids and adults who like fantasy stories, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch. I gave this film a 10 because it was very well made, it's very unique in that it is based on a book, it is set inside a fairy story, it was written by a man named Sendak, and it does an excellent job of creating a fairytale that people will enjoy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Blessed are the peacemakers.  Pamela Adlon's film is a true love story, as much a love letter to love as it is to the movies of its genre.  The film opens on an empty cinema screen, with an aging movie star (Brett Dalton) watching over his daughter, (Cate Blanchett), a teenage model who has been chosen to star in her father's latest film.  They've found themselves on the same screen, but the daughter's star has been overshadowed by her father-in-law, played by Colin Farrell.  As the opening credits reveal, the film's hero, Colin Farrell, (who is played by a very young Colin Farrell) is also her father, but because the daughter is the product of a troubled marriage, the daughter doesn't know this.   But Colin's estranged wife (Judi Dench), played by Blanche, wants Colin's attention back.  Colin, on the other hand, is a reluctant movie star, as a result of his long-term relationship with his wife and their daughter.  It's a good story, and Adlon does a very good job of making the audience care about both the story's characters and the film itself.   It starts off with some pretty simple scenes, with the couple just chatting, Colin having a glass of wine, while her father enjoys the view.   Unfortunately, nothing in the film is as simple, or as good as the opening.  First of all, the relationship between Colin and his daughter (at this point it is an established fact, so you know she's the movie star's daughter and it will be a constant) is very one-sided, with Colin treating his daughter very little better than an appendage.  Second of all though, it is the film that takes the lead.  There is a long conversation between the two characters, during which Colin tries to impress his daughter with various bits of acting he has done, all of which are completely terrible, to the point where they make me feel uncomfortable for the rest of the film.     The relationship between the film star and her daughter, or even better, her ex-husband, is not explored, but it's clear that Colin and the daughter have a troubled relationship.  A few scenes, but some of them are just too stupid to even be funny.  I thought the film was very interesting, but nothing special.  After
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my first horror movie. I was actually quite scared at first, but it made me laugh really hard. There is not much violence. The story is about an elderly man who gets a new neighbor. The neighbor has the power of telekinesis. The first scene was a nice one with a house where you see the old man and the woman. The next scene had a monster coming to destroy them. The old man uses his powers to create some nice shots, and I actually liked the old lady. I didn't really know her. I thought she would have been very boring to watch. But she had a funny personality, and she was very sweet. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It wasn't perfect and I expected it to be. I think it would have made a good comedy. I liked how it got the old woman, because it didn't have to follow the whole old man story. I wasn't really sure how the film would end, but I was glad that it ended happily.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   This is a story about how I met a girl who was born and raised in Thailand but now lives in Paris. She's a beautiful person and she's smart as a whip. She has a great sense of humor.   She's only 17 and we met at the age of 15 in our school. She was so gorgeous and I had a crush on her. We spent most of our time together because the class would come and hang out. She always seemed to be studying, which I felt was a good sign because I thought she was pretty intelligent. But I was too shy to ask her to go on a date with me.   that's when I knew that this girl was something special.   it was like the first time that I had seen something beautiful. She had a heart of gold and I didn't want her to give up on me. I wanted to know more about her and how we connected. I was very lucky to find her because when she went to Paris for the first and only time, she left me alone on the beach with the other girls. And I felt so alone and left. The following week, I got a text message saying that her mom was out of town. And as soon as I read the text, I felt relieved. I figured it must have been a mistake. But she texted me back, saying that they had been watching some movie and were too tired to go see a movie at her favorite theater. I thought that this must have happened for the second time that day. She said that she would come to Paris tomorrow night with my brother and we could go see the movie together. So I said yes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the more interesting movies to be released since the release of The Terminator, and it's good. I just found it to be a very entertaining movie that did its job in terms of making you feel all the different emotions you'd expect from a dystopian future. A lot of people complain about the acting, which for me was just OK. I did enjoy a good amount of the characters, and the actors did their jobs well, but it was really the story and the way the actors were chosen that made this an interesting movie, and not just a good one. I was surprised to see how little action there was in this movie, but that just made the movie all the better. Also, if you watch it in 2.35 or 3.1 surround, you might get bored.

It's as close to a classic action movie as you can get right now. It is also quite funny in the right places. You know it's a film you have to see. You won't be able to look away from it.  This is based on the best-selling book by the same name. It chronicles the early years of Bill Paxton as he deals with an alcoholic father who refuses to admit that the family is struggling financially and that Paxton is not up to the job. When a local gang tries to rob Paxton's farm and the farmer's wife is murdered, it turns out that Paxtons' father-in-law was a secret member of the "Crazy 14". It seems as if everyone and their mother is involved in this gang, but then he finds out that his father in law was part of the group who killed his wife.  that's the bad news, the good news is that Paets' father in-law has a wife named Rose who he is forced to leave because he is unable to provide for her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been waiting a few weeks for this movie to come out so I could watch it again. I was quite disappointed by the first but once the story moved on I was hooked and I was hoping for a sequel. The story about the three best friends is not a bad one but the two who got together early on and the middle girl is just a bit more dull and I thought the ending was a bit disappointing. I had expected a bit of a comedy with some fun action but I think the action is overplayed and the comedy seems to be the same as the first movie.  But that isn't really a bad thing because the first two movies were both good.

It's like the film's a little man, a sort of mischievous boy who thinks of mischief but doesn't really do it, and when he does he comes up with some ingenious plots.

It will be a wonderful occasion, they're all waiting, the guests are all standing and waiting. A little boy is sitting in the front row and watching his father's performance. He doesn't look very pleased but the audience is delighted, the people watching are happy, the beautiful woman is delighted.

But soon the alien crew begin to take over. It's up to the Nostroman (Vin Diesel) to turn things around and get the Nostomos back on track. Now with director Gerard Barrett on board, this adaptation will not only make history as the first-ever Star Wars feature to have a female lead, but also become one of the biggest grossing sci-fi movies ever made, with a staggering $460 million worldwide box office. How did it do? Star Wars - the Original Trilogy by Matthew Stover A comprehensive review. (12/27/2006) Star Wars is, without a doubt, the most important film in the franchise. While there were plenty of films before it, including the original trilogy, there is no question that it's one of, if not the best, in the entire Star Wars universe. One of the reasons that is the case is because of its innovative plot structure that is based around the classic trilogy, while taking some liberties with canon. I will talk about the three films in chronological order. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope Star Wars was released on May 25th, 1977 and starred Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Peter Cushing, Carrie McCoulland, and Kenny Baker. Episode IV, like its predecessors, begins on a galactic ship. After being abandoned by the crew, the Nostro's crew is confronted by the evil Wampa, a giant furry, fur covered creature that only appears when evil is in the air. After a tense standoff with the Wampa the Nostrains escape into hyperspace, where they find themselves caught in the middle of a deadly, galactic conflict between two warring races. With the Galactic Empire and the Rebels, the two groups fight to determine which of them is the most evil. In the end, the Rebels win out and the Empire is forced to retreat, but not before the Death Star is destroyed, and the Alliance is victorious. Star wars - Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Episode V, released in 1980, was a sequel to Episode IV. When Luke Skywalker finds himself stranded on a desert planet with a talking Wampa in tow

This brings him great happiness, but the trouble begins when Vijay's cousin, Raghu (played in a charmingly seductive way by Deepali Arora), becomes interested in Aamiri. He has an affair with her, and Aamri is heartbroken.  In the film, the three actors deliver an uncharacteristic amount of good chemistry. Ajay delivers a convincing performance as Vijay. Raghuvanshi Kapoor and Deepali, who both have a big presence, also do their share to keep things interesting. As the film's heroine, Padukoni seems to have found the perfect formula. She is very attractive and the way she wears her hair, as well as her sari and the casual way she sits, makes her seem fresh and new. The plot is a well written one with several surprises as well.  in the beginning, all the characters act in a manner that may be a little annoying for the viewers at first, but after a few scenes, the viewers get used to it. While the plot itself is predictable, the way the characters behave and react to each other, their interactions with each other and their characters' relationships with each others, as a whole, is always entertaining and engaging. The movie has an intriguing sub plot, too, and a few unexpected and funny moments. The actors are just as good as the others, and the music by Mani Kaul's tunes and the score by Ritwik Ghatak are also top notch. There is a lot of good stuff to enjoy here. : R.H.S Rajamouli's 'PK' is definitely a good watch and one that's not to be missed. The film's plot is quite straightforward but it keeps it interesting and engaging by throwing in some new twists

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The movie is not really a comedy, nor is it a drama. It is a dark story, as is it should be. There are very few scenes, as well as characters, that don't have some form of conflict. It all comes together, and becomes one big movie. What keeps the story from getting any better is the story being told. There is a lot of symbolism and symbolism is a great way of showing how things are, but it just doesn't work in the plot. The movie would have been a little better if the people that are doing the story weren't so much an afterthought as a plot device. It does not get any better. The only real change in the story is that it is about a girl named Emma (Ishka), who is a little troubled. She is a girl that has seen it all, and she knows how to handle things. I think that the real problem of the movie, the story it trying to tell, is the character of Emma. She gets a bit of a change in personality, and her past is laid out for the reader to decide, but there isn't much to her past. It doesn't have any real impact on the story. The plot keeps getting interrupted by the characters going to school, going to parties, getting ready for a fight. The characters themselves are not very interesting. The male character is a bit too loud and he seems to have a lot going on in his life that is getting in the way of him and Emma. The female character is an interesting girl, but she is only there because the male character has to be, and even then, there is not much to say about her. As for the actual story, it starts off strong with a story about a boy who wants to start an academy, but can't find anybody willing to do it. He is a pretty quiet guy, and he is the one that helps Emma figure out the secret of life, and how the universe works. He takes a good care of Emma as she develops, and eventually, she figures out that the reason she has the talent is because of what he did for her. She then decides to use the talent to become the next leader of the academy. That is where the movie becomes a little difficult. The other characters don't really have anything to do with the story, and it is not until the film that they really start to get any focus. They don't even really have any development, and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this one, the story revolves around an orphaned boy named Kip (O'Mara) who is taken in by a bunch of eccentric characters and taken on a wild ride in a race that is actually set in a train. The movie doesn't focus so much on the events that happened in the train as it does about the people who were there, the people Kip runs into along the way, and about Kip's family. I like the way the movie explores this idea of a place in a world and how people get lost in it, and how different places have different experiences and stories. The music and sound design are fantastic, especially for a movie of this kind.  The movie also features a great soundtrack, featuring a bunch tracks from songs I have been wanting to hear for years, as well as a couple original songs.  O'Mahony is absolutely great in this movie.  A very emotional movie that also does not let you forget that it is based on a book.  I think people should watch this movie for those who like stories about the underdog.

Harris (Farewell, My Lovely) and stars Patrick Wilson as a former Special Forces warrior whose brainwashed girlfriend is looking for the guy who killed her ex-boyfriend and turned into a mutant. Harris also co-wrote the script. The story centers around his attempts to rescue his girlfriend from her captor.  After a lengthy search and the help of his former comrades, the soldier finds her and he and his daughter begin to explore her world of dreams and reality as they go on a quest to find her parents and a way out of the dream.  the cast is a wonderful mix of strong performances, excellent performances, and some really good moments between the two of them as if they were a couple. - - - -  This film was an awesome movie, there was just one small problem that kept me from giving it a five-star review, however, this is something you have to experience yourself. The problem was the fact that the film was so hard to watch, the story had just enough twists and turns but not enough to keep us interested. The film had so much more potential for being a great movie, instead, it was ruined by a very obvious and very obvious cut-scene that left me with the feeling that this film was a piece of sh-t. We start the movie off with a young man who is just a baby. He is found by a mother who believes she is his mother and then begins to realize how strange he is and how he does not like to be held. She takes him to see a nurse but instead of bringing him back home, she gives him some food and lets him stay in a nearby orphanage. That's all we get for a while. We are then introduced to some people named Mr. and Mrs. Mudd and Mr. Muddle and they are the parents of the baby. The baby is a mutant that was not born with any special powers or powers that would make him a force to be reckoned with. Instead he only has the power to make anyone who he touches feel like he is the most beautiful thing they ever saw. His parents tell him he is not so beautiful but he likes being pretty. His mother and father were killed when he was a baby but somehow he somehow escaped. He runs into his first real friend, a young woman named Jennifer who has been looking for him and the two begin to work together to

I had heard good things about his new movie. The actor and the director had an unbelievable chemistry on set and Bill was always a great sport. I was very impressed. I also enjoyed the movie and it had an interesting plot that kept me guessing the whole way through. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a classic Hollywood action movie that still holds up. I found myself laughing and looking forward to the next time they come on the screen. The movie is definitely on my list for 2015 and I highly recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why do I like this movie: The film has a great ensemble cast that includes: the fantastic Jennifer Connelly as an alcoholic doctor, a man who is clearly obsessed with the idea of becoming a superhero, a cute little baby, and a very handsome man in a superhero costume with a heart of gold. In addition to being funny, it's also got a great soundtrack. It has some pretty good performances and one of the best action sequences of the year. It does have some bad things too, but it's a great summer comedy and is a lot of fun. Posted by Robert Hickey at 7:16 PM

The movie has a wonderful look and feel to it, which made the characters easy to understand and also easy to empathize with. The screenplay, acting, cinematography and directing were all great, as was the soundtrack, especially the beautiful and hauntingly beautiful opening song. The ending was sad, but it still kept you interested.  This is a movie about love, loss, fear and hope. A beautifully made movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ "The Great Gatsby" is one of the most fascinating movies I've seen in my life. What a story it is, and what a film. When I saw this movie I felt as if I were in an antique store. It really felt like a period film with all the old characters, all the different types of people, the music, the clothing, the cocktails, the scenery, the costumes, the hairstyles. The music is fantastic as well, one of my favorites. The acting is great as well. It was fun to see how everyone was reacting to the events happening around them, and watching Nick Carraway and his friend Daisy find their place in Gatsbys' society. Everyone was believable, there were even some "real" people thrown in to give a little color. The movie is very well acted and a lot of fun to watch, and a very enjoyable read! For a great movie review, I'd suggest "The Lost Weekend" from The Chicago Daily News. The Lost Weekend review has some very interesting info, about a trip Gatsbye had to see the sights of the west coast. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go see it. You won't regret it, and you won't forget it! You might also want to check out "The Golden Hour" by Josephine Decker. This is another great movie, a story about a girl who falls in love with a man that she thinks is her step-dad. It's a great romantic comedy. I think this film also deserves a mention for being in an AFI's list of the best movies of all time. In the "Film by" section it lists "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Last Detail". This movie also has an excellent soundtrack by Bob Dylan and Lynyrd Skynyrd, which is one reason I love it so much.

I was not really ready for it so I did not really think much about it. This movie was not as good as the title would indicate and it was not my favorite for a number of reasons but it was fun to watch nonetheless and I did like how it was written. I am also glad that I saw the English dub, it was very well done and it brought back a lot of the humor that I had forgotten.  My rating:    I rate this movie with a 7.5 out of 10. It is not the greatest movie that I have ever seen but it had some good moments and I think that it would have been better had the story of this movie been more exciting. I have watched this movie twice and have no regrets at all in my experience. If you have not seen this movie I would say that you have wasted your time. I hope that this will make you enjoy it a little bit more and give you a good laugh at the expense of the villains.

There's a couple lines of great dialogue and the rest of the dialogue is kind of forgettable. My two favorite scenes are in the last scene. (In both scenes they have a really nice amount of detail.) I really love how the action scenes are set in a castle and the movie uses this to show a lot of scenes and characters from many different characters' POV's. The movie is very descriptive about the setting and it was awesome to watch as a viewer. I enjoyed this movie, it was a lot better than the movie I thought it would be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "L.A. Confidential" is a brilliant, witty, entertaining, well-acted, well directed, and well produced movie. It is a film that has a number of themes that go well with each other, and manages to have them all woven together in a way that is satisfying to the viewer. The story, although fairly predictable, does a great job at keeping us guessing as to what is going on at all times. The main theme of the film is the theme of betrayal. The theme of a man being betrayed by the woman he is in love with is not just a theme in the film, but a theme that permeates the whole plot. The movie follows this theme through out the entire film and the themes are played out so well that I had no trouble finishing the film. I found that the film never seemed to be in over its head, and always seemed to have a great story. I liked the way that the plot was presented in this film. The film's pacing was perfect and always kept the audience on the edge of their seats. This film is a terrific example of how good acting and well written story can elevate a mediocre movie to greatness. In the end, "L. A. Confident" is an example of what I mean by good movies. "Lambs To The Slaughter" is another great example of a movie that can keep you guessing, with one plot twist or turn after another, until the very end. My rating for this film was a 10/10. I think that I will be recommending this film a lot more as the years go by, and I look forward to seeing what the future of "Lamb" has in store for us. If you like "Lambo to the Slaughter," or "Lamps for Lambs," "L, A.A Confident", and "Lams for Lambers" is something that you must see, and you should be excited by what is in store next! I have only given a 10 out of 10 to "Lombs to the Slaughter", because I think I may have been giving it too much credit in my review, and was not completely satisfied with the film's ending, but I was very satisfied with "Llambs to Slaughter", so I am giving it a 10. The final grade for "Lamas for Lamds" is based on a 5.4 out of 5 based on 7 reviews (all 5.9's). * The story
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (1999), in which the main character is a Chinese monk who takes part in a long quest to capture the dragon, then becomes a legend of his tribe. Not as amazing as The Matrix, but it's good and has a more optimistic view of the Chinese.  I guess there's hope for these people after all... The "Crying Game" is a movie where, instead of fighting, the participants use their crying and moaning to simulate the suffering of someone they like (and who like them too, it must be noted) or to get attention, often from an "important person" (a guy you don't know in the movie). The participants try to fool an important person into thinking they are in love with them, but the people at the top are very savvy and will often use the crying for something very different.   Marilyn Monroe's character in The Misfits, in which she plays the role of an unhappy woman who is forced to play the role that someone she likes and who is actually more popular than she is.   She doesn't really like her fiance (who she doesn't know), he was never in love to begin with.   The movie is also based on the book written by a group of British actors in the 1950s about a band of young boys, a "misfit" band that go around trying to be popular by pretending to be the "cool" kids.   Their leader, a boy, is an idiot, but they end up being friends and end up living happily ever after. One of the more popular examples is an American TV show which came about in the 1960s: The Golden Girls.   Not a real sitcom but an anthology series that was made to look like a sitcom in order to appeal to a more mainstream audience.   One of the episodes was about the mother who is going through a divorce (the wife had been cheating on the husband with another guy).   The episode was titled "The Golden Girls: An Unhappy Marriage" and was a very sweet episode.  However, there are also examples in other shows.   My favorite is probably the one from the late 1980s, "The Family Guy" (which is in many ways a satire of the TV sitcoms of the 1950's), in episode "The Last Man on Earth" which focuses on one of the "family" members (a man in his mid to late 50's) who lives

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of this movie. The story is well thought and thought out, the acting is excellent. The director, James Mangold, really knows his characters, he knew they were the type of people who are smart, and strong willed. The love story is wonderful. If you can look past the fact that there are no real good characters in the movie, it is an excellent piece of art. (12 votes, average: 4.50 out of 5)  votes, average :out of 5):
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ ( ) ----------------------------------------------------------------- My wife and I went to see "Kiddie vs. Monster" last night and the kids were the most excited to see it. It has been on the list of recommended movies for some time now, because it has all the ingredients to make a good horror movie and it is very well written and very well acted by the children. It is a good, easy to understand, scary story that is told from the viewpoint of a little girl and the monster she encounters. I had an easy time getting the movie and once I was in the theater, I found it very well done and well acted. I think the only thing that I could have done differently is have had my wife's friend read some of the monster's lines and maybe have her yell "WOAH" on the DVD commentary track. Overall, it is a fun, nice, family movie and I will probably go see it again! - August 8, 2013My wife and me went to...  Reviewer: paulh - favorite favorite favorite - July 29, 2013  Subject: Good, but not great A solid and well-written movie with some good laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Warm. I just finished watching this movie. The opening is very well done. I liked the music, the acting, the story and I thought the ending was good as well. The ending had a nice bit of humor and that was nice to see. I would recommend this movie to those who want a good comedy or a good action flick. Also to those that love a good story and who have seen all the movies or at least the ones they liked...and I say all of them...because most of them are awesome, so do check them out...and the best is yet to come.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ [UPDATE] - Here's a more up to date version of this guide: _________________ The game is just like the first one. And there are some new characters, but not many new areas. There are some minor changes: You're no longer allowed to fight the three girls at the top. They're gone now. You'll find a bunch of new girls at one side and a couple of guys at the other. And at the very end you'll see the three old girls come up to you and ask "Why did you get up to the top? Do you really want to get killed?" When you reach the top you see a very big wall that separates you from the outside world. A giant stone face with a skull on it is blocking your way. It looks kind of like a giant face in a movie. Then you'll find the "big guy" in the top left of the screen. He's an evil spirit with a big beard. He doesn't seem to notice you, but you can talk to him. He says he's a God, and he's the reason for all this. He wants to give you a gift. He tells you that he's giving you a big sword, and that if you take his sword back to him he'll let you go. I was wondering about how many times you can go up to him before he'll give up on you and say he can't go up anymore. I wonder if he goes back up for good? I haven't played the whole game yet and so I have no clue about this. The big guy gives you a sword. Then he gives you another sword. When you go back up, you'll be able to get another sword, then another, and another. So in all, you get five swords in all. The first guy will give you the sword he gave you at the beginning. The second guy will get you a third, then a fourth, and then another. And then the third guy will hand you the sixth and final sword. And now it's time to start fighting your way down. The enemies at the bottom are just as tough as those at the upper levels. They have the same kind of spells and weapons, but they also have more health and have more attack power. They also carry big things like axes and stones and rocks. The main things to worry about are the "mummy monsters". These come in different colors. The blue ones move around slower, and

It has all the Spielberg style of filmmaking but is actually pretty good at the same time. What I really liked about this movie is that it was truly well done. The performances are excellent, the cinematography is great, and the writing is spot on. It even managed to be hilarious at times. This movie has it all, and I give it an 8. ***********  Likes:  - Great characters  -- Wonderful acting  --- Excellent cinematography  Weaknesses: - The ending is a little strange  ****I really wanted to give it a 9, but it went above and beyond my expectations!*************

A great look into the mental health of the mentally ill, and they did an amazing job portraying a really difficult subject. What I didn't like: The acting is a bit shaky, and the ending was a bit forced. Other than that, great movie. I give it a 4/5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is a very pleasant surprise. If you're into a little mystery/thriller movie in which there are a lot of people with guns and explosives and no real story, then this is a decent movie to watch. I will admit, I'm not entirely sure how this movie was able to get made, or whether the plot was even coherent, but at least there's no blood and no guns, and it's pretty well shot. I think the only real flaw with it is that it's not funny. But I guess that's just one flaw." Posted by Scott Goss at 10:18 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The last few minutes of this film were a lot of fun! There was something so much fun about the movie with the first 5 minutes when the film seemed to be really starting to go down hill, but the story really picked up in the last 5-10 minutes! The ending was a bit weird, but I just laughed because I was so excited to see what the ending would be like! The story was great! ************* It's been a while since I've seen a film with a great plot line, and that's what made this one a great film. I loved how it was set in the 1930's and how it mixed that with the modern setting. There is also a great use of music and comedy, the ending was great with the ending sequence to it! I loved the first 25 minutes or so, and after seeing this movie I can't wait to see the rest! ************ The movie itself is great. It's not a long movie, but it is a good film. The film has a great mix of action, comedy, and drama. I really enjoy the last 10 minutes of the movie! I love this film! **************************** The film stars John Malkovich as the narrator and Michael Douglas as the father. The movie has an ending scene which is very funny and great to see. John Malkovics great voice really adds to this movie. The story also has a lot to say and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, and comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always loved The Princess Bride and always had the movie on the back burner. The movie was so good that I felt the need to watch it even though I am a long time movie fan. The film has such a great premise and the story is so great that it's amazing. It's a story about a prince who must marry his childhood sweetheart to save the land and its people. I was so glad that I watched this film. It was a good film that was funny as hell. It will make you smile and laugh and I feel like it was the first really good romantic comedy of the 1990's. It also showed how many movies of that era were in fact based on true events. This is one of them. "This, this is not the end. This ends now, this ends now..." The best thing about this film is that the actors and actresses were great. There was a nice amount of romance in the film and that made it a good romantic film. I can't find anything bad about the film other than that it is a little too long. I would say this film took between 90-105 minutes to be finished. This movie can only be seen if you get it on DVD. I have yet to find it anywhere else. I recommend the film but if you can wait, you will probably want to wait. Read full review of The Princess by the Lake
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of my favorite stories and the main protagonist was my favorite character. I did not read the books before watching the movie, I am sure some people could tell me why I enjoyed it so much and what the books did better that I missed. The main problem that the book had was that they were too detailed in detail about his past. This was a very important aspect that the author had done a great job to tell his story in a very interesting manner, and he was good at telling his story, but it was just not enough for me to enjoy the story. The movies did not do a good job with his past, they did a great work to make him as he is in the movie. The movie did a good work to tell the story that they wanted to tell, they gave you a nice and interesting journey to watch as the main character and I was very interested in what will happen to him. It has a lot to do with the ending of the movie and I will talk about it in a bit, but I will say that I had some very good feelings about the movie for a good reason.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ತ್ನ   Krampus - 7.5 out of 10  Krrampus is an adaptation of a short story written by Finnish author Kalle Nordqvist. The movie is very well made, I love the story. The actors really give great performances. The film has a good sense of humor, a lot of fun. The music is excellent. Krampus was an amazing movie. I highly recommend it.   The Nightmare Before Christmas - 8 out of 9  The Night Before Christmas is an animated feature film based on the story, 'Jack Pumpkinhead'. It is an entertaining animated movie, featuring the voice talents of Jim Carrey, Melissa McCarthy, Seth Green, Kate McKinnon, and Kristen Wiig. The story of The Nightmare Before CHRISTMAS centers around a young boy named Jack who wishes to be a big-headed Christmas monster, but is bullied by his peers and by his sister Emma. The only hope Jack has is to have a Christmas dream come true and travel to a realm called Nightmare Land and become the very best, Pumpkinhead. The first movie had great animation, and the second film has very well done animation as well. I personally found the animation of The Night Before CHRISTmas to be more than adequate. It is a great addition to the animated series, and I highly suggest checking out this film.   the Nightmare before christmas   A Christmas Carol - 8.5 OUT OF 10 's a good old-fashioned story about Ebenezer Scrooge and his life before Christmas. It tells of Ebeneze, a man who was born blind and with little in his life and was in poverty for most of his life. Ebenezel's greatest wish is to buy Christmas trees from the local shop in order to entertain his loved ones. However, Ebenezie will have to work hard in order for his dreams to come true. The script is written by Harold Pinter and directed by Peter Cushing. The Christmas Carol is a good classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      A good comedy with a funny cast. You have some wonderful characters - all played by very likable people. If only more comedy shows could take place in real-life situations.   I've seen the movie twice now and both times I have enjoyed it immensely. Not everyone has to like a film about a group of kids, especially since they are in danger of being shot at from helicopters by their own government, but I think the story is very well written and it gets better and better each time I see it. The ending is great, not only does it have a heartwarming message but the ending makes the movie even better. A true comedy is what it is and this one is full of laughs and has all the right lines. The actors who play the other kids in the film are great and they are all played well.  - I think it is the best comedy on TV.     - Not everyone should like a movie about a bunch of kids who are at a shooting range.   - The ending should be a big hint that the movie isn't all about kids but you can't go wrong with it.  Rating - 5 out of 5  The film has a heart-warming message about not giving up, and it ends on a high note. The movie is well-written and entertaining, with strong performances from the cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  My mom made me watch this, because I had to go to the store and she needed to do something to make me do things. This film has that special appeal to me that no other film does. My favorite part is when the mom asks "what are you doing? What's your mother like?" I love that this mother wants to know more and more about her daughter. The movie does a good job showing how one's father treats them. I think that this is a great movie to watch with your little nephew or niece.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I don't know if the producers were trying to say something or were just a dumbass, but I don�t know if I've ever seen a more ineptly constructed film than this one. The story goes something like this: A man has been abducted by aliens who are forcing him to work as an entertainer on earth in the future. This movie, being a little behind the times, has not been updated to reflect modern times. So he goes to the future to work at a "show" in which he meets a pretty girl, has sex with her, falls in love with her and then the movie ends. But don't get me wrong, the movie has a good premise. It starts off with an interesting story of how a human man falls in loving relationships and how he�s being forced into a life of work for alien beings. The whole story is not bad, but it does not end. The bad ending in the film was pretty lame. The aliens have taken control of the man and he is forced to marry a girl who has no right to him. The film never shows us how this guy was able to make this decision. He just falls in like a lot of movies and ends up marrying a woman who does not love him in return. I donít know why this man married this girl because he would be just as happy with any woman, but he does. The only problem I had with this film was the acting. I loved the way the guy with the glasses and mustache got to do his thing, but when the female lead gets involved, the acting is absolutely horrendous. She looks like a walking joke. The other bad thing was the whole thing was filmed in black and white, which is why it had such a strange look to it. The thing about this film is that it doesnít have anything else going for it. It has a couple good jokes, but this movie has really nothing going for itself.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The story follows the life of a poor, black male in New York City. The film begins with an encounter between two people who appear to be perfect strangers. Then, a few minutes later, a young man named Michael and his friend, a girl named Emily are walking together through a park. At first, Michael doesn't notice Emily. He begins to pay more and more attention to her, until she passes out in his arms. While on the path, Emily sees a man looking at her. This strange man, named Dr. Frank Marshall, offers to take her home, if she does not have to go anywhere for the night. However, the next night, when Emily arrives home, she finds herself in the apartment of Dr. Marshall. Emily doesn't know he is Dr. Marshalls fiance. However he is a very sexy man, and Emily is completely attracted to him. A few days later, Emily comes into Dr.Marshall's room and the two start making out. Dr. Marshal seems to be very familiar with Emily and the couple goes on a date with a friend of theirs. At a concert by the local jazz group, Emily notices Marshall talking to a young, blonde woman. She asks him to stop, but he ignores her and keeps talking to her. As she's walking away, he makes eye contact with her, and she turns around to tell him to go away. He calls her "Little Miss Muffet" and he takes her on a tour of the city in his car. She starts feeling attracted to Marshall, until he tells her he likes young white girls. Emily sees Marshall again when she is walking home with Marshall's friends. When she arrives home with the group, the young woman who had been with Marshall earlier tries to get her attention. She wants to be taken home, but Emily tells her to go. Emily tells Marshall she doesn't want to have sex with him, but Marshall doesn't seem to care. Emily tries to talk to Marshall one more time, but it doesn't work out. Meanwhile, Emily is talking with Marshall at a restaurant. Emily thinks he is cute, and when Marshall sees her, he says, "Hey Emily." Emily doesn-t want to go home, so Marshall gets in the car with her. She is afraid of him, so he drives faster, and pulls over near an apartment building. He tells Emily to lie down, and they begin having sex. During the night, Emily begins to feel
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ Have you seen/heard about this movie? If not, watch it. It's great! ______________________________________________ (1/5) ***1/2*** The movie is great, and the performances are great, but that's all it is, and it's mostly on a technicality. The story, with all its action, is dull. The plot is the best thing about the movie. It is a story of a young, arrogant, brilliant, yet naive young woman, trying to figure out who she is and where she wants to go in life. Her mentor, who is also a scientist, seems to be the key to solving all the problems in her life, but he is also trying to get her to forget about him for her own good. She has to learn who she really is, who she loves, and why she should have faith in someone who may or may not be her best friend. Her character is one that I found interesting, and that's why I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story about a young woman who is trying to find herself, her purpose, and her path in life and to anybody who's interested in seeing good movies about scientists and women. But as much as the film is interesting and fun, it's just boring. I mean, I have no complaints about the performances by Sarah Paulson, who plays the young woman/scientist, and Meryl Streep, who stars as the scientist's mentor. Both are terrific, but it's the writing that makes the movie what it is. The director, Michael Mann, is trying a very hard job with this movie, and I think it's going to end up being an important film. Hopefully the next film will be better. The only problem I have with the movie is that it ends on a bad note. If you're not into science-fiction, I don't think you'll like this movie. I would like to see this movie again and again, and if anyone would like me to send them a copy of the movie, that would be great. _________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was one of the most relaxing ones I've ever watched. The story of how the war was won is a lot more interesting than most war films, but what really makes the movie work is the beautiful music. A wonderful song, by a musician by the name of Tom Waits, plays over the credits while we watch the movie. This movie makes you realize why Waits is a great musician and musician's songwriters are so underrated.  It's a slow-paced movie, but it's also one of those movies that you want to get to the end of. There is some action in the movie, and some great suspense, but the main reason this movie made me stop and watch was because I couldn't put the movie down. If you like slow-moving movies, this is for you. If not, don't. I recommend this movie to everyone.  I've given this movie a solid 4 stars. I watched the movie in one day, and I didn't feel like I had enough time to fully get into the movie's story. I can't wait to watch the sequel.  This is one of my favorite movies and one of  my favorite  TV shows, so I'm going to start watching it right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!The main story was very interesting and thought provoking. A very enjoyable film. I really enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one. This film was not made to be a 'graphic novel'. It was intended to be watched in 3 1/2 hours. The writing was strong and the story very interesting. The story is about a man who was on his last few days of life and has just left his family for a week. When his wife dies of cancer he decides to move in with his sister and a girlfriend (which he calls his soul mate) and make some more money so he can go out to a place to smoke some pot. He soon discovers that that is not all that he gets to do. The film has many twists, a lot of action and lots of sex. It is hard to decide which of the different characters the movie is about. I loved the story and it's pretty funny. The sex scenes are good and the characters are funny and interesting.

It was just perfect. The movie had so many good things about it and that makes it perfect, so much so that I just want to tell you about the best thing that this movie has to offer. The main character's name is Chris. He is a very, very, good looking guy and I thought it was a very nice touch. I felt bad for him. I mean, he is the main character and it is only for a few minutes in the movie, so you should have a few things in life. There is something about him that is a bit creepy, which is really a good thing because he can take on any role he is given, but it also makes him look a bit... off. It is a small thing that is not to his face, but is just to everyone around him. And I know, there are no good looking guys who can play lead characters in movies. But I just love it. There are a lot of people who hate the movie because they are so sad that Chris did not get to do more, but I am not one of them. I think it is a good job they did the whole movie with Chris, I mean he did not have a lot to do. He was just the main guy, and then the rest of the movie was all about his relationship with his girlfriend and how that relationship affected him. It showed that it was really important for him to have a girlfriend and that it made him sad and that this made him more sad, but he did what he had to do, but then his life was going down the drain. And that is the story of Chris' life. But his girlfriend... the main love interest in the whole film is the only character that I really felt bad or sad about. That was a really nice touch, and I loved it and hope that they go back and make another movie with her and maybe have her make an appearance or something. I really did like this movie and I am looking forward to seeing more of it. It could be worth the time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* A very enjoyable film and excellent action scenes. The villain is a master of disguise and uses the same methods to defeat his victims. The actors are all excellent and they have the perfect chemistry. A little slow at times but worth watching. The action is very good and a fun ride. Highly recommended. ********  Review written by Richard O'Mara  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's interesting, dark, and I liked the villains in the story. There's nothing like it. If you're into horror films, or horror movies in general, I recommend this. I'm a horror fan. There is something very special about these old movies that I found interesting and creepy and I think it's in this film. This is not for the squeamish!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe I just did this. I am so glad I did.   What I liked about this movie: - Great set pieces that are so well-done that you can't help but appreciate them - Excellent direction from a great ensemble cast - Well-constructed plot that has a beginning, middle and end. - Lots of twists and turns, all the while not seeming to overstay their welcome. - A very well-written screenplay that has all the elements of a good drama (plot, acting, characterization)  What would I change about this: - Nothing! The acting was solid and the set pieces were great, but nothing is really changing. It is all very well put together, but really doesn't feel like anything was changed or added to it. It was just a great set of circumstances, and it doesn't change the movie.  What I liked most: - The main cast (and particularly Lili Taylor) - The supporting cast (particularly Andrew Scott, Ben Garant and Robert Knepper) - Benicio Del Toro's acting - The direction and cinematography by Darren Aronofsky - The sound design and sound effects - Michael Giacchino and his piano score - The amazing musical score by composer John Williams  What didn't I like: - Every single character who wasn't in the film (or who was only in the background of a large part of the film) Overall, this is a great movie with one flaw. The flaw is a lack of a satisfying ending.

Moviegoer's Reviews MovieGoer's Review : "I'll give this film three stars, but the fact that it is a sequel to the well-known "The Exorcist" is a huge plus. It is a very good movie. This was one of the first films that really showed that the "found footage" film could be successful and that it had the potential to be a horror classic. " Moviegoing Reviews MoviegoiReviews :  'The Ex-ReXe' is the second film in the franchise.  It is also directed by the late Jim Shone.  The movie is set in 1977.  When a 14 year old boy named Ben is sent to live with his uncle, he ends up on a tour of an exorcist museum.   He comes upon a child that has not been seen in years, and is soon drawn into the ritual.  In this haunted house, the children are trapped and must fight to survive.  This is a movie that is much more about suspense than horror.   It has a nice, slow pace to it, with a nice plot.  The movie has some great visuals, too, with good camera work, and a good soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Outdoors  is an extremely rare and good film. There was a time when I was very happy with this movie. This was back in the time when the genre had not yet become very prevalent. Back then I felt it was well directed. The cinematography was great and the plot was well presented. I had high hopes for this movie when I saw it. I was happy with it. But alas, like most things, it wasn't perfect. The acting is not up to par. Some of them are pretty great. But they are nowhere near the level of actors that I had grown to love in the past and I'm very disappointed. The movie didn't feel real. No matter how much I may have enjoyed the film, it doesn't feel as if it could have actually happened. The story is too contrived. If it was a simple story of a boy and his dog, I wouldn't mind it at all. If, however, it was simply a story of an old man's struggles with Alzheimer's, I'm not sure I could have enjoyed it. It was just way too much too fast and far too overused. Some scenes could have been a little more subtle or a little less fast. There was no real emotion on display and the characters were way too generic. They just had too many faces and none of them were particularly memorable. It's just not a good film to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie.  There are some scenes that are too fast and some are too slow, but overall, the movie does a good job of keeping up with the story.  The only downside is that the actors playing the other characters didn't seem to be really giving it their all.  I'm pretty sure they had the same lines for every scene, and didn't do anything particularly funny.  But the acting was good enough to make up for it.

I found it very informative about some real science, it's fun to see what they think in the movie and I loved the special effects. The BluRay version of the movie is in 1080p but it looks better in 4K. I don't know of many good sci-fi movies for people to get their feet wet with, and a movie like this will open some eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You'll go to sleep feeling like you've done the world a favor, and wake up feeling like a total jerk. You'll look in the mirror and think, 'I look like a complete fuckup.'" -Trey Parker, director of South Park "South Park" has a lot of good jokes, and they are all extremely well thought-out. It makes great use of comedy timing, and doesn't take itself too seriously. It takes the time to let the audience know that it is not a show for children, and that in order to appreciate the show, they should make sure that they are not overly aggressive or stupid. "I don't wanna be a dick!" -The Kids Next Door, episode 1 I don the black suit of the Mayor. "I will be the greatest mayor in the history of the world. No one will ever take away what I have." "Fuck my hat, boy!" -Citizens of Southpark The title song has a great sense of humor. "The mayor's on the phone, you know he wants a drink" is a classic South Park line. Also, I can't get enough of the "What do you want, baby?" line. South Park is not afraid to let a good punchline roll off of its tongue. "Fuck, I guess you guys should probably start acting like a bunch of idiots" is what I want to say, but that would just be a terrible thing to do. "South Park", along with "The Simpsons" are the two shows I think most deserve a place in the top ten. They are funny, creative, and entertaining. I love them both, and I hope you all will enjoy them as much as I do. 1. "One Tree Hill" Season 1 (1998-1999) "In the beginning there was no Kenny. And in the end there was nobody else." It takes a very long time to write an episode, and while I feel like I am just getting started with this, this is the first episode that I have ever been really involved with. In the first season, a friend of mine who was in a band told me that if he had his way, I would join the band, and he would take me under his wing. My first instinct was "fuck that, I don't want to be in a white kid's band". But I did, and "One tree hill" is probably the best reason why

This is the film for people who love the idea of a monster movie and want to watch it. I liked it. It is a story about a man who goes to see a psychiatrist who is giving out advice on how to get rid of a evil monster who is killing everyone, but it is only a figment of his imagination. He then meets a young woman who is being stalked by the monster, and her mother who is a scientist in the area where the monster lives. They try to help the mother figure out how to kill the monster. Then the man gets the daughter of the scientist to try to kill it, which fails, and they meet the monster's mother.

The Dead Inside (1988) 6.4 I've had a copy of this movie since I was a teenager and it was a favorite of mine. I'm a big fan of the genre. I think it's a great, scary movie. The special effects were great and the plot was well thought out.   Maus (1986) 7 This movie had a very good premise and it's very scary, but there was a lot of slow acting that ruined it for me.    A Christmas Horror Story (1985) 7.75 I was expecting to see the movie The Exorcist, and that's what I got. This was a very short and very scary movie with good special effects.   I saw this on video when I was about 8 years old. I was in the middle of watching this with my dad. I can still remember the scenes very well. The story was told in a style that felt very creepy, but I felt that the writing was very weak. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Monsieur Denis, le plus grand nous-même! I'm not sure what my favorite film of 2014 is. I've enjoyed almost every single film released in 2014. However, I think that'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'is a really unique and original film, that in no way can be compared to other films. While not as well known as 'The Revenant', it is a very important film in the history of French cinema, and an absolute must watch for every French cinephile. The story opens with a couple, Azzaro (Michel Seydoux) and Lassana (Azouzia Toure) leaving their small village of Béteil and heading towards Paris, to start their life as a couple. But they never made it. Azzarro is brutally murdered in the middle of Paris, in the very center of the city. The police claim that his killer was an unemployed man named Hamadi (Marcel Dhaene), but there is something more sinister happening. The entire city is in a state of unrest, with all kinds of protesters taking to the streets. Everyone seems to have had their suspicions that something was wrong with Azzaru, but no one had the guts to say anything. That is, until Hamadi kills Azzaron's wife, Nelly. The rest of the film follows Lassa and Laleh (Sofia Boutella, who I believe is a perfect match for her character), as they go through a series of increasingly absurd situations, but never make the connection between what is happening and who Azzaroo was. There are some really interesting ideas that run throughout this film, some of which were also explored in the novel by the same title. I will give it a full paragraph here, because it's so important to the overall theme of the movie. One of the major themes of the novel is the way that the way a society views the past shapes how it behaves in the present. A society that accepts the fact that a man had an affair with the wife of a woman's husband is going to be much more likely to allow for infidelity in the future. Conversely, one that considers such an act as a crime is not going to have the same kind of tolerance. And I think this is exactly what we see in the film. While the film explores many interesting ideas about how people react to past and present events, I
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** **Fargo** (2015)*** I had a bit of a strange experience in viewing this film. It had a lot of great qualities, but I was also put off by a few things. First, the dialogue was very cheesy, especially in parts with two characters. They don't speak at all; they use only "muffled" grunts and so forth. The dialogue was also a bit too long, at about two hours. That's about average for a feature-length film, but it did not seem like an effort was made to cut out the cliches, which in turn left a bit to be desired. The second problem was the acting. I thought most of the people were just doing the same old stereotypes. Most of them were pretty terrible, so that was no surprise. The only one who was good was Christian Slater. Unfortunately he was kind of the one who kept me from enjoying the film. I was expecting a lot better from him. However, it still had a few good things, and some really great performances. I'm glad that it didn't become boring. In fact, the last third of the film was a lot more fun than the first part of the movie, and that was something I was not expecting at all. In the end, I'm not sure if I would have ever gotten into a Fargo movie after this. It wasn't bad, it just didn't have any charm. If you're looking for a good, fun time, then this movie might work for you. I will say that I don't know why it has such bad reviews. I enjoyed it, and I wish that there was a longer version of this movie. It's definitely a little longer than 2 hours, but there are still some good scenes in here. I don`t know, maybe it would be a better experience if it was only one or two hours long. I have to give this a 4.5. I would recommend it, but that's probably only because I'm a bit underwhelmed by the whole experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The "Rapture" was not only the first time that I had heard of the phrase "Jesus was the best movie ever made," but it was also the first thing I ever saw that was specifically and not coincidentally about God and religion. I didn't want it to end with the death of the last of the apostles (though I will admit that the film does not follow the expected ending, nor did it leave me wishing to see the film in a more positive light). However, for my last thought in the movie, I found a scene in the film to be one of the best examples of "the perfect scene" that I have seen. There is no more perfect of a scene than when two people meet in the middle of the street, look each other in the eyes, smile, walk on in each others' company, and say, "Thank you," and then say "Bye" without a second thought or a hint of awkwardness. I loved that scene, and I loved it because it was a good scene. There was no awkwardness, no second guessing, no "Oh, well that could have been worse." There was just two people saying, "You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but I believe in Jesus Christ. Thank you." That scene, as it happens, was also my first introduction to the phrase, "the best movies are about God." It is an awesome phrase, but also one that I believe has become distorted because of the way it is used to describe Hollywood films. As I mentioned in my review of the film "Loving" (see here ), "the Best Movies Are About God" is an accurate statement, and one that is even more applicable today because Hollywood films are always trying to be something that it isn't. The point that I want to make is that the "Best Movies Are about God" idea is a perfect way to define the movie that is "The Matrix," the one that the filmmakers have tried to make into something it is not. That is what The Matrix does not stand for. It does not represent the truth, the beauty, or the perfect love of God. It is, in fact, an example of God's love for mankind, and a beautiful example of the love of Christ that we can learn from. But that is not what the film represents. The film, as one critic has explained, is about "The Master" and his "children" who are his minions and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dope (2002)  is the perfect entry in the franchise. It's so bad that it's good, and that's rare. It has some of the best acting in the entire genre, but that's not what matters. What matters is how it works with the other two movies, and the movie that came before it. Dope is a really good piece of work, a story about a drug addict, who gets a hit to the head, and his relationship with the dealer who made him. The drug dealer, who's named Dope, is one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema, and is so funny that it would be impossible to not find yourself laughing all the way through the movie. The movie is just so ridiculous that you just want to keep on laughing throughout the whole thing. It is, in fact, a perfect example of comedy at it's best. I have no idea how the film is so good because, as much as I would like to, I just can't get over the fact that it is absolutely terrible. There are moments where I just want someone to come up and kick it and give it a good sendoff. It would be the perfect ending to a classic comedy film, and I'm just not seeing it. That's what really bugs me about this movie, and it's the last thing that makes me want to watch the rest of the movies.  There is some really good acting here, but, again, it just isn't enough.  The final act of Dope was so bad, it was good!  As I stated, Dope wasn't great, but I really wanted to like it. It had a ton of good acting and some great special effects.  It's an all around terrible movie, but it really isn't that bad. I guess that's why so many people liked it: because it's bad.  And, in a way, that makes it even funnier.   "Oh my God! It's Dope!"  This movie is a perfect definition of comedy done wrong. The whole thing is a disaster, and in that sense, it's pretty damn funny, too.

It would be a pretty good movie if they kept the bad movie going on in the second half and didn't ruin it by throwing in the other one right in the middle. I'm just too tired to finish these movies. I don't even know how to feel about this movie. I know there is a whole plot line going on, but I just don't care. I would have been better off watching it on DVD.  What did you think of this movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, give it 5 stars!  I'm not going to say too much, because it's been done so much, but it's good. If you know who Paul Kersey is, you probably know that he's the producer of the TV show "Beverly Hills 90210" and he wrote the book "Boys Town". He was very smart and he was smart in the writing of this book. He shows the real life characters that happen to be in this neighborhood. The movie is good, because there are not too many things that are new in this world, so it doesn't feel old. So many people come here to watch a movie, and this is what they get, but I think that this would have been even better if he had used that film as an excuse to show the real world of the ghetto. The people that come are all good people and I think you could have seen more of them if they had been shown. The kids, and even the girls in the neighborhood, would have shown a little bit more of themselves. Also, I think it would have really made the movie. I'm glad that he wrote this, because I think this movie should be on HBO. The music is great, and the movie itself has a lot of great characters. If this movie is not on HBO, I'll go to Netflix and get it. I like it, and I give it 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There's plenty of humor, enough to make the film feel fresh and a bit irreverent, but no one laugh-out-loud funny." 5.  A Fistful of Dollars (1964) A lot of people like this one because of its use of Western tropes and its violence, but it is also the greatest Western ever made and probably the best.  It is an incredibly detailed, realistic and well made movie that is a little more realistic than the typical Western, but still very entertaining and filled with intense action.  The western genre began with John Ford's A Fistful Of Dollars, but it was the most popular of all of Ford's westerns and has since then dominated westerns.  It is about a Texas cowboy named Johnny Ringo who goes to the Mexican border with his horse, his gun, and a large bounty on his head.  He goes through many different encounters and encounters with outlaws and bandits.  At the end of the movie Ringo goes back to the US, but does not have a big Western success, he does not make as much money, but he does get his horse back.  There is some violence in the movie, but the violence is justified and never seems to go too far.   The most famous scene is when the outlaws come across a group of Mexicans and shoot at them, it is a scene from every western ever made.  This movie has a lot of violence, and it is one of the most violent westerns, but its brutality is justified.  The first half of the film is very good, but when the action gets serious, the movie starts to fall apart.  As for the action, it takes place mostly in Texas, with a few scenes at the border, but even then, most of the violence happens in a small town, so the gunplay is mostly confined to the gun fights that take place in the local tavern.  All the guns in this movie are from the 1860s, it really is like a time capsule of what gunfights were like in the 19th century.  With a lot more action than the other westerns in this list, it makes it a good action movie and also makes it one of John Ford films that I have seen all the way through.  A Fistfull Of Dollars is a very interesting movie and a good example of a classic Western, if you haven't seen it before, it may be worth
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" the first time I saw it. It was a big action movie, with lots of explosions and plenty of things flying. But what surprised me was that the main cast was really good and the other actors really were able to show their range. The human characters were all very charismatic and made the film enjoyable. The other characters were more interesting. Even though they were all humans they all had their own unique characteristics. The movie did have a few plot holes but it was still a fun movie.  5/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I got to be in this movie, but I was very glad I wasn't in the film's main cast because the movie sucked so bad that it would have been worse without them. This movie was so bad in my opinion that I was so irritated to be a part of it because I knew the story it was trying to tell and then, after watching it, I was just like...huh? Why do I even care about what's going on, but that was the biggest complaint I had about this movie...it's so bad, I don't care at all!  You have a girl who has a crush on a guy who isn't interested...and then suddenly the movie takes an action sequence involving the guy and this girl...that takes up a good chunk of the movie...but then, that was only half of the film...it takes the other half to deal with the relationship between these two characters. Now, the guy is actually the only one who really takes any action in this film...because that's how bad this movie is! It's so un-action-y that you'd think the guy was just sitting in front of his laptop watching videos while a girl was having sex with this guy...which is so far from the truth. Then, the woman...well...she does get sex in this one, but it's not because she's had sex before, it's because this guy gets jealous, so the woman decides to make a movie...in the hopes of making herself and the guy jealous, which she succeeds in doing. I'm sorry, but there's just so much wrong with this movie! The script sucks so bad! The acting is bad, the pacing is bad. The story? Terrible! The characters? Terribly written, the acting is poor, the music is bad...etc etc. Seriously, the only good thing about this film is that I had to see it...so you know it had to be bad right? But it isn't! In fact, this movie has some decent performances, like a decent performance from Michelle Monaghan, but the script is so bad it almost doesn't matter! Oh, and the plot is also pretty awful, so just go in thinking this will be some epic movie with a great plot, and you'll be disappointed!

In the beginning, we learn about Jake, a young boy who has been in a coma since he was a toddler. Jake is being treated at a hospital for a severe brain injury and has an extensive family history of seizures and other brain abnormalities. At the end of the movie we see Jake's mother and grandfather, but it is not until later in the film that we learn that Jake is the son of a wealthy businessman named James. After seeing his parents go through such a painful divorce, James starts his own company with Jake as a member of the board of directors. James and Jake work together very closely, and are constantly discussing business and other subjects. This relationship is what is so great about the movie. As the film goes along, we see the changes that occur to James and his daughter. Jake becomes interested in girls and the way they act, and as the film continues we see this affect the way he treats his employees, his family, and his friends. Eventually Jake's interest becomes so strong that he starts thinking about what life could be like for him. After some time of getting a feel for what he wants and the changes he needs, Jake moves into a hotel to study and to develop his business. He also meets a young woman named Beth who is the granddaughter of his deceased father, James's first cousin. After a number of months of living in the hotel, Jake realizes that he needs to move on with his life, so he decides to get a new apartment. However, he is immediately thrown into a bad situation when he finds out that Beth is going to be moving in with him. The problems between the two start off rather slowly, but get a bit more serious as time goes on. The story follows Jake as he tries to figure out how to deal with his problems and make it through the day, while dealing with his relationship with Beth as well as his new responsibilities as an adult. This story is one that is worth the watch. Jake, Beth, and James are a good mix of interesting people, and all three of them give excellent performances. There is a definite feeling that this movie would have worked better as a movie starring young people rather than a film about a young person.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ A new entry in my blog-I have a little background in science. I work with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, which is a leading science center with an emphasis on genomics and cancer research. And I do some writing on a regular basis-writing articles for the popular science magazine Cell. I have also written several science fiction stories, including "The Caves of Steel," "Dwarves and Gods," "The City of Brass," "A Race in Space" and "The Last Day of the Earth." And I am an occasional contributor to other science-fiction magazines. Now, I also have an ongoing science fiction series, written with some help from my good friend and publisher, Paul Cornell. The premise is simple. You are a man named Jack who has discovered that something is out there-a vast alien ship, a space station, a gigantic alien city-that is moving in on the Earth. Jack is an adventurer, and he has been in the field for many years-with various stories about alien encounters, and this is no exception. The book starts off with a fantastic action scene with a huge spaceship smashing into the earth in a very dramatic manner. And the action continues throughout the book. The story develops from there. I am sure you will enjoy this book. A wonderful story. If you like sci-fi, you will like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was great! I enjoyed it. I liked it a lot!  My rating: 8.0 out of 10  Review for the film:  In the world of the supernatural, the word "paranormal" has a different meaning every day. When you think about it, you know you're talking about the paranormal, the unexplained. This documentary takes us back to an obscure movie theatre in New Jersey, to a very early film about the ghostly happenings of a man named James Aaronson, the founder of the Ghost Club of New York. The film shows us how a man trying to prove his existence and his sanity to his father and his friends, finds his own spirit to be a threat to everyone. The main problem with the movie is that it's not about the "Paranormal." In fact, it's a very different movie. The concept, the story, the characters and the dialogue are all very good, and the acting is wonderful. The only drawback was the editing. There are many sequences of shots that were not used, or, in a few cases, completely lost, as if someone changed the sound and/or direction of the film. If you are a fan of this film, then, you'll enjoy it. But if you don't, then you will definitely have your work cut out for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better sci fi films I've seen and I don't mean that in a snobbish, "I'm not impressed" kind of way, I mean in a "it looks pretty cool and has good special effects" kind.   As far as sci fi goes, this is another one I like, it has more than a few clever ideas, such as the time travel and an alien society.  In particular, I like that they don't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead simply go with what works.  I think it's a really fun film that's well worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. If you think a movie is not a good enough, try to have a good idea on what can be improved. And most importantly, if you think that it is not the best movie ever made then go and get the DVD. Otherwise the movie will take forever to watch, you'll be in a constant state of anger and rage and just when you think you can't stand the situation anymore... you'll watch it again. What do I expect? _________. This is a film that I'm still trying to find a decent movie from the 80s that has the energy and originality of this one. This movie does not have the same energy and the characters are just different. The actors and actresses are also different from the actors in this movie. They're not nearly as good and they lack any sense of character. The story is simply too contrived and boring to even be worth the time to sit through.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! The fact that we live in such a world is awesome. We have the internet, we have a world wide web, and we have the ability to watch our favorite movies and watch them anytime, anywhere. In this day and age, and in the age of mobile devices, people want to keep themselves entertained and not be bored. This is why many people like to watch their favorite movies on the big screen. This movie is a great example of why. It is not a bad movie. It does not make you wish you were a kid again and the plot was not overly complicated. It also did not get boring as the end credits kept telling you. However, I found it more enjoyable for its good story that did not take itself too seriously. It did not try to be a high budget production either. The soundtrack and sound effects were very unique and unique as well. The character development was not rushed but was also not too much as it was a great amount. The ending was also unique as it came off as a happy ending. But the movie was a very different kind of movie. With its unique characters, the plot, and its original setting, the movie is an entertaining way to pass the time as well as it does not have to take itself that seriously. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something different that they can have a bit of fun with, or even if you are not that much into movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an interesting movie from the first 3 quarters. I am impressed by the depth and depth of character of the movie. It is a very good drama. I believe the lead actors play the parts very well. I love how the lead actor plays the "poster boy" role. The other leading roles are also very good, especially the role of the "worried mother". The film is worth the time to watch. I don't know if the movie can be made into a better movie as it does not have anything special. The movie has its own theme and is good enough in itself to give it a good score. I give the film 3 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I don't think it was until I saw the first trailer that I realized how many people would be disappointed that a movie about a boy living with his grandmother in a rural area, in the midst of a terrible drought, wasn't an epic epic in scope. It's not really the drought but a terrible weather system that disrupts his life for weeks. His father's wife is his best friend and a constant in his life, but he has no one to talk to and finds it hard to make friends. After a brief period of friendship with a local girl who likes to cook, he discovers he's very good at it, and the two begin a friendship. That is, until he meets a boy in a truck who claims to be his older brother and he becomes a suspect in the murder of his father. The movie, for all its shortcomings, is filled with good character development and an interesting story that was told so well by the writing. If you don't like a movie because of the subject matter, I'd probably give it a miss, but if you are looking for a good story with an interesting cast of characters, then this is worth the watch. ______________________________________________________ Review by Mark E. Smith from The Big Island, Hawaii. _____________ __________________________________ I watched this as a freshman in high school when it came out in theaters. I remember being impressed with the fact that all the characters had personalities and that they were all unique in that regard. I was never a fan of the character in it who was in love with the beautiful woman who was his boss. I had no interest in him and I thought he was very obnoxious. In fact, this character was actually played by the father of my wife. My favorite character was the father, a very wise man who was trying to get his son to see that the things that happened to him, in his youth, really were important. His son was a child who didn't see any of this and I think he was only convinced of it after his mother's death. I liked how it was told in a series of flashbacks and how it felt like it was getting back to the beginning. It was all told so beautifully. I never noticed the film's flaws. I think it's a beautiful film. I thought the music was excellent, the acting was great and the directing was very nice. It didn't have anything that caught my attention the entire time. I'm sure people will be disappointed by the ending
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many times I found myself wishing that there was more of this type of movie out there. If there's a reason I'm writing this, it's because it did not really get a fair review in any film forum. However, the following review I wrote is a direct result of one of the great reviews I read: "I saw this in a 7-year-old movie theater and it was one of my favorite movies of all time." I was 15 when I saw this and I don't remember it being a good or even an average film. My feelings about it are similar to a lot of those of my classmates who have seen it. It had many of the hallmarks of an 80s or 90s throwback. It was cheesy, silly, and had a good director. Yet, I can't say it was a really bad film, although it might be my most forgotten movie and I'm sure it would be considered a disappointment at most modern movie screenings. The thing that makes this film so interesting is that it's an example of something that is happening today. When I saw the film and watched it over again, I was reminded of an article I read a while back about how "Gravity" is the "New 'Saving Private Ryan'" and I think that it might have been the right movie for that movie. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the movie, the basic plot of this movie involves two friends from different backgrounds, who decide to work together in order to create an art film in their home. It's kind of like how they work in a factory together in "Saving. Private. Ryan." The movie follows one-sided friendships in a variety of different ways. One of the characters is a former Navy SEAL who was turned into a drug dealer for his work with the SEALs, and the other was a journalist who became addicted to meth. They both try to hide the truth from one another at first, until one of them gets killed. The truth eventually is revealed as the friends are confronted with a choice. Will they continue to deny it and try to keep their friendship alive as the truth is revealed? Or will they face it head on, as friends? The ending of the movie is the most telling in my opinion. It has a great ending where the truth of what really happened is revealed and the true story is told and then they make amends. It doesn't hurt that it is a really funny movie, but you

We see the history of the planet Tropic Thunder and the life that was once on the planet.  The ending of the movie was very cool.      I like this movie a lot and it would make a great addition to the sci-fiction section.  I recommend this movie highly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm not sure I could get a better movie than The Godfather Part II." A very interesting film and I hope to see the rest. A good movie by an excellent director: Â  This is a good film. Â It is set in a world where most of the characters from the first film are dead, and the only ones left are two gangs.  The police are all incompetent and corrupt and the cops are trying to kill everybody in the film, so only one gang remains.  I loved it!    The story is great.     I think it is a wonderful way to explore the themes of justice and revenge in a realistic way.  I like that this film has some nice gore in it.  If you like gangster movies, this is one to see.  This film had a very good cast and all of them did well.  The performances are fantastic.  From David Carradine to Robert De Niro to Robert Duvall to Al Pacino,   everyone did a great job.  Some of the great lines in this film were:   "I've come down with a big cold.  What does it mean, my old friend?  The same thing that killed my mother and father. It's got to be in that ice cream, right?  I'm so sick, I've got to go.  All of you, get the hell out of here." ( Al Pacianino) "Now I think my old man would have liked it. He'd want us to be heroes.  He would have wanted us to put down the power.  And then we'll have our ice cream." ( David Carrigan) The great thing about this film is that it doesn't make fun of anyone, it doesn;t make fun or put anyone down.  It takes the themes from the previous film and gives them a very original and fun twist. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is one movie in the world that has every reason to be on this list of 100 movies to watch before you die, it is "The Thing," the brilliant 1977 film by James Cameron, a film that is not only the ultimate sci-fi disaster movie, it also has everything going for it: a fascinating protagonist, a compelling plot, a terrifying but ultimately rewarding creature, and a stellar score by John Williams. If you've ever dreamed of being a space-going scientist, this is the film for you. The main character, played by actor Ron Cobb, is a young scientist who becomes involved in an alien invasion when he is hired to study the creatures. His mission, however, takes him to a far-off planet, and he is separated from his crew in an accident that causes him to develop a unique telepathic power. Thereafter, Cobb is subjected to constant torment from the aliens, forcing him to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his fellow scientists from the destruction that he and his fellow alien scientists have caused. The Thing is a sci- fi horror movie that has everything that you could ask for in a sci fi film: an interesting plot with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, an awesome and intimidating creature, a cool and creepy soundtrack by John Milius, and some truly scary moments. If the story doesn't freak you out, there's always that great and chilling music by John Carpenter. I guarantee that you will watch this movie a hundred times, and your brain will be screaming, "What in the hell is that?!"

You can see the cop in the back of the cop car trying to make the U turn, he keeps getting stuck behind the cars and just crashes into the car in front of him and they go off at the same time. The scene is worth watching. I give it 10/10. If you are watching this movie because you want to see a lot of people getting shot, I can't help you there. However, if you love action movies and you like the shootout, I recommend this movie! _________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Breathless has great action sequences with an interesting story, well-paced action and some good pacing. A good action movie with interesting characters, a good mix of comedy and action and a well-balanced story. There are a lot of action sequences and there are some interesting characters.  It is a bit long but that was to be expected of a movie that is over two hours long. The only negative I have with the movie is the characters. It feels like there is a large disconnect between the people the film follows and how they act, and it does cause some problems with how the movie builds up the tension throughout. That said, the movie was enjoyable and a lot less depressing than I expected. Overall:    Overall, I thought Breathless was an enjoyable action film. It was pretty exciting and had lots of good characters and good action scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** My friends and I decided to go to an after party for my friend's birthday. As you might remember from my first film, we were both extremely drunk by the time we found our way there. We were told that they had a room reserved for us and that we would have to wait for it to be available. We waited patiently for an hour. When I was finally told to come out, I was extremely disappointed to find that the room was occupied. I made the mistake of sitting on the couch in the middle of a crowd. I was immediately surrounded by women, who began flirting with me and touching me. I quickly learned that this was a very bad idea, so I stood up and attempted to leave. The women, of course, followed me and tried to follow me to my car, where I was attempting to hide. One of them tried to grab my car keys and drove away in my car. We had no idea what was going on and were both very confused. After another hour of waiting and wondering who was going to make the best out of this situation, we decided to just get dressed and walk out. We walked the whole way home. We got there at around 5:30 and had to wait another 30 minutes until we were able to walk out of the house. By this time, I had vomited once and felt very sick. As we were leaving the house, my friend who I had been flirting and groping had started to follow us. We both looked at each other and realized that he was following us because he wanted to get in the car with us. I refused to let him get in and he refused to walk away. We eventually found our car and continued on our way. I walked at a very slow speed. My friend, who was extremely drunk, was very scared. He kept telling me how to "keep it together," and not to get too close to anybody, etc. I eventually reached my car and got in. My girlfriend came with me but she was extremely uncomfortable with what was happening and just sat there. I tried to play the part of the nice guy, as a friend of my friends had come with me. We finally arrived home. On our way home, my girlfriend noticed me checking my phone every five minutes and told me that I was going crazy. I had gotten to the point that I actually asked her why I was texting my friend. She told me I was just checking the messages. We decided

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ "This film is an absolute joy to watch, and a wonderful addition to the "Star Wars" canon. The movie opens with a thrilling opening title sequence, including two of the greatest songs in cinema history, "The Imperial March" and "Return of the Jedi." The first film, which was an epic about Darth Vader, would have been a perfect entry point to this new universe. For the sequel, however, it was important to give us a bit more background to the world of The Force. George Lucas takes us back to the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and Rebel Alliance and the formation of the First Order, a rag tag, militaristic, and militarized army that seems to be the culmination of the Empire's attempts to suppress the Rebel Alliance. The First Order is made up of several different factions, all of which want to take control of the galaxy. We're given a nice look at the First of the "Infinity Squad," which includes a group of Stormtroopers from the Resistance. They are portrayed with a great sense of humor and are very friendly, while at the same time they are very capable soldiers. There's also a whole host of Stormfronts that have taken up residence in the Resistance hideouts and bases around the galaxy, including The Blackout, a group who seem to have a very strong political agenda and are in fact led by a malevolent Baron. These were some of the most enjoyable and engaging elements of the film, and were some great opportunities for George Lucas to give the audience more context to the story, as well as more humor and lightness to the tone. The first act of the movie was a lot of action and excitement, and the third act has more character development and story. While it's easy to compare the first film to "Return," the second has a lot more to say and takes place years later and offers much more in the way of character development, which is great. It's a shame that the third film isn't as visually impressive, as the characters are more fully realized, and much more complex than they were in the first two films. If you liked the first films, then you'll definitely enjoy this movie, but the first one also offered a lot to discuss and give a reason to continue seeing the films. __________________________________________________________ Posted by Chris R at 2:52 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There have been no truly great films about the Vietnam War. All that has been accomplished by a series of low budget indies is to allow filmmakers to talk about it and then to take it back to the studio. The film's narrative structure works, but the character work by the actors is far too flabby for a film with such a big scope."  -  Gavin Hood, The Guardian  on The Last Days  (reviewed for the website by Tom Spina, who was in Vietnam himself),  3/8/14 "One must understand why the movie is so moving, why it resonates so strongly with so many people, when it is a film that could only exist as a small studio production."   -  David Ayer, New York Times film critic (7/20/14) "The Last Days Of Vietnam is not a film you can buy. It's not a blockbuster. It doesn't ask for the attention of millions, it is not an experience that is only for a few. It is not even a film about Vietnam. It simply is. I wish that its makers had made it for the same reasons, but they made it because it is, and always will be, an extraordinary film. It speaks to us as well, and is able to speak to us both in a simple and powerful way. And it speaks to the truth about the war itself, and the reality of its victims, and that is something that will, I think, continue to remain powerful and important." - Gareth Evans (writer of the 2014 film The Raid: Redemption ) on why he was glad the film was made in the first place,  7/23/14
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The new Ghostbusters is hilarious and scary. It's not quite a remake of the old Ghostbusters but it's funny and not so much an original. It makes you laugh but doesn't overdo it. The film was fun and has a lot of good acting and direction. A lot of fun for a silly movie. I recommend this to everyone who likes Ghostbusters and the Ghostbusters are one of my favorite movies of all time and the new Ghostbusters just keeps the spirit of that film alive.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight Rises is one of the great blockbusters of modern times. The story is quite dark and the effects are fantastic. It also contains some great acting, although I think Heath Ledger was the best performance of the two. It is a great film that I would recommend for the family.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The Great Wall is probably the most visually stunning action film I've ever seen. The story revolves around a Chinese army of soldiers defending a border with Japan during World War II. The characters and their surroundings are impressive to look at and the animation is pretty amazing. The fights, especially the ones against the giant monsters, are just insane. This is probably my favorite film to show off the Playstation 3, especially with the motion controls (more like virtual controls) since this was such a great movie to show them off on.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  "The Man Who Fell to Earth" is a great example of how a great concept can be ruined by the poor execution. It has to be in the top five of the best science fiction movies ever made. It is also a rare film in that is made as a direct sequel to the very first movie made and in most cases, an updated take on that film. It goes to great lengths to follow the original, in fact it tries to make it more realistic by adding a lot of technology to the story.  The problem lies in its execution. The movie starts off very well by using a few familiar elements from the first movie, like the android (Robert Hays) and a space station. The first thing you notice when you go into this movie is that it is clearly meant to be seen in IMAX. This can be a bit confusing at first because the opening sequence is just a bunch of static and the only thing moving is the ship, and that is only a couple of shots. As you progress through the movie however, you begin to understand why the movies look like this, the main characters are clearly meant as stand in characters to show how this movie would have to look, this is a very expensive movie to make, so I really cannot blame the filmmakers for making it look like it. -The opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the movie  After the opening, we get what I thought the movie was going to be, and I was wrong. The idea of the alien landing in the middle of the ocean was intriguing and really well executed. The problem with it is that the audience doesn't get to see this. The aliens land and land in a very small patch of land and quickly disappear. The only time you see them is when they are just floating in the ocean and a scientist looks at them. This is the first half of the film. The second half of this movie introduces the concept of time travel. The main character, Tom Noonan (Jeff Goldblum) is sent back in time to 1973 and has to do a lot to save his future son and also his family. He is then sent back again in an attempt to stop the destruction of the planet by the evil scientist, played by Clive Revill (and his famous character from E.T. he is basically a clone of). He is sent to 1973, and while there he tries to figure out who he is in this time and in the future

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There are a couple of little problems, as it would have been really helpful if they hadn't wasted so much time on the first part of the story. In the first half, the narrative has some interesting ideas, and is very well-paced. In fact, the film is so well-thought-out and has so many excellent ideas that it just never seems to get around to really exploring any of them. The other problem I have with this film is how it is over-hyped. I'm not the biggest fan of John Hughes films, but I really was expecting something pretty special in this one, and I don't feel like I got that here. At all. Even in my very negative review, I found the film to be a really enjoyable watch."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. What's your favorite? Mine? Let's see: -The Matrix (1999). That's a hard one. I saw it in the theater at midnight. I was only in third grade when the movie came out and I still remember the fear it caused for me, as I was the only one who was able to sit through the entire movie at once. It's such a great story, the first movie of the series and it was great to be part of the story. I can see it is the best in the series so far. -The Usual Suspects (1995). It's a thriller that is a bit slow at times. It could have been great, but it is probably the worst movie of 1995. It has some great action, but also has some really bad dialogue. I still love it though. -Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). It was a pretty good film. It had some great acting and some nice action. It was also a pretty solid Kung Fu film. There are other films that I would rather have seen than Crouching, but this one is one of my favorites. -Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). I watched this movie way back in 2000 and it gave me the greatest "Wow!" moments of my entire life. The first time I saw Darth Maul in that scene, I was like "Holy shit! That is something." I am so glad I watched it back when it was still the newest film. I didn't get to see this one until recently when I decided to rent it. It is a great film and it is amazing that the first one ever in the franchise still holds up as well as it does. It also had the best special effects, ever. _______________.  I think you will enjoy this movie if you are into action, sci fi, martial arts, and the whole action genre. The story is well written and it has a great cast. This movie is not for the weak of heart and should definitely be watched if you like action movies. You can pick it up for $14.99 on iTunes or DVD. I have already seen it three times in the theaters, and I have never missed a beat. I hope you like it as much as I do.  The DVD:  -Starring John Leguizamo as The Man with the Dragon Tattoo  -"John LeguIZO" as The Penguin

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather is probably the greatest movie ever made. It is also one of my all time favorite movies. And it is the movie I am discussing here. It was released in 1972, just one year after The Godfather. In addition to being a wonderful film, The Godmother  also happens to be a very memorable and well-written novel. I am not going to get into the entire plot of the book, just a brief review. I read it for the first time in high school, in the mid-1970's. This novel takes place at the end of the 1960's, which is about the time my own family began growing up. The novel takes about 25 years after the events of the films, and is a love story that deals with the trials and tribulations of a marriage between two people who are very much in love. The story begins in 1972. In 1971, Michael Corleone, the son of a New York crime family, goes to live with his mother in the suburbs of New Jersey. His new stepfather is Al DiMeola, who runs the DiMeoleo crime family. His mother's family is the Gorgos, who are family from his father's past. Michael, his mother and his stepfather take up residence in a house on the outskirts of a small town. They are about to have a child, whom they name Michael, after his father. Michael has been living with his stepmother since their marriage, and she has been helping him. They have been living for quite some time when Michael is suddenly confronted by a man he did not know at all, and who does not resemble him at all. His real father has passed away, and he now is dealing with his father and stepfather. This man is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He asks for money for a family trip to Las Vegas. Michael does not have any money, and decides to make the best of a bad situation. He and his mother go to Las Palmas, and spend a lot of time with the Golanos. He meets a girl named Francesca, whom he likes, and the Golandos become quite fond of him. When it comes time to leave, he is given a small sum of money. They all go back to New Jersey and make up their story, and they become much closer. When Michael leaves, he finds out that Francesca's family lives a little way from the Goloos, and has a very

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* I was not expecting to enjoy this movie so much, but I did! The movie had a nice story-line, but it was short. It was a nice change from the "Giant Spider" series. The only bad thing I found about this movie was the annoying "evil" aliens. I understand there are some bad people out there, but they were not as bad as "the good guys". One thing that I love about this film, is that the character interactions were good! In addition to the love triangle that was made, it seemed to be the same for all the characters. I felt the movie had an ending that worked well. Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie. It had a very nice feel to it and I had fun watching it!  Reviewed by: J.D. Johnson from WEST COAST FLORIDA on 10/19/2011

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, A lot of guys have sex. And it's just as satisfying. It feels good. But what about love? What about...more  MOVIE REVIEW: JUNE 21, 2007 - 4.3/5   THE WILDS OF WONDERLAND was made in 1986, which is only the second full-length animated film to have been released before 1999. The animation style is a bit dated and the characters are pretty weak. Still, this is a decent animated comedy with a couple good gags.   Ralph Fiennes is the titular wizard and is played by the legendary James Stewart. Fiennes plays a wizard who is so powerful and smart that he is called a "Wizard of Wizardry" in the town he lives in. He is married to Elle. But he is also the most miserable wizard in all of fantasy. His wife's name is Louise. She is a sorceress who was once the wife of the main hero. It turns out that she is actually an evil sorceress. She has her own minions, called the "Sniffles". She is the reason Ralph Fiennes has an annoying habit of sniffing his food before eating it. Louise has no choice but to put him on an egg-shell and pretend to be a nice wife. This is a small point, but it is the same kind of thing as what people who are fat and ugly do, but that's a whole different story.   beau has a pet dog named Barney. He's about the same age as Ralph Fiemsons, who also has a dog named Ralph Fiemmes. They have a good relationship.   The only other noteworthy character is a human named Elle, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's like a witch-like character with her hair all over the place and is constantly looking in Ralph's kitchen. She tries to seduce Ralph with magic, but he never gets involved. I would have preferred that they made this a three-part story. Also, I think Ralph Fiemenss should have died.  I love Ralph Fiemanss, his friends and his wife, Louise. His life is one long adventure to find himself and he just seems to be running around. I've seen Ralph Fieme s movie. He was a great part of the magic that made the W.W. II movies so enjoyable. I think he could be an even better character. Ralph Fiemis is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What is there not to like?" is not a valid answer to that question, but it seems to be the response to the question, "Where did the bad parts of the movie come from?" Well, that is a good question, and we don't have a definitive answer to it, but here are three possible answers.  The first answer:  That I am too familiar with this subject to be able to really criticize it. It's a film I've seen many times, and I haven't changed much with it over the years. The bad actors don't get much better, and the dialogue is not always that interesting, but this is a film that you can watch over and over, and you still find it to be entertaining. I suppose what I am trying to say here is that I don't really understand why anyone would not watch this film. It has a nice old-fashioned story about a couple who are going on a vacation to a secluded country cottage and run into the most strange and unpleasant encounter with a group of "friends". The film is so long, in fact, that it's hard to follow exactly what is going on, and there is a scene where the two characters have an argument and the "friends" leave. The character of the wife is portrayed by Margaret McMurphy, a very good actress, and she is the perfect fit for the part. Her character is somewhat of an unknown quantity, and her character really helps the film in other ways as well. The two leads are, of course, the two men playing the two "friends", and both are also excellent actors. I do enjoy the way they are played, both of them, and they are also not the only good actors in the film. All of the supporting characters are well played, and some of the best actors that have appeared in a long time are in this film (Tom Cruise and Dennis Hopper, two of the biggest stars of the day). I suppose it is a little disappointing, but not terribly, that they are not really able to do anything in the way of a character development, but that's something we will see in their later films (although I don,t know if that is really a bad thing). Overall, I think that The Country House is a pleasant enough film, and certainly worth a watch. I have nothing but good things to say about it, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in some good old fashioned
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Airbender is a wonderful tale about a young boy who is raised by a giant, and who discovers his unique connection to the earth's surface in this epic adventure.  The story is not just one of adventure but of friendship, respect for those around him and the power of the earth.  Every character has their unique characteristics, some more so than others.  Some of the main characters are a little annoying, as they do not give themselves enough to play off of.  However, this does not detract from the story.  Each character has a story that is not told, but shown to the reader.  This can be a bad thing at times, but it has to be taken in consideration when you look back on the story and its characters.  When the story is good, it is amazing.  Its characters are unique, its story is powerful and the world is so rich with detail.  You can not help but love it. The music in the movie is very good, but there are some moments where it does not do the scene justice.  It is a shame, because the music is well done, and well thought out.  There is no bad moments with the music.  Overall, The Last Air Bender is one of those movies that can not be missed, if you haven't seen it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Godfather: Part III" is a great finale to a great film. I'll miss this classic, and the movie-within-a-movie that is this movie...the infamous P.S. If you can watch a movie that's about murder and betrayal without feeling guilty about it, I recommend you watch this. The following film review is a spoiler Free review of The Godfather III: Part 3.  It can be seen after the end credits. A lot has been said about this film, and some people might think this movie is a bad film.  I don't know if they're right.   There's a lot to like in this film; it has a lot of laughs, it's fun, it moves along well, and it's pretty damn good.  There are some things that I'm not sure about, though, and I'd like to get all of my questions answered before I can give my honest opinion.  This is an action film, which means it takes a lot for it to be fun, and this is not without its issues.  But I think people who are interested in this movie will enjoy it.  The movie follows the third instalment in the "Godfather" series, and we follow Vito Corleone as he goes about his business.  Like the first two films, we see Vito through the eyes of the audience, and there are some changes to this film.   For one thing, he is more cynical, and he has no problem going to any lengths to keep the money coming.  We get a lot more of a sense of Vito's personal life than in the first film. He has to deal with the death of his mother and he also goes through the loss of his lover, but it's not a big deal.  He also loses his best friend, and like with most things in life, it makes no difference to him.  I found this film to be a lot better than the previous films, but at times, the movie will take an awful lot of turns.  If you like the first films, you'll love this film as well, but if you hate the first three films, don't watch this, or you'll probably hate it as well.  What you can say is that it's well-acted and the acting is very good.   The story is still great, even though it's a little bit lighter than

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ Review: There is no other way of describing The Wolf Of Wall Street than 'awesome'. We are not just talking about the fact that the movie is very well made, with good performances and a well written script. The Wolf of Wall Street is a movie filled with incredible moments of acting. It is filled with high moments of plot twists and turns. It also has the best plot of any movie in the last decade. It has a lot of emotions. There are so many great characters who have a lot to do in the movie. The main character is an amazing character who will go on to become an action movie legend. The movie has amazing visuals and music. One of the best scenes of the movie involves Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jordan Belfort. The character of Jordan Belfiore is very good and you would love to see more of him. The film is filled to the brim with amazing moments. One scene involves Leonardo playing a piano with a beautiful woman. He asks her out and she asks him back. They get into a heated discussion about love. Then the woman reveals that she is the daughter of one of Belfiores friends and her father will not speak to her again. Jordan and his friend agree to do it. The scene is beautifully shot and the music is beautiful as well. The entire movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is not just about the money, but it is also a movie about people and about money. The most amazing thing about the movie? It doesn't use the 'bad guys' to make the movie, it uses the money of the 'good guys' and they are portrayed in a perfect way. The people in the film are very likable and funny at the same time. One memorable scene has the main characters sitting outside on a street and then a car pulls up. It takes Jordan and Jordan's friend to the scene. After Jordan gets out of the car, he is shot in the back of the head by the men. The man in the car then goes on to kill Jordan's other friend. In the middle of the scene, a young girl comes up and gives Jordan some money to pay the man for his act. The young girl then tells Jordan that he did a good thing and that it will be the best day of his life. This girl becomes Jordan's love interest in the next scene. The best part of this movie? The ending. After an amazing film, Wolf of
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ It's hard to put a negative spin on a movie that's really good. The story is a lot of fun. The acting is good. I liked the concept and the action was really good too. There were plenty of laughs. I found the music a little repetitive. It seemed like a lot was going on in this film and it was hard to keep track. It was a lot like The Muppets, but it's not a Muppet movie. I'm sure the next one will be better. I have a feeling it will be a hit! Overall: ____________________________________  Director: Kevin Smith The Muppet Movie Review It's really hard to find something to hate about Kevin Smith. It's been said that Smith is the one filmmaker that can make a movie as good as it looks. That's not the only thing that has been said about him. Smith's movies are extremely well-received by critics. There are plenty of reviews of The Mummy and Sucker Punch that are extremely positive. Even if you aren't one of those people, there are plenty more reviews to go by that have been very positive. Smith has also been criticized for making movies like Chasing Amy, Dogma and Serenity which all look like they were made by a 5th grader. The only time Smith can truly be criticized is for the fact that he hasn't directed a movie yet. He did work on a TV show for years which was a nice experience, but he hasn a long way to go to be considered a great director. The fact that The Moolah Man is so well-reviewed proves that Smith still has plenty of movie-making experience to his name, but I don't think it's going to be a problem for him to create his own unique style of directing. Smith does a great job of bringing out the horror aspects of The mummy and is able to make the movie not only fun to watch, but funny and scary at the same time. The plot of the film is that an evil wizard is trying to make a baby mummy and he needs a mummy to do it. Unfortunately, his mother died. The mummy has been kept in a dark dungeon for 3 years and the wizard needs to be revived to find a new way to resurrect the mummy. This evil wizard's mother had a secret lover, the mummy's evil brother who is the only person who knows the mummy is dead. The boy who is being raised by the mummy (Sid

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ This movie is a real work of art. A real film noir. A film for true lovers of noir movies, which is probably why it hasn't been made before (or at least, I hope it won't be, it's a great movie). The plot is simple, the story is fantastic. The story takes place in a crime ridden city, where the main character is a young man named Alex. Alex is on the run from his criminal brother in law, named Al, who wants him dead. As Alex is being chased by Al, he is approached by a prostitute named Laura, who offers Alex a job working at her brothel, "The Rose" - an underground sex den where prostitutes do their work, without any interference. The main theme of the film is the idea of the sex trade, but it is not about the sexual acts, but rather the human beings behind the scenes. The sex is an element, but is there just as much to watch as the action. It is a movie that is not only beautifully filmed, but also a great watch. The ending is very well done and sets up for the next film in the series, which I'm sure will be just as good. The music is fantastic as well. It makes the movie just a little more dark, but in a good way. It has the right mix of suspense, mystery, and humor. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great noir, like I do. I loved this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ _________  The Best Newcomers to Watch in 2013!  What we think:  "The world was in an uproar over the news that the film would be shot entirely in North Korea and its most popular actor had just landed in Hollywood for a high-profile role in "The Interview," an action thriller to be released on Christmas Day.  After all, it's not every day that an iconic star makes a cameo in a Western, but the "Overseas Crew" of North Korean movie stars, actors and film industry insiders made a very nice surprise for their countrymen back home."  This film is very different from anything you have seen before. North Korea is well known for its film industry but this is the first time that such a large number of them are on a film set together.  the stars make a very good film that is worth watching in any language:  a lot of people say that North Korea has a low standard of film making, but this film has something that no other film has: A very strong story.  on his return to North Korea in 2012, Park said,  I really don't know if there are any foreign films that have a story like this that show North Koreans as human beings.  in a typical drama, the characters are created to look like normal humans in order to get the audience to follow the story but, in "A Better Tomorrow", the cast is not just normal, but is portrayed as characters you would meet in real life. . I am not a film expert, but I like watching this film very much. This is one of the best films that I have seen recently. The only criticism I have is that the movie has a good plot, but not much action, so a lot is missing. There is also a lack of depth in the plot which was also a reason I couldn't see the film in cinemas.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This is a movie I watched just once on TV, when I was about 13 years old. It was the last movie the producer and I had worked on together before she died and it's the only movie she ever directed and produced. I've always been a big fan of her other films and this one was the only one she ever did for TV. It's a great film for many reasons. The special effects are amazing, especially for a film from the 70s. You have to see it to believe it. The acting is top notch and I loved the supporting cast too. They all had different aspects to them and made it interesting. You won't see too many scenes from each of the three kids, but each of them are given their proper time. I think a lot of the story is told in flashbacks or from the POV of a character who was around when this happened. And of course, there is the main villain, who is really bad. I enjoyed the film and I highly recommend it to anyone who is into science fiction or space fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My friend and I rented this on Friday and Saturday night and really enjoyed the movie.  The movie was excellent and the story and the characters were all very likable and well developed.  There was a bit of "hanging out" humor in the movie but it wasn't annoying.  I also really liked the ending with the love triangle between Nick, Sarah, and Emily (all great characters).  I hope to see more from this great movie!  What made the movie great: This movie had some awesome actors in it including David Patrick Kelly and Mark Ruffalo.  It was a great action movie with some great fight scenes.  The movie also had a great story line which was really well told.   I really liked how all the characters felt like real people.  This movie had great action and really good acting.  I would recommend this movie to any fan of action movies and any fans of the tv show Heroes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The third and last part in the "Eccentric" trilogy! This time you'll have to help Shindou rescue the princess that is currently being held prisoner! In order to do this, the protagonist will have to go out and save the princess! Is he ready to go and get her, or should he take his time and save her in the meantime? What happens when the hero realizes that the princess was actually kidnapped by her own people?! This is what makes this series great, it has it's ups and downs, but they are always good, the series never lets up or loses its intensity. There are some times that you might wonder if this is going to be the last chapter in this series, however I can guarantee that you will not find a better one in the future. And it will never get old watching this anime!

It is brilliant. They make the most of their unique character to create a fascinating and clever plot that has something for everybody. It's about the people at the center of this small town and their love for one another. In this, they are completely on the front lines for a great war to happen. As the war gets closer, the people in the town are more and more concerned about who is responsible. Written by Peter Mancuso

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Funny People' is a very funny, if not very well done movie. I loved the ending, especially the funny, and heartwarming scene with the baby, but it was a little sad that the baby had to die so early in the film. It just wasn't done right, and that's what really got me. It's one thing to have a funny ending, but having a happy ending, and a happy baby, that's the most special ending. The ending in the end is just very rushed and very short, with no buildup. The movie just seemed like a waste of a good script, and the ending leaves much to be desired. I really don't think the writers for this movie did their homework. They probably only watched a few of their TV shows for reference, and decided that this was a good story to go on and try to make into a movie. The main problem with this film is that it really does not seem to have much of a plot. The story seemed very rushed, and rushed to the point where I had no idea what the big deal was about. The characters were all very different from each other, and they all had a very different attitude to life. The actors did a great job of bringing the characters to life, but the story just really lacked any focus. It is a good start, but I would like to see a better movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ How to Make a Good Movie. This is the most comprehensive and easy to follow movie making resource I've ever read. As a long time filmmaker (10 years), I've learned a lot from this book. It's just fun to read!  I've read a few books by other filmmakers, but this one is hands-down the best.  A fun read and great resource! - Tim Lebbon  As a filmmaker, I would be hard pressed to recommend a more complete, comprehensive, and easy-to-read movie making book. - Steve Hirsch  This is an amazing resource for any filmmaker. - Eric Carle  An extremely comprehensive book about how to make a good film. - Ben Stiller  If you are going to work as a filmmaker I highly recommend this book to you. I loved it. - Paul Reiser  Filled with useful info, insights and stories. Highly recommend it! - James Gunn  The only book I've read on how to create a good story, that I think you'll like. A great read! - Joss Whedon  Excellent book! This book will help you make a short movie. - Sean Tejada  What I like best about this book is that you can take what you learn and apply it to other aspects of your filmmaking. For example, I think of a scene like the chase scene in Pulp Fiction. That's because it's a very long chase scene, but when you understand how to shoot a scene and what to shoot, you can then apply those skills to other parts of the movie. This book is also great for someone who's new to filmmaking because it explains everything from the perspective of someone who is just starting out. I think this book should be required reading for any aspiring filmmaker. It really helps filmmakers become better filmmakers, and I recommend it highly! - Robert Rodriguez  Thanks to John for writing this book, and to the other authors for making it a reality. - James Cameron  So helpful to know all of the technical details behind your camera's settings, lighting, lens, etc. - Mike Nichols  My friend and I made a short film from his book and I loved watching it. It helps you understand the filmmaking process and allows you to use the filmmaking tools you learned in this book! - John Hughes  John and I are working on a short animation that utilizes everything that I've been taught about
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The title of this movie was a bit misleading. The movie did not focus on the hero's childhood, but on the childhood of his father, the president of the Philippines. The president's son is a normal child, he wants to do normal things like go to school, and then his father takes him to an island, where they play. As a child, I always wanted to play with my dad's toys, even though we were both busy and busy kids. The dad would be taking us to play, and my brother would stand by him with a toy, so that we could play together. I knew, that he was a dad, so it didn't matter that I would have to play by myself. But even as a kid, I knew that I wanted to have a role in my father's work. After I watched the movie, I realized that, it really had all been my childhood dream. This movie will be something special for me.

Reviewer: jonah_the_blaze - favorite favorite favorite - June 26, 2004  Subject: I loved this so much.... When I first saw this I loved it, I thought it had such great story lines. But then I thought to myself it was great that we were on the run and this movie had a little bit of everything. It was a fast paced film with great acting and a cool looking city on the screen. The action was great. The ending was also great. But I must say this is the only one of the three that I actually liked. The other two I thought were way over the top. - June 25, 2004I loved this but I had trouble with the endings  Review of the movie:   Well I'm sure that you've seen the reviews for the other two movies and there's no question that the characters and the script are very, very good. But this one seems to take it up a notch with more drama and more action. It's all set in a deserted city in the desert so there's a bit of desert in it and the movie is really about the journey they go through. I like the film a lot but I could not figure out the ending. The three main characters are on a run from the cops and in a bad situation. So they go to a desert city and that's where I thought the ending was... It's just a weird end. It doesn't really fit in with what is happening or what the characters are going through at all.   The action is really, really good though. And even though I couldn't figure out what happened in the ending, I was still very happy with the film. It had a lot to offer in a 3 hours and 30 minute film. - May 7, 2004The other 2 weren't bad, but this was a gem!  was too much   - April 26, 2003It's too much

The new trailer for Batman V Superman was just released, and I've seen the new one a couple times now. I was really happy with it. The cast is very good, the story is good, and the special effects are amazing! This looks like a movie I will keep coming back to. I haven't heard much about Suicide Squad, but if I were to see that movie then this would be my second choice. I hope to see more superhero films, because I love these films, and these characters! Now that the new trailer is out, I can see why it is my favorite trailer! I really liked how they showed the other side of the movie. I am still a Batman fan, so this trailer was nice to see. I think I am going to buy this movie, and will have it for my son.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has a great story, it has some amazing visuals, the soundtrack is great, the acting is pretty good.  I thought it was a good film and if you enjoyed the previous films in the franchise it is pretty much the same as the first one except that instead of going to Atlantis and getting a dog as the main character that lives underwater, this time they're in the woods and get a horse.  There was no other movie I saw that has the same theme or concept as the earlier films in this series.  The story is very simple.  It is a guy that comes to a remote island that has been deserted for a few years and he ends up having a magical encounter with a magic mirror.  This is where the movie goes from a film to a long form mystery.   The problem with this is that the ending isn't very well written.  First of all it's very cheesy and second it just comes out of nowhere.  A lot of questions are left hanging but the film just doesn't have enough to really make it work.  If you want to see an original story with a cool story and some great visuals, this is a great one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this film and so did my brother. My only real complaint is that it was a little too long.

It's a pretty fun movie. It does a great job of getting you to remember that we all live in the same reality. And, despite the fact that you are being hacked by computers, the story doesn't get too heavy. Instead, the characters are very human and, if you're willing to take a few minutes of your time, you'll be more than ready to laugh and smile at the same time.

A friend told me that I should watch the original The Shining and then The Exorcist. I had a difficult time seeing them for whatever reason. I think I've seen all of them now, but I don't think I have. I've been a big fan of horror movies for a long time now, since the original Evil Dead. So it's an honor to watch this. I'm in love with it.  I thought the music was awesome and the story was well done. There were moments in the film that were really eerie. It's definitely a film that I think would be awesome to watch over and over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great flick, it was great to watch. I really liked the film, I thought it was well done and I love this film! This is the best film in the series and I highly recommend it.   Rating:   5 out of 5 This film takes place in the year of the dragon, it has a very dark and grimy feeling to it, you really get the feeling that something terrible has happened. The character's story line is very well done. I felt a little bad for the main characters and I think they should have had a happier ending. It's a pretty bleak movie. The story was good, there wasn't much plot but I still felt a sense of despair in it and I really felt for the characters. Rating: 3 out of 4 This is quite the amazing film, it's not the best but it's my favourite! I felt that there was a really amazing and very dark plotline to it. I think it was good. It has quite a dark and gritty feel to it and some really good performances from the actors. The film is well made and I thought that it had a great ending! Rating:  The movie is really good, it starts off dark and really dark, but then it moves into the light and it becomes a bit of a comedy. I found the movie to be very funny, I really enjoyed it! Rating :  This was an extremely creepy and dark movie, there is some dark, and depressing themes to it which you just feel really bad for, it really was a very bad experience. I thought the plot was pretty awful! Rating = 1 out of 2

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Happiness, not a bad movie at all. It takes us on an experience that's a mixture of the good, bad and the ugly.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.     It is a sad day in the life of an orphaned child and her guardian.   He was in love with her when they were young and then he married a rich woman and her mother came and took her from him and now he is no longer able to see her.  He also wants her to be his wife. But she doesn't want to be.  She's a nice person but she hates to be touched.  At the same time the old man is a big fan of her and wants to marry her but she doesn\'t want to marry him.  They decide that the only way for them to survive is to start a family of their own and try to raise a child.  We don't really get to know what happened with the previous couple and we can't really say if the guardian was married or not.  Then we get to see what happens to a mother and her child. We meet the new mother as she is about to give birth.  The movie starts with her being told how cute her baby is.  And the child looks like him too.  After the child is born the new parents find out he's not really their baby.  It's actually the old woman's.  How do we know that?  This is the first hint that this movie could have been even better if they had gone with something like A Boy and His Dog or perhaps Something's Coming.  That film follows a similar plot line but with a different character, I just thought that the same character was used more in the story.  A Boy And His Dog has some great comedy scenes but the story is pretty good too.  When she finally finds out, the woman tries to make a deal with the child\'s mother.  Now she's trying to get her money back and the mother has nothing to say to her. But then the woman finally realizes that the child doesn\' t want anything to do with them.  They are kind of like a pair of strangers.   The old woman is very upset by what happened and doesn\'T want to see the child again.  But it\'s too late.  One day the child decides he wants to see his father again. When the child

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ My father saw this movie at an airport and it stayed in my head. So I did the movie and it's okay but I would never recommend it to people who like action, action, and more action. It's good for when you're bored in the afternoon and want to go out and do a bit of running and shooting. It has a few very good scenes and some good acting. The plot is rather simple. It involves some bad guys and good guys and some bad people. The bad people are bad in that they do evil things. The good people are good in that we really get to know them. They have no flaws. They're not just bad people who need to be stopped and saved from themselves. They really are decent people who just do what they're told. There are also people who are good people who have no bad in them, who have good ideas and ideals, who care about people and want them to be good, who make mistakes, who go along with the system when it's convenient, and who make the ultimate sacrifice for the right reason. The movie is told from two perspectives. The first is the eyes of the bad guys. These are guys who are so evil, so nasty, so evil that you almost believe they're the ones who are doing the wrong thing. One of the more interesting characters is the hero, the good guy with no flaws or failings. He's a young man who doesn't know he's a hero until someone gives him his first gun and he has to go do what he's told and not ask questions. That's probably why I liked him so much. And then there is the viewpoint of the good guys. They all seem good and the guys are all very likable. Even the bad guy. In my opinion they're all just kind of good. There's a point where the evil guys come and attack a village in a war with other countries. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in a theater. I've seen films like that and they're not bad but they're just awful. This movie takes a lot of the best parts of them and combines them with the worst parts of all the other movies. And it's not good at all. The acting is very bad. I thought some of the actors were a little over the top. Even one of them is very over the Top. The story is awful. The setting is awful and there are no people in it. But I

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I have been told, 'A lot of people will come in and try to start talking about the plot.' I've never done that, and have always wanted to talk about what we were doing. So, I'd like to thank the director of it, David Rabe, for keeping a good plot to the film, and for the wonderful acting. We have lots of fun. This is a funny and a nice time. [Laughs] I really do love the sound effects. They are great."  In this review, we'll hear a lot about the film's special effects. The studio used an unusual lighting technique that gave the film its unique look. The film is about a man and his dog who visit the beach to do some fishing. The man is missing his legs and has been left on a deserted beach. His dog can't swim and gets swept off in the current. The dog gets out to search for him and finds a mysterious statue that appears to be some sort of ancient idol. What this statue really is, we never learn.  For the most part, the film is quite enjoyable. As long as you stay in the mood the first few minutes, you'll enjoy the film. It has some good laughs as well as some poignant moments of the man and the dog's attempts to reunite him with his legs. The movie also includes some scenes that could be considered quite long, but are quite amusing at the time.  and  There is no question about the excellence of the film: it's really one of those films that's just plain fun to watch. The lighting and special effects really make it worth checking out. -CG
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ "What the fuck is wrong with me?" This is the first question the protagonist of the original Ghostbusters movie, Ray Stantz, asks himself as he looks out over New York City from his apartment window. The question is asked and answered in a way that we've all asked ourselves at some point or another. This is something that a lot of movie-goers have asked themselves before they have watched the movie for the first time. It is the main theme of the movie and it is the reason that this movie has remained fresh throughout its lifetime. What is the problem? The main character in the original movie is a New York cop who has been assigned to the case of a "ghostly murder" that has taken place in New York's Times Square. The police chief, a gruff, sarcastic man, is so consumed with the investigation that he is missing his normal life, which he had before his assignment to the Times Square murder. At this point, it is quite obvious that he has lost his mind and the film takes place over the course of a couple days. The only clue that the police have is a video surveillance tape of a pair of young boys playing in Times Square at the time of the murder. The tape is found and taken to the detective, who decides that the only person who could have committed the murder is this pair of boys and they must be apprehended. Once the boys are apprehended, their dad (Ray Stantz) and the chief of police become involved. The story goes on as the two men try to unravel the mystery of the crime, but the two characters eventually find themselves on opposing sides in the investigation. This leads to a very interesting, and, in my opinion, one of the best movie endings in movie history. The scene I want to highlight comes towards the end of the film when the boys have been released and the boys' dad is in the room discussing what happened and his reaction. The character of the kids' father is an interesting one, who in my mind is a mirror image of the late Ray St.antz. The main difference is that the boy's dad is much older and he is quite jaded with everything in his life. He spends the entire film complaining about the city, the police, and his own son's lack of interest in his work. It's clear that this father is dealing with some kind of illness that is making him seem so old. There is nothing much to go on about this father in the movie, but

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I have a copy of this movie. It's a great flick for fans of good '80s cheesy slasher movies. I was glad to find this on DVD in my local video shop.I thought the movie was a lot of fun, and the characters were all unique and fun to watch. It was a nice mix of scary and funny (not a ton of humor, but you'll find it) and that's what made the movie really stand out from the rest of the 80s slasher films. I'm not a fan of Michael Myers. I felt like the movie didn't give Myers enough room to show his true self, or his lack of remorse, or any of his more classic characteristics. But, I did like the way he was portrayed in the movie. I also enjoyed how the movie did not give you much of a clue of what happened after the murders were committed (there's some hints, but not many). I thought that this was really well done, and I would like to see it again. __________________

One of them finds out he is an alien while another has a dream that makes her a vampire. But this movie does not really tell a story. The movie simply uses these two characters as a means to make some weird and wierd visual jokes. ____________________ A couple of days ago I saw this film on my lunch break, and it had an interesting and weird visual style. It was definitely worth seeing. The story is pretty weird, but this movie definitely does not have a plot, and its weirdness does not distract you from the visual.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dazed and Confused (1982) "Dazed And Confused" is the title of an indie film by Francis Ford Coppola that is about a student (Bruce Dern) who is trying to decide what college is for him. Dern is not a very good student but he plays a part that makes him appear like a bad student who is forced into taking more classes than he can handle. The college that he is in seems to be a perfect fit for Dern in terms of the class structure. Dressed in a long jacket and tie and wearing the typical glasses that are the hallmark of his type, Dern gives a classic performance of a guy who is a good student, but still has an itch to get the girl. He also has a little trouble making friends and not knowing how to act with people. This is what makes the film work. This would be a great story for a student to write about himself but the movie makes it so clear that this is all just a bad dream. It is funny but the dream aspect is not done very well. The film opens with Bruce Dern on a college campus and it does a good job of showing us how he is a real class clown with a big ego. He is always in trouble for acting like he is the star. He shows a lot of bad class behavior that would be an automatic fail for a class of students. The movie keeps reminding us that this whole thing is a bad vision but it never seems to take away from how much of a great actor Bruce Denn is. He plays a character that is so easy to hate but the whole time he is getting more and more interesting as the film goes along. Bruce Dennett is in his prime as a film star and he is making his mark with a classic movie. A few things to mention: -Dern's sunglasses always had a special charm that make them stand out. -His sunglasses are actually not just for his character. They also serve to make the character look cool. -The first person that pops into your head when you hear the title is Dern's character. -Bruce Denn has a great laugh. The film is full of laughter. -Denn has an incredible sense of humor. He has fun with the material but he is always very serious when it comes to his character which makes his character a very realistic and easy to identify with character. I have to say that I am not a big fan of this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wicker Man (1988) - I just can't get enough of Wicker and this movie is no different. The movie is a really good horror comedy that is very much in the spirit of Tim Burton's classic film.  You're supposed to be terrified of a creepy man who wants to cut off your head and drink your blood.   The main problem with this movie (and I think it was also a major reason that Tim Burton dropped it) was the movie didn't use a really great cast.  The actors were mostly forgettable and the script was so thin that it would make it easy for anyone to fall asleep and fall asleep on their feet.  Wicker was a big success for Warners and I'm really glad that they had the guts to make this movie when it was so much better than what they were showing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Inception. There are too many bad movies that make a bad concept good. It's a movie with a lot of things going for it. The characters are memorable and the twists are interesting. Inception is probably my most anticipated movie of the summer. So far, the reviews are mixed. I don't know what they're expecting. If they want to be taken seriously then it should be something like this. Not this. There's so much going on that it's hard to concentrate on any one part. I think the audience will be able to get behind the idea of some sort of meta-reality that's coming to a close. But it will be interesting to see what they end up with.   There's a scene near the end where an elevator goes up, and in it is the "mother" of the characters. She speaks to them through the elevator walls, and it's as if she's actually speaking to them. I really hope they give us more of this, because that's just great.  I don.t have anything bad to say about this movie, and I really like the twist ending. I guess the question is...did the twist actually work? I don 't know if it did. I'm not sure I'll remember it when it's all over. I hope I don' t. I love this movie. I just want to say that this was a very well written movie that took a lot to make. The story of Inception was actually based on a real idea, and is not just a mashup of different stories. The way the characters act towards each other and the way they make decisions was very interesting to me, and helped me feel that this movie could really be something. I love this thing. I couldn't recommend it enough. One of the many things I liked about the movie is that it takes place entirely in the mind of an artist, who is a great artist. We don't actually get a glimpse at his real life, but rather his work. I like the fact that the movie puts you in the shoes of the artist as he is trying to figure things out. He isn't just making the movie, he is the artist. There are several themes that are present throughout the movie that I liked. One of the things that I really liked was the idea that our memories actually have to do with the brain, not the senses. We have a very good feeling of what we're experiencing,

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________  This was the first film that my family ever saw and for the first time ever I felt I had the time to actually enjoy the film itself. The film begins as a typical tale of family misfit, and ends with the family reunited in a happy ending. I found the ending very satisfying and one of my favourite movies of all time. I was also a fan of the characters in this film and I loved that the filmmakers had the opportunity to show them in a unique way. This film really stood out from the crowd in my eyes and I recommend this film to any movie lover that is looking for a great movie that will have you cheering throughout the whole ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I've seen the original three movies, and thought they were a fantastic trilogy. It wasn't until my seventh viewing of the trilogy that I actually realized that the third movie in the series wasn't the best of the series. The reason for this is that the plot of "The Dark Knight" is more confusing than the plot for "The Lord of the Rings". A big plot point is missing and the villains are much more underdeveloped than in the first two films. The plot is still very good and the special effects are still excellent, but the plot is much more confusing then the previous two films in the trilogy. The fourth movie "The Return of Bruce Wayne" is still a solid action flick but doesn't have much to do with the first three movies. Overall, I'd still recommend all three of the Lord of The Rings films. If you're looking for an action flick this is it. If not, then you've been missing out! 5/5 stars!

It's not a bad movie, it just wasn't as good as I would have liked it to be. _______________, the great writer, never got a good script. You can't write good scripts when you don't have good characters, unless you are writing about them. _________________ - _________  Dylan - 4/4/2010 "He was a good actor in it. You could tell he knew what he was doing. It was a tough script to get through."   And we're not talking about someone who did it at a young age, and then got in the right places for the part later. If he was actually a talented and good actor, why is he no longer with us? I mean, let's remember that this movie is about a man who has committed a violent crime, and who then goes back to his home to kill his family, only to be shot by his wife and her lover. And then there's the other guy, who's a complete psychopath who gets a job working for the man he's after, and kills his whole family. And the guy has a "girlfriend", who just happens to be the wife's daughter.   I'm sorry, but that movie does not have a good enough script.

It's a classic example of how the world works, and it's something we really need to take away from our youth, which is why it's still a good story to tell today." -David Gaughran, The Irish Times "It has been written about so many times. So many of us who grew up with it, it's become part of us, but I've never found it boring. It still feels fresh, and I'm glad I saw it. The ending was so good and I hope everyone is as thrilled as I was. And what a great way to end it off. A very moving movie. Just wonderful." -Robert C. O'Hara, The St. Joseph News "I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lost or lonely." -Joanne J., New York Times "A wonderful film, rich in emotions, a great ensemble cast and a poignant final scene, "The Wind" delivers all of the emotions that make this a classic film." -Cory Doctorow, Boing Boing "The Wind is back, and this time it's at its most enchanting. In one of the year's finest pieces of filmmaking, John Boorman presents a masterful retelling of a great Irish story." -The Washington Post "John Boorman has again produced a brilliant, hauntingly evocative film." – The New York Observer "For those who love John Boorangan, this is a great treat, a film that will not only thrill the hearts of those who know and love the characters of John Booran and the Irish people, but also a great tribute to the Irish story, and to its great heroes and characters." – New York Post The Wind (1951) was written, produced and directed by John Boorson, based on the novel The Wind from the North by Peter Hanaway. In this classic novel, a young boy is taken into an underground world of wind, water, and stones by a great teacher who also possesses the ability to speak with animals and who teaches the boy how to use these powers to protect his family from cruel weather.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a movie! This was probably the first film I ever saw in English, but I remember it so clearly. This film is a classic of the style and the theme of this century. It is about the struggle of a people and its fight for freedom and its desire for an ideal that is still alive today. The great thing about this film is the performance of David Niven. David's performance is superb. Even though this is a story from the 19th century, you will feel that you are looking at a real historical piece. It's not a complicated movie. It has all the elements that you can feel like a story that you know from the past. What I liked about this movie is the cinematography, it is a beautiful and the perfect shot of the landscape. The characters that we are seeing are so realistic that the story is very convincing. You get to know a lot of people and even if you have only seen a few of them, it will be clear that these characters have real life values. The last thing I wanted to say about the movie is that there is a very good performance of Jules Dassin and an interesting plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- An old favorite of mine is Star Wars: Episode IV. I remember seeing this when it first came out and having the first of many Star Wars themed parties. This is the film where we get introduced to the idea of the Jedi and I loved the way the director used his camera angles to show us the Jedi in action. The opening titles set the mood for the movie very well and then the movie starts off nicely with an excellent opening scene where we see Luke Skywalker training to be a Jedi. The movie goes through a very interesting period of time where the Empire is gaining strength and the Jedi are losing ground to the Empire. The first part of the movie focuses on Anakin's training and Anakin is a very unique character in the Star Wars universe and I am glad to see that Anakin went from being a jerk to someone we can sympathize with. There are a few interesting character development moments between Anakin and Obi Wan that I enjoyed. Anakin gets some really good training and it's not long before he gains some strength. We also have some really strong lightsaber battles and some very strong Force Chokes. Luke is really just an ordinary person who gets pulled into a whole lot of different action. I enjoyed the way they put some of these interesting characters and events in the background. The second half of the film is when it starts to get really good and I will say that if you are a Star Wars fan you have to see this movie. This movie is where Obi Wan starts talking about the New Jedi Order and that's where the second half begins. The film gets really good throughout the third act and then we finally get to the end. The whole Jedi thing is very interesting but the ending is where the film really starts to show off the good stuff that made this a good sequel to the original trilogy. The third act is just amazing and I was really excited for the next part. The last act is another very good part of this movie and it just keeps getting better and better. The story is very good here and it gives us some good lessons to live by. I thought the characters in this movie were really well done and I really enjoy the story as a whole. This really is an excellent Star Wars movie. --------------- Another great Star Wars story is Revenge of the Sith. This was my favorite movie at the time it was released and I still really like it now. It tells the story of how Darth Maul and Count Dooku met. This story is really good in

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   It's so much more than a simple action movie or an action-adventure movie. It's a very special film. I love it, it's so unique, it was an eye-opener to me, I felt I learned something new and enjoyed the ride so much I bought it to see it again.   I was a huge fan of the first one and a huge fanatic of the second one, I'd go to see anything with the two. There is only one other film with this special feeling to it, and that's the original King Kong. This film is also a perfect entry-point for young audiences, especially kids. I'm in my early 20's so it really is an incredible film for a younger audience, but I think they will be hooked and hooked forever.  -Award-winning Director of Photography: Matt Johnson  -VFX Supervisor: Sean Patrick Collins  I would like to give a very huge thanks to Matt Johnson who was so gracious in sharing his love for all of us on our own journey to the top of the world. Matt is a legend in the industry and his work is a testament to the love and passion for the genre of action films that has been instilled by our industry.  Sean Patrick Collins created and directed the VFX on this film and his direction of the images created the ultimate feeling of scale and the feeling of a very large beast in the depths of the Pacific Ocean.   is a true love story in the classic sense of the word, it will have you rooting for the underdog and rooting against the big bad. It will make you feel the excitement of a dangerous adventure, of being out on the wild blue yonder, and not only seeing it, but being one of the actors that makes it possible for your character to do what he does.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. This film is a straight-up psychological horror thriller with a good amount of suspense and scares throughout.  So, what is the big deal about it? Well, I was able to watch this movie as an adult and it actually scared me. I had never seen a movie that terrified me like this one. The story is very unique and very original. It does contain some dark themes and themes but the movie is also very entertaining. There are plenty of funny and fun moments throughout the movie. There is some great acting in the movie and lots of fun things happen throughout the film. The ending of the movie really brings it home as well. I feel the story could have been a little more mature but it still is a good horror movie. This is a great movie that is well worth watching.

I felt a very strong love for the characters and I think that some of the best scenes in the movie were when the film was moving slowly and the characters were interacting. I'm not even sure what the movie was about, but I can say that I definitely felt attached to them all the time. One of the most romantic and emotional movies I've seen in a while. I could tell that this movie was very well-crafted and I can see how the makers did it. It was beautiful and full of love. I would highly recommend this movie to any lovers of romance and action/sci-fi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I thought the movie was pretty good. The movie has a good plot and is filled with heart. I really liked how he used his powers to change and become more of a man." - JT, Ohio "A good, old-fashioned comic book tale with a modern touch." - Vadis V.M. "This is my new favorite superhero." - T.B. "I don't normally read comic books, but I really enjoyed the movie, and the whole thing with the power of words. I think the writing was pretty cool. I also liked how the character went from a wimp to a man and now a superhero." It's funny how we always assume the first thing we see when we turn on a TV is "Batman", but now that we can see it on the big screen, it becomes apparent that "Superman" was originally conceived as "Batman Returns" but was made to fit into the DCU.  It was the first movie made after the success of "Batman" and its sequel, "Batman Forever".  And it's about to open at the height of its popularity.  What are you going to see when you head into the theater on opening day? The Joker has returned.    And Clark Kent is going to get his ass handed to him.  No, wait, that's not right.  Yes, this is the most anticipated movie of the summer, but it's a pretty poor movie.  To understand why "Superhero" is so bad, just look at some of the stuff written about it: "Silly and boring" (Hollywood Reporter) "Troubled production that will only make comic book fans want to punch a wall" (Vanity Fair) "A muddled mess of a superhero movie" (The Washington Post) "The worst superhero movie ever made" (SATIRE magazine) "It's one of the most embarrassing movies ever produced. I was laughing out loud at a lot of it, just hoping it wouldn't make me look like such a loser." (Says a guy on IMDB)   And these are just the reviews.  I could go on, but the bottom line is that people are talking bad about "Super Hero" because it's not an enjoyable superhero movie. The opening sequence is laughable.  The characters are not likable.    The action is dull.  It's a movie you can tell
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ It's easy to find yourself in love with a great movie. Like the great writers of Hollywood, I love all the best movies and the authors who created them. In that spirit I am going to tell you why I love 'The Hobbit'. I think this is one of the best adaptations of a literary work in history and it is just a delight to read. The first thing I noticed was how much Ian McKellen looks like Sir Ian McKellan. The beard he grew for the role is not that long but in the end it looks very much like his beard from 'A Knight in Shining Armor'. His character is very charismatic and I like him. There are plenty of other actors in the movie who look wonderful. The cast was very talented and I thought it was a really good movie. It has many fantastic moments and a very satisfying ending. This movie is truly an incredible feat of fantasy filmmaking. I am glad it is one that has made the world aware of this wonderful world in which our fantasy tales are set. ______________ 'The Two Towers' (2002) _____________ The movie was set in Middle-earth and it was really a movie about people and not about castles or heroes. The story was told in an epic manner and you knew you would never get to the end of the story and it would never be finished. It felt like a very long movie. I thought the casting was good, with many actors who I liked. I just thought the film had no action sequences and there were no dragons or giant spiders that would bring the story to an end. The acting was good and it looked nice. There were plenty of great moments and it took the story through many different scenes. I think a lot of time was spent on the 'battle of Helm's Deep' and the battle at the river crossing and this was a good end to the story. I found the two films very different and I think that is the reason why they are such popular films. But as I said, I am not a huge fantasy fan and so I didn't care for either movie. But it is a movie that I think people should watch and if you do, you will love it. It does take some time to get to know the characters and the story but I would recommend it to everyone who loves stories of epic proportions. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I loved it. ____________________________________________________________________________ _____________ I know this will be a controversial statement
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Way of the Gun " is a film with a solid story. It's not a spectacular film, but its a solid film with some interesting ideas and it's easy to see why it was a hit in the theaters.  I've never liked the idea of a superhero fighting for the good of the world, but this film makes a good first impression.   The film is set in a world where guns have been banned.  It follows a young man named Kip (Harrison Ford), who's been sent to the country to live and train with his uncle, a gun collector.  The only problem is that Kip has a natural talent for drawing guns from his uncle's collection.  He spends most of his time training and drawing with the guns, while also having to deal with a series of bullies who are trying to get into his uncle.  Kip's uncle has been trying to kill Kip for the last two years, but he keeps failing.  However, Kip does know about something that his uncle has never told anyone.  When Kip draws a gun from his Uncle's collection, an enormous monster comes out and eats the uncle. After a series in which he fights his uncle for his life, Kips uncle manages to escape and decides to move to the United States to work at a gun store in Kansas City.    One day a man comes to the gun shop, and he tries to get in the store by drawing a gun, only for Kip to draw his own.  While he draws his own gun, a man runs in and kills his uncle and then runs away.  This is all a pretty standard superhero story with Kip at the center.  In the meantime, a group of kids try to kidnap Kip and use his guns to fight for justice.  These kids are the bad guys, and it appears that they don't have much of a plan. They don't know how to fight, and they don in fact seem to just be in it for the fun of the fight.  Their only saving grace is that they are the kids who killed Kip, so it makes them easy to beat up.  Unfortunately, they still want Kip dead.  They just don't think it through enough.  If you are a fan of any kind of action/comedy, you'll likely enjoy this film.  I know it's going to be a tough sell for some, but I think

The Bad Part:  There is a part where the actors in this movie have to say the words "We are the people" and "We'll be back" at the beginning of the film which is a terrible way to close the film, but then there is also a scene where a young boy gets a little too excited about the film and falls out of his wheelchair, he does not even know how to ride a bike properly, I don't even want to mention the ending because I don' t know why they bothered to make it at all, they could have just shown the first two minutes of the movie, it's a really bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ I love this movie. I love the way it portrays a lot of things that happen when we can no longer look away from the truth, especially in the midst of such a bleak and depressing world. I also love how it portrays the character's personalities, the way they come to terms with their fears, and their attempts to move forward and fight back. The way it brings you into the lives of these characters, and the things that they do or think or feel in their day-to-day lives, is quite something. I would not say it is the perfect film, it is not. There are several problems I see with the story, and they need to be addressed; but the main problem I see is that the movie has been edited to make it so that we are all supposed to think that the main characters are the main character in this story; that it is their story. I think this is an amazing way to make this film, and if you do not care about the main story you could watch it at your leisure, and you will not be disappointed. I am very interested in seeing where the filmmakers take this story. But if you are going to watch it for the main themes, then I would say that it does not live up to the standards set by this movie, but at the same time, it could probably have been better in its execution. But as it stands, it still is an incredible film, I just wish it had been longer.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The only thing that was more painful to watch was the movie itself and, of course, the character. I did not know him, but I was so in love with him that I wanted to kill him, and he was so cute and innocent. He didn't mean to do any of the things that he did but it was just the perfect place to start a terrible story. I think I would have preferred him to be a character who never did anything.  Gus, the guy who shot the girl, was too good. He got a good scene, and the guy was really annoying at first. He was just a smart, funny, likable guy who just wanted to have fun. He had no evil, but when he shot the woman, he really did it. I liked him.    The film is set in a place called "The Cottage." It's a nice, small place in the middle of nowhere that doesn't really have any place to stay except for the Cottage. It's just a nice place for people to stay and hang out. Gus is a friend of some of the people there and he lives there with his parents. He's a good guy, I guess. His parents are nice and he makes the perfect living for himself. It isn't very nice, but that's the way it goes when you're a good kid with a big heart.  in the beginning, the movie is about an angry, angry kid who doesn't want to go to school and who tries to be different. He wants to fit in with everybody else, so he gets bullied and has a hard time. He doesn't like his friends. He thinks that it's really dumb that all of the kids at school are friends with each other and they're all so good at school, so much smarter than him. He has a good heart and tries to help out everyone, but there's a problem with that and then he becomes part of this awful mess. The guy in the movie seemed to have a problem, too, with his friends, which makes the whole movie much funnier, I think. It has a lot of laughs and it's good to see some real life friends doing bad things. I also liked the way the movie was done, the fact that it didn't take itself too seriously. It was funny, sad, sadder, even sadder. The end is very sad, but it's not like a movie where the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If I didn't have a few days to spare, I'd get straight to the good bits. The film is an action-packed romp that, as I have seen in the past, takes a slightly different route with some added twists. For me, it feels like the film was given a second life on DVD. Not much is actually new.  The film starts with two soldiers, both of whom have just been shot in the back of the head, fighting over the gun of one of them. They have to keep their heads held above their bodies, as they are both in cardiac arrest. The soldier who has the gun is still alive, but his friend is dead and a bullet has already passed through his skull.  He then sees a small man dressed in a grey suit. He's a scientist who has discovered that when he has the right blood group, a blood product is created, which he can collect by putting a drop of his own blood into the right tube. The man knows that he has a rare blood type that cannot be found anywhere in the world. When his friend dies, the man goes to find the blood sample, so he can make it and make his life more bearable. - I don't really know what the plot is about. The movie goes on with an explanation for why a rare type of blood is so important. The scientist makes another mistake, which causes a riot and it becomes clear that the man is the son of a scientist from another country, and has been sent to his father to learn about his father's job. However, the scientist decides to keep the son locked up in a house without any visitors for the next eight years, so no one can get to the man. The father has died and his daughter is left alone to live with her mother. But she's an old lady who has had her eye operation and cannot see. She is also a spy working for the enemy. The spy's job is to try and take the man from his daughter to get the sample of blood, so she can create a better version of the blood. The old lady knows this, but she is also an excellent marksman, so the spy is never able to shoot the old lady. So the old ladies daughter, her husband and her nephews have to go into the house and do what they can to try to save their own lives. And their bodies are destroyed along the way. We see the old spy from
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think The Big Short is a great movie, despite a few flaws. It does a great job of presenting the financial crisis of 2007-08 as a perfect storm that is largely the fault of people who did not act on the warnings the government issued. It is a story told by a few, who did nothing, and a few who are lucky enough to be on the other side of the crash.  As a movie it is very entertaining and even the "spoilers" are enjoyable to see, if you like those. But like many good movies it is not perfect.  But I would certainly recommend this one to those that love good movies, and even to those who have never seen one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What I love about this movie: the story, the acting, and the cinematography. But most of all, I love the movie and think you should see it too. I found the movie pretty entertaining. I'm a huge fan of Paul Rudd and the fact that this movie is based on a comic book was perfect. What I didn't like: there is a scene in this movie where one of the characters is trying to pick up a piece of the floor. The floor is covered in nails, that would have been a really cool effect to use, if only the actor were a bit more creative. It's a movie about love and romance and I think that is one thing that this does a great job at. I did find the ending a bit too abrupt, and not really the way I had planned. I would recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like Paul Rudd.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What I Saw: __________________ This is the first movie I saw in the "A new generation" series of films by Michael and Susan Sarandon. I am not an especially big fan of their style of films. They are kind of campy, a little cheesy, and I get the impression that they have had a lot of trouble finding a producer who will take the film seriously. This one has a little more charm to it than their last two films. The story follows two children in their twenties who move into an old house. The wife decides to live with the husband, but they soon become separated after the wife starts a new relationship with her lover, an older man. The kids begin to wonder if the house will be empty for good once their parents are apart again. A great blend of comedy, family drama, and mystery. The movie takes a little time to set up, but the story begins to pick up with the first few minutes. A wonderful cast, and very funny. I gave it four stars because it takes time to get going and the story is not really the strong point of the film. I also liked the idea of an older, divorced husband getting involved with a young woman that is just starting out in life. She is in her late 20's. I was surprised at how young this story seemed to be. There are no adult themes or anything, just a fun mystery and a very sad story. I will give this movie a four because I thought the story was very mature for a family film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You can't help being blown away by the great effects on display, particularly in the spectacular scenes between the two young characters, which are set amid an apocalyptic landscape and are framed with haunting music. I was surprised at the film's lack of conventional conflict, although it certainly is a horror film in the tradition of The Fly and Jaws, and will appeal to fans of those films. What really gives this film a big edge is the terrific score by Hans Zimmer, which gives the film an extra bit of menace, and is a major reason to watch the film."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Fargo" is a great movie.  A lot of people will not be familiar with this movie, or I doubt the majority of them even liked it.    "Fargo", however, is a perfect example of how to be an actor.  "Farewell, Mr. Chips" The movie is great, and one of the best movies from this year.  "Dead Man's Party", I thought, was my favorite movie of the year. "Fare Well, Mr Chips" is like a good good movie with a bunch of people who do nothing but yell at each other.  One of the main characters, a guy, has a crush on another girl, she doesn't reciprocate.  This guy is constantly yelling at her and gets a little annoying.  In the end, the girl walks away and the guy cries, saying, "I'm so stupid and useless that I would fall in love with a girl for nothing".  This film is about a guy who cries when he says he's stupid and worthless, how he is stupid and insignificant and how he can't even look up at the woman he's chasing.  It has everything a movie needs to be great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a movie that I was not expecting to like. But it was well worth it. I enjoyed the movie a lot. The movie was a little bit different than the other movies in this series and i would say the movie took a different route than the others. The story was pretty standard, it was a bunch of bad guys trying to get into a secret military facility. They had to take the security down so that the aliens could get in. They also had to protect the scientist in the facility. But the movie did not give us a lot of action. I would say only 1-2 of the movie was full of action and the rest of the movies is very much filled with plot and characters. Overall, it does not have much to do with the other installments of the series but is a good watch. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes sci-fi action with some humor mixed in. This is definitely a good pick for a movie to watch if you have not seen the other series.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I'm not sure if this is the only place that will sell me the rights to this, but I'm sure it'll be well worth it. I hope that it does as well as "The Dark Knight" and the other two I mentioned. _____________________________________________________________ [Review by Kevin J. Haggerty] I haven't seen the first season of "The Killing" (yet) so I'm having to go from memory (or watching the "SVU" episodes), but here's the thing: This show, at its best, is not nearly as brutal as "Svoboda" or "The Wire" at its worst, so much so that the show seems more like "W.T.F." with an all-female cast, and a few extra drugs and women. In fact, "The Kill List" is just as violent (albeit less graphic) as "M-G-M" and probably "CSI". While it's no masterpiece, "Killing" is a good, if not a little dull, crime drama with a few great performances, and great performances. It's not the best of the season, but it's definitely not the worst. And hey, I'm watching it now, so I've got to say that if you like good detective stuff, you'll enjoy it. For anyone with an aversion to the violence of "Sopranos", I highly recommend this as it won't turn you off of the Sopranos for good. And for people who think there's too much "violence" in these shows, there's a lot of it here, which is good for the ratings, but doesn't make me want to go buy a DVD of any other show. It can be watched for free on HBO, but as I said above, if you don't have a cable or satellite TV, you're likely to have trouble getting a stream. However, it's available on HBO Go, and can be purchased at Amazon for under $5.00 (it's also available on iTunes, and for $6.95 at Best Buy).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good and really enjoyable movie with a great cast.  I don't see this movie as a kids movie because it is an adult movie.  The movie is about a boy named Danny who is in a movie theater and he sees a movie with one of his best friends named Andy, he takes the ticket and leaves the theater. Then he goes out on the streets of a small town and sees something odd, a black and white TV that he doesn't recognize is on the street corner. He walks into a pawn shop and sees that it is a television but there is no sound. He goes into the store to find that it has been sold, so he calls the police who come and find that a man is trying to steal the television. But it turns out to be just a toy. Danny and his best friend Andy go to a garage to investigate, they find out that a black man that looks exactly like Danny has been playing the TV. Danny's best friend then sees that the man they think is Danny is actually a toy man. So Danny and Andy go back to the theater and they find that Andy has taken the ticket out of the machine and they discover that the TV is gone. The toy man is not who he says he is. The kids play the TV on top of the truck. Then Danny finds the ticket in the garbage can. So that is the movie. I will have a look at the screenplay and see if the premise is really bad or not.  I also have to wonder if the TV was actually the real thing or not and what this is actually called.   This is a pretty good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This movie isn't the most original I've ever seen, but it was funny enough that it didn't have to be. The movie centers around the "Lonely Ghost", a ghost whose name is pretty much a synonym for sad. He lives with his mother (a beautiful blonde) and a boyfriend (a black guy) and they get a little too much sex from their old friends (all white and pretty rich, it's like a movie where the lead actor is in the middle of a real estate deal, only to be mistaken for a stock broker). I love how the movie uses the word "sad", because it means "completely miserable" and it makes his attitude that much better. It doesn't take long for them to find that their new friends are also not very good at sex. When they go to one of their "lucky" parties, they end up fucking a ton of people, including a bunch of strangers, all of whom just want to hook up, get laid, and be with their friends. I loved this movie, especially how it doesn't put the "gay" theme in it, just the "sick" one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A movie that can be considered both a psychological thriller and a love story" (The Film Stage). "This is an extraordinary film - it makes a whole lot of interesting philosophical points that will resonate with a great many people. Its central message is not for the faint of heart, but one that can easily be applied to any given situation - and the story of its protagonist is also one that requires serious consideration." - Roger Ebert "Hijack the Body" is a documentary about the life and work of one of the greatest artists of our time, Henri Lartigue. The film focuses on Lart Vie's work during a period between 1958 and 1961, when he was a young artist in New York City who developed a new form of visual expression that he called "Hijacked the Body." The film is an intimate portrait of Lart' Vie's life and career, but it also presents a critique of contemporary art and the social effects of the American art world on contemporary society. This is a must see documentary about one of France's greatest artists and the influence that his work has had on his country. Lart's work is the spiritual successor to Marcel Duchamp's " Fountain ", " Hijack The Body " is one of his greatest works and one of my favourite films. One of the reasons I like this documentary is because it is not an interview, but rather an in-depth discussion and analysis with Lartvie  Vie about the films he is making, his influences, and what his role is in contemporary art. He explains how he gets to his projects, his method, and he even goes in depth about the film that won the Silver Bear for " The Silent Partner " in 1957. It is fascinating to learn what a creative and unique figure he really is and to see him discuss his work in such a scholarly and reflective way. For all of you who have not seen this film yet, I implore you to go and watch it. It will change your view of how we view art and how art is perceived in the 21st century. If you are a fan of Duchaud and Lartieu, you will not be disappointed, but this film should be required viewing for all who are interested in cinema and art. 1) Hijacked The Body :  http://youtu.be/xqXtK-2jf_c

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" is a good "Star Trek" film and probably a good good film in general. It's well shot, well written, well acted and has one of the best and most original soundtracks ever. The character of Yoda is one of my favorites in the series. He's also a pretty cool looking guy. If you've seen the original films, you'll have a lot of fun with this one, but it's more of a "Trek" movie than a "Star" film. It may not be an original "Trekkie" film but it certainly feels like one to me. It has a nice sense of humor and it's got a great cast (again) that can all bring their A game in some cases. I've never seen anything quite like this one. You should get it if you like Star Trek or even "Trekers" if you're a "trekkie".Read full review

It has some cool things that are well done and it's very good as a comedy. I like the concept of the movie. There is a big guy who has a weird way of fighting. It is a funny and funny way to fight and the way it works, well, just watching it is funny. I don't really have anything to say about it, it does not feel like the "next big thing". It has a lot of different ideas that are cool and I enjoyed it, but I don´t think that it´s a movie that´s going to change the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dope" is an amazing and creative film. From its gorgeous cinematography to its innovative ideas, "Dope's" director and cinematographer, Barry Jenkins is a genius. He crafts a visually stunning film that is also incredibly poignant and deeply rooted in the human experience. This is a film that speaks to a large range of people, from the young, impressionable mind of a teenager to the adult brain of a teacher dealing with the consequences of their own past indiscretions. He also makes his audience feel empathy for his characters, allowing us to be swept along by their journey and to take on a different understanding of these characters. This film will bring smiles and tears to your face, but also will stay with you long after the credits roll.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ When you hear the words "G.I. Jane" your mind instantly goes to "the military action movies I watched in the 80's, they made me want to be a spy." However you won't be watching that crap, this film is a real gem, and you're going to want to see it again.   G. I. Jane stars Cate Blanchett as a badass female pilot in the middle of a worldwide war. After her ship crashes she's taken captive by a terrorist organization. After a bit of an interrogation she's put on trial for her actions, and she'll have to prove herself worthy by taking on the terrorists in court. She has to prove that she's a good person and is not a traitor, or she'll suffer the consequences. The best thing about this movie is Cate's character, she's not just a "goddess" in the movie, she has personality. Cate plays the part of a tough military woman who has grown up in a war torn country and feels the need to get back to her roots. She's not one to sit back and let things go her way, she finds her way by fighting to get her mission done. She goes into a lot of trouble and makes a lot mistakes, but she does not let them get in the way of her mission. It's easy to see the type of fighter pilot that Cate is, you can tell from the first scene that she has a killer instinct. If you thought that the character was a bit too perfect at the beginning of the movie you're in for a treat. She is an awesome military action heroine that is very capable. I just wish that there was more to the plot, she and her fellow female pilot just got into this whole "we're just going to kill the terrorists" thing too easily. I don't really know why they put such an emphasis on this thing that has very little meaning in the beginning.

The story line about the relationship between the two love interests was so sweet, the music was excellent. If you get the chance to see this movie make it happen!  LOVED IT!! What an awesome movie! Love how the director has the perfect twist, as soon as the scene starts, the first thing you see is the movie being shown. It's so funny. The ending was brilliant, but to not give it the attention it deserves would not have been fair. I loved the movie. There were a few scenes that were a bit awkward, but overall, the film was a wonderful movie! It was really a lot of fun and I can't wait to see the sequel!!!!  Love the movie, but have problems with some of the scenes. They seemed really rushed and I don't understand how it could have worked without a few other scenes.  Was this helpful?

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********  I can say with 100% certainty that this film is the single best movie I've ever seen, hands down. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is just great, and even with it being a horror movie it does a very good job at taking the horror genre and giving it a whole new spin. I never would have thought that a movie that has the premise of a guy who is being hunted by an unseen beast could be scary, but it is, and in a good way! There are some great jump scares throughout the entire film, and a few truly terrifying moments. The acting is top notch, and with a story like this it only makes sense that it would be. I can also say that the cinematography alone makes this worth watching. This is a film that you will not want to miss.   And for the record: it's not scary.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Lights Out' (2012) is one of the better films to come out of the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, but it isn't just the subject matter that makes it worth seeing, it's the directorial style of Sam Mendes. 'Lights' is a short film about a woman and her son, who live in the San Francisco Bay Area. In an attempt to find peace between her and her husband, she is forced to move to an abandoned house to stay with a friend, which is where she meets the mysterious "Tiny," a woman who lives in the house.             Sam Mendesian's directing style is the perfect example of how to utilize a modern day  mumblecore, in which the camera follows the actions of the main character, as he is in a constant state of worry and anxiety over the prospect of his relationship with his wife crumbling to pieces. 'Light's' characters have been simplified and stripped of the overbearing emotions and life experiences of the woman and the child, so as to better focus on the interactions of these characters with each other. The story is told through the small screen of a television, and focuses mainly on the relationships of these three people, without the rest of the story being necessary.        'LIGHTS OUT' is quite a unique film, and was also one of my first  watching of films made by Sam Mendez and his crew, and is a film I will definitely be seeing many more times in my life. I look forward to the follow up, 'LIGHT' 3 (2013) which will not only focus on Tiny, but her friends and the others that inhabit the house, which will hopefully make for another very different film.

It really was an interesting take on the vampire genre and the idea of the creature in human form. It also did a good job of taking some of the vampire stereotypes and making them more relatable and believable, although some of it did come across as a bit clichéd. The story was entertaining, although the ending was a bit abrupt and unsatisfying. This is a great movie to watch with some friends and would be a good vampire movie to show off to the kids at your high school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd say that, aside from a few moments of tension, this is a perfectly fine action-drama. What I Liked:    The action scenes, and the use of a lot of action set pieces.   I liked the characters, especially the one who is very good at using his environment to his advantage.  And I liked that the story didn't feel like a prequel to "Men in Black."   What Didn't I Like:    A couple of times the action seemed to take a while to get going, and I wished it would speed up.  But I think I'll be very happy with this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great film that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in sci-fi. I was really surprised with how much I enjoyed the film. If you are a sci- fi fan, then this is a must see movie. It has great production value and will be one of your favorites. I also like the film because it is very creative and has a great mix of humour, horror, action and science fiction. The film shows how human nature is, it is good to be human and to be free from the chains that we put on ourselves that make us do things that we wouldn't be able to do for the rest of our lives. The plot and characters are interesting and unique and is the reason why I liked the film so much. The characters are complex and are not what you would expect from a sci fi film. It also shows that science has a very dark side and is shown in this film. There are so many elements in this movie that are done in a creative and ingenious way.  The soundtrack was not as good as the film, I did not think the soundtrack was good enough. But it is just the first film and I'm sure we will see improvements. The cast are great and I loved the movie. The story was a good one and was not one that was too hard for me to get into, but it was not boring either. The cinematography and sound design of the film were perfect and I was entertained from the very first scene.  The film was rated PG-13. The final rating is 4.6/5 Muse is a Canadian sci--fi horror film that has been on the list of movies that I watch at least once a month since it came out. It is very unique as you get an alien that is a human hybrid and I really enjoyed the concept and story of the movie and the way the film developed and changed. There were a lot of different stories and plot lines that were very unique and interesting to watch. The acting was superb, the directing is excellent, and the action scenes were really great. I have watched this film twice. The first time I saw it was at a movie theater and the second time I had to watch it on TV and this time I thought the story was really good. I liked how the movie was created and I thought that they added a lot to the film as it was the first time they did this. There is quite a lot going on in the film and the plot
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The Last of the Mohicans ***** I thought that this was a film that would be well received, and to an extent it was. I thought the acting was top notch and I loved the acting style of the two leads, especially the way the character played by Will Smith's character in this film would tell others to stop and to stand down as he came over to help them. I felt like I had seen this same story before in many movies, and it was always one that I enjoyed and I think that this story was well done. The story is very well written and I have to give this one five stars. The action is quite good, the writing is good, and the story is just so good, I think it should be considered a classic. I did find some things that were a bit of a letdown. The acting is good enough, but there were some moments where I found it a bit confusing, and I wasn't able to figure out how a certain character was going to be able to help his people if they were attacked. I guess that's what happens when a story is told in two acts, it can get a bit confused. I was also a little disappointed that I couldn't see the Mohican's skin color change as well. I know that we are told it is a metaphor for the color of the American flag, but I couldn;t see how his color could change. I think the ending of the movie should be taken to mean more. It doesn't really have much meaning as far as the rest of the story goes, and in some ways I feel that it was a bit more of a tragedy to the Mohandas than a joy for the Mohan's. I liked this movie, and while I feel it would have been great if it came out when I was a teenager and had me wanting to see more, I guess in my eyes it wasn't that great. Overall it's a nice film and it shows some great acting, good writing, and a lot of action. It just doesn't quite go the way I would like it to. So I give it four stars.

When one of our staff members visited the set of the film, he was left feeling unsettled and confused as to why such a well-known film series was being made at all. According to his report, "The script was well written and the acting was strong, though a bit too melodramatic, for my taste."   The cast is made up of "a very large number of talented and believable actors from different ages and backgrounds". "This is not a film about "young" actors," said director David Leitch, who had been working on the film since its inception.   We were told that in a post-production scene, a young woman came into the office in her nightgown and was given the "most horrific experience of her life" by the film's director and screenwriter.   The young woman, who goes by the name "Sharon" in the film (she is only given a single line in the entire film), told us she was forced to perform in a scene where she was raped by a man. Sharon said that she had been given a role in the scene, but the scene was cut when she became visibly distressed on set.  This story was inspired by our own recent experiences on set for the film The Good Lie (2006).  We hear that the cast was also required to be in the nude for the movie and that the scene that was cut was where the young woman is made to strip to her underwear and perform for the man while he rapes her.  , in the first of a new series of films set in the world of the American pornographic film industry, the film follows the life of a woman in the sex industry, Sharon, as she becomes a "housewife" (that is, a prostitute) at a sex club run by her mother's friend. Sharon's mother, a beautiful young woman named Sharon who happens to have been a pornographic actress in her youth, is an object of desire for the wealthy owner of the club and the movie portrays the sexual relationship between Sharon and her mother as a love affair between two young women who cannot live without one another.  for

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Watch the trailer: Watch the trailer  You can learn more about the film here  "A beautiful, moving, and powerful story about a girl trying to find a place in a world that feels like a desert."  —Bridget Ryan, Director of The Black Sheep  I knew from the beginning that I wanted to work with someone who was true to themselves. So I was delighted when this beautiful, intelligent, beautiful actress stepped into my life. I love what I hear about the woman who plays this film's lead character: she can play an angel, a mother, a friend, a lover. But most of all, she plays a girl.  Ginny has lived a difficult life, as many of us do. Her mother, who was a drug addict, was murdered by a boyfriend when Ginny was a teenager. Her father was mentally ill and didn't come home until very late, which is the kind of life Ginny experienced. She was adopted by an affluent, Christian couple, but it wasn't until she was 17 that she realized that the family she had been raised in was not the place she needed to be.  to my mind, there's not a film set in Ireland, or even in Ireland in a period of Irish history, that's been more personal than The House I Live In. It's a hauntingly honest depiction of how people, and specifically children, can be separated from each other by culture, geography, income, class, politics, and a lifetime of conditioning. This is a film about the love between an individual and their mother, but also a love between parents and their child, and in Ginny's case, between the people who love her, and the people whom she thinks of as her family.  on the film's theme of love and family in the face of tragedy: "I always remember my mother saying to me, 'you see, you have a father, and your father has a mother. And your mother and your mother's mother is your father. That's a very important thing. It changes everything in your life. Everything, that is.'"  On her own film, she talks about her film's relationship with the original, in the book, by Pauline Kael. In it, she describes how the movie begins and ends, and how the original ends. It is, in a way, a love letter to the Irish film: "It has an almost mystical quality
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Titanic," the most expensive film of all time, was a success. No wonder it broke the $1 billion mark at the box office. It's certainly the highest grossing film of any kind since the James Bond franchise. The film was a flop at the time of release, making a dismal $66 million in its opening weekend. It then took the money it made, re-edited the film to make it more appealing to an audience of a certain age, and put it back on the market. So now it's doing $1.9 billion at the worldwide box office (with $1 million coming from a free ride from its own theatrical release). The film made over $800 million in the U.S. alone. But now we have the "Titan" DVD, and a Blu-ray set of "Titans" coming later this year. So you can see why it would be a big money maker if a sequel were made to this film. But I don't think that would be possible. The movie was too expensive for the sequel. But that's not to say that it could never happen. The production budget for "Till Death Us Do Part" was just under $100 million dollars, making it a little less expensive than "Titantic." For comparison's sake, "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09," made just over $150 million. But "Tin Cup" was a different beast from the "World War II" film. In that film, it was a more comedic-oriented film. For "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" the producers had the freedom to create their own script. But a script is only as good as the scriptwriter, so we won't know the full quality of this movie until the release of the DVD. If they release a DVD or Blu-Ray of the film, people will get to see all of the funny bits and not just all of that scene in the bar. This will be a good film, a real gem for fans of "Beverly Hills 90210." It will be interesting to see if the people who have already seen this movie like it as much as the critics who have yet to see it, or if they can live up to the box-office numbers it already has. I would love to see "Tasmanian Devil II: The Revenge of the Tasmanians" be the sequel to this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I have seen this movie more times than I have seen any other movie. It has its fans, its detractors, its friends, its enemies, and its cult followers. This is definitely not an average sci-fi movie. A few hours into the film I felt like I was in another world, I'm not sure I can ever really describe it, but it was unique, dark, and mysterious. This movie does an excellent job at creating an atmosphere that is dark and menacing, and that atmosphere is only increased by the music. The soundtrack by John Carpenter is awesome and will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The cast is excellent and the performances are outstanding. If you like to see a nice, creepy sci- fi movie with the creepy music and a great cast, you will definitely enjoy this one.  The score by John Densmore The film does not have a lot of action, and there is very little gore, but what there is is certainly bloody and gruesome. There is a nice scene that shows the crew of the Nostromo on the surface of the moon as they talk about the events that led to their destruction. There was also a very brief scene where we got to see the Nostramo as it was in the early 80's. It was cool to see it on film for a change.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The End of Days" is a great, fun movie to watch. It's based on a novel by an author whose name has become synonymous with the best books. In this movie the story moves forward from where the first novel left off. We follow a group of scientists and the leader of the group, a professor, as they are contacted by the group leader, a mysterious man, to participate in the mission to locate the mysterious alien device that was created by the scientist. As the group attempts to escape from the ship the ship begins to collapse in on itself, the ship's control computer, which is located on the ship, suddenly begins to malfunction. The ship crashes onto a remote planet inhabited by an alien race that are in the process of attacking the ship. We watch as the leader, the professor, takes his men and starts to fight the alien. After a few skirmishes the alien appears to be on the verge of killing the scientist, but our heroes manage to pull him out of the rubble and escape the planet with the scientist still in their group. At this point we watch as a second ship crashes on the planet, the planet is being attacked by a number of aliens. The second ship is piloted by an evil scientist who believes that all life is just a chemical reaction and he's trying to find a way to convert everything in the universe into one giant chemical reaction. The alien leader, who has been watching all of this, has found out what the professor is doing and is trying to stop him. In the middle of this war the evil scientist reveals himself to the group and takes the group's leader as his own slave. This man, the leader has become his slave and he does all of the evil things that the professor does. After the evil leader's attempt to kill the professor the scientist is able to find the cure for the alien plague that the aliens are creating, but he has also discovered the secret of the device the scientists have been seeking. This is where the story is at the end of the first book. It takes the story from the beginning and adds the second book which is the first part of the novel. The story does not really start in the middle, it is set on a remote alien planet in the beginning of the movie. There is some mystery in the second movie as to how the events in the first movie could have happened. I'll give it a 4 stars for the first act and 2 for the second. The action is pretty good and

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********This is an old school sci-fi film which combines the best of the past with the latest ideas in the genre. It mixes the old with the new in a way that is not only entertaining but also very realistic. It has a lot of fun, but also a lot heart. It's not just a story of a race of robots that are fighting a race called the humans, it is a story about life, family, love and what it means to be human. It was a lot more than I expected, and it left me wanting more. As a fan of old school movies, I can say that this is as good as it gets. Don't expect much of any action or any super powered robots. This is just a simple sci-fantasy film with great humor and great storytelling. If you have enjoyed the "Blade Runner" trilogy, this is one of the best examples of the style. You won't be disappointed. ********** ******** ******** (6.3/10)

It's not great, but you do get some funny dialogue, though this is from a war film from the sixties. There are some good bits and there is a lot of action that goes on. Some of the actors have great impressions of Vietnam War vets. The writing is okay. Some dialog in the war sequences is just "Whoa! Oh my God!", but it's not a terrible thing. I liked the ending, but I'm a fan of this movie and the director was pretty good, so it wasn't a huge letdown. It was a lot better than "The Deer Hunter" or "The Blues Brothers" for example. - April six, 2007What was wrong w/ The War  Rating:   The War I saw in St Louis was a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Beauty" is an excellent movie. In addition to being an excellent film, it is also a beautiful movie. You can watch this movie, and see that it is one of the most beautiful films in this century, and it is a good thing. Here is what I think is the best aspect of the movie, which I have never seen before:   "The Great Beautiful" is very beautiful. This is a film that is about beauty, but it is not about beauty in a sexual way. It is about the beauty of the natural world, and of the human body. If you like this, then you will like:      " The Great Beauty " and " Beauty and the Beast."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ I really liked the movie and enjoyed it. It was just a bit long for my taste, but it's still worth checking out. It's a movie that is very fun to watch. The characters are all really fun and likable, and the action is well-done. I'd recommend this to kids and adults alike. _________________________________ I found this one a bit disappointing. It seems that when you're trying to explain an entire war on the big screen, you start to lose sight of some important aspects. A very little amount of effort was put into the war on a single planet. That seems very little to ask from a movie and a movie in which the action occurs every two minutes. I would have loved to see more. There is a really beautiful soundtrack, a little bit of comedy, and I didn't mind the "adventure" segments that happened every once in a while. However, the movie could have had a lot more focus. There were times when the characters just seemed a little too tired or too stressed, and it just seemed like it was too much going on. If you're into space or science fiction, you might like this movie. If not, you will probably be bored. If it's not for you, then you might just enjoy the little bit you are given.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ It seems like every film I watch these days has a huge amount of CGI. It's amazing how such a simple thing can look so good in the right context.  "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is the first Star Wars film I've seen in a long time. It isn't without flaws but I love it. I was hoping to see the effects of CGI and CG in this film but I was surprised. The Force is back and this movie shows it. From the opening scene with Rey's parents to the very last scene when the film closes with Kylo Ren and Rey's father in the Resistance base. I felt like the Force had a presence in this movie. It gave it power. It showed the power of hope and the Force in all its glory. I hope we see more of the Force with Star Wars Episode VIII because I would love to see more scenes where they have to fight with the Force and it shows the power it has in the films and I hope it gets stronger over the next two films. If you loved "The Force Awakens", or even just liked the first two films, you'll love this film.

They began work on this film while working on the Broadway musicals "As You Like It" and the "Porgy and Bess" revue. They decided to make a movie rather than a musical after Mamet's family was tragically killed in a car accident. Mamet said in an interview, "We had the same kind of grief and we just decided to try this out instead. We loved the material so much that we really thought it was worth taking the risk. It took a while to get it right." Mamet worked with the director, screenwriters, and an original cast, with a few additions, in a unique, almost dreamlike, style that was reminiscent of "Night on Bald Mountain." The main theme is a re-creation of a melody that Cukoro had once sung to the composer in a dream.  For the film's sound design, the composer worked closely with Ashman and composer Robert L.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ So, I've finally had a chance to watch this movie, and the reason I haven't watched it before is because I didn't care about it. So when I saw it at a midnight showing on Netflix, I was quite surprised to see how good this was. Well, as good as it was, I think the audience was just as surprised, too. The movie starts off with a slow, suspenseful start, and slowly reveals itself over the course of the film. I found it quite interesting that there were a couple of scenes where the characters were acting without much emotion. This might be because we've all seen it, but I don't think most people would take the same view of it. I guess it's a little similar to the ending of The Hunger Games, but the ending wasn't as satisfying as the first one. Anyway, I'm glad I watched this movie. It's really great. The acting is good, the storyline is decent, the visuals are nice, the music is good (although I think it was made for the Oscars, not the Oscars), and the cinematography is really good. So, why don't you let me know what you think, and if you want to see the movie, or if you were disappointed by it, or what you thought about the cinematographer. I've never watched this before and I love to hear your thoughts.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015): If you were expecting a Star Wars movie that didn't suck as much as the last one, you were not mistaken. The story is basically "the Force is back" which is pretty damn good as the plot basically tells us that the Jedi are dead and that the Sith are the new masters of the galaxy. However, in the new story that we're getting, the story is a little different. As in the last movie, the movie tells us how Rey is trying to become a Jedi, which is understandable. However she is not the only Jedi in the movie. She is also joined by Kylo Ren (who we also got a little bit of in the trailer) and Captain Phasma (who got a ton of screen time in the first trailer) to form the newest and best team of "bad" guys in the Star Wars galaxy. They're essentially the heroes in the film and they're basically the evil bad guys. However they all get some pretty cool action scenes which is always fun when you watch movies. While the story isn't nearly as bad as The Force Awakens, this is still a fun action packed film, with a bunch of great characters, lots of good looking action sequences, and some pretty amazing performances all around.

So if you're a fan of horror, you'll love this movie.    This movie is not for everyone, but it's definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Django Unchained What's it about:  There's a bit of Django's backstory. He is the son of a slave but a free man by the time he is six, so he begins his life by raiding plantations and the occasional bounty. He eventually leaves, going to New Orleans where he begins teaching school.  In 1876, a former slave named John T. Porter meets Django and they form an unlikely friendship. Together, they plan to run a plantation of their own, free of the shackles of slavery and against the will of their families.    The whole film is based on this idea.  So it's set in an alternate history where the Civil War never happened and there is no emancipation.  This is the story of how Django and a group of his friends manage to find a place and form a kind of community. It is also a story of slavery. And a story about the way that people can find themselves in a place that once made them feel completely at odds with their humanity. Plot Summary:   Djangophiles rejoice.  It is about a group who, for the most part, don't go out in the evening. They live in a shack where they teach school and play with their dogs. Django is the leader and has to be very careful to not anger the slave master. He gets very annoyed by this but in his defense, he is a slave.   Django and his friends, with the help of Django Sr., learn to be respectable members of the community by becoming good farmers, good farmers. They do things in their way: they only pick cotton and plant corn. They always work together, always talk about what is right and wrong and how the community should be. Django goes out at night but only to steal food. He does not steal because he hates himself. In one scene he says he wishes he could steal the sun. He then goes to sleep and dreams of being a free black man. He wakes up the next morning and he realizes that he was just dreaming about his life in slavery.   It's a story that will always resonate with me because I love it so much.  It is a movie that will forever stay with me. It is the movie that made me fall in love with the genre.  Django Unchained is also an important movie in my history as a movie fan. It was a movie in which I saw myself as part of a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie so many times, but have never had a chance to watch it with someone. We had just moved to a new state, and I really thought we might be able to find a really great film or television show. We did, but I don't think anyone could have seen this film in the same way again. It is a very unique story and it's impossible to watch again. If you like the idea of an evil corporation controlling people through fear and money then you should watch this. It has some great performances in it, and the story that was told was very compelling.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ A friend recently told me that "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is the best movie she has seen this year. I haven't seen it yet, so I am not sure if that is true, but the movie is entertaining, interesting, a nice romance, and pretty good acting. I was going to give it a good rating, but as it turns out it is an excellent movie, and I am pleased to see this quality movie in the hands of somebody with the talent of John Lithgow, who did a very nice job in the lead role, and his co-star, and a very good actress, Maggie Grace. The film has one of the most memorable lines of dialogue in the history of film, in the scene where Mr. Gray and his wife are talking about how the children have a new sister. "The best child is a dead child, she's dead, she isn't even alive," Mr.Gray says. "And I've been waiting all of my life to say that," says Maggie Grace with a smile on her face. I thought it was terrific. The scene with the woman in the garden was also very well written and acted. The cast is wonderful. The only slight disappointment is that Lithgow has to do a lot of talking, but it is well done and he gets across what he is thinking. This is not a high budget movie and this is not something you can spend all day with, but I found myself enjoying it. It is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last of the Mohicans" is a great action adventure film. It has lots of action and plenty of gun fights but it also has a great story and great acting. The story is about a British explorer named Nathaniel Poyet who is sent to capture a Mohawk chief who is a powerful warrior. The film is set in 1607 but with modern weapons and looks. The last Mohawk village was destroyed in 1664 by a group of English settlers and the English settlers in turn massacred many Mohawk people in the following years. The Mohawk leader, Chief Pontiac, is a very sympathetic character who tries to help Poyets friends and allies who are trying to escape from the English in 1608. "The Last Warrior" is worth watching even if you are not that familiar with the story and the Mohawk culture. My only criticism is that the action is slow and tedious. It just goes on and on and you know that in the next few minutes the action will end and you will have to wait for the next part of the story. But it is still a good action movie with great story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I was excited to see this movie. I'm a big fan of horror movies, and this is by far the best one I've ever seen. It's creepy, horrifying, scary, and is just an all around fantastic film. It has so much heart and emotion and this one made me cry so hard. I will forever cherish the film's opening scene. The camera lingers on an eerie looking forest as a man, dressed in an old hat and boots, walks by and slowly disappears into the shadows. He is followed by the feeling of unease as he walks through the dark corridors of the house and enters the attic. The room is filled with the sounds of a child's laughter. I found myself watching this movie for hours. There are so many beautiful cinematography and design details in this film. Even the characters are beautifully designed. It made my heart swell with warm happiness every time I thought about them. I love how everyone (except for the killer) is portrayed. They are all human and their fears are all relatable. I was also glad to see that the movie had an ending. I always hated endings, but this one felt like a satisfying conclusion to a film that I would highly recommend to horror fans, especially those who loved the original. I also have to mention that the acting was absolutely incredible. The lead actor, Matt Lintz, really gave an interesting performance and kept you intrigued. He really got to play the character of John. I have never really liked the character before, but he just brought a lot of life and life experience to it. His performance was excellent. The film also had a very unique score which made this film that much better. It was unique and made a movie I didn't even know I wanted to watch. I think it is one of the best horror films of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight is a movie that can't be easily summed up. It's a film about the rise of a family who, in the midst of an unspeakable tragedy, are forced to go back to their lives and confront their darkest demons. It isn't about the end of the world or a man escaping from a burning building but instead about a family in denial and a man whose mind, body, and soul are not his own. It is a film that asks questions about family, race, and class in the western world that will live on long after its release. If you've not seen it or if you've seen it but not felt the passion or connection the director is able to generate through its characters, it's not for you. If however, you've been watching a movie or show for any length of time, you will see why The Hateful Eighth is a must see. It was directed by Quentin Tarantino and it stars Samuel L. Jackson as "The Sheriff" John Ruth (played by a wonderful Christoph Waltz) who is forced to re-live his son's death after being convicted of a crime that is never actually proven. This is a hard story to tell and Tarantino manages to put the audience in the same situation that Ruth is forced in in order to get the emotional stakes just right. This movie is not for everyone but if you can put up with some very rough dialog and a very short runtime, you won't regret a moment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is well made and worth the price of admission. The main thing that bothered me is that the movie was too long. The plot is good enough and there is some action to keep the viewer interested. The acting is not good but there is nothing to complain about in that regard. I think this movie would be better in 3D. There is a scene that is very disturbing that you must see to be believed. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good mystery and a good thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ What is good: The main protagonist, Laila, is a very well done protagonist. She is a strong woman who will never let anyone's opinion sway her, and will always do what's right. She even gives back a part of her salary when she's called into a meeting to discuss a problem the company is facing. What's not so good: There are a lot of bad ideas in this movie. In my opinion, most of the characters do not have that much screen time and are left as a background for some of the other characters. Even when they do come to life (and they did) they are a little boring. And the ending of the movie was quite a shock. I can't say I'm a fan of sci-fi, but this movie had so many problems that it should not have been made. What else I liked: The sound quality is good and the camera work was excellent. It was just so frustrating that in order to bring back the main character Laila will have to kill her way into a warzone and in the process has to kill a lot and kill people that should not be in a war zone. What I didn't like: Most of the supporting characters didn't have any screen time at all, and the bad guys were just as generic as the good guys. What could have been better: This movie would have been perfect if the main characters didn´t die so early in the movie. So many of the problems in this film could have easily been avoided if the story of the main heroine, Lila had been given a bit more time. This film was a waste of time. _________________________________________________________  Final Score 4/10

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst   The Justice Department said the investigation will look into whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey. The probe will also examine whether the president committed obstruction when he reportedly asked Comey to end the FBI's investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Wall Street Journal reported.  ADVERTISEMENT  The probe has already produced an indictment for Flynn and an associate, and is focusing on obstruction and perjury, The Journal said. The White House disputed The Journal's account, and referred all questions to Trump's outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz.  the report comes a day after Comey revealed that he'd drafted a memo describing a Feb. 14 Oval Office meeting in which Trump asked him to shut down the FBI probe into Flynn.  on Monday, Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee raised more questions about Trump's motivations.         "He said he 'hoped' the Flynn investigation would be'sorted out'," Comey said. "He did not say he was'sorting it out,' but I take him to mean he wanted to close it."  Comey also revealed that during his meetings with Trump, the president had pressed him to say publicly that the FBI was not investigating him personally.  and that the conversation between the two of them left him "hurt," and he asked his friend, the FBI official, "is it possible I might be interpreted as trying to influence the investigation?"   Comeys statement said that he did not remember the exact words he used to convey his feelings, but that he took the president's comments as a direction. He said that because of those sentiments, he had "calmed my own mind" and did not share that information with Comey. The president's tweet came hours after Comey confirmed the existence of the memo that he shared with a friend to show Trump.  a day earlier. Comey's memo said that Trump had asked Comey during a February dinner for his loyalty and for a pledge of loyalty from the FBI director. The Washington Post first reported the existence and contents of the memos.  that Trump told Comey he "needed loyalty," the former FBI director recounted.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I watched this a few days ago and I really liked it! It's about an older brother and younger sister who are both in an abusive relationship with their parents and are trying to get out, but the older brother gets a job at an all girls school, and the younger one can't get any job at all. When the older sister and her boyfriend go to see an independent film being screened at the school, they are approached by the director of the school to watch an independent horror film. The film looks very good and is very interesting, but when the director leaves the two are attacked by a bunch of crazed cultists who want to convert them to their religion and eat their brains! The film ends when the older sisters get killed and the cultists flee. I found the film to be very well done, and it was entertaining, so I hope you enjoy the film! I hope the reviewers will give it a positive rating as I did! Watch the film here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YjL0RmNw6I_____________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Year of My Life (1957) As far as American movies go, 1957 was a banner year for director John Ford. It started with The Searchers (1956) and continued with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1958), among others. There was another John Ford movie in 1957 that I want to talk about, which is John Ford's 1956 version of The Best Year in the Life of Hughie M. He made the film on the strength of his film The Outlaw Josey Wales (1955). The first Hughie film was a good one, and he won the best actor Oscar in 1956. In The Best Years of Our Lives (1954), he won a second best actor award for his performance in the role of Jimmy Stewart, who is also based on Stewart's real life friend and fellow actor. In this film, however, Stewart plays a man in his mid-thirties who has been a military officer for thirty years and has been in a war all his life. After winning a victory in the war, he lives out his life as a widower, and it is only after his wife passes away that he decides to come back to the United States. He goes to Mexico where he meets and marries a beautiful Mexican woman, who becomes pregnant with their daughter. Then he returns to his home state and spends all of his money buying land and building his dream home. At the end of the film, after he has lived his life and enjoyed his wife's company, he gets a letter from Mexico and his wife leaves him. Stewart goes to visit his family in Chicago, but his mother's death makes him return to Mexico. In The Best of All Possible Worlds (1949), Howard Hawks plays a character who is a young boy who, when he was little, lived with his great grandmother. He spent a lot of time with her, and she taught him about his life, his family, and about life and his relationship with his grandmother. After he dies, a young girl named Nellie comes to his great grandfather's house and meets his great-grandmother, who turns out to be his great grandma's daughter, and they get married and have a child. NellIE (also called Nell) goes to school, becomes a college student, and, during the summer, she and her new family get on a train to go back to Mexico, where her mother is from, and where Nell's

What they're not, is a happy couple. They have problems, they have anger problems, a little jealousy, they get married and their lives change. What makes it unique and worth the watch is the fact that this movie has a great relationship and strong dialogue between the characters. The ending is good, the last scenes in the movie are great, and most importantly, I felt good about watching this movie. It's a very good movie to watch with your best friend, a couple, a parent or a child.

Her dream was to see her father one last time and to show her love.  is the last in a series of films that tells the story of the life of an American girl called Tilly White. She's a good student and has great potential. One day she's picked up by a traveling salesman named Willard White. After a trip to the sea in a small boat she has the following encounter: A young woman of 20, wearing very little, strolling by on a sunny day, holding a large blue bottle of the drug ecstasy. Her hair has been dyed blond. She had no one but the blue bottle, which she is carrying, with her. She is walking on the beach towards the house of her parents, who she has never met. Willard starts to introduce himself, but when she notices he doesn't have a name, she doesn't take no for an answer. Tilly asks him what he is and his reply is to put his hands behind her back and throw her off the beach. She runs away from him and takes the bottle with her and starts to walk away from the house. The camera follows her as she walks down the beach where a group of teenagers were playing. Tally tries to warn them about the man but they ignore her, while Willard decides to chase her down, but she runs into a local fisherman who says: You'll have to wait. He then takes her to his house, and he tells her he won't kill her if she doesn. She has a few moments to think about it and she returns home to her parents.

There are two big issues that I have with this movie.   - The "A" plot was so fucking dumb, that I was surprised by how many times the movie had to be stopped to ask what was going on.   the characters:   It's no surprise that the main character is a dumbass, he is the worst guy of them all. He is also the most stupid, but somehow we like him. He has to live with his dad for the first 10 years and that is so annoying. It's like when a kid is growing up, his parents start to think that he is a piece of shit, and so he is constantly pushed away, until one day, one day he gets his comeuppance.  , but it is too late because his father was murdered, and he has to go back home. So he is pushed into a situation where he is forced to kill a bunch of people and he only has a couple days to live.  . This shit is so bad that when his father finally comes back, he shows the movie to him, and the father dies instantly. There is only one more scene where he asks how his son is doing, and his son says that he only survived by killing his father. He doesn't seem to have any kind of remorse over his actions. This makes me sad. This movie is so dumb that it is difficult to describe what exactly is happening. This is why the movie is the most controversial of the century.   to sum it up:   that's all I got. __________   So I was reading this review, and I thought that it was terrible. It was like all of his sentences were written in a foreign language.

Daniel Day- Lewis plays the title role, a man who must find a way to find a balance between his personal vendetta and the demands of his new family. The Last Samurai explores the meaning of honor, honour, honor, and honour.  the film explores the relationship between the warrior and his family and how the clan teaches the values of honour and honor and how they teach it to the younger generation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must-see for fans of sci-fi.   As a child I adored science fiction and was thrilled to see the movies that featured in my local multiplex in the mid-70's and 80's. They were movies that I could be involved in. I always loved the aliens, space ships and robots. These are the films that shaped who I became, and as a result I was a fan of science fiction. I was also able to meet and work with some of the main creative minds who have made films such as the Star Trek and Star Wars series. I have long considered it one of the greatest science fiction series to have ever been released. I am a huge fan of the work of James Cameron, who is also a fantastic director. He is one of those artists that have made it their life's work. It's such an honor to be able to be in this special screening in honor of the amazing work that he has done. It will be a very special experience for me and my family.    I can only thank Mr. James Cameron and his team of creative genius who helped to bring to life the vision that I loved as a child.    The Aliens Are Back In The 21st Century!  "What's the matter, Doctor, haven't you got enough trouble?  I've got a job to do here!"  (Captain Janeway, Star Trek: Voyager)    What are you waiting for?  Grab your best friends and head on out to The Museum of Movie Madness!  There you will find the best sci- fi films in the world.  We also have a huge selection of TV shows, cartoons, movies, live action and much, much more.  You are in for a treat, and you will not regret it.  The Museum is open on Tuesdays at 10AM, and Wednesdays from 10AM-5PM, Thursdays at 12PM-5, and Saturdays from 10:30AM-7PM.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate  (1971) - One of the most shocking films I have ever seen, this film is still used as a primer for film classes around the world. This is a movie where the main character is an American whose mother is a Korean spy. While he is in the military, his mother is captured by a communist country and is brought to a camp where she is brainwashed.  As he becomes the leader of the group, he begins to realize the evil he is fighting against and how much he is losing the war.   The script was written by  Orson Welles  and it is one of the few films that had ever seen the light of day before the first movie was released.  The film follows a series of increasingly evil plans that are being carried out by the main antagonist who has a group of "agents" who are his personal bodyguards.  This film is considered to be one of Stanley Kubrick's great films and is probably Kubrick's best film.  Another interesting aspect of the film is that it is set during WWII, and the film was originally titled The Manchuko Spy and it has been a subject of many films as to whether or not Kubrick actually filmed it during WWII.  The Manchnurian candidate has many amazing effects that have not been replicated to the same extent since, but I do think it is a great film.

If you like action, or at least are a fan of some of the movies in that genre (such as James Cameron's The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall, etc.), then this movie is a must see. It has a lot to offer in terms of action and stunts, but it also has some very funny moments and moments in a very dark and serious way. A great action movie! I give it a 8 out of 10. -Reed Tucker, March 22, 2002

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** Good Movie *********   I was super pumped for this movie as I have a lot of love for the author who I believe wrote the book. I was even more stoked for this book because I really wanted to feel something for what the author is writing about.   My boyfriend and I both watched this movie together, and it was great to be able to discuss the story and the characters at the same time. It's very enjoyable! We got a bit teary during some scenes, but that's not unexpected for a movie like this. It felt really realistic, and I think that's what makes this movie so cool!   We did have some issues though. The first was the "stuck on the street" part. The movie is about being a young boy, and he has to figure out where he belongs. This movie did an amazing job of introducing us to this boy, but he does fall into the streets and the streets are pretty dangerous, so the movie has to deal with the fact that this boy is scared of the streets, and this is something that you should expect to see in a movie, but the movie wasn't done right, so to speak. The "stolen car" part was also a little weak because it doesn't really fit the overall theme of the movie. You will notice the film had a very dark atmosphere to it and that was pretty effective, but it wasn't as effective when it came to the story. There were too many scenes in which the film tried to show us some sort of emotional reaction to a certain character, but they didn't do it as well as the writer might have wanted, and the ending was a bit weak.  /End Spoiler Warning   Overall, this movie was pretty awesome and a lot more than it needed to be. The ending was better than expected, and that's why I was so excited. I really hope the author does more movies with his book. There was a lot to like about this movie, and if the movie was done better, there's a lot that could have been great.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   "The Man Who Would Be King" is a pretty good movie, it follows the same formula of a man, who is an expert at building weapons, goes into the war and the enemy is pretty dumb. However, in "The Man, The Myth, The Legend" we see the man, actually a myth, and it is interesting that after the war, he is able to rebuild and take on the enemies with the new weapons. He learns a lot, he also grows a little bit and learns to be more caring and compassionate and he is the only one who truly believes in his own strength and what he has done and the power it has given him. This is what makes the movie so good, the film has great action scenes, there is even a big gun fight that I haven't seen before and it was great. We see a couple of side characters who aren't always heroes, but they do have a good moment that we get to see. The actors really did a good job at bringing this movie and even if it's not very good, it has that "cool" feel to it. The music of the film is pretty good and there are even some really good scenes in it. It really has it all in it and I am so glad I watched it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bram Stoker's Dracula was an excellent adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 classic horror novel. The film was a total success, even winning a lot of Oscars and the prize for Best Actor for Edward Woodward. This film not only made Edward Woodward an international celebrity but also provided the great Peter Cushing with his first great success. The film's story is a mix between the true events of the book (although a few of the things in the novel are different from the story as told in the film), and a modern vampire story. This was an interesting approach to the story because it gave the movie more modern style. There are many twists and turns in this film, and you never know what is going to happen. The movie is also an interesting blend of several different genres. You have a very modern, and action-packed, vampire story, you have a mystery plot, and even an adventure story. The film has a fantastic mix of actors from many different walks of life who work very well together. Edward Woodward as Bram Stokers vampire, Edward Blake as Edward Blake, Richard Arlen as Bram's brother Thomas, and Richard Chamberlain as Dracula. This film also featured the performances of Barbara Stanwyck and Vincent Price as the Count and the vampiric doctor, respectively. Some of the film's most famous scenes include the classic duel between Bram and Edward and an incredible scene where Bram uses a knife to cut the heart from his opponent and drink it. You also get a scene where Dracula takes the vampire doctor and his nurse hostage as a way of negotiating a peace treaty. The vampire doctor also uses a key as a sword during the chase scene. The screenplay was written by Bram Stokke's son, George Stokker. Bram Stokske died in 1956 and George Stoksker took over the writing and directing of the movie after he had an accident and was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. The main problem with the film was that the film never really made it into theaters because of a bad weather front (it was the coldest November in a century!). The only movie theatrically showing the film in the United States was in San Francisco at the San Francisco Opera. This may have been why the film didn't make into theaters here in Canada, because the film is much better than any of the other vampire movies at the time. When Dracula was released on VHS in Canada in 1987 (a few years after Bram Stocks death) there
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I liked it a lot. The characters were realistic, and I didn't feel the need to write a review about the film. In fact, it wasn't until I rewatched the film that I realized how great it was. The screenplay by Rob Marshall is very realistic, the acting was believable, and the cinematography was outstanding. It reminded me of an old Italian spaghetti western called The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, except that the bad guys are all so much cooler looking and more interesting than they were in The Good. I don't recommend it to anyone who hates the western genre. But if you like old westerns and the fact that all the bad guy's are in black leather jackets instead of trench coats, you will definitely like it. The only thing I could think of is the fact they could have done more with the "brave new world" aspect. However, even with these nitpicks, I still think this is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great story, that features excellent performances, and some really great characters. The story has a lot of depth, but doesn't bore you and has some fun action as the main character. Don't watch it too early:    This is a fairly slow paced film, but still has some action. I will definitely get this on VHS. Read more reviews of this film on my blog: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies i've seen this year. The story is the main point of the movie. It has a dark atmosphere and the story is made by the film makers so well and well. The movie was a good surprise from the start. The character design are nice. It is not all dark and gloomy. It was very funny and the movie was quite funny at times. The sound is amazing, especially the sound effects. If you like a dark story about a killer and then some funny moments, then you should watch this movie.   The movie is rated as R.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great movie for the genre and it's nice to see some action.  As always, the actors are good and the animation is nice.  I'll add a note about this movie.  It's about a boy who is a very shy and intelligent person, until one day he meets a girl in a park who has a very funny and funny way of speaking and she's called "Mimi".  And this is just one of her many hilarious traits.  She makes her friends laugh and the boy soon starts liking her.  They then move to a house with a garden and it turns out that Mimi is not just a funny girl, she's also very wise.  The whole thing is a bit overrated though, and is a film not to be taken seriously.    If you want to check this movie out then you might want to consider getting the DVD.   And if you have the chance, then here's a link to the trailer: Rating: 3/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I can't say enough good things about this movie. The film follows the story of a woman named Claire (Anya Taylor-Joy), who has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease and has to choose between living her life as normal or living with the disease. Claire is a very intelligent woman who has lived a very "normal" life with her husband and children. Claire's dementia progresses quickly and in the film, she's able to give a "piggyback" to the family members she still enjoys being with. One of the reasons I liked this movie is because of the characters. Claire has the ability to be incredibly understanding and kind with others and you can see that she is very strong minded and in control of her disease. In some of the scenes in the movie, Claire doesn't know what is going on around her and is in a very confused state. It can be tough to watch this film because it makes you wonder what is really going on. As the movie progresses, Claire is able to use her "mind powers" to be the best wife and mother she can and to some extent, help her family. One part of the movie that stood out for me was Claire's fight with the hospital and with the nurses over who gets to be her caregiver. Claire was forced to put up with the pain and suffering of others to the point that she was forced into a coma to help her get better. Another part of this film that left a lot of impressions on me was the fact that Claire's brain was actually scanned to determine what would happen to her as a result of her early onset dementia. This was a nice touch to the film that allowed for us to see a side of Alzheimer's and dementia that we don't usually see and is very interesting to read about. The story of Claire's disease is really interesting and well done and I felt like I was learning more about Claire and her struggles each time I watched the film. The ending of the film had me on the edge of my seat and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning about Alzheimer's, dementia and those living with this disease. __________________________________________ Claire's Mind: A Film By Anya Taylor Joy is a director and actor that is really making a name for herself as she is able take on some really unique and interesting stories. In this movie, she does an outstanding job at showing Claire's character and helping us understand what she is going through as
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The movie is very good and the acting is top notch. It is not a sci-fi thriller but a thriller with a little bit of sci-mystery in it. The premise is very cool and the movie is a bit slow but I do not mind because it is a sci fi movie. The film is about a man named Joe whose father left him when he was very young. Joe wants to go back and get his father and after a lot of trouble he gets the chance. He meets a woman named Linda who wants to meet Joe and he agrees to take her to his old house which they walk through the ruins. While they are there the man finds out that he has a problem with his father who was trying to help him get away and the man takes his gun and kills the father. Joe runs and then he goes back to the old house to try to get his revenge. He finds that the house has been turned into a living space and so he begins to look for the old man. After they get in they find out the old place is like a living place so they are forced to deal with the evil there. The action is very nice and the story is interesting. The ending is kind of a cliff hanger but I think the sequel is on the way so I hope that the fans will like it. __________________________________________________________ -M.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you've seen this movie, you know what you're in for! One of the best films I've seen in years and probably the best one since The Rocketeer (the other being The Crow). The movie is a great mix of action, sci-fi and a bit of a horror flick. If you like the first movie, this is your next. A must have for any fan of science fiction and action.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that needs to be on anyone's "watch list" but it gets its rightful place in my "must see" list.   And what a fun experience it was.   In the summer of 2001, one of the most exciting time frames in film history, the first James Bond film appeared on the big screen, a first step in the franchise to become the biggest and most successful property in the world.  So while the producers, director and actors were busy making the film that would make a big impact on this industry, what happened next?  The next 007 movie would be James Bond in Japan?   The original ending for Dr No  I don't think that we could have predicted the changes that James Bond would undergo over the next several movies.  It didn't stop the producers of the original 007 movies from going ahead and making another movie.  The producers of Dr. No  wanted to continue the story from the original and wanted Bond to have a girlfriend, a "real" girlfriend like Bond's own in Live and Let Die.  They wanted to take the story in a completely different direction than how the original story ended, but they also wanted to have an interesting lead-in to the next film, so they made the decision to go back to the source material and have Bond break into Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The movie opened on Valentine's Day and was a huge hit.  Bond didn't take long to get caught up in the "good guy" mission and soon went after the villain.  On the surface it seemed like an interesting idea, but when I was watching the movie, I didn't see what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish.  They took a good idea and used it to create something that wasn't as good.  We are also given a chance to get to know the new female characters in the film.  There are no female Bond girls, and the ones that are introduced don't even play a significant role in the story.  In fact, when the movie was over, I had no idea what they were doing with the Bond girls.  For the most part, the movie felt like an afterthought.  It was nothing more than a simple James Bond action film, nothing more.   The producers did get it right in creating a fun action film with plenty of spectacle.  Dr.No has plenty of action sequences, both on the ground and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The film starts off with a bang. The film is set on the eve of the Winter Solstice, and it's actually set during the Winter solstice. In the film, two people from the far north who have been trapped in an old man's cabin for the winter, have been told that they have an option to leave when the Winter Sun comes up. What they don't know is that when the Sun comes, their time will soon be up, and when the sun goes down, so will their lives.  This is the start of a movie that is set at the moment of Winter Solstice, and that is the movie we are going to be talking about today. Winter Soltice is about two people, who have recently been released from a cabin. They are given three days to get food, and get their clothes and anything they might need.  The sun goes up in the middle of Winter solstice.    They are trapped at their cabin by a snow storm that keeps getting worse, and worse.   On a day when there should be plenty of snow, the snow only seems to get thicker. This snowstorm ends up turning into a snow cave.  This is where the two are trapped in the cabin, and they must find out what is going on. One of the characters, who is named Baudelaire, discovers a small room of a man named La Belle Epoque, who has been inside his own mind for a long time. La Belle's cabin is very elaborate, with gold leaf walls, and gold mirrors, and a fireplace that is so big it is almost too tall to fit over the fireplace. La la Belle was the first person La Belle had seen. He was also the first man who spoke to Baudelle. La La Belle was quite different from the rest of the people in the village. He is very cold, and has a bad temper. He has also been hiding for a very long time, having been born with something of a curse. In his mind, he is a young man, but that young man is not in a position to be an adult.  He is the "Young Man Who Only Knows" (youth that has not grown into the man who is to be) but he has always been different from those around him. The other characters in the film have a hard time relating to Boudelaire and his situation. There are many people in this village
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ What makes this movie unique is that we follow the lead character through various stages of her life. As we watch her get older, we see her become less of a tomboy and more of a "girly" girl. As she gets more serious with her life, she eventually finds a guy (Dylan O'Brien) to settle down with (played by Sam Rockwell). In her younger years, she has more or less dumped her old boyfriend and he is not at all happy about it. She moves in with her parents, who have been struggling with money for years, and begins to make friends (played here by Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt). It is also here that we learn more about who this character is and the reasons for her actions. There is an underlying message here that the world is a dark, dangerous place and that the way to survive it is not always through tough decisions but through embracing it and turning the other cheek. The movie also teaches us to take life with a grain of salt and to not take life so seriously as to be self-righteous.  Rated 5 out of 5 by A.C. from The movie I never saw... and then loved it! I was at a family function and my son asked me if I would watch the movie, that is all I can say that I did. My son was 5 years old and my 5 year old daughter was 6. He came up to me after the movie and asked me "Did you like it?" And I said "yes I did" he told me this is the movie he wanted to see because he had never seen it. He said, "If I ever want to see a film that is not a movie of war and monsters he will be a big boy. That's his favorite film." The movie is about a young boy who goes out on the battlefield during WWII, sees the true horror of war, gets back to his home, finds love, and learns that it is OK to live and not to take your life so serious. He finds happiness, love, friendship, family, etc. My only comment is that it should have been titled The Real Truth.

They set off on an epic journey to stop the monster before it destroys them all.   "In the end, it is all the same old story of good against evil, of love against hate, but there's something different this time... the way the world looks at people is not the same. No one is afraid of the monster. The monsters are afraid of us. And the people are the monsters. The movie is a really great example of how you can have a story that is full of good characters and yet, at the same time, really scary and scary enough for us to feel that we have to protect the people around us.

There is a great twist at the end, and there are lots of scenes I wish had been done in the first one. I like the addition of a second son, and the love affair between him and his sister is wonderful. Also, a terrific ending with the final fight between the good guys and the bad guys. Just another brilliant story of adventure.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paint It Black  is a really good movie.  Not a perfect one, but a great one.   This film is the follow up to  The Manchurian Candidate.  It's interesting to note that both of these movies take place in the 1950's.  But you really have to remember how little was going on with the world in those years.  Sure we had a lot of technological advances, but at the time that was all they had.  I found this film interesting, but not as much as The Manch.  It does have a lot more heart and is more emotionally satisfying, but if you're looking for a better film I can't recommend  it.  The ManChurian was a very good movie, but I think  this film had a much more satisfying ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   In the movie, our hero (Spencer Tracy) is on a flight to Las Vegas where he's going to play in a movie that his buddy (Steve McQueen) is producing. When he gets off the plane, he finds his girlfriend (Jennifer Grey) has left him and the plane is out of fuel.  In order to land the plane Spencer decides he must find a place on the island with a strong electric current and make it go to Vegas. The first place Spencer decides to look is a "witch hut" where he finds it.  the witch hut has a "high voltage" power plant.  as Spencer begins to walk through the hut, a little girl starts to come out of it and he gets scared. The girl tells Spencer she's an electrician and that she's going in with him to fix the generator and run the wires back to the airport. As Spencer is heading towards the hut to take her to the electrician's office he finds out she is really an escaped slave named Molly Brown. She says she will kill him if he lets anyone else into the hut. Spencer decides they will have to find another place to hide because the electric plant has been sabotaged and is going to blow.   Spencly is a good guy. He tries to help Molly and she doesn't even seem like she likes him. I don't think the movie does a great job of showing why he doesn't like her. What I do like about the movie is the main cast is very well balanced and I liked all of them. I am also in favor of the fact that the movie shows the true meaning of true love. This is a story about a couple who fall in love but they have to make it work in spite of not knowing why they want to marry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Girl is a film that explores the concept of sexual morality.  As we watch the titular character, it becomes apparent she has some hidden issues that we're not supposed to know, until the moment she's raped.   What follows is an incredible film about being an abused woman who has the desire to survive.   The Good Girl  is very close to the first feature film I ever watched called The Unusual Suspects.    I watched this film on an airplane on the way to see a friend.    It's a true cinematic treat.  The story begins in the 1980's, when we see a college student, who was just kicked out of her house, move into a decrepit apartment with her new boyfriend.  At first the two of them were just hanging out together doing nothing, but over the course of the film, they slowly begin to realize they have a very special connection and when one day, they're faced with the decision of whether or not to do something more, we witness one of the most disturbing and violent scenes I've ever seen in a film.  A truly original script and a great cast makes this a film I will never forget.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The last five years of my life were all devoted to the discovery of the supernatural. I can remember, in my late teens, how interested I was in the unexplained phenomena, the unexplained creatures, the unsolved murders. Then I discovered the supernatural for the first time. I remember, too, vividly the night, after watching a horror film in a cinema, when the cinema went dark. I turned around. The film was still showing, but it was in black and white. The cinema was deserted. No one was around. It was night time. But it was still the film I had just seen. I stood looking at the film, and I felt a sense of revulsion at the sight of the horrible creatures, and the horrible people in the film. I still remember the feeling. I was scared that I would have to go back to the cinema to watch the same film. A few months later, when I discovered television, I was astonished to discover that such a horror story could be told in the most innocent of ways. I went to see the show My Life as a Teenage Witch. It gave me a new perspective. My reaction to that horror show was one of revulsiveness. I did not believe I would ever enjoy seeing a horror movie. But then I saw The Devil's Rain. My life as a teenage witch had finally made me see what I'd been looking for all my life, the horror. I felt the urge to seek out the other films that were like it. The films were not for people like me, the audience that would not be frightened by such a film, because it was too innocent. It did not want to be frightened. It just wanted to be shown. It had a quality that could not be defined, a quality I could only call 'natural'. It did something no one else could do, it did the impossible. It took the audience by surprise. It shocked us. I had never been so taken in before. It became an obsession, and became a source of shame. As a teenager, I went over and over the top in my attempts to be scary, and failed all the time. It is very easy to be a horror fan when you are a young person. You don't realise what you've done until later on. And when you're older and wiser, you can see the mistake that you have made. Horror films are good for you, they give you ideas, they make you look at things in a

A. M. E. R. is an awesome movie for any Alien fan. It is a film that I have watched before and I loved it. It was great to see the Aliens in a film, this was definitely my favorite part of the movie. It also features the very best action sequences I have ever seen. This is definitely one of the better Alien movies of all time. The story for F A M E R is a little strange and the characters in this are not all that great, but it is fun, and it is a nice change of pace from other films in the Alien series. The performances are all pretty good. Everyone gets a chance to shine, and the actors really take the lead in this one. It isn't one of my favorites, but I still have to give it a watch. And with good reason, this is definitely an awesome Alien film. I give it an 8/10. Next week I will be writing about The Last Starfighter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Debaters by Mark Wahlberg, and I like it.   The movie is about the three great debaters of the American Revolution, who in an unusual event, agreed to debate.   One side was British, one side was American.   All the people had something in common, which was that they wanted the American colonies to succeed.   They disagreed on most things, but there was one thing they could agree on; they hated the British.   They had a lot of fun in this movie, and the British were not too pleased.   In the end, they had to fight. The Great Debate by Mark Twain, is about a debate that started when it came time for a debate between the two American Presidents at Kirtland in 1835.   On one side were the two presidents, the other side was a large delegation of Indians.   That's how this story begins.   Then, two more presidents came to debate them, the one who was on the Indian side got angry at the first presidential debate, and said that his only chance of beating the British was to make sure that the other guy didn't even show up.   He said that if the other president had come in, he would have beaten him.   Now, they've been making the case for some time to get this battle of ideas to happen.   If you ever have the chance to watch one of these debates, do so. "You've got to get the other man to come to Kirtlander for this debate," the president told the second president.   "I could never do it myself," said the second, "and if I had to come I couldn't beat him. The Indian delegation will not come unless we do it." And that was the beginning of the battle of the great debates.   Not only that, but when the Native American delegation came, they didn't show up, and when they did come, they showed up with the wrong side.   And the other two presidents didn't like it very much.   When the other presidents got into it, they lost it.  It was a long, and at times very nasty, debate.  Eventually, the president with the Indian delegation, was so frustrated that he said, "You know, I'm an Indian, and that's what I want to fight, not the British."   So, at that point, the British sent out an attack force, to get those

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________ Do I ever need to repeat myself? This is not a bad film. There's something for everyone in this flick. But it's a little thin on the character development. There were some parts where it seemed like the characters were merely a vessel for the plot to operate, and it was very easy to forget they were there. That said, there are some decent moments here. The acting is just so-so. There are a lot of performances with a "nice guy" type quality to them. It's not really that bad of a thing, but you do notice it a bit, and I'm not entirely sure why that is. I think I could give a better performance than this, but then again, you'd have to be a pretty sick actor to pull off a performance this good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** A lot of films, especially those in the supernatural genre, are about strange things happening and people going insane. ********** Not much happens in this one, and it does start out a little slow, but by the end of the movie the audience will feel like they have seen all of the characters' darkest hours. ************ A lot can be made of a good story but you can't do that if you don't care about your characters and if you aren't prepared to spend hours watching the movie. **************** A couple of things that really put this movie over the top, were the sound design of a bunch of characters going "woah!" ***************** That's a whole lot of words for one movie. Let's just talk about it: There's a lot of tension, a lot in the way of scares and an incredibly creepy final third. _____________________________________________________________________________ If you want to see a story that actually has something to say, then this is it. ______________________________________________ This is the perfect movie for Halloween.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Have you seen this movie? What do you think?   It's a shame that, after spending an entire movie learning the rules and then getting to know one of these kids, the next thing you know you're in a horror movie and it's a "horror" movie because you don't know what a horror is, but there's a monster that looks like a pig-headed, naked, talking demon who is about to attack this boy.   The thing I like about this movie is that the monster isn't in the beginning of the movie. In the beginning he's just standing there and looking at the kids, and then he decides to get up and run away because he's scared. He's like a scared dog. He runs away and he's running away and then there's this horrible scream and then the scene cuts to this one kid running for his life.   the end.   He gets home and he tells his mom that something weird happened in the woods, and that's about it. No explanation, no plot. He doesn't know why he did it, so his mom doesn't really have much to say to him. He comes back to school the next day, and the teachers don't give him a hard time. He decides to try to find out what happened to the creature, and they tell him that he'll find out when he gets home, but he'll have to wait until later that night. There is no explanation as to why there is a demon with a pig head and nakedness. I mean, he does have a really long hair, but I can't help but think of all the "what is a pighead and what does it have to do with this movie" jokes that people make about this show. I guess this is more of a movie that could be made if they cast Michael J. Fox in the part of the demon or something. I suppose he could play the demon in some kind of "pig head" action movie, but that would be really lame.   to be continued...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I know it's the end of May, but I'm still not sure I'm ready to call this film a masterpiece. I've watched it several times, and I'm convinced I've seen it all, but that doesn't really explain why this film has been so difficult for me to wrap my brain around. At the heart of the film, and perhaps the true purpose of the "story," is the tragic tale of a husband, his wife, and their two young children. They were in a hotel room, watching a movie, when a man they did not know came through the door. The man had been arrested, and he was talking about wanting to kill the family. There is no evidence that this man was anything other than a "dickhead." This man would eventually be found dead in the same way the other three would, from a heart attack, but before he died the man told the wife to "lay down" and shot himself in the head. To me, the idea that the man could talk to the wife and her child and that he wasn't a "terrorist" is a horrifying idea. It's a story of one man taking advantage of his wife and children. It doesn't make for a good story, and it certainly doesn't feel like it could have been any other way. In fact, the movie feels very different than anything else I've ever seen. It seems like a strange amalgamation of the worst elements of different movies, with a heavy influence of the Manson family. It is a twisted, horrific movie that makes little sense. But it feels right. In my opinion, this is a truly awful movie, but it still has enough good in it to be worth watching. It might not be my favorite, but if I were to have a second, third, or fourth viewing, I would certainly revisit this. If anything, it makes the film seem even more like a horror movie than it already was.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This film is a must watch" "It is hard to put my finger on exactly what The World's End is about.  It is about a boy (Eddie Redmayne) who is bored with his life in the suburbs.    He gets a job, does his best to keep his girlfriend (Emma Stone) happy, and then he comes home one night to find his brother (Bill Nighy) has become a zombie.  His mother has been bitten too and is being held prisoner in the cellar of a house (well, the house in the film actually).   Now Eddie must rescue his brother and his mother from their captors and save the world from the zombie apocalypse.  I am a huge fan of The World According To Garp.  So was my wife.  It is hard for me to put this down.  Not only is it funny and witty, but it is a beautifully acted film with a great story.  The cast is amazing, especially Eddie Redmaynes.  But it is this story and the world that keeps coming back to me.  You have to be a true fan to see this film.  And for what it is: A great movie.  "The World According to Garp" was released in 2009, but was released on DVD recently.  To see it in a different format, check out my review:  So... who is the best zombie?  It is a fun question.  In general, the most zombies are zombie killers.  Some of the zombies like to play nice, and some don't like to be killed.  One thing we can all agree on is that a zombie is not a zombie unless it has just eaten a human.  Zombies do not like to bite, or grab.  They may try to be friends, but this isn't always the case.  As such, I am going to use my own opinions to make this list.  My choices will be based on one thing...  How well I think they would be able to do their job in real life. 5.      John Wayne Gacy This man is not only famous for being the killer in the "Giant" murders, he also is a man of honor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Me (2007)  comes with a small but important caveat.  The director and the writer were both ex-military, and when they made The Best of Us (2007), they both served on active duty as well as in the reserves.  They were deployed in Afghanistan for nine months, and each spent time in a combat zone.  As far as this film, there is absolutely no doubt about it.  All four characters in the film are veterans, and they all speak with a very heavy voice.  There is a lot of action, and it is a very well acted movie, but the fact remains, that if you are in any way considering a "military" type film, you might want to reconsider.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** If you have enjoyed this movie, then please tell your friends about it. This is a great film.  It really made me feel like I was a little kid again. It was great!  Thanks for watching.  a nice addition to the great movies I enjoy.  and it's pretty much all I've ever wanted to see! - a good one! -   I just finished watching this and I found the story to be very intriguing. I thought it was interesting how they made the characters more human and then we see them more as a group and then they realize they are all human and we see that at a deeper level. I really liked that.   This is a film I will surely have a look at some time and I am looking forward to seeing more of it.   The acting was great, the directing was good, the story was good and the action was good. The soundtrack was great as well. . - a good and interesting film -     The way they made their characters more like ourselves and then seeing that they are actually all human makes the story even more interesting and interesting.  is an excellent film and I suggest everyone to check it out!  The film is based on a book "We Were the Moon" by Ray Bradbury. In the film the crew of the Mars Mission becomes stranded on Mars when the rocket they are travelling in is damaged. However, the two pilots, James Moseley and Mark Watney, survive the accident and return to the Earth, not long after. Unfortunately the damage to their ship is so extensive that they need a new one, which is being manufactured on Earth. However this new rocket has a fatal flaw: it does not function. After some time the crew discovers that the crewmen's memories are not completely gone, but can be recalled by a device called "the amnesia machine". Mosely and Watney must use all their skills to get the machine working again. "We Were The Moon" is a story about the exploration of Mars, the danger of space travel, the human side of the adventure and of all the possible lives we could live on Mars. It is a tale of how the human being has the potential to become the master of space flight, how the knowledge of space has led to the invention of many amazing technologies, and how our fascination with space is often used as a means of war.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. It makes the movie even better.  In a world where everything is terrible, where you're left to figure out the best movies based on what the best people are watching, it's refreshing to find a movie that's trying to be different. Even the "good guy" characters are pretty damn good (if sometimes a bit weirdly evil), and the villains are interesting, compelling people. Not everything about the movie is perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than a bunch of people pretending to be superheroes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Day The Earth Stood Still " is the first feature film from the team behind The Blair Witch Project. While still a mystery film it's a very cool and unique idea. The plot has been described as "the most over-the-top sci-fi action adventure that has ever been attempted on film" and it is a very true statement. It's basically a sci-fantasy, supernatural thriller with many twists and turns. There's a big difference between a movie that's "the best" and one that's truly fantastic and this movie definitely qualifies. It does have some problems but they are minor and only distract from the overall experience. The acting is great all around, especially in the scenes in the car as well as the scenes with the camera. There are a few sequences that could've been better but other than that this is a well-made film that's very worth a look.   Watch it at home on the DVD, the Blu-ray and it will look really good on the big screen. The effects look great, the pacing is very good and it has an intense and engaging story that doesn't drag on for too long. It is definitely the best of the Blair Witch series and one of the best movies in the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Boy Scout" (2013) is a well-acted story about a man and a boy who are friends and are drawn together after he gets sent to a boarding school for troubled boys.  There is an element of horror in the film that does not come at the cost of a decent story.  When he is released, the boy goes to stay with his uncle and their new landlord, but he has become the new sheriff in town.  This makes for a very funny film.  I liked that the filmmakers did not focus too much on the bad guy and instead used this as an opportunity to put the audience in the place of the boy as he tries to balance the roles he has to play as a man, a sheriff, and a father.   The only problem with the film is that it seems that the director wanted to put a bit of an extra twist in the movie, as the guy at the end has some rather odd tattoos, but that does little to detract from a very fun film.   The Last Boy Scouts (2013 ) is available on Netflix (or streaming sites)

I did not understand how people in the film is a great family. I also did not appreciate the action scenes that were a little bit over the top. I thought I was watching a movie and I was not satisfied with it. The story does have a great beginning and end. However, I have never seen a film in my life so over the years, that would have taken me to a different place in my movie watching life. I would highly recommend this film to any person. I think a great movie with great visuals, action, and a great romance could have been the best movie of the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ My wife and I saw this in a preview in San Francisco when I was living there at the time. We both thought it was really well made. It's a fun, quirky comedy, and has great, funny performances. It was made in San Jose, so it's a little dated, but I wouldn't say that is a problem. I love the idea of a big corporation that is in big trouble, because it is supposed to be a comedy, but there's a lot of social commentary, which the movie pulls off, and it has an awesome ending. I found it interesting that there was a scene at the end of the movie where a guy who was in the film was on a boat in a pond, and he thought he was in another movie, and I'm not sure why, but the water was changing colors, and the whole time he was looking at it, the colors were changing. So there was something about this movie that just seemed to have a message. _________________________________________________________________________________ Watch the trailer, and you'll find that it has a bit of everything. I think it has fun, clever jokes. There's a good amount of laughs. A lot of the characters have interesting backgrounds, and some are likable, even if you don't like the characters. The characters and the comedy are very well made, and not a ton of swearing, but a lot. I enjoyed it a lot, and recommend it to all. _________________ See what people are saying about this film in our forums area, or check out other reviews of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A beautiful, well-crafted, very intelligent film. It has its flaws, of course, and the story of the film, the themes it explores, the characters it portrays, and most of all the casting of the characters don't quite measure up to the film's potential; but if you're into the ideas of the movie, and interested in it as a social analysis of the American social condition, there is a lot to like here. The film's production quality is excellent, and it has great performances from the cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix (1999) This is a movie that had a lot to live up to, but if it can be said to live in this decade, it's definitely living up to its expectations. This movie is filled with what would come to be popular tropes for the time it was made, including the "Matrix" in its opening titles, the plot to free humans of the physical world, the fight against Neo, and a plot to destroy the computer in the first movie. This is a sequel to the first Matrix, and while the story is somewhat derivative, it still remains entertaining and is a better version of the original movie than its sequel. The plot follows the characters of Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Ellen Page), and Cypher (Michael Fassbender). While the story starts out on a more serious note with a battle between Neo and the evil Machine (the world of the movie is a pre-World War II world where humans fight robots), it is not long until Neo starts to find himself involved in a larger conspiracy involving the government and many machines. It's a lot of fun to watch the characters get all philosophical, and they still keep you entertained as the plot keeps shifting around you. This film has a great cast, and it has some of the best special effects that were ever used in a film. The story was well written and executed, but it was still not as good as the first one, but that's not a bad thing. A very fun movie, and I recommend this movie to any fans of the Matrix series. A few years later, Neo and Morpheus are now free, but there is still a war to be fought. This war is not one between humans and machines, but between humans who were given the power to use technology, and machines who are trying to keep humanity down. Neo has a new mission, one that he had not even known about. A new man named Morpheus is now in charge of the military, and has made war a very important part of the world. Neo's old friend Cypher has moved to a quiet island off the coast of Ireland, where he lives a lonely life on a very small farm. Neo and Cypmer are soon confronted with the truth, and Neo has to decide if he is willing to let go of his quest to find answers to his questions, or if he will fight on, as he has been his entire life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I'm not going to lie: I thought the film was overrated when I first saw it. I was going in hoping for a fun comedy with a good script. Instead, I was treated to a rather slow paced and underdeveloped story line. There were some funny lines, and I had a good time, but it was very hard to care about the characters, and that is an easy trap to fall into with poorly written films. I'm glad I watched it though, because it turned out to be a very good comedy with some strong performances. The ending is very emotional, and it shows the importance of the characters and their struggles. It made me smile, it made me cry, it showed me the importance that the people have on the future of their nation and it showed the power of friendship in a society. I hope this film gets more recognition, because I think it would make a great comedy with great acting. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I also feel that it could have been a great drama film, but as it is, it is a fun and fun-filled comedy. I gave it a B, because, despite it's flaws, I thought it was a good film, which is a bit rare in this day and age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Gravity' is a film that has a lot of potential. If you enjoy the science fiction genre then it's something to be excited about. I liked the idea of trying to understand what happened to the human race as it was going extinct and how did they go from space shuttles to a space station? It's a different take on the sci-fi genre and I like that.  It does have a few problems that made me think of the original 'Star Wars' film where there was a lot wrong about the story but it does show that science fiction films can be made. The film is set in the distant future where humanity has been on a space shuttle for 100 years and are only on the station for maintenance. It's the year 3227 where the station is destroyed by a meteor.  The shuttle and the crew are not destroyed but stranded on a remote planet called Anubis. They discover that a colony of alien people have made it to the planet and take control of the station and use it to travel across the galaxy in search of their new home.  This is the premise of the film, a lot has changed about the characters, the plot, and the setting over the past 100 years. It doesn't get too complicated but it's a good enough movie that you won't miss anything.  A lot of the action takes place in the air and on the ground. The fights are fast paced and there's a great mix of character and action scenes.  There are also a couple of really good sci-fie moments throughout the film.  These include a couple where a space ship is shot down and it crashes into a planet and a scene where a spaceship is seen heading towards a planet at light speed.  And this movie is not afraid to have an awesome space battle scene.  I thought the explosions were pretty awesome and the space ships in the film are really awesome.  In fact I was impressed with how well the actors were able to handle all the action.  Although the movie does start out with the main characters stuck on the planet, the action really gets going when a spacecraft enters the planet's atmosphere.  A couple of great visual effects work are seen, including the planet in the foreground turning from a blue planet to a green planet, as the spacecraft passes by.  It's an amazing sight and one that will not get old too quickly.    There's a few moments where the action gets to a bit over

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The Big Sleep is a good thriller. A thriller that is set in a world where a good man is dead and where a young girl, Lina (Lena Headey), is the only survivor. But it is not a traditional thriller. The film is an interesting and well-paced thriller with an interesting plot, good acting, a good story and a great music score. This is not your usual action thriller where the action is over very quickly, and is the typical "shoot out between two villains". There is a very strong and emotional story here and it is very well-written. I enjoyed the film, it is a great movie and definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one of my favorite movies of all time and I loved it even more when I saw it again for the first time in many years at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is based on the novel written by George S. Patton, but was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  The story follows Colonel Jessup (Vincent Price), who, when an accident occurs at a U.S. army base, is transformed into a war veteran.    This turns out to be a bad decision, as Colonel Jessups gets involved in a drug trafficking cartel and is soon involved in war in Korea, where the government doesn't even know what to do with him.             This is an epic film.  As I said, it is based off the book, but the film version is very different from the book.  The film version had some changes that I personally didn't like, but others like myself enjoyed it, so I will include it here.  For one thing, Francis Ford coppola decided that he didn't want to use the famous "O" in his title, because he was afraid people would not understand it.  This may sound silly, but he was also afraid that the film would be considered a "porn film".  The movie was not considered as such by many people, who did not understand the film's title, but they did understand that the title was not for "porns" but instead to reference a war movie.   After a brief look at the movie, we see a bunch of military soldiers in the middle of the desert, with an intense fight going on all around them.   In my opinion, the film, is a little more brutal than the book and I could understand why he did not want to put in the "O".  As the story goes on, we get to know more and more of the characters as they live their lives and see what happens to them.  When we first meet Colonel Jessupp, he is living in the army base with his wife and son.  They are at peace with one another and, I suppose, even enjoy each other's company.  Then we meet Colonel McCready (Kevin Costner), who has been there two years and the first thing he notices is Jessupp and his family.   McCready is a very sarcastic character, who has no problem with drinking and being a bit of a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's kind of funny that people were concerned about this. It really wasn't anything special, but I loved how they ended it. I liked that they kept the scene where the old man takes out a pistol and kills two of the gangsters with it, I guess it would have been too much if they had just let him get killed. But what I really enjoyed was that it ended without a traditional resolution and there was no twist at the end. It ended on a cliffhanger, I really liked that. Plus it's kind-of weird that the bad guys get caught with their heads cut off, which is never a good sign. But overall this is a good little movie with nice visuals and some decent acting, you might even find something interesting in it.  Just remember to watch it when you're feeling bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way We Were" has an excellent script, a good screenplay, an excellent story, good actors and the right director, making a movie that has great production value and a decent story.  It is definitely a great action movie, and is more of a movie about two gangs getting along instead of the typical "hero and bad guy" cliché. The only real negative I could think of about the film is that the production is somewhat lackluster, as there are not that many effects. The movie is also a bit repetitive and you might even forget about it if you go to see it again later. If you like action, or if you want to watch a good action movie with excellent action and the occasional good plot, then "The Way You Were" is definitely one for the watch.  The film opens with an extremely short intro that plays a brief clip of the main characters getting into an auto-gang, and then it cuts to a scene of two gangs that were shot down, and their leader and his henchman getting killed by the military and taken back to a POW camp for treatment. I don't really want to get too much into this part of the film, as it is pretty unimportant to the plot, but it's definitely nice to have a brief snippet of the story. You have a few other scenes like this that I would also like to talk about, but again I will skip this because the film moves along quickly. Once the film gets going, we follow a very short and very well executed revenge movie. The film starts out with a very cool car chase scene in a car, and the film starts to play out. We see this car chase play out, we see the driver getting in trouble, we then see the car chase from the car's perspective, and we see both sides of the car getting into trouble. The first time we see this, it is an amazing sequence of car crashes, with very impressive car and helicopter shots, which are pretty cool, and it leads to a short chase scene between the military car and the gangsters car. It is pretty much a simple car chase, but the car driving and the cars crashing is really cool, so we go back to the scene with the car, we have some great explosions in the sky, and this is a great sequence of action. The car chase is fun, and so is the chase scene, so I don`t know why there isn`t more of this in every action movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wailing is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.   If you think horror films are too gory and scary to be believable, you'd be surprised how well this movie is made and what a good story it has.     This film shows that a good horror film needs to have a good villain.   The Wailing isn't a perfect villain; the film has an overbearing police force, but it still manages to be more than just a standard evil police force.   I enjoyed that the film didn't go into the standard trope of the cop character having some sort of mental illness that he needs to take care of, it's a very different take on how a villain works.   If there was any doubt that this film was made by someone with experience in the genre, this ending proves that.   This was one of my favorite movies of last year, and I'm sure it'll be a favorite next year.     I highly recommend checking this one out!   It may seem a little basic, but the story and story development are good, it shows how well the horror genre is getting made and it's not afraid to show it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ Star Wars: Episode I _________________________________________ The first episode is one of the better Star Wars movies. While it is full of plot holes and other issues, it makes up for it by being an excellent action movie. The special effects were phenomenal. The action sequences were amazing and even the special effects worked very well on the big screen. The opening was a great way to set the movie off and the action was epic. _________________________________ _______________________________________ Star Wars ________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________ _________________________ Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is considered to be the worst Star Wars movie and it's true. It is just plain awful. The main story that follows Jango Fett is lame. I mean it's lame and it really doesn't have much of anything to it. It's a little like a terrible version of Gladiator. The characters in this film are the worst in the history of Star Wars. Obi Wan, Anakin, Qui-Gon, C-3PO, Jar Jar, Ani, and Padme are just some of the characters. The writing is bad and the characters don't seem to have much development at all. The effects are horrible. The music and sound effects are all over the place and the sound editing just makes the movie look awful. When the good bits happen in this movie it just seem like it's a blur. But hey if you want to watch an awful movie that has poor writing and characters then by all means go watch this bad movie. ________________________ Star Wars (1977) ___________________________ Star Trek ______________________________ ________________________ ________________ ______________ ____________ Star Wars The Phantom ________ ______________________ _______________________ Star Trek: The Next Generation _________________ ___________ _____________________ Star Wars - The Phantom Man ____________________ ___________________ ________________________ Disney's Aladdin __________________ _________ ________________________ _______________ The Lone Ranger ______________________________________ -------------------------------- Star Wars Movie Guide -------------------------------- Star War's Star Wars ------------------- Star Wars, The Movie _____________________________________ Star Trek Star Trek (2009) ____________________________________ Star Trek Into Darkness __________________________________ ________________________________ Star Wars and the Making of Star Trek ---------- Star Wars at the Academy Awards - The Visual Effects _____________________________ Starfighter: A Visual History (2000) ------------------------- Star Wars Clone Wars - Star Wars vs The Empire __________________________ Star Wars Visual Effects - Part I ---------- An Insider's Guide to the Creation of
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What a great film! _________  Review Summary: The year is 2118. The year has been a time of great growth and innovation. There has also been great upheaval in the world. The world was still in turmoil. We live in a world of fear, oppression and war. However, some people had begun to find some sort of hope. It was found in a place called New New York. New New NY was an urban wasteland. It had become the place for criminals and vagrants to live. People began to call the place by their given names: New New Y. It wasn't exactly the best of cities. The only thing that made it work was the lack of crime. The problem with New New NewNY is that it is a completely isolated existence. The few that did live there all eventually died. All of the people that inhabited the place were dead by the year 2200. The people had fled into the sewers and tunnels that lead deeper underground. New York was still a very large city and had become a vast network of underground tunnels that were used for criminal and drug activities. It also had a massive population of rats and vermin. The rats were considered to be extremely poisonous by most people. They were used as food and were also used to sell drugs. The Vermin on the other hand were considered as little more than vermin in any case. The Rat was found to be quite useful. It is a sort of mobile food source, able to go through small cracks and holes to get to the food that it needed. The food that was made from the Rat was very highly valued. The Food of the Rat consisted of vegetables that were much less digestible then the vegetables that most other foods would have. It consisted of carrots, sweetcorn, radishes, potatoes and other vegetables. Some people that were desperate to survive in the city of New Newy used the Rat to try and grow themselves a supply of food. However it soon became known that they had to be careful about their food and not eat too much. One man who had lived in New NewY had a different idea. He set himself up as a chef. He was able to find out which ingredients were safe and which ones needed to be cooked. He began to cook his meals on a very high temperature. It took a very long time to cook and he only did it in one small section of the sew. He then began to try to sell his food. He
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wicker Man is, in many ways, an amazing film. It's got some incredible performances from the likes of Tom Hardy, Daniel Craig, and Bill Nighy and some wonderful sets and scenery to go with it. Its action is surprisingly well-choreographed and some of its more gory moments are actually very well done. But, there's a major problem with The Wicker-Man; it's not actually a movie. In the first half of the film, the characters are introduced, the action is set up, and the world of the movie begins to form. Then, the film is over and the characters and world are gone. That's it. The Wigner-Man isn't a movie at all, at least not the way that we'd usually think of one being a movie, it's more like a "movie trailer" and a very well-written one at that. And, as much as I hate to admit it, it is probably a much more enjoyable film to watch on its own than it is when watching it in the context of a feature length film. The Wignor-Man is really just a "show" for its own sake and it makes it much easier to get into the film than a feature film would. The film does manage to tell a really compelling story though and, as a whole, is a pretty good one. If you can get past the "bad trailer" aspect of it and can appreciate its own unique vision and style then The Wic-Man will satisfy. 7/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ 'KILL THE PRESIDENT' (2010) - 7/10, 7.5/10 _____________________________________________________ I enjoyed this film a lot, but there are a few issues that keep it from being the great film it really could be. It does have a decent ending, a decent cast, a pretty good soundtrack (no, I don't think this is an Oscar nominee) and an ending that is both appropriate to the story and exciting. But this is a flawed film, and as it should, a very flawed film. I was disappointed in several aspects of it: it's main plot seems almost too convenient, and the writing is really poor. But it's not a perfect film, as the film is actually pretty good overall. I am not sure if it would be a better or worse film than 'The Dark Knight', but it is a pretty decent film and probably better than a lot of the other "best of 2010" films. It has a nice story that is just about right, and a decent set of characters. It is also very, very long, and although it doesn't have a really cool opening, the ending is quite satisfying. There are many other issues: it is really, really long. I would have preferred to see the film in 5 hours, or something, because in that time, there are some really great scenes, some great acting, and I also like some of the more interesting scenes. There is a very, rather good script and I liked that there was a real sense that this movie was about a lot more than just a killing of a president. But the film just has some really, rather, weak scenes, especially in the first half, and it is also a little too long. This is not a bad film, I still recommend it, but I wouldn't give it a 10, I would probably give it something around 7 or 8.

A well-written comedy about a high school senior who is sent to an all boys private school, where he meets the beautiful and arrogant, but really hot (and not at all shy) girls. I am not really sure how I can give a positive rating to this movie, but it did give me the best comedy of the year. It is not too long, but I think it's pretty funny. I love seeing high school girls in this sort of movie, so I was hoping for something like that, but sadly, it didn't come. I hope that the next time they film this, they make a different script and then I could see it again.  See More ▼ See Less ▲  Get Smart 2010 The Movie The movie gets off to a good start with great performances, great performances. The main character, Nick, is so much likeable and the rest of the characters are funny and likable. However, the movie has one really annoying character, the villain. He is just one big, mean bully who steals everything, throws parties and is always there. He even steals the car of a female character that he has to "talk" into going to his party, but she doesn't listen to him and says, "no, thanks, it's fine, I just don't like guys who try to take everything away from me". I know that his intentions are good, but he is so annoying and obnoxious that you can't help but want to kick him when he says something that annoys you. The movie was not very well-crafted and as such, I found myself forgetting things, but that is a problem with the movie in general, since it's not very original or well-made. The movie is also not very interesting. In fact, the only thing that is interesting about it is the characters and the setting, not the plot. The plot is quite bad. It's a simple "who is the best at whatever", but it has been done a hundred times before and the characters in the movie never seem to think of anything interesting to do with the story except to say, "I'm going to do this, then I'm going home, then, I'm coming back".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Furious 7" is definitely the best movie to come out of the new Fast and Furious movie franchise.  I have been a fan of the original movie since the first film, and I've watched the first two films three times and still haven't tired of them.    The story is an excellent one, and while there were times when I had to question how exactly the movie was going to follow this timeline, the final film ended up feeling just right.  And the car chases are just awesome!   One thing I really like about this movie is the action.  "Furious" has never been the best at car chasing.  This is because cars have never been very good at chases in the past.  But the cars have really gotten better in the new film, which is why it is great.  One other thing that is awesome about this film is that this is a perfect movie for the entire family.  The movie is perfect for the young kids and really easy to watch.  There are plenty of things to be laughed at, and the whole family can enjoy this movie.  Another thing that really helped this movie was the special effects.  For a movie that is so much about the car and the action, you don't really feel any of the explosions, or the gunfire.  Instead, you just feel the car racing and just think of a good time watching "Fury 7."  Another great thing about this car chase is that it isn't over right away.  You actually get to see how the cars start to race, but then they slow down to a stop, then start to go again, and then slow down some more until you really don't know what is going on.  Overall, I think that "Funkasaurus" is a great movie. I recommend that you watch it, even if you already watched the previous two movies.  If you haven't seen them, I really recommend you watch them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. The first 30 minutes or so are slow and the story is slow but that will slow down a lot. It does a wonderful job of setting up all the different characters and then you see all the pieces fall into place. When I think of the world, I think that most of it is a bit boring with just a few interesting places. I did enjoy the introduction of each character because they were not just your typical hero's. The villains were just as great. If I were to nit pick, I would say the bad guy character could have been more like a villain in a cartoon and not someone who is an antagonist to almost all of the people. That was not an issue for me. The cast is great. We have some great performances by the leads. I really enjoyed watching them work. I was laughing for the entire time. Also the music in the movie is awesome. It is not that heavy but it is not something you can forget. I also liked the movie more than most because I am not a big fan of science fiction and horror movies. I like movies that are about the everyday life of people. I love seeing characters that are very human and not all perfect. I just feel a bit more at ease with the movie now that I know that it is about everyday people. It makes it seem more real to me.  My rating:    5 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Gravity' is an amazing film. I've been waiting to see this for quite a while. This movie has so much power in it. I love the direction and the acting. It is so emotional. I wish this was the movie we get for the next 10 years. I'm going to watch the movie over and over again because I just don't care about what happens to anyone else. The best thing about this movie is that it is an emotional story about love. This isn't the kind of movie that people are going to get into because it's too sad or it's not their type of movie. If you like heartbreak, the drama, a good laugh and a good story, then 'Gravity'" is a MUST WATCH! I would love to hear your thoughts, so leave a comment. Thanks for reading!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ The best thing about the first season was the sense of camaraderie, a feeling of team work and an emotional bond. But in the second season, the relationships between the characters became somewhat less developed, and there was an increase in focus on other plot lines. Still, there were some nice aspects to the second half of the season: it was a bit more tense, as we followed the events of a new arc. Most importantly, the action sequences were very strong. They took some of the best elements of the first three seasons and mixed them with a lot of new ones. It was very good. There was a lot going on at once and the characters had to make decisions quickly. As a result, the story was a little muddled at times, but still very enjoyable. There is a lot to enjoy about this series. The first two seasons were very entertaining and full of energy. I enjoyed the characters and the world they inhabited. And I definitely enjoyed the action, which was a welcome change from the first two series.

I'm still a bit nervous.) ______________ (I didn't like it) ____________ (it was ok) ______________________________________ (Not what I was hoping for) __________________________ (Would not recommend this film to a friend)  Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) is an exciting film, and the trailer shows us what we were probably hoping for. The cast is strong, the story is fun and action-packed, and everything looks like a Star Wars film should.  The film starts with Rey looking at the black and white photos taken at a funeral of her great aunt. Rey is on a mission to find out what has happened to her and bring her aunt back to life, when the ship she is on is attacked by a mysterious enemy. The ship is crashed and Rey is trapped on the ship.  the ship is attacked, but Rey is rescued by BB-8. BB- 8 can jump and has the ability to transform. Rey decides to follow him through the halls of the ship to find a way out. But BB- Eight is not alone. He is accompanied by Finn and Poe Dameron. Finn has the power to manipulate gravity and can use this to his advantage. Poe is a pilot and is in the Resistance's Starfighter Corps. He uses his special blaster, "Bodhi-Drake," to protect Poe and Finn from the enemies of the Resistance. , which is a great choice, as it shows the good versus evil in Star Wars. The bad guys are well designed and show great battle prowess. We see a young Rey facing down a stormtrooper with a massive battleaxe. Beside her is a Jedi Knight with a lightsaber. She tries to protect Rey from the enemy by trying to deflect the blaster shots. The enemy turns the ship and they are forced to jump out of the way. The movie is filled with fun action-filled scenes as the movie tries to keep up the "epic" feel of the original trilogy. It does succeed to a large extent. The actors are all very good and do a great job with their characters. There are a few bad-dies, but most of the time they are easily dealt with. For example, Han Solo's son Kylo Ren is a cool character and a cool action hero. I didn't care for him as a character, but that's just my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  "It's a dark comedy, but not the same kind of dark. It's the kind of film where you don't feel you're witnessing someone going crazy or doing bad things. You feel like you're watching a person at the point where it all went so wrong. There is a lot of darkness here, but it's not an unearthly, nightmarish thing. This is just the darkness at the start of a relationship. It doesn't matter what that darkness is because what happens is that the darkness and the darkness is a really good thing. It is a kind of a happy, sweet ending." — The Daily Mail  "… a powerful and moving film." — Vulture  This movie is so good I wanted to talk about it…I'm very happy that it was finally made.  I can't believe that a movie like this made me cry! I think the fact that it didn't turn out to be the disaster I feared, makes me appreciate its greatness more.  the movie isn't all about the terrible, terrible things she has to go through and the drama that she has with her boyfriend. the story is more about the things that made her life worth living. that the movie manages to give a feeling of joy to a life that was at the brink. -  There are some interesting things about the film, the first being how much she doesn't talk about her feelings about her boyfriend and her feelings of depression in the past, in the movie she tells her parents and boyfriend that they are good people, that they love her and that she is the perfect girl and that they would get married. 's life has been very difficult, and her relationship with her parents has also been difficult. It seems that her boyfriend is very good at keeping their relationship going, although the way he treats her is very manipulative. He always looks for new ways to impress her and he gets more and more mean and jealous when she doesn`t appreciate him, or doesn` t seem to really like him. She also finds that his bad moods, bad food, bad jokes, and the way that he talks to her make it very hard to get close to her and make love to her. This leads her to realize that she wants to break up with him, that the relationship they have is not worth the way she is treated or the way they act. But the movie gives her so much happiness in the end that

I like how the movie is short and the characters are real and well drawn. It was nice to watch the actors interact as they did. I liked the fact that you had an episode before the movie, and the fact the actors were not on the same page so much as in the same world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai had an epic cast. In the end, the plot just doesn't make sense, but it's great to see Japanese culture embraced on the big screen. 5/5 This film was produced in Japan by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. This film features a large cast including Toshiro Mifune, Ken Watanabe, Toshiro Shimoguchi, Toshio Masuda, Takashi Shimura, Yukio Mishima, Yosuke Takemitsu, and Tomy Matsuoka. This movie was released in the United States in 1987. It features many interesting characters and events. This is an excellent film, and an interesting one at that. The Last Swordsman is a samurai film. The plot is a bit too complex and the events are a bit over the top. The action and the violence are very well done. I enjoyed this film. I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ _________________________ You don't need me to tell you to watch The Godfather: Part II and stay for the ending, but it would be an injustice to the film if I didn't at least briefly explain it. While I would agree with many that the film was a huge disappointment (and it is by a large margin, even before taking into consideration its terrible reviews), I can't help but appreciate that the Godfather films (especially the sequels) are so full of the sort of rich detail and complexity that you'd never think it's possible. The film was also written by the same guy who directed the film, Francis Ford Coppola, who has a reputation for being a terrible screenwriter. He really is a terrible writer, though, and is more of a storyteller than a filmmaker. But it wasn't the worst of the bad and it's not the best. It's a fun ride and the film is a big fat happy family that has nothing much going on, which makes the ending so damn funny. But there are still some more serious problems, such as why the hell did it have to happen in the first place? A little too happy? Or because it was the last film of the trilogy?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A man named Walter arrives at a house in a rural area and is met with a surprise. He finds a little girl tied up and gagged in a dark basement. The little girl, named Amy, tells Walter about her father, a war veteran. The girl's father is a murderer who she believes is hiding out in the basement with his family. He tells Walter the secret of his survival - he has been a vampire. The film follows Walter's investigation of the murder of his ex-wife and her unborn child. The movie has a very unique atmosphere that is set to the tune of the old Irish lullaby, "Otternacht", which is sung in this movie. The music has a dark, ethereal feel to it which is enhanced by the dark, haunting lighting in the house. The story is a bit slow going but it is definitely a good, original vampire story. The acting is very good throughout the entire film and it is a shame that there are no other vampires in the movie. There are a few flashbacks throughout the story and it makes it feel as though the story is getting slower and slower. The ending of the film is extremely disturbing and is a true bloodsucking masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ Review by D. S. I thought it was a great movie and I would like it again, especially in the summer when it's hot and people have fun. The film is enjoyable but there were things I would change. I didn't like the way the director let the actors fight each other. It was bad for both actors. Another thing was, at some point in the movie, two of the characters get married. Well, not married to each other and it's for one day only. The second one is also married to someone else. So the two of them are married to some other guy. The third was the woman that went with the guy, and it was so annoying to watch, because she was so ugly that I had a hard time believing the guy was a good guy. I'd probably not go to the movies with this kind of people in my house.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from The greatest summer camp movie EVER! I have to admit that when I first saw this, I had some hesitation because I thought this would be a straight-to-DVD release, but it's really worth watching. I loved every second of it! I hope it's going to be a sequel. That would be the best of all!

I just saw the trailer and was extremely excited to see a movie that could use more of my time. The main characters are pretty believable, and the cast is just a really great one. This movie just works. I am looking forward to the next movie in the series. "I feel the need to be a part of something that's bigger than I am." Director: Peter Weir Cast: Jodie Foster as Holly, Tim Robbins as James, Patrick Stewart as Richard, James McAvoy as George, Katee Sackhoff as Laura, and Willem Dafoe as Walter. I was quite excited to hear that this was a film I would want to see. This is another one of my favorite sci-fi films. The premise sounds like it would be a lot of fun. I'm excited to watch more of this amazing universe, and I want to know what other films Weir and company will be directing in the future.  "When you're not feeling like you belong here you just let go and drift off to sleep. It's easy when it feels like it doesn't mean anything." It's also pretty amazing that I'm not the only one who's noticed this. I had to look it up! Peter Weir is also a fan of the game. In fact, he played the game in the movie! "You have a bad habit of being scared, don't you? Don't you?" It is a good film, it just seems to be very different than what a lot people are used to seeing. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's definitely something that I'll enjoy seeing more of. I can't wait until the next time we get to see this universe.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Giver is about a young woman named Ella (Alicia Vikander) who has been assigned to be the caretaker of an old, abandoned home. Ella has a special gift: she can see into the future. One night, Ella sees something from the past--the death of her father. She finds a diary where her father left a list of what he hopes to achieve over the course of their lifetime, and how he wants to live in the future he hopes for. EllA finds these journals in the house and uses the future she sees in them to help solve the murders in the present. The film is well-acted, but the acting is the least of the problems the film faces. The Giver suffers from a number of problems that are inherent in any narrative based on the idea that people can have supernatural abilities--particularly those who have an unusual, unusual name. The title character is so far outside the bounds of human nature that even the film's narrator, Elly (Academy Award winner, Julianne Moore) has trouble grasping that Ella is not normal. A scene where Ella and a young boy (Ben Mendelsohn) take a walk together reminds you that the film is meant to be taken seriously, but you can't help but feel like it's taking itself way too seriously. It's a big, wide open story that lacks character development, and it's hard not to be disappointed by the way that all the elements are just tossed together.  "I'm Ella Fitzgerald... I sing for a living." "I'm gonna be a star!" The film also suffers from its treatment of the supernatural abilities of those with special gifts. Those with gifted children often are forced to keep them under house arrest. For a little girl who thinks she's getting a special education, that's pretty horrible. The reason is that the house is full of "disparate children." They were born with different abilities and are therefore punished as a result. We're supposed to understand that the family has no choice but to treat them this way, but it does make it harder to connect with Ella, because there's no indication that her family would do anything different to other kids with similar gifts. In fact, EllA's older brother is killed as a child because he was the only one who could see through his brother's lies. As Ella tries to escape from the house, she's shot by one of the family
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this post you'll find two short reviews on movies I saw last month. I haven't seen everything, but I hope these two movies will satisfy your thirst for cinema, and get you started. The movie that I reviewed this month is called The Long Riders, starring Michael Caine and Colin Firth. I did not think this film was that bad. I mean, I really didn't. But I was really shocked when I got home and saw the Rotten Tomatoes score of 79%. Well, I don't know what to say. I really had high hopes for this film, and even though it was not as bad as I thought it was, it's still not a great film. Colin Fenton has a great role in the film, but his performance is not what I expected from him. This film is good in some parts, but not the whole film, which is sad. If I had to rate this film based on one performance, Colin Fentry would have gotten a 5 out of 10. Michael Cane's performance is really one of his best performances to date. Colin played the role to the hilt, and made him a worthy villain. If you know the book and can recognize the voice of Colin Fence, you might get a little chuckle out of the movie. Otherwise, if you have not read it and you are not familiar with the book, don't look forward to it at all. I have had no other experience with this book, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I will have to see it again to see if I like it. I also want to see the sequel, The Long Ride Home. It looks good, and the film has Colin Finton as the villain, which I would like. I hope to see this one soon. I know, I'm not going to get another movie like this in my lifetime, and that is sad for me. I wish I could be able to make movies like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I love this movie. I really like the concept of this movie and its characters. The cast really do a good job of bringing a really good variety of characters to the screen. They are all likable and do not take themselves too seriously, but they do make sure you understand why they are the way they are and their personal issues that they have. It's a great example of how a great story can be done with no gimmicks and no crazy ideas, and just good old fashioned good acting. It may not be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely one of the top ten best movies ever made. It is very interesting, funny, and full of emotion. I highly recommend this to everyone! _________ I enjoyed this movie so much that it may be my most favorite in the top 10. It has a unique and refreshing concept to it, one that I didn't think was possible in a science fiction movie. The characters are all unique, and the story is amazing. It takes it time to catch up to the movie, but once it does, it just keeps going. This movie is one of those where you have to wait to see it because it will surprise you. ____________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I enjoyed the movie and I was really pleased to see the way the producers, writers, and crew approached this film.  This movie is entertaining.   It's easy to see that this is a spoof of the movie of the same name but with a different cast, different story, and different style.  The film has good characters with some humor and great acting.  I enjoyed watching the cast act as the characters they were playing.  Overall the film had great acting and animation and a great story line with a twist.  This was a fun, light, and fun movie.  If you like parodies, and don't mind the subject matter, then give this one a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Did you watch? _________ My rating: ______________________  A must-see for fans of The X-Files!  This film does not disappoint, with superb acting, a fine story, and a truly bizarre story! (My review was written by me)  The X-files is based on the TV series of the same name. The film is about a couple who are on vacation in the country, having just moved from Texas to California. One night in the hotel, a strange person named David Duchovny, played by David Dukovny himself, attacks their hotel room, and they find themselves in the body of a dead woman who turns out to be a demon. Duchonnny becomes possessed and kills his wife, and takes over her body. Dukocny becomes a demon himself, and the couple have to fight against both of them in the form of Mulder and Scully, with Mulder as a FBI agent, and Scully as an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.  Director Guillermo Del Toro shows no hesitations in putting together a fantastic movie. His direction is extremely clear, with excellent use of lighting, camera angles and camera angles. Also, many scenes have long takes and it works well. In the end, it works really well, and it will keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It all works in this movie and there are many mysteries that are left for you to solve.  I think that most people will agree that this is a great movie, especially for fans. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. Del Toro and co. have come up with some amazing ideas for a film, and I think they have created a movie that will keep people coming back to see more. This movie is a must-watch for fans, and if you are a fan of The FBI or The X Files, I am sure that you will find the movie to be enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is so much more than that; it's got great performances, a well paced story, and an even better movie.  That said, the film had the same problems as its big brother, "Sudden Death", and those were not as easily avoided.  If you liked "SQUIRREL", then you'll like this as well.   I'm glad I did.  I love horror, and I love how this film captures the mood and tone of that genre.  It's a little slow at first, but by the end I was grinning like a fool.  Also, there's some great effects here and there, but the focus is really on the acting, which is pretty good, if you can get past the cheesy special effects and the occasionally awkward jokes.  For me, it's a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a small world after all." "A lot of kids died."  These were the comments the fans left on IMDB and at the movies I went to.  I was also called out as a "Nazi" by a young child (who told me he had been bullied by an older boy and said that if I was a "nazi" I should "get the hell out of the way and take that kid down with me").  He even gave me a Nazi salute.  At the movies, the kid and I ran into each other every time.   We often sat on the sides of the screen and laughed at the same jokes.  I would call him "boy."    He would call me "daddy."  I think this made us friends.  Then, when I told him I liked Star Wars, he said he liked "Star Wars."  I liked " Star Wars."  I also liked "Duck Soup."  If we kept at it, we had a lot of great laughs.  My favorite scene is when Luke is trying to save his ship from crashing, and the stormtroopers charge him.  They have him pinned in place and Luke just has to hold on.  His grip is so strong and he doesn't budge an inch.  He doesn't want to let go.  The stormtrooper looks at Luke and he's thinking, "Are you kidding? This guy is just too much for me!   Luke gets some help and they fly off, into the sunset. Then at the end of the film, Vader confronts Luke with a question.  Vader asks if he's learned anything in his years of service.   If the Jedi are dead, then what does that mean for his family?   Did the Jedi learn a lesson?   Vader says he is not surprised that Luke still believes in him.   He tells Luke that "all this time, you were just waiting to be called to the dark side."   That is when the last of the Jedi fall from the sky.  Luke asks "Is there anyone left who has any faith left in me?"  Vader replies, "You've become a better person than any of them.  You're not even tempted to use the dark hand again."   Then Luke asks, "Who am I?  Who do I want to be?  How can I live without the dark
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The movie: It was great to see a movie that not only showed a lot of love to its beloved franchise, but the director's skills as well. It's not just the story that stood out, but also the special effects, the character designs, the writing, and the direction. I have to say that for a live-action franchise, the movie was not the greatest. This is because a lot was taken for granted in the story. The acting was great, but it felt more like an excuse to bring back the franchise. The main plot is that the team at the university were working on a genetic serum that could heal people and give them abilities. Their tests showed that the serum could work on humans if given an opportunity. It is up to them to stop the project before they destroy their home and the world, which is pretty much where the movie ends. It was a lot more enjoyable because the writers were more interested in the world around them, and how it was influenced by them. The characters in this movie were great and interesting, even though some were a little too long and some were way too underdeveloped. Some of them were pretty good and others not so much. The special effects were a bit more on the average side. I wouldn't call it bad or good, but not spectacular either. The film was a perfect blend of the old and the new. You didn't see a lot that was new and you also didn't miss much. It has the trademark of the franchise, and I feel it could have been a good sequel, if only the writing was done better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!The first time I saw this, I thought, "Man, I really like this." But I thought the same when I saw it again the next year. It has a lot to recommend it, but I would recommend it if you're a serious fan of the original, and have a good deal of patience. The original was a cult hit. So many people loved this movie, that it's actually a cult classic. You can watch it today and never think it's been done before. The story is so clever and well-observed. It takes place in the future, but it's just like watching your grandmother tell you stories.The acting is top-notch. Most of the actors really know their characters well, and they play them very well. You'll find some great actors in the cast. You know exactly where the movie will go in any given scene. And even though they are old enough to be your great-grandparents, the acting in this movie is still as fresh as ever. The one criticism I have of this movie (which I've not seen any other reviews mention) is that there are no sequels. The film is set in the distant future, so why not try to make another movie in that future? If that's the one thing that holds you back from seeing this movie...then I don't know what to say.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ The film was well acted with a good script and great cinematography. I think that if they were able to make it shorter it would have worked much better, especially with the special effects. It's not like this is a great film in a million years but it has something to offer to many people who enjoy a good mystery. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Rated 5 out of 5 by gkraus from great film! I just love the story of the film, it's a bit of a love story between a man and a woman who is in a long distance relationship with another man. the relationship is kept secret from the man and his mother for obvious reasons and the woman is also very protective of her. the man is an alcoholic but it's only because of the secret that she is living with another woman. as you will find out the secret does not end in love so happily ever after, it just ends in the middle of the night and they wake up the next morning with no idea what happened. The film is very well acted and it gives a good glimpse into the lives of both the woman and the man who has been living as a secret. the film is about the relationships and the secrets that are kept by family and friends in our society. Satisfying
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ ___________ 1.5 - OUTRIGHT DOUBLE-DECKER ______________________________ This is the kind of movie that you have to wait a long time to get through, but once you do, you just can't stop watching it. I'll always be able to look at this in a nostalgic way because it was such a big milestone in my film-watching life. It's a movie that I had seen and thought it was fantastic but it wasn't until it had aired on cable and my friend had seen it that I realized how bad it actually was. I still love it to this day because I still laugh my ass off, but I'll never look at it the same way. The best thing about this movie is its cast. Everyone that works on this film is absolutely phenomenal. The main leads, Matt Barr and Chris O'Donnell, are the best of the best. They're the types of characters I hope to see more of because they're so relatable and great in every aspect. The supporting actors that were also in the film are just as good. I really like the performance by Tim Matheson who was in the movie before it. He makes his character and the scene so much more than just a generic antagonist. The real thing that I will cherish about this film though is the direction. If you're familiar with director Michael Bay, you'll know that he always seems to love directing action scenes with big explosions, but there's a reason for it: it makes the movie flow. The movie is slow enough that it doesn't feel like a fast paced action flick, it just feels like a slow movie that was made in the '90s and feels very '90ish. This makes it perfect for a long-form movie like this. I've never been one to like action movies, but this is the perfect movie to watch if you want to see something different than the other stuff out there. The acting is fantastic and this movie gives us an incredible glimpse of the future, but it also shows us a world in which we still have some way to go, and the most exciting part about that is that we don't know what the future holds. 1.7 - BLEW IT UP! _____________ I never thought I'd see something like this in theaters again. There's a lot of great sci-fi movies out there but for some reason this seems to be the one that I'm reminded of. The story is

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- The movie starts with an interesting premise, but it fails to develop its premise. It tries to explain the concept of a group of people who have an abnormal ability to see invisible things. We follow a young girl who has a strange ability to get information about people from their faces. The idea behind the movie is intriguing and it is certainly worth seeing if you are at all interested in supernatural or alternative-history stories. However, the movie never really gets going and doesn't really make an impression on you. At times it seems a little too generic, too similar to its contemporaries, and at other times the plot seems to drag a little. It all comes down to the acting. The actors don't stand out much either. Some of the actors are decent enough, but others have trouble breaking into the roles. At some points, they even seem to be acting out a generic 'cool dude' role. The acting of the movie also doesn't seem to carry into the movie's third act, where the movie becomes incredibly dull. --------------- I've heard mixed opinions about this movie. It does a good job of showing a few elements of alternate history. Some elements that are interesting to me are the idea that there were other people before the invention of the telescope. Also, it shows us that even after the invention, the existence of these people was unknown. In some ways, this story does seem a little 'immature' compared to other more recent movies and TV series that try to depict alternate history by depicting it as a 'greater truth'. However, it was a fun movie and I recommend it. Overall Rating: D+

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You've gotta give this one a thumbs up, it's pretty darn great.  This is a fun little tale, with a few twists.  In this version of the story, a group of scientists are experimenting with a device to produce electricity using a giant pendulum.  It goes pretty well, until the pendulum gets out of control and threatens to kill the scientists.   The scientists figure out what's causing the pendulums to swing so far out of whack, they come up with the invention of an energy shield.    This allows the pendula to be pulled back into proper control.    It's a fun, little romp that I think could hold up for a long time.  The music was very good, the narration was well done and the action scenes are pretty awesome.   If you're in the mood for a quick and humorous sci-fi flick, you'll definitely enjoy this one.

I would recommend this film for everyone, and to everyone, I would say this: DON'T SLEEP, DON'TRUST THE DEVIL, BE CAREFUL, AND BE INSPIRED TO LIVE." -Amitabh Bachchan,  "One thing I love about this movie is that it is an adaptation of a novella, and also of a book by Edgar Allen Poe. This movie is a story of a man who meets the devil, who is trying to stop him from creating the world in which he lives. However, the protagonist is an honest man, who fights against his own instincts, and does not let the devil use him. This is a very well made and well executed movie." -Kumar Raghavachari,  'The Devil Rides Out' is a great film by the master of suspense, Steven Spielberg. I have seen this movie more than once in my life, and I can say this that I love it! The story is excellent, the atmosphere is so dark and mysterious, and the performances by the three main leads are fantastic. This will leave you feeling at once frightened and moved. I think that this film has some great scare value, but it also has a lot of heart, and is a must watch for all movie watchers! -Shailendra Dixit,  "...a masterpiece of suspense and beauty.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My friends and I drove to see the first Pirates movie in 1997 when we lived in Virginia Beach. At the time, we'd only been to a few Disney films, and this was the only one we'd seen. Our only other exposure to this franchise was the 1990 TV miniseries, but we had no idea we were about to enter the wildest and most dangerous adventure to date. I'll never forget how a little while into the movie we were stopped by a sign that said "Please Do Not Shoot The Pirate Captain." The only way we knew this was happening was that one of our tour guides shouted, "Shoot the Captain!" At which point the guy behind us yelled, "Don't shoot him!" And the guy who shouted, didn't know what we were talking about and kept shouting, "I don't want to shoot the Captain. I don't have to." The Pirate captain didn't get shot (he's still alive) and we had a great time. But the film was just a teaser, and the first movie didn't really tell us much about what was to come. So when we returned the following year, we knew that the Pirates franchise needed to have a proper start. Sure enough, there was only one new Pirate movie after the first one, and it didn't include the old captain, so that's not a great sign that they were planning to go back to the drawing board. But in 1999, Disney came out with two new Pirates movies, which was great news for fans of the franchise. This time around, they managed to use the same crew and have the same fun-loving, romantic pirate who wanted to be a good person, but the real issue is that this sequel wasn't that great. The story took a while to get going, and there were some confusing and rushed moments. That said, I would have been interested in seeing how this was supposed to be connected to the previous films, especially considering the fact that this film opened up with the old Captain still alive. But what really killed the movie was that it didn,t give us a proper resolution. It made it very clear that the movie just wasn't about any one thing, and I think that's a good thing. I've been trying to find a good time to watch this film for years, and now I finally have it. If you're a fan of the first two movies, you'll probably like this one. I think it'll probably be right up

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way Way Back" is a terrific Western.  It takes you back to the old west, which is what I look for in a good western.  It is a simple story but a gripping one.  The cinematography by Peter Sturges is spectacular and sets up this movie well.   There are a lot of characters but none are unimportant.  They all have a role in making this movie a great western.   The film has a great soundtrack.  With songs from " The Great Train Robbery " and " The Last of the Mohicans," "The Way Back " is a good musical western. "The way way back" is an action movie.    But not an action film without the good characters and the action sequences.  Like I mentioned in the beginning, I look at an action picture for the good story and this movie gives you both.   The story of "The way back " is simple and not complicated.  There are not many things that make the film a failure.   It is still a well acted western with some good action sequences (especially the fight with the Indians) and some decent acting.    I give it four stars.  "The great train robbery" is still one of my favorite westerns.  You get a great movie and you get to experience the old West again.

The characters, though cliché, are all so fun and they all play off each other and the script is so good it's hard not to laugh. The performances were good as well.

The Big Green and Temptation of St. Elmo are both funny movies that aren't bad at all. This movie was on the verge of being good, but it just didn't come together. Temptations was the funniest and least boring of the two. The second part of the film that I watched was The Big. It was just so bad. The characters were so over the top. We all know how it ended, but they had to throw more stuff in that we didn't need. The third part of this movie was a waste of time. It felt like an attempt at a film made for the sake of being a film. It didn't have that good of an ending.  Did you find this review helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year. The animation looks great and the story is intriguing and the characters have some very different motivations. The story is not what it first appears to be. The main character, Johnny, is the only survivor of the attack on the town by the robots. Johnny is one of five children of the town's mayor. One day a man by the name of the Tin Man visits the town, introduces himself to Johnny, and hands him a toy car. However, a robot appears and steals the toy car from Johnny. Now Johnny must learn to protect himself and the other children of town. This film is the most fun I have had with a Pixar movie. The humor is funny and the animation is good. The musical number that ends the film is pretty funny. Overall, this is a good film and I look forward to seeing it again. Recommended for fans of: Pixar, Cars, The Incredibles, Brave.

The first part was very good (I was watching it for the first time) and then it went downhill from there. The second half was bad. I had a hard time watching this movie. It was all about the characters (especially the old man) and that was the main problem. The ending was very predictable. The movie was a bad idea from the start. ***** I highly recommend this movie to no one and anyone who has seen an old episode of the show and thinks it's good. It's not. ****

"It is much harder for a man to become one," is my second opinion. "In fact, most women who do become stars do so not because they're gifted actors or because they are naturally talented actresses, but because their father or a wise and kind mentor has urged them to become so."   So it is with Shannara, a movie from director Fran Walsh, an award-winning director of many successful films, but not much of the "star" kind.   A young girl named Sara (Anya Taylor-Joy) arrives in the small town of Shannar where the last king was killed some time ago, and starts to learn the truth about the magical, hidden world. But as she learns more and more about this world, she discovers her own abilities and the truth behind the magical items that are being hidden by the very people who are supposed to keep them safe from people like her.   The story is told in flashbacks, showing the events that lead up to the present day where we learn the secrets of the people of Shanna, and the mysterious and beautiful world. The actors deliver their respective roles with great sincerity, showing us the struggles the characters face every day, and it also shows us a kind of beauty that they are able to express, through words, through acts and through beauty, and that is something that is so rare in a genre where such an effort is made to be more realistic than anything else.   and also, to be honest, for me, one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in an animated film, and I have seen lots of animated films. And so it is a great relief that the story of this movie is not about a group of people and how they get along in a world that is made of a fairy tale, or a fantasy world, but about someone, a young girl, who is being given the responsibility and the courage to grow up and learn about who she is and what she can become.  …

You're never far from an "A" story.  This is a show that starts off strong in its first episode, then it slowly ramps up in every episode, but still manages to maintain an overall good feeling throughout its entirety.  For the most part, this is a story about drug kingpin Walter White, played by actor Bryan Cranston. He's a family man who doesn't know how to be a man, but that doesn't stop him from trying to become a better man. He does all he can to become as successful and powerful as he can be, even though he's an uneducated meth cook who is basically a scumbag. After working on the side as a hitman, Walter gets a call from his wife Skyler White, his daughter Skylar, and his friend Hank Schrader, who also happens to be an FBI agent.  Walter and his family are going to be leaving their house to go on vacation for the summer, but because they're going to have a new car, he's going to need some extra money. But then, the DEA arrives to arrest them.  So now Walt needs to get his family out of town, and he knows just how to get the DEA to do that. "The Sky-High Wine" is a pretty cool song.  Walt doesn't need a car to travel, he just needs a way to get around, which of course has gotten him into a lot of trouble. However, that's exactly why he's gotten himself into this mess. He decides to hire a Mexican drug lord to bring Walt's drug money to him in Mexico. As the story progresses, we find out that the entire reason the DEA had him on the run all this time was because he's trying to make the Mexican drug lords pay up.  The first half of the series is definitely less interesting than the second half, but the show
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** ******** ******** (7/10) This is a pretty good movie. It's not my favorite, but it's certainly not a bad one. It has a good cast and story, a lot of heart, and some fun action set pieces, and I think that's enough for me to like it, regardless of the plot. The only complaint I have is about the ending. The whole movie is set up with a character saying he's going to come back, and he's in the hospital, but he never returns. Then in the last 20 minutes, he comes back, but this time it's not really him, it's a new character. The first thing he does is make the same joke from the opening credits, and then says it a third time. It doesn't really matter whether or not he's the same character or not, but what bothers me is the ending in general. I didn't think it was that bad. However, if you're into that sort of thing, I can't really recommend this movie because there isn't anything here that I like.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. If it gets great reviews, it's a good one. If you haven't seen this one, don't watch it, you will be bored. I don't care how you watch it. If the best you can say is that it has good characters, a good story, and that it is a fast paced movie, then you've missed it. The good characters and the best story only get you through the first 30 minutes or so.  See the above review for more information. I gave this movie three stars on the strength of its good characters. , written by Michael McElhatton (who did the screenplay for).is about an older woman, who's husband is going insane. They're traveling through the desert, and she can't figure out why. One night, in a bar, her husband is attacked by a snake. The old woman is taken captive, and in the middle of being tortured, she realizes that she is pregnant with his baby. The snake eats a lot of people, so she kills it by throwing it in a fire. The baby is then taken into care and raised by the locals. That's the entire story. In, a different woman, and a woman who looks very much like a witch, are traveling through Africa, where there is a war between rival warlords. The woman is trying to save a man from the warlord, who has killed many villagers. They are joined by a man in the city. In the second half of the movie, we see a bunch of kids who were in a car crash. It turned out that they were in another car, and they all survived, but now they're all grown up and can't remember what happened to them. They take their memories and try to find their way home. The children meet an old man, who helps them remember what really happened, and it's all a mess. In a nutshell, it is about a woman and a child in Africa who get lost in a town, and their journey back home is a total failure. This movie, like a lot these days, is full of violence, but the actual gore is a bit tame. There are a couple of scenes in which a man is killed by a knife, and his head gets cut off, but there is not a whole lot of it. There is very little sexual content in this movie, even though it was supposed to be about women in Africa, and there are some scenes in it where you
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Have you seen: The Secret of Kells (2013) Taken from: A review of the play, by William Shakespeare I was so surprised at how good this film is. I would like to give it an 8/10. If this film was made today it would get an 8.5/10! First the story: After an accident takes the lives of his father and mother, young Joseph is raised by his uncle on the outskirts of the city. He becomes interested in the arts and begins his first play. He soon finds his talents are needed in the city and moves to London to become a playwright. The story itself is a fairly short but is done very well and is told from Joseph's point of view. This movie was made back in 2007 and shows how far we have come in film making. The acting is so wonderful and the script is excellent. The music is beautiful and the production is top notch. The film is not very good at its best but is very good throughout the film. The ending is a little odd but a nice bonus. This film is good fun for the whole family. Posted by C.C. Ladd at 1:50 AM

I love the characters, the costumes, the characters in the costumes and the characters that they make up for the costumes! The plot is just a little funny, but I don't have to laugh too hard, just enough to keep me interested. This film has some very cute and sweet moments!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film has lots of good things: funny, well-acted, with decent visuals. It's a good idea that will likely be forgotten by the end of its three-hour run time. If you watch it and are lucky to have it as a special feature, you'll probably be quite pleased with the film. I'd love to see a new version from another director."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know I've already done that, but it still goes to show, that the first time I saw this film was a really nice surprise. I was really surprised and it just went up from there.  One of the first reviews I remember ever reading was written by George Romero about this film. So he must know what he's talking about. It was a very good movie! A film that showed us how good a film could be if you really made it. The only problem I have with the film, was that the story was kind of weird. A guy was going through a bad break up and was talking to a woman. The whole story was in one shot and I wasn't even able to get a good look at the main character. However, that would all change in the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ So this is an anime with a plot about the hero's family, how they are all evil and there is a family who are good but the son is in love with the sister. I was surprised that it was about a family, they had all that the plot could make you think, and it worked well enough for it to be good. They were evil but it was fun, the action scenes were well done. The character of the son who is in LOVE with the brother. That was an odd concept I had to figure out, it was cool and I loved it. It was funny, I was laughing for the whole show. I also liked the action because the brothers were smart. The best part was that it went through 3 different time periods, but you can't really see it. The anime had many other things that the manga would have but was great. I think that if you don't like action, and you don`t like horror, you might like this. If you like action and horror, this is your anime, no spoilers, but if you like drama, you will like this anime. I gave this a 10.  Helpful and the best part of it is that it makes you think about life and what is good and bad, it gives you the idea that sometimes a good family is just a bad family, and even if you aren't going to be a part of that family, you have to learn to live without it and try to make it so that the family will be better. The brother (I liked him), the son, and everyone in the family has an evil trait that makes them evil, but they can't show it because they are evil, so that makes the family look like it is evil as well. This anime is very funny and has action, so it has that going for it.The action scenes are well done, it doesn't go too far into the horror of the anime, and doesn't have a bad art and animation. The animation wasn't bad, but there are many different things that could be done better, I liked the character designs and how the art used in the show looked, it also looked well animated.The characters were well drawn, they were just funny.The music was good and catchy, it had the feeling that it could be an anime.The story was a fun one that you will love. It is a good anime that will make you laugh, and make you sad, I would

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A small, quirky and moving comedy that is about an unlikely friendship forged in the face of unimaginable tragedy." – John Adams (Movie Marker) The only thing I have to say about this movie is that I'm not too sure if the actual film is a comedy or a drama and I'm unsure if it is one or the other. However, what this movie does right is its comedy, because it uses its characters, the way it uses the format of the short film, in a way that is so hilarious. The short film format is used so well because I think that it was the idea of using a format that was easy for the filmmakers to make and still use it with a sense of humor, and it does that perfectly. There is a sense in this film that it is so dark and it takes place in a small town, where the film plays as a very small little indie movie. However by the end of the film the film becomes more of a psychological thriller. I am not sure if I could call it a story or a comedy but it is an effective thriller. What really drew me to this movie was that I am always looking for small films with a great idea that has a strong sense of plot. For example, it uses a format so that it feels like you are in a movie that is very small, with characters that you want to like and get to know, and yet it manages to have a real sense of drama that is worth the price of admission. I like a lot of short films because they are very quick to get to the point, but I also like a good sense of comedy, and I think it does the former extremely well in this short film. This is a great comedy because it manages a great sense of comedic timing in the small format of a film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My sister and I watched _____________ (a) in the late afternoon, with no sound (the film's not terrible; it just doesn't have much to say and is over in a hurry). I loved this film. There is so much here that's so beautiful, in such an entertaining, lighthearted way, that it is worth a viewing; so I'm pleased that this film has a decent reputation. I'll be honest: it may be hard for me to watch this film again. I felt like I was being told an absurd story to make me feel something, so I felt sorry for the characters who were not able to communicate or do what they wanted in this film, but I also felt the opposite, and I found myself not caring that much about the characters. There are not many good characters in this, and the actors were uninteresting, but they were well-acted, and it is not like this film was poorly written or directed. There's not much of a plot, and you'll probably watch this without too much understanding; however, the story and the acting were more than enough to make up for that, so it's worth a watch if you like this kind of film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The one movie I'm looking forward to this year is Jigsaw," "The only movie I'll be looking forward too is JGMO." "The other one is Jughead." "Jigsaw is my favorite film of 2013 so far." "I'm not going to watch Jigsaw, because it looks awful." "Well the best thing about Jigsaw is that it doesn't look bad."  Well you don't watch it. The bad people are all working for the good guys, but the movie has no story, just a bunch of people working together to get rid of someone. The characters are dull, the action is non-existent and the plot doesn't really hold together. Jigsaw (played by Ethan Hawke) and Dr. Girlfriend (played with a heavy accent by Kristen Stewart) make a terrible team and I've been looking forward nothing else but the next installment in this series.  You're welcome.   Jigsaw was made in 2013 and I'd call it a low budget horror movie.  This is the fourth installment in the franchise, the first one didn't turn out too bad, but this one is just too dark, too intense and I can't find anything to enjoy about it. I mean, the only thing I want to say about this movie is that, if you have no interest in horror, I suggest you stay away from it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ If I'm being honest, this is one of those movies that didn't come out at the perfect time. The film was a commercial failure at the box office, but the box cover has stuck with me for years. It's not a great film, but it's a great movie that shows what the people were really like back then, at least with the general public.  ________________________________________________ What are you waiting for? Get your tickets here. _______________________________________ It's my third time being in this section, and I just had to write this because I have seen these movies so many times. One thing you've got to do when visiting the Golden Gate Park is pick out one of the famous people to photograph. Well, the following people I've picked out for you. Some are easy to recognize, while others are more difficult. The people are listed in the order I saw them on the first day of the park, which was on a Wednesday in March 2005. And as you can see, they were at least a half dozen. The first person I noticed was the very attractive and attractive lady with the long blonde hair. But the next person I saw was...well, you'll see in a minute. The woman is actually at the top of this list, but she's not the one on the right of the image. That would be one of my very favorite women at that time. She was actually the one I was most worried about. I guess I was too nervous to get to the front of the crowd.  It was a sunny day and we were hiking in the hills surrounding the park. The weather at that point had been bad for the past week. I was wearing some of my new park clothes, which consisted of shorts, a vest, and a long sleeved shirt. I really liked the shirt because it was very well made and it had pockets, which is what I liked to do.       The last day I visited the Golden Gates on May 5th, 2005. I arrived at the park and met up with some friends. While we were walking we passed some young people, who seemed to be having a party at one of their tents. I didn't see them there the whole time, but I did catch the other people's attention when they passed by me. I would guess that they were from a similar area as us and that we just happened to be passing by them at that moment. It was hard
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I was really excited when I heard about a movie based on a classic book, and the author had apparently made a great adaptation. There was only one minor problem with this movie, that is I found it to be very boring and one dimensional. The story of the book is told from different perspectives and it was a fun read, but this movie is not going to be like that. The characters are really one dimensional and you really need to pay attention to the way they talk to each other, and they don't really have any character development. They all know what they want to do in the story, and there is not really much depth to the characters. If you want a good read then I suggest you read the book. If not, then you might want to pass on this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The "Wise Old Man" was a very nice film to watch. It was the kind of movie where you do not need to know anything else about it. It has good dialogue, very well acted, and it has the right amount of humor. The special effects, which are pretty bad, were not the major factor in the film, and they could be used for a good science fiction movie. It is very funny and it shows a little bit of character development. It also has a nice ending and it did not feel like a total waste of a film. Overall it is a good film, but not much else. It did not make me want to see the other Star Trek movies. I liked it, but I am not sure that it will be in my regular rotation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Devil's Backbone' is a horror film that not only works as a horror movie, but as a real-life drama.  It's also the best American film ever made about the Vietnam War.  The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (1956), Stanley Kubrick It wasn't too long after the end of the second world war that the idea of a sequel to the horror-romantic-comedy hit 'The Devil Rides Out' came into fruition.  This movie, by director/co-writer Richard Donner, is a classic horror-movie, with a sense of realism that sets it apart from other horror films of the time.  The movie tells the story of a man named Don Cajee (Sydney Pollack), who was involved in a gang-war between his gang and the Cajees' rival gang.  He was then involved in an incident with a young boy named Danny Darmody (Humphrey Bogart) who was killed in an accident that involved a car-crash.  After he witnessed the murder, Don Ciely (Bogart) has had his faith in humanity weakened, and a few years later he and his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) had a child, who they named, after Danny.  However, things don't go quite as planned as Cajewear is murdered by his rival gang the Mazzers, but then it turns out he actually didn't commit the crime as he has been framed for the crime by the Cajaes.  Once the murders are uncovered, it becomes clear that Don Cajaee is being framed for murder, and it's up to the boy Danny Durden (Beverly Hills Cop's Wesley Snipes) to investigate, even though he is completely unaware of the truth of the situation.  With the help of a local handyman, a local boy named Harry (Brent Spiner) and the local girl, Lola (Samantha Morton) the gang set out to prove Don Caciobe's innocence.  It's the kind of mystery movie where the audience can suspend their disbelief and be taken in by the mystery as the plot is unfolding.   The script by Donner is very good, although it suffers from a lot of problems when it comes to the production value.  There is a lot to be said about the way the film is shot, especially with the camera moves and

It's also a great example of the sort of comedy that you'd expect to find in the era of a John Hughes movie, but the modern-day plot twist makes the comedy even more clever and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ ______________ _______________  The film itself is excellent, but the movie doesn't care.  There are a few interesting things about this movie. Firstly, it has one of the best music scores, ever. I just love the music in the film. Secondly, the writing is good, however the movie's story line lacks a lot of emotion. That being said, there's a lot to like about this film.  It has a very fun script and excellent characters. The film follows the story of a group of three kids as they get pulled into a world they don't understand. The story begins in the middle of the movie as we're introduced to the group of kids. These kids are all incredibly smart, and a little bit different. They all have a different idea of what they want out of life. A girl wants to go to space, a boy wants to be a super hero, and the last kid wants to have his dog be named after him. In an early scene, we're first introduced to this third kid who has a dog named after his deceased grandfather. This boy starts to get pulled along the path of this adventure after one of his friends ends up in a terrible situation. The boy and his dog decide to go see the dead grandfather of the second friend, and he agrees to help the boy rescue the other two friends. It starts off very well as these characters all make fun of each other, and everyone gets along. It's as if these characters have known each other for a long time and they are used to each other's personalities.  Unfortunately, the movie soon goes downhill and becomes one long boring scene. These characters don't get to do much. We see our main character (the first kid) try to save his friends from danger, the third kid helps his dog with a small task, and then we never see or hear from our third kid. All the other characters do not matter to the main character because he has no friends to save. We are also introduced to a couple of other characters and the story focuses more on the other four characters than the main characters.    While this is going on, we see a guy walk by. The guy who walked by had nothing important to do, but ended up taking a picture of a dog. After this, the first kid's father, and his wife, visit the dead grandparent's house. They tell the grandparent that the boy,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was great, but not the best. The music was alright, and they didn't really care about the character development. I think that they are going in the wrong direction, to make a movie about a bunch of kids in high school. I don't get why they want to do that, or who they think would like it. The animation was nice, and some of the special effects were good. If they would have stuck with the live action, it would have been much better. The story of the movie was alright. It was fun to see the gang go on an adventure, and I felt they were fun characters. However, there was nothing about it I liked. The ending was stupid, and didn't make much sense. It made me sad to see these kids get wasted.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________   In a movie titled "Fantastic Four", it's a little surprising that it looks so great! In a movie entitled "The Matrix", the special effects look so real that it becomes a bit of a pain. I have no complaint about the special features on either film. "Futurama" is about a futuristic world in which time is measured by a day, a year, and a thousand years (and the fact that there are a million planets, the sun and a wormhole in a star). "The Terminator", on the other hand, is about the future where people are not just immortal, they are a sort of time machine that can travel into any point in the past. The two films are both interesting and I recommend them for different reasons. While the special was interesting, it's not what matters. The "FUTURAMA" special is a good watch with lots of jokes. The special is fun to watch, even with the fact the main character dies. I'm glad that the special wasn't just made to get people to watch the DVD.

It was actually pretty good, but the reason it was a great movie was because it had a great character in the lead. The script was also pretty good; the dialogue was funny and the movie seemed to be filled with so many good ideas it was hard to believe they were the same person who wrote The Departed. It also had a killer soundtrack, and there's a lot of great acting in this. A great movie with great performances, so if you're looking for a good popcorn movie this is probably the one for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ You have not seen THE HANGOVER, so the rating here doesn't really make sense. __________ But if you like ________ and love ___________ then you will love this movie! ________ The story follows two characters who are on a blind date and who go to the theater to see the movie, only to find out it's not a play, but a ________, or possibly ____________. _________________________________________________________  If you like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas, then you are in for a real treat. Director Michael Almereyda, who also wrote THE MASSACRE ON THE MAYOR'S HOUSE (one of my all time favorite movie scores) and co-wrote, produced and starred in, delivers a movie that really does live up to its subtitle. A good deal of the film's tension is derived from the characters who act out the story with a flair of the comic, but this movie has something much darker, a more sinister edge to it. For a time it seemed like the story could be a bit of a let down, but the second act really shines through as we are reminded that there are still good things in the world. I really liked the casting of John Huston and Peter Lorre as the roles of Count Orlok and the Countess, both of whom play by their very nature of the roles. Both of them are not afraid to be a little over the top and both have been successful at bringing a sense of menace to their characters, but without being overdone. As a director, Almereyda's first two films The Man Who Wasn't There and The Red Badge of Courage were both pretty impressive, and I think it was just the combination of great actors, superb directing and a screenplay that added up to this wonderful film.  I have to say that I really enjoyed THE HANDMAID'S BLOOD. The story of the titular handmaids who are trapped in the basement of their master's house is a fairly dark tale, and is a little bit on the grisly side. The execution of the plot and the performances are all on point. The special effects are really good, and the music is wonderful. But the film really shines when the characters are playing at the dinner table, and as the story unfolds it really does seem like we are watching real life as we

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good, enjoyable, fun movie, and the ending was brilliant.  The cast (all good, really) and directing are both top-notch.  What I didn't like:  - The villain (actually a couple of different ones) was really uninteresting, and they weren't all that likable. -  The first half of the movie is set in a school, and I really wanted it to be a thriller.  That's a pretty standard type of movie, but not a great one.   I'm going to recommend this film to anyone that enjoys fun, action-adventure movies.  It's not perfect, but it's not bad, either, and it does a good job at introducing us to the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is one of the most amazing animated movies ever. It is like a combination of the "Apes in the Attic" and "The Flintstones" and is a very fun, well made animated movie, but the problem is that it is just a very mediocre movie, and that is why this is my least favorite animated movie of all time. As I have already said, it is like watching a bunch of kids in a classroom all being very excited for a school play. The movie is well animated, the characters are fun to watch, and the action scenes are well done. But this movie does not have anything special about it. It has an annoying plot, and it is boring. It just lacks anything special to make it worth watching, and I don't see how it is worth watching at all. This movie has one of those plots where you are just sitting there waiting for the plot to move along, which is a little silly because it is only 20 minutes long, but it does it so that the story is pushed into the movie and you cannot even enjoy watching it, except to get a chuckle out of it. The problem with this movie is that the plot is so boring and slow, and you just sit there thinking "what am I watching?" The movie even has this thing where it is supposed to be a comedy, but I just couldn't take the jokes and was bored throughout most of the movie. I know this is supposed as a comedy and the acting is amazing, but if you actually want to enjoy a funny movie, you can just turn the music off, and not pay any attention to it. Also, the movie has a very weird thing with an "anime" style animation, so the movie does look like something from a "animes" movie, which, as I said before, is a bit weird, but at the same time it looks pretty good in my opinion. At the end of the day, it was just a pretty average movie, not great, but just pretty decent and boring, which kind of makes it more like a school movie than an animated movie. This one is worth only 4/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really loved this movie so much that i wanted to watch it all the time. The plot is really stupid but the action was so amazing that i loved every second of it. Its pretty much a classic. The director should get a gold star for his effort. I recommend everyone to see this movie.  It was ok.... not great... It's hard to find anything to criticize in this movie, there was nothing to fault the movie for. The main thing to take away from this movie is that the ending was lame. It felt as if it was all a cheap gag. The story didn't progress at all. The movie would have been better if it ended earlier. The ending was rushed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Maggie's Plan is a beautiful film, I'm sure the director would be proud. As a horror film, it's very suspenseful, you can't take your eyes off the action. The director, Jeremy Gostelow did a great job on this movie, if you have a chance to watch it you should. 4.2 out of 5 What did you like about the movie? It's a beautiful movie with a great twist. The action was awesome. It was well paced and suspenseful. What didn't you like? If I see a lot of movies like this I usually have some problem with them. I've seen some really good ones, but not one of this level. If they could only make one movie like this. It's a good start for a good franchise.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good Movie  by Adam Sandler is a fun movie, very funny, very silly, very entertaining, I have to say this was the best Adam Sander and I ever did on film. There was not a bad line in this movie, I would give it a higher rating, except it was about the time that you can expect a film from Sandler to be a lot funnier. I know this is a very good Sandler movie because I saw it once and I had to buy a DVD so I could watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only movie I watched this week that didn't end up being a complete disaster was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It has to be one of the best movie plots I've ever seen. As I said in my reviews for Taken 2, I thought the main character was a little stereotypical and that the rest of the movie was a bit weak. I had to go back and rewatch Taken 2 just to make sure I had not missed any major plot points that I didn't know about. If you haven't seen it, you should also watch Taken 3 and 4 to see how the whole story unfolds. So if you like the Taken films, you'll probably like this movie too. I'll admit that I did not expect to like the story, but when it comes to this kind of movie, I tend to prefer the action scenes to the slow paced, thoughtful storylines. But that is just me, and I think you'll love the movie, just don't expect to understand it all. Overall it's a great movie that is filled with action and lots of blood, so if you are a fan of the Taken series or the action/thriller movies, I think it will be a solid popcorn movie to watch. If you enjoyed this, please share!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ A young boy named Klay is kidnapped from the street and brought to a house to be raised and trained as a boy soldier. When he is sixteen he has been in the training for a few years and is ready for his mission. Klay's mission is to eliminate the leader of a terrorist group called the A-D. The leader of the terrorist group is his sister, the beautiful and charismatic A-C. The A-S is the main force of the A group, the A of the group, but his sister is not as weak as he thought she was. She is the true leader of A-A. She wants to kill her brother. A-H. A very dangerous woman, A-F, who is also one of the leaders of the resistance, is on a mission to kill Klay because she believes he killed one of her brothers. A woman from A-N, one of Klay and A-L's mothers, is one of A's friends. She has become ill and A believes that Klay has some sort of connection to the illness. A is also on a suicide mission and is on his way to take A-G's life when A is knocked unconscious. Kray does not know who knocked him out, or how he got there. He thinks it may have been A-J, who was with him in the last place they were before the attack, which Kray is convinced A-M was in the room. Krays plans for the mission are to knock out A-R, who will likely have a knife and a suicide vest, and to take out A. The first two are a little difficult and take more time, but Kray succeeds and takes A-E out of the building. A's mother is very upset by this, because A's father never loves her. She and A fight, and A wins. The terrorists are not as strong as they thought and Klay takes out a man. The next terrorist, who Klay doesn't know, is in his truck. Klieg shoots him and the truck explodes. The explosion knocks Kray unconscious and he dies in his bed.  Did you find this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A film about a mother and her child, the girl is born with the same birth defect as her mother and both of them have to live in a house where there is no indoor plumbing and the mother has to bring her child outside to bathe her. One day, they run out of water and there is a flood in the house and their only option to stay dry is to use an old shower head. The child's father was a poor man and he didn't have enough money to replace it. This is one of my all time favorite films.  What I liked: Well, it's a mother's child and her own father doesn't have the money to purchase a new shower head for the child. Well, the film is about the birth defects that the child suffers from. But they use a different form of birth control which prevents the child from going through the procedure of getting the shower head removed. But, the child doesn't want to take the shower heads off and so they have to make a sacrifice. It's a powerful film. It will keep you on your toes at first but then the emotions really start to build. The Good: This film is an excellent film and it's the best film of the year that I think that I will admit to. The story is extremely moving and the ending makes you cry. It doesn't take long for you to fall in love with the film. The film is based on a true story but in a realistic manner. The way the director uses color to make the film seem real, especially the black and white scenes, is wonderful. There is nothing that feels staged or fake. The soundtrack is good but it's not a standout. It is just an excellent piece of filmmaking. There are a couple of characters I liked a lot and a couple I disliked a lot but the overall effect is one that really makes you think. That's what I like about this film. There isn't really anything that stands out that you will dislike. I was in tears during the end credits and it truly does a wonderful job of bringing the emotions to a place where they feel real. You will feel something while watching this and it will be genuine and realistic. I think this is a film that will stay with you long after the film has ended.

It's one of the most wonderful things I've ever seen. It has no plot but it has great characters. I'm going to miss this film. A very short movie, but it will last forever in my heart. —John W.  2017/02/14  Halloween  When I was young, I would see horror movies on Saturday nights when my parents let me stay up late watching them at night. There was something about these movies that made me think I would be able to do something like that if I tried hard enough. However, I wasn't very good at it. But one of those movies I saw was called Halloween. I would sit with my father in the darkened living room of our apartment building and watch it with a bottle of water. After that, I vowed that one day I would do just that. —Eric S. , Los Angeles, CA
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My impression of The Martian was more positive than I expected, given the reviews on this site, but I also realized a few of the mistakes I made while making this review, and I will correct them here. This is a movie I found difficult to watch.  It has an unusual pace that at times becomes tedious (I can only imagine how much time it would take for a person to walk across Mars for a day).  When the action really starts, it's exciting (and I loved the Martian landscape), but it gets really slow toward the end.  "No time to look around," he mumbled in annoyance.  I had to take breaks on several occasions to try and understand the Martian language, and even the main character isn't easy to figure out.  For that matter, it took me several times to figure what the Martian had done to get to Mars in the first place.  So why did I like it?  It's certainly a challenging movie.   But there are lots of fun moments.  If you're up for a good challenge, or you need to pass some time, then check it out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We Are The Best" is a wonderful movie from start to finish. I was hooked from the first scene. The acting is amazing. The music is beautiful and the movie is amazing! The best part of the movie: the ending.   I was very disappointed when the movie stopped with the last scene. After a good story it is a shame to leave with just a cliffhanger ending. But, the ending was good. The ending was like the ending of a movie I had just finished. I don't know why I kept watching it. It was one of those movies that you go to a theater to see. It's very good to finish a movie on time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I thought I would write a review for this, since I saw the movie and liked it. I'll try and be as objective as possible. I have seen the movie before and I'm a fan of the series, so I thought it would be a good idea to see it again and just see how different this version is from the first. I will say that there are quite a few changes in the new movie and while some are minor, there are definitely many more that will be obvious once you've seen it. One big change is that the movie takes place at a school instead of the police station. This was done to give it a more realistic feel, which does add a little to it. The main reason this movie is different is that it's no longer a mystery. This is definitely a big change, and there are a few new characters who are introduced along the way who play key roles in the movie. However, there is a lot of the same as the series. We have all the main characters, and it's really all about how they deal with the problems that they face and how they cope with being in the middle of such a scandal. This, in my opinion, is a much better version of the original than it is the first one. There are some changes that will probably make the new fans more angry, so let's talk about them. Firstly, the sex scenes have been completely removed, and the film is a little shorter. This might sound surprising, but I felt that it added a little more to the film, since the characters were much more aware of what was going on between them. I didn't find the sex in the original scene that memorable, and I didn,t care for the sex scene in the second movie either. Also, the scenes that are left are quite short. There's a lot less going on than the first movie, and these scenes do help to keep the film moving a little faster. Finally, I think that the most important thing is that there's no more action in the film. No one is shooting at anyone, no one is getting hurt, and everything is pretty calm and quiet for most of the movie's run time. As I said before, I found it more realistic in the first two movies. Overall, I thought that this was a good change and I liked the movie a lot more. I think it adds a lot to the series and I would recommend this to fans of the first series. There is
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I'm very glad i gave this a chance because this was actually a lot better than i imagined. It was a lot more interesting than i expected but still very enjoyable. There were some cool sci-fi/military sci-fis with a lot of action and it all tied together nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction movies.   I don't know if this will be able to pull it off as a sequel. They've never had a good one for me. I'd probably get it on Blu-ray if it wasn't a trilogy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ 1/10 ___________________________________ I am not usually a movie person, but I thought this was a pretty great movie. Not one I would go see but would recommend to other people. It was a great story with great acting and good music. The only thing I don't like is the ending. The last 5 minutes were just sad. I'm not one to like happy endings, so I didn't like it, especially the end. It seemed like the story had a real good ending, so that may have been the reason for it, but it was just the wrong ending. That's just my opinion. So many good movies get cut short, so don't get too frustrated if you are expecting to see it in theaters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The movie has very little in common with the storybook version of the story of Cinderella. It's like it was ripped right out of another Disney movie (like Mulan) and used as the basis for a horror film. I found the acting to be pretty terrible but the effects looked pretty good and it was actually pretty interesting to watch. ______________________________________________________________________________ A movie I highly recommend and a solid film overall. There was a very good portion of this movie that was very disturbing and I felt as if I had to sit through it. But, once it started to get to the good stuff, it really started to shine and the ending was a real good finale. The best way I can describe this movie would be like going to a haunted house and seeing if you could stay awake. It didn't make me sick in the slightest, but it did make me a little disturbed and that is definitely a good thing. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. _____________________________ (C) 2001 A24/T2
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A man has a dream, a child is born and he needs to raise the child with love. To be able to do so, he can't leave his home. The child is a genius, he has special abilities, he's only six years old and if the parents can't teach him, they may lose the child. So, the boy wants to come home, he doesn't want to leave his parents and he'll do anything. In this movie I liked the special abilities the boy has, his imagination is amazing, his kindness is amazing. When the boy grows up and wants to take care of his parents, the father is angry and tries to fight him. The boy's father then goes and tells his wife to go to work, so she goes to work. Then the boy goes to see his father, who is angry with his wife. He goes to fight the boy, he wants the child, he even calls his friends, they go to fight this child, but all of a sudden, the child disappears. Then all of the children that go to see their parents get back and are surprised to find the child still gone. Then, all of them come back together and see that all of their parents are still there, all their friends are back too. All of them are sad. In the end, the mother of the son, who had been in love with the boy is crying, but not sad, she is happy because her son has gone away, she doesn't know where he is. Written by Anonymous

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I saw a video on youtube of two girls having a fun time. There is one girl who really enjoys dancing and the other girl is very serious and just wants to have fun. Well the funny thing is that when they dance the dance that they both love is a French braid. The one girl can't do it and has to try again and the girl who has never been able to do it does. The two are having a great time. The next morning when I was brushing my teeth I had just finished my toothpaste when I remembered what I had watched on the video. That video got me to thinking about French Braid and I found myself doing it and doing it for the rest of the day. When I'm done with my video I'm going to write a review of French B.I.D. for YouTube. _______________  My husband and I just celebrated our fourth wedding anniversary! I was in the hospital in the afternoon and then drove home after about an hour and a half. As I was driving up my street I saw a large red pickup truck drive by me. I got in the truck and then turned off into my driveway, parked at the side of my house and started to get out of the truck. The truck had some strange lights flashing from underneath and some other lights flashing around it. When the light turned off I looked behind me and then saw an older couple on their way to my house! The lady was in an old red dress that had a long train and a white lace cap. Her husband was in a tan suit with red gloves and red sneakers. I could tell right away that he was a cop. The couple went over to the driver's side of the red pickup and started talking to my husband and the lady! After the woman finished talking to her husband my husband went over and started asking her questions! I asked him to take off his hat, which he did, and then asked her to take it off as well. My husband then asked me, "How are you doing Mrs. Jackson!" He then looked up and said, "Why don't you take your hat off and sit down over there!" I looked down and saw his badge! I just looked at him in shock as I realized he was not a cop! I then asked him, "Who are you?" He looked at me with a strange look on his face and said he was one of the police!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that there was a lot of love for the movies that came out this year.  It was a really nice year for films. Â It seemed that more and more people were willing to go to theaters for their cinema fix.  I got a chance to go see the movie and it was pretty cool.    The actors were really great and the crew of director Jason Reitman and producers Aaron Sorkin, Michael Mayer, Jon Landau and Marc Platt were all great guys.  I went to the movies a lot this year and I don't think I went for anything more than just checking out a movie.  This was one of those movies that had me coming back again and again.  What was so great about it was that they took a fairly simple concept and did something really special with it.  The whole movie seemed to have this magic to it.   The story is about an elderly woman who decides to take a trip with her old friend, who is still living with her father.  She's going to visit her friend's family in Alaska, and she's going into town for a little bit before she goes, but she is getting her car repossessed.  They end up having to deal with this, and when they take their time getting a hold of the car, their trip is cut short and they are stranded there.   They eventually find an ice fishing shack in the middle of the snow and they decide to try to take in a few minutes of the day.  After that, they decide that the best thing to do is to get home and rest and get things straightened out, and that's where the story begins.  It's a fun story, but it's also an introspective story that gets a lot darker as it goes on.   It's just a really good movie, and I think it's one that you have to see.  Some people have a tendency to think that horror films are dark and gruesome and it's really not the case with this one.  However, it is a very good movie and if you are looking for a good horror flick, I think you'll enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I really enjoyed the movie and it was a very unique story with an entertaining ending. As far as the movie goes, it's a good horror movie that is worth a look. I recommend this movie and anyone who likes this movie to watch it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Shlomiejx from I would watch this movie over and over again! I read the synopsis, saw the movie, and I was excited to see it come out and I went into the theatre. The movie started off with a nice mood and was a pretty easy start. The ending made it that much more interesting. As I watched the movie I thought, "Wow, this is really good!" It was a little difficult at first, but by the end I found it very, very, enjoyable. There was very little gore, but it left a nice feeling inside of my stomach. As you know, it is all about the ending and I found that it was perfect! If you don't like horror movies, then you may find this one to be a little overwhelming, but then it will be over quickly once you start to feel your stomach growling from the anticipation of the ending. I highly recommend this to everyone that likes good horror movies!  Reviewed by Tanya from Washington State USA on 21/09/2015
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I went to see The Last Unicorn on Friday night in New York City. This is a beautiful film. If you haven't seen it, then you have no idea what a magical story it is. There's a young girl who lives in an enchanted forest that she never leaves. This girl is called Merida. Merida's family is being murdered by the Duke of Wellington, King Arthur's nephew, and a couple of knights. Meridiana doesn't speak or communicate. Her father, her Uncle, and her sister Merida are all in a giant bear pit and there's a bunch of other people in the pit as well. And then they all meet the unicorn. Meridian is told, "You are not to speak. If I am a prince, then I am not to know, but if you are a princess, then your kingdom shall know" She is told that if she will be a princess and marry a prince then she will have to stay in the tree. So Merida goes off to the forest with the King. And they get into a fight. She has to be saved by the king. And she has to fight off the giant bear. But then they have this beautiful conversation. And it's great. In the end she's happy and then they get married. So, I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were well written and the story is great. I also like the way they show Merida in the forest in her clothes. They're so pretty! And you know, the movie does have a little bit of romance. You'll get a few glimpses of it throughout the movie. It's not really that big of a deal, though. Overall, The Last unicorn is a great movie. I wouldn't say it's my favorite Disney movie. Maybe The Lion King is my favorite. But I do enjoy The Last Enchanted.

The plot is great, the characters are great, and the dialogue is very funny. "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the next Marvel installment and its great. You can't really ask for anything more than a perfect Marvel movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon as an astronaut on Mars, is one of the most interesting science fiction movies I have ever seen. It is the latest film from the director of Gladiator, a movie that is still one of my favorites, and one that I will definitely be seeing on a future movie night. The Martian is a film that is not afraid to take chances and experiment with its narrative structure. It's a film about a man, in his final days, trying to figure out what's left for him when there are no longer any resources on Mars. After two years of trying, he's finally sent home. It all seems pretty bleak until we see him walk on the surface of the red planet. The movie is not about his final journey to Mars, but his final moments, before being whisked off into the night. He is, in a sense, stranded on Mars for the rest of his life, and he is determined to make sure that the last moments of his time on the planet are his best, by trying to find the resources that can help him survive. In that last moments, he witnesses the death of a crewman and he finds himself wondering if he's ever going to come back home again. I can see a lot of parallels between The Martian and Gladiator. I know that I have watched the earlier film countless times over the years, and I'm sure a lot have as well. I've been a huge fan of this movie since I was a teenager, and it's one of those movies that will never get old. The music is great, and the acting in this film is really amazing. This film is a sci-fi adventure of a man trying to get home. The first person I thought of when I saw The Martian was Matt Damon. I was immediately drawn to the man and his character. He's a man of action and adventure, and a man who is determined and determined to get back on the right track. In this way, he could be a parallel for Matt Damon, who is also someone who is a bit of an action hero, but also someone whose passion is for finding a way to get to Mars and survive. It really does feel like a movie about a guy trying to fix his broken life. I loved seeing how he handles his new situation on the Red Planet, and how he tries to find resources to survive. His relationship with NASA and the astronauts on Mars is something that I've always loved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really really good. I wish the director would direct another movie because the first one was really good but this one's a lot better. I'm not saying it's the best, it's just really good and really great to watch! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful. 1. I like movies but I have to go to work now, so I didn't take time to watch the movie. But, I think it's amazing! It's the movie you would like to watch if you are a fan of good movies, that makes it a good one! You won't find any stupid plot, but you can see how the director knows what he is doing and the way he does it is just incredible! The soundtrack is also good and you can hear the voice of Jodie Foster in it. The scene where the main character has to change in the locker is great. The actors are great too! I'm sure you'll like it! 2. So, I was going to watch it when I got home but it got delayed. Then I finally watched it and I have been very pleased with it. It's a very good movie, with good performances and a good story, with not so many plot. It was good, as I said, it was good! You can't help but love this one! 3.  You have to watch this one after you've seen it, and you have to get the soundtrack. I recommend to watch all 3. There are some nice scenes that have some cool performances. I would recommend this movie to any fan of great movies, with just as good story. The movie doesn't have the most great story but it's still worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The first thing that jumps out at me from the trailer is the sound. This is no cheap synth-heavy movie with some sort of electronic instrument in it (or out of it, actually). It sounds just as you might expect: A bit industrial, a bit gritty. This sort of film works best for me when the soundtrack isn't over-saturated and you get a few more instruments in it. This isn't that, and I guess I like it. I will say this, I'm a big fan of The Wire. I don't think I'm an old-fashioned hipster with the idea that the world would be better if all it's got was synthesizers and heavy drums and electronic music, but I can't really do a lot of research into the way music is made these days. I guess you can find plenty of things online, and if you have any interest, you should definitely do some research into some modern techno and dub techno, but that's about it. The film actually takes place on the streets of New York, and the sound that I like is that of the subway. I'm not a huge fan of the way New York sounds, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it does. I like the trailer a lot. I liked the fact that it is not a sci-fi movie, and that it's not a comedy or action film, but rather a mystery. There's really not that much going on in it that will really grab your attention, but this should be a good mystery. I think that this will be a fun movie to watch, and it is a mystery I'm definitely interested in. ____________________________________________________ So, this is it. It is still a bit early to say too much about this movie, but it does look interesting. I'll let you guys know what I think about it as I watch it, but the plot will be explained as I go through the movie. Until then, happy movie watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's an action film, but it's a good action film. The movie starts off in a scene where some soldiers have to escape from the city, and the guys with guns, or what they have in the army, are being pushed by a police force. One of the cops gets shot and a guy with a rifle fires in his direction and then goes back to firing at the cops. Eventually the other guys with weapons come across one of the police officers and then there's some dialogue that kind of establishes a little bit of tension between these guys. But, then when the action moves back to the civilians in a street, we start to get the sense that something isn't right. We are watching a bunch of people who are being tortured and then we start seeing them killed in gruesome ways. Some are shot in the back or shot through the heart or, in some cases, their brains are cut out. It is pretty gruesome stuff but it gives the movie its emotional impact. At first I was concerned about the movie's graphic nature but after I got past that I really came to like it. Even though it is pretty grim stuff there is a lot of humour and you end up rooting for these guys in their desperate situations. In the end I think the movie achieves its objective in being a movie of its genre but one with a great story. If you want to see something that is both violent and emotional, this movie is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ 'SCHOOL' (1987) A long shot but it's got some very decent music (it's a good film and a lot of fun too). It also features one of the best films of the 80's (that's why it's included in this list). It's based on a book by author and director Jean-Claude Van Damme (yes, he's a real director), so it has a lot more heart and action. The premise is this: a teenage boy (Van Damme) is on a plane (which is actually called 'Ladies' Air, so it's a really weird film) with his girlfriend (Halle Berry) and another guy (Robert Loggia), and it looks as if they're heading to school. But, in fact, they're in the middle of a plot to assassinate the American president, which is happening at the same time at his house (which, coincidentally, is also the presidential mansion). They're on the plane and the plan is to have a car chase with the presidential limo as they make their way towards the school. Then, they have to get through the school in the presidential car to get to the school to shoot the president. Unfortunately, they get caught up in a huge bomb scare, which they manage to survive, but the president has died, leaving the nation in a state of chaos (hence the film's title). They go to the police station and they start questioning the people there, and eventually they're told by an old woman (Pam Grier) that someone has come for them. So, the three of them head to the same hotel room as the old woman's husband (Logan Marshall-Green) and there they find a room full of guns and a secret plan that they have been given, which involves getting them all to the President's house, where they're going to have the President killed and that's it. It's very cool and cool! If you like Van Dammert, I'd recommend checking this one out, especially if you like Halle Berry and Robert Loggias as main characters. Posted by Steve B. at 5:41 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Do you have a favorite movie that you think is really good? Why?  There is a certain joy in watching a movie that is as good as it is. I am not sure I can say a single thing about it that you won't get from other movies, but I do think it is interesting. I have seen many movies that are as good or even better than this one. For example, I saw the first part of this two times and loved it. What a fantastic script by the incomparable David R. Ellis. The picture is beautifully lit and well photographed. This is a great film. There are many other great movies, so I don't have time to mention them. However, the first time I saw this one was on television and it is a marvelous film to show to people who like to watch good movies. - April 8, 2007I saw this film for the first and only time on TV  Reviewer: gale - favorite favorite favorite - February 24, 2007  Subject: It was okay. It was a very good looking movie, but a bit slow. It had some nice special effects, like a flying man that the girls had to bring to him so he could fly to the top of the mountain. As far as the acting went, it was ok, but not great, and they tried too hard to play it like a romantic drama. Some of the girls were good at being silly, but as with most romantic comedies, they are not that funny, in my opinion. I did like a couple of the characters, especially the teacher, and that little boy (who's name was Joe, but you got to hear it anyway). I'm not sure why they kept using the same actor (in the last scene, the girl in the red dress is the girl that the guy was kissing). I think it might be because they already used the same guy a lot and that it just took them longer to use a new guy in the same character. I would have preferred to see them all play more roles. - February 25, 2007It was okay  favorite favorite favorite  It was a good looking film but not so good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you like this movie, then I think you'll really like _________. This movie was fantastic. I really liked it. It's one of those films where you look at the cover and think, "I'm sure that's what this movie is going to be, and then you see the movie and it's like, "Okay, there's some stuff in there that's just a little different." That kind of movie is really what made me want to make a film. When it's done right, when it's really a quality film, you don't really know where it's going to go. It could be really good or it could just be a bit off. I liked it a lot. I think the film was well-crafted.  I like to think of myself as a serious filmmaker and one that's not going to put a lot of things on the screen that you could say were trying to be funny or just for the sake of being funny. I was really interested in how people react to violence. It was interesting to see how the film is made with the audience in mind and not a joke that was intended for us.  and you're just like, that's awful and you should feel bad about it and it turns out you do and you don´t have the right to feel sorry for people you have killed. I mean, if you feel sorry, you should do something about it, I mean. But it's a film that you don�t really have a sense of where it is going because you're trying to understand why this guy is going crazy or how he's going crazy but all you really do is feel sorry because he's dead and that's it. The film didn't feel like a joke to me. And it really didn't have a message that I saw. It didn't really feel like the film I wanted to make. It felt like a film I'd seen a few times. The movie was very well-made and I really enjoyed it. There was nothing that felt gratuitous in it. All of the jokes are well-timed to give you a moment of levity but you're not left with a sense that it's been made to be a gag movie. It just felt like it's trying to tell something about the real world but it can't really go too far into that because the audience will go, "Oh, okay, the guy who's trying really hard to be normal is actually

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a good, but certainly not a great, movie. It's a great script, and that's all that matters, but the acting, the pacing, and the story are not up to par with its own merits. I'm going to get this out of the way right now, "The LastTemptationofChrist" is an R-rated film. It's a hard line to draw, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. For the most part, it's well-written, and it's fun, and I'd recommend it. I was hoping that this was going to be a great story, but it just doesn't live up to what the story needs to be to be "good". The movie begins with a beautiful shot of a beautiful car. We see a man driving it down a dark, winding road. We follow the car as it follows the road and drives through it's obstacles and into a parking lot of a parking garage. He pulls the car out of that parking space and it is then revealed that he is the car's owner. We learn this when we see the car parked by a church, and a woman walks up to the car and says "you are a good man" and we see a smile on the owner's face. We watch this as a man gets into his car and follows her into the church. This is a fairly well-known story, that people know the story of how Jesus ended up in that parking spot, and what happened when he returned. In it, he's asked to leave the parking space, but he takes it because he doesn't want the man to get hurt. He gets in his car, and we follow him as he goes inside the church, where he's introduced to some people, and given some bread. We eventually get into a discussion with the people, in which he is made to come out into the street. This is a long shot, with a person on the ground and Jesus walking away, and they take this shot to make the point that Jesus is not the person who gets in people's way. They continue to show Jesus walking through the streets, and talking with a group of people. Then they show him walking into the city, where we find him at a street festival. The man is there as a guest, while the woman, who is a religious leader, is having a conversation with a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Airbender" is a pretty good movie. I will say that the ending is a bit strange and it does a poor job at integrating its characters. However, it is still a good way to end a movie that had so much potential, and has some fun moments. I can see this movie becoming a cult classic, like all of its siblings.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best way to describe this movie is "A love story made of horror". I can't tell you how many times I've been scared out of my mind by the characters and by the terror that surrounded them. I would watch this movie over and over again if I were in a situation where I had to watch it in a theater. If you think you might be scared out the mind by this, you might want to wait until after you've seen it. The film begins with a young girl named Jessica talking to her older brother in the woods. They meet someone, and a scene takes place in a cave. A man (and it looks like he is a guy) approaches Jessica and they begin a passionate affair. A couple of minutes later a man shows up and tries to take the couple away, but he gets shot and killed. At that point Jessica is in trouble. Her older brother has been killed. She is being pursued by a very powerful and evil man. The rest of the movie follows Jessica as she tries to escape, trying to find a way to kill the man. It is interesting to note that she can never find a weapon that will kill him, even though he is extremely dangerous. It's amazing how well written this film is. Here's a couple of lines that really stuck out to me. "My brother was my first love, but there was another. He's gone, too. He was my only friend." "We've made each other laugh our entire lives, but now I'm afraid we might die together, and that scares me." The man in the cave, the man who shot the other man, and the young girl are all real people that we meet. There is a lot of suspense to this movie, and I love the way that it is so suspenseful. There are a couple scenes that were really eerie. One scene took place in the night and had Jessica and the man looking out the window. The shadows on the window made them seem to become closer, which really scared me. There was a bit of a slow build-up to the suspense that we were in for the most part. The ending was pretty powerful, and made me think about how much I love my family. The only problem that I had with this movie was that it was too long. The pacing was pretty great for the first half of the film, but as the movie progressed it got more and more slow. There were a couple parts in this film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the title says, the film does not focus on the hero and his adventures but on all the other important characters, so there is little to say about the hero. It is very well done and well acted. All the character are very realistic, with not much of a comic relief. I felt that some of the scenes are rather too melodramatic and that there are not enough laughs. This is an interesting film about an ordinary man who wants to become a man. There are many different types of people in the world, and each of them has different dreams and goals, but none of them is quite what he wants. The best scene is where the narrator is giving a lecture about love. All of the different characters are well developed and each one is interesting, so I think that the film is quite long. In fact, the third part of the film was cut down and only the first two parts remain, but that does not detract from the film. There is nothing that could be better than this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast and crew of the movie  . The story itself is pretty well done. It deals with a bunch of aliens who live on a planet that is covered in a large dome of ice. When the aliens come to investigate, they find the ice dome has been completely breached by the sun. It's also found that a strange black substance has been poured into the ice in such a way that it is now crystalline and completely covers the surface of the planet. It also appears that some of the surface ice is being used to create a kind of energy field. As it is discovered that the aliens have discovered that they can use this energy to build buildings and travel around the planet, the tension builds. I found the movie quite interesting, and I'm a sucker for such a story. It doesn't have the "gravity" of Star Wars, and it isn't as well-written as Star Trek; it's a more simple story about what happens when people find themselves at odds with the environment they've found themselves in. A spaceship is seen in the distance. As it happens, it's the same ship that destroyed the one seen in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan.       One problem I had with the movie is that I thought the film was too long. It took me an extra 45 minutes or so to get through the entire thing, and at the beginning I thought it was going to take forever to get to the end. I really wanted to finish this movie as quickly as possible. I know I have a bunch more that I want to see in the Star Wars series, but I'm going to hold off on that until after I finish my own version of this series.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The "T" in "Tropic Thunder" can't stand alone, because it's already in the "T," but if we want to hear it again, the soundtrack makes a much better stand-in. (See the movie description at IMDb.) It's not as catchy as it was on the soundtrack, but it doesn't sound so bad at all. It's much softer and more relaxing. There are also some songs from "Planet of the Apes." (At a time when you'd probably expect something like that from me, but I have the best of intentions.) The voice actors do a fine job, though their voices sound a little monotone compared to the more intense, energetic ones on the original soundtrack. If you think the voice actors are overdoing their "angry" and "disgusting" voices, maybe try the soundtrack instead.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ "The Dark Knight has brought Batman back from the dead." __________________________________________ So I'm going to just say it: this movie's a fucking blast! I'd say that it's probably the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time. Batman is a fun character. He's got his badass, brooding, and all-around-tough-guy-type of humor. But his real strength is his relationships, both with the other characters and with the viewers, and this movie shows a whole lot of this in spades. And the characters were all really well-written. So much of the humor in this movie is based on this idea of what people are like, and how Batman thinks about them. Like when a guy goes to Gotham City and is shocked by how boring it all is. And another character, who's a girl, thinks about what her parents would say if they saw her in such a dark, dark city, and it's just a very funny, and nice, line that makes the movie. And then there's that moment where Bruce starts to have a real hard time about who he's becoming, when he meets some of the other villains. Like how in his head, he's telling himself that he's not a killer, when really it's true. And there's a moment when the Joker tells Batman that he feels Batman has changed. And Batman just goes, "Yeah. I know." And I laughed like an idiot for a good minute. It's so well-executed. It has a lot of great moments that really hit the right notes. The villain Bane is a good villain. And I like that there's more of his dialogue in this one than there was in the last movie. Even though it is a bit longer, it feels like it's much shorter. I think that's a good thing. I'm really enjoying the relationship between Batman and the Joker. I kind of expected to be bored watching it, but I found myself really enjoying it. There's really interesting moments between them. It doesn't seem like they really get along very well, but there's still moments when they get along, and we get to see it through the Joker's eyes. It is really fun to watch him play with Batman, but he's also a great character. In the end, I think this movie ends up being an improvement on the last one. You get to hear Bane's voice a lot more, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a way, The Great Muppet Caper is not so different from The Muppet Christmas Carol. Both are funny, both are funny in a way that feels new, but both share one of the most famous scenes in film history. In the movie, the Muppet characters are trapped in a haunted mansion. A group of friends set out to rescue them. This year, The Muppets are on a holiday themed ride through the streets of New York City. Their journey is interrupted by a drunk driver (a nod to the film) who crashes the ride. The Munchkins are then chased by a gang of men with guns. The film's most memorable line, from Muppet narrator Kermit The Frog, is "There's a muppet in the car!" The Great Muppeteer Caper  is the second Muppette-centric film released in 2013. Originally called The Mumbo Jumbo Adventures, the title was changed in the United States to The Great and Muppet-Carted Adventure. The film is a direct sequel to The Muffin Man. The Mooch is in New York to attend his friend Mumbo's birthday party. His car breaks down. As soon as it is fixed, he takes it to a new address in the city. When he arrives, he meets two boys, Muppet Boy (voiced by Chris Mulkey) and Muppepper (voiceless and with a huge head) in a car. They ask him if he is the Mumbo who helped rescue the Muppety's from the ghost house. After he admits that is his car, the car is stolen. They follow him to a bar. They are then given a new ride and follow him in a convertible. They eventually get a lift from the owner of the bar, who invites them back to his apartment. They go up to his room and see his stuffed animal collection. He then tells them the story of how he saved the Muffins and the Munchkin's from The Wizard. At first, The Wizard is angry with the Moochie's for stealing his car and tells the Mocking Bird to beat up the Moolers. Muppet Girl arrives at the party to protect her friends and the three get into an argument. Moochi, Muppa and Mooppop are then attacked by The Wizard and the Three Ghosts of the Haunted Mansion. The Wizard captures the Mummys and steals the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  "He's only been a cop in this country for a little over two months and he's already got a reputation for being a cold-blooded killer." So, we all know what happened with the movie version of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The original novel by George S. Wier Jr., while being somewhat different than the Hollywood version, still had one of the most iconic scenes. Johnny Ringo is a New Jersey cop, but not just any New Jersey police officer. He is a hard-boiled cop from New Jersey, the state with one of America's harshest drug laws in the nation, a state where police use their own dogs, and where police brutality is common. But it is also a state of New Jersey that is rich in real-life gangsters that make the state, not to mention the entire country, look like a piece of trash. So, Johnny Ringos life is made even harder, but he has a chance for redemption when he finds himself working a major drug bust. After an attempt by Ringo and his partners to arrest a notorious gang leader is foiled by the police and the leader is then released, Ringo must try to get the bad guys off the streets and protect his own family from a dangerous gang war that is raging in the town of Hoboken, New Jersey.  The Good and the Bad I didn't enjoy this movie a bit, and as a result I think it was a flop in both film and book. In the book, Johnny is shown to be the same arrogant and self-centered person that he is in the film. He also has an underdeveloped and unfulfilling relationship with his best friend, Lieutenant Bill "Pop" Thompson. However, I think that the real problem with the book is the lack of characterization. Ringo only has three lines, and is only a minor character in the movie. Ringos wife and fellow cop, Kelly is shown in the book to be a very loving, caring and protective mother figure. Kelly also shows that she is a better detective than Ringo, by taking down one of Ringo's rivals with a series of interrogations, including torture and threatening to kill her husband. In this way, Ringos portrayal in the story mirrors his portrayal in a lot of the gangster movies of the 80's, which didn't do well at the box office, but

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________This movie is really good, it's a real gem, good acting and plot, great characters and great music all with good acting. The best part is all the characters, not just the main character but his whole family, and the other members of his family. This is one of my favorite movies, I've watched it about 5 times. If you like dark humor and love the classics, this is a must watch. I don't think it gets the best reviews for being cheesy, but that's just me, I think the movie works better because the film doesn't care about being cute or funny, it does care about the story and the characters and is a bit disturbing. I really love this movie. - October 16, 2009Mmmmmm!  Reviewer: bb1233 - favorite favorite favorite - March 21, 2008  Subject: I want to like this movie I like it alot! I love how they don't seem to be afraid of the idea of people being killed off. It's not a story about someone trying to find out where they are. It is a story of the person and the story is about them dying. The movie has good humor but it's not what makes this movie good. It makes the movie good and it's an oldie but a goody.  The acting is good! - March 20, 2008I want tolike this movie  Rating: --   I agree with everyone on this site that this is not a film for kids. This should only be viewed by older people and by people who have seen "Shane" (1971).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot. While I think it was a bit of a let down with the first act, it picked up right where it left off, with a new group of recruits that quickly proved to be a team to be reckoned with. One of the main criticisms that I've read about this movie is that it's kind of one dimensional, which is not the case. Most of the characters were well fleshed out and fleshing out each one of them was really rewarding. I particularly enjoyed the new recruits and their interactions with the older members. Even though this film doesn't really have a big plot, there are a lot of different things going on, and I was very invested in trying to find out what was going to happen. Overall, I think this is an awesome action-adventure, and a must-see for any fans of the Ninja Turtles franchise. I will definitely be watching it again.

And the answer is: not enough. I mean, what was I supposed to do? I did all the stuff I thought I was going to do. It was a shame. The film is about a bunch of kids who live in this big, shitty house and have to learn to play a bunch music they don't like and dress up like a bunch people who don't really like music. The only saving grace of this film is the first two songs. But as for what the film really wants to be, it's an homage to '80s musicals. And that's why it's not good.  I didn't like this movie, mostly because it's too similar to other movies I already hate. I can't imagine the writers of this movie were excited to watch the first scene of a new Star Wars movie, because they probably thought it was the "first scene" of a bad movie. It's not really a good thing to compare yourself to Star Wars. This movie tries to be similar to '84's 'Wicked' and '95's 'The Little Mermaid', but in the end I'm just not seeing it.  (3.5/10)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a fun one, well-written, with some great laughs. The way that she gets to use the character of Sam in a way that works for her and makes it her own is pretty unique and cool. The story is told through flashbacks, the story of the characters' lives and the things that happened to them in between then. As a result of the flashbacks, and all of the different people that get to know the characters, the movie doesn't really follow the chronological order in which they were growing up, so there's a bit of back story in it, but it still stays focused. I really liked this one. _________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a HUGE fan of both the old and new Harry Potter movies, so I absolutely adore this new adaptation, as well as both of the Fantastic Beasts movies, but the most amazing thing about this movie was seeing the casting of Dan Fogler as a child Harry Potter. I mean, what more could you ask for? Fantastic Beasts is a great way to get a Harry Potter fan to get their fix, and I can not wait to see the new Fantastic Beasts 2 when it comes out!  I am a Huge fan of all things Harry Potter, so I adore this movie. I know you can't expect anything from a book about a young child, but that is how this story is written, and the Harry Potter world is so rich, that Dan Fogeler should've won an Oscar for his performance. I also really loved the introduction of Newt Scamander and the introduction to the magical world of Diagon Alley. I can't wait for the Fantastic Beast sequel, as it will be so much fun to see what Newt has in store for us. I did also want to talk about a couple of parts of the movie that I found a little disappointing, especially when I didn't expect them. It seemed to me that the magical part of the book was a little too rushed, and some scenes that seemed to have been cut out felt a little forced. But those were minor things. What I did really like were the character relationships and the story of Newt and the Weasleys. They were very well done. The Weasley's are also very believable. I actually like Hermione and Ron a little better than I liked Harry, which is strange for me. Anyway, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is very much worth the price of admission. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves Harry Potter and is looking for a fun and exciting movie. -Sara  Check out these other movies:  Honey, I Blew Up the Kid  Pitch Perfect 2  The Fault in Our Stars  Sisters  Bad Santa 2

It is not really a "adult" movie but it will appeal to those who can appreciate a good mystery. The animation was great. The music was great as well. It was a fun movie and will appeal children.  Report this for removal michaelgv on Oct 2nd, 2013  This movie has a few flaws, but it has some heart and some fun. One of the few stories that has both a romance and a funny plot. The plot is based on the character of Pippa. This is a short movie, which means you only have about 2 hours to spend. The story is very good and it leaves you wanting more. There were two bad things about this movie. First, the music was very weak. It doesn't really add to the story and is a little boring. Second, it was a short and the ending is a joke. In all, this is a great movie. What I liked about this: The story and the characters are great. It's a really good mystery movie. This movie doesn't feel like the other mystery movies that are out there. I didn't like this: The story is too short. The characters aren't developed. There wasn't a big ending. There was no sound. Overall, it's good, but the story should have been longer. The soundtrack could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. I don't know if it is my time of life or not but if I were to make an "advice to teens" it would be to avoid watching it by yourself, especially with an adult (or two) at the end. This is a movie for children and it is for children. It takes itself seriously and tries to be a very adult comedy (which it kind of is). It's probably the kind of movie a kid would watch but it's not for kids. It's not to the level of a "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". I wouldn't recommend this to someone just to laugh with a friend and have some fun. I'd probably get some giggles and maybe some crying along with it but I wouldn;t recommend this movie to anyone. Maybe if you're in a bad mood and you're at a loss for something to do you could watch it with some friends and have a good time. But just don't sit alone at the "adults only" theater for long. If you like it like I did then enjoy it as I did. I do recommend this for people who like adult movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a lot of tension and excitement with the big fight at the end, and we finally got to see what was happening in the background, but I think that the fight scenes were also fairly predictable, and I didn't even feel much excitement until the end when the big reveal was made. The acting was pretty good, but it also feels like they are just taking every possible opportunity to say that their characters were "heroes" or "wonderful", even if they aren't actually. This movie will definitely appeal to some people, but not everyone should expect it to be an entertaining film. One star is reserved for: The only thing that was enjoyable about this movie was the ending (and the fact that I got a nice little epilogue after that), but the rest of the movie sucked, so it's not worth getting or recommending.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I'll start off by saying that I've watched this movie many times and it has always been one of my favourites. It has just a simple plot, a simple and interesting protagonist, a pretty good soundtrack and a great cast of characters, it really is that good. But there is something that I always find strange about the movie. It just seems like a different movie, something that is very different from the standard formula that many others have to offer. The character's don't feel like they are trying to say anything, the plot is very easy to follow and the pace is great. It's just not as dramatic as most of these other movies. The characters are very basic, the relationships are a bit contrived and the drama is kind of lacking. When I look back at this movie in the future and I find myself wanting to see this again, it'll be a strange feeling for me. It certainly is a very good movie but it's just something different. I don't know why, but I think the film has this sense of style and mystery to it that I just don't really get with most of the others. I guess it's because the movie isn't really trying to be anything, it's so simple it doesn't really try to be that good, it just tries to be good and the style doesn't feel out of place in the story. And the ending is... well... there's not much to say about it but I loved the ending and thought it was perfect. So yeah. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   "There's an incredible amount of talent on display here, and it all runs from a surprisingly subtle and grounded story about the dangers of a generation raised to believe the world revolves around them, to a terrific thriller."   I loved The Place Beyond the Pines. Not necessarily in the sense of it being a great film, but more in the way the movie was told. In this case I loved that it didn't make the audience feel as if they were watching a typical "totally unique" movie.   A small group of people have been selected for a remote assignment on an island. They're being given a chance to go beyond what the world sees, but the job requires a bit of a risk. A couple of times a couple of people in a very small boat have ended up in the middle of a raging flood, only to be saved by a mysterious helicopter. The helicopter is operated by a very peculiar man who is the only survivor of his previous mission who now has to come back from the dead. And we know that's not the only group of survivors to end up in this situation.   on the island there are two other groups of people that have also been placed on a remote island. One is a group of scientists that have been tasked to look at some sort of phenomenon on the water. They've gone by the wrong ship and ended up stranded on a small island with no food or supplies, but one of the scientists manages to communicate with the helicopter in order to rescue his friends. But as they land, the helicopter crashes and the scientists end up separated. It's clear that something strange is going on on the small island.   the other group of group members, headed by a man named John Wayne (a wonderful performance by Ben Kingsley) have been told to stay away from the group of scientific researchers, but they still want to investigate the island. So they take a boat to try to make contact, and the helicopter is nowhere to be found. There's a lot of action in this movie, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is, however, a story that focuses on what happens when the group gets to the island, but not before one of them gets bitten by a radioactive snake.   (I know I'm only supposed to call snakes radioactive, but I just felt it should have been stated more explicitly.) After the group makes their way on the rocky shoreline of the island and begins to investigate a crashed ship, a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Do you like this movie? ____________________ Read more on IMDb: _____________________________________________ This is a wonderful, charming and heart-warming family film which you will easily fall in love with. It is a very unique film and you will get the impression that it is a dream come true for the entire family who has just been through a rough time. It takes you on a wonderful journey in the life of a father, his son and the family as a whole. I thought this was a very good film and I am very happy that I bought it for my family. This is the first of the 'Rasputin' films and you would think that it would be nothing but an easy ride for the family. However, as you will see, this family has some issues that need to be overcome. The father needs to go back to work so that his son can attend school. However when he returns, he finds out that the son has become an alcoholic. The son goes to a psychologist who recommends that the father take him into a hotel. The parents decide to go and see the therapist, only to be confronted by the son who is very drunk. The situation turns into a nightmare. The family then starts to think that the therapist is trying to turn the family into alcoholics, and they all begin to fight. The whole family is in turmoil and in need of help. This movie is funny, sweet, nostalgic and uplifting. It will bring back great memories for me and will be very enjoyable for my whole family. ___________________________________ UPDATE - I watched the 'The Rainmaker' as a Christmas present to my mother. This was the best movie I ever saw! It was funny, emotional and very uplifting and it was very nice. I loved it very much and would like to give it to my son also! He will definitely love it!  Rated 5 out of 5 by jenniferp from Excellent movie for adults This is my second time watching 'The Family'. The first time was when I was 14 years old and it made a lasting impression on me and my life. My family and I enjoyed this movie. It was well written, good acting and very funny. You should go out and buy this movie if you haven't already. It would be a wonderful addition to your Christmas movie selection. It has everything you need from great acting to fun scenes to beautiful music. You won't be disappointed with this one.   Reviewed by

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "Hercules" was an interesting film. The story is intriguing and the characters were well-developed. There are a few strange and out-of-place elements, however. The music, especially the music at the end, is very annoying and is extremely out of place for the film. I found it very annoying that the film tries to sell the idea of a good and pure heart by using an orchestral score to bring it to life, but it just sounds like an awful piece of garbage. I also felt that the opening scene at the circus was very awkward and forced, not something the audience should want to see happen in the first scene of the film, especially for this young and impressionable audience. "Hecula" is a decent movie and definitely worth watching, but there were many better choices for this film. My Rating: 7/10

I found it an interesting film and as a "bad" bad movie in my opinion I can't find fault with anything about it. It was not very complex but a good film. " I don't recommend it to you all for no reason. But if you have the money to burn and have some time to kill, you can see this.   Rated 5 out of 5 by JohnP from One of my favorites I just saw this last week at the festival, and I absolutely loved it. I haven't seen it for a while because I was traveling back from the festival with my family. But after I finished the film I felt my pulse quicken. I was in shock. This movie is amazing, it's such a well written character driven film and that is really what makes it great. The story of this movie, which I am not going to mention a lot, is about a boy that loves to watch horror movies. His mom tells him that it's okay to watch these movies, but he should be careful. The boy is so scared that he doesn't want to watch a horror film again. He goes out one night to see a movie at a movie theatre in a small town near him. He sees a movie that seems like it is a horror movie, but that it is really just horror and science fiction. He tells his mom that he can't watch it, but her reply is the most beautiful and heart wrenching one I have ever heard. She tells the boy that he needs to be brave, because the next time that he sees a horror or science fiction movie, he will know it is real and there is not a thing he can do about it, and that the worst thing that can happen is that he will have nightmares and that he might become one of the people that are affected by the movie. It is hard to explain, but it's so powerful. The rest of the story is just a continuation of that one. The movie is really simple and if you know what horror or sci-fi means then you will know the rest of it.  I am surprised by the fact that most people who give this one 2 or 3 stars, have not seen it. When I watch the movie I think it is the best horror movie I've seen since Poltergeist. That was a very good movie. But this is the

This movie takes some of the best moments from classic science fiction and adds to the story by giving it the "gritty realism" of a gangster movie. I really enjoyed the first third of the movie, but then it turned into a much darker, and much more violent, and scary movie. If you love sci-fi, and love a good thriller, then I suggest you watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. _____________. _________________________________________ _______________ I'm looking forward to The Mummy, and will watch it as soon as it's available. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed The Mummies. Not because of the plot, and it certainly isn't the most amazing film, but I love it because it's one of those movies that you're not sure if you can take, and I can, I actually enjoyed the heck out of it. I think it's a great example of how a great director (Cameron) can make great movies that are unique and different from each other, but still have a plot that is simple and straightforward, with an entertaining and entertaining performance by Tom Cruise, and some of the most creative monsters and monsters designs in all of movies. The film is a blend of different genres, but has a great plot and is really a great piece of popcorn entertainment. The Mummu is an awesome monster, as long as you don't mind the fact that his character is kind of a whiny teenager and that he never knows how to be in control of his actions, and that's ok. I'm not trying to take away from that fact, I was really enjoying the movie, the character is a fun and interesting one, the story isn't mind-blowing, but the characters and their actions are. I enjoyed it quite a bit and think it is a solid horror movie, and if it does well at the box office, then I'm sure they can find a franchise and I'll be very interested in seeing what it's like to see the movie with the sequel and its sequel, which is a very good idea. If you like big monster movies, a good story with great character acting, interesting monsters, and action sequences, then go see this, you won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ It's an unusual story about a man who is called to court after he is accused of the murder of a young girl. He is brought in for questioning by the police and he is shown a photograph of the girl he allegedly killed. The police decide that the photo is not his and that the girl is dead. After he is brought before the judge, he confesses and is sentenced to death by a jury. He pleads for leniency because he is very poor and has only a meager life. The judge, who has a poor opinion of the man and has been brought up as a poor man, decides that he is guilty of murder and he decides to sentence the man to death. In this case, the poor judge is quite a good judge as he has a very good eye for what is going on, he can see the truth that has been hidden. He has no prejudices and his moral conscience is clear. The poor judge makes a decision that is very moral. In fact, I can't think of a better film than this one, even if its plot is rather complicated. There is no real romance, no sex, no evil or good. It's just the truth and it's just a good film with a good ending. If you are looking for a good science fiction movie, then you've come to the right place. If your are looking to see what people thought of science fiction movies back in the 1950s and then again in the 1980s then you can look no further. It is a good story about how we need to look at the past and think about what we were doing in the past. This film is good, but I am disappointed that the author of this film (C. J. Cherryh) has not been recognized for this outstanding achievement. This is a must watch for all the science fiction fans. If there is a film that can make you smile, this is it!Read full review

The characters are well defined, with all the right dialogue and attitude. As long as you remember you're watching a movie, it is very well done. The action scenes are well choreographed and you'll be laughing at just how crazy the characters are. I was really pleased with it and enjoyed it thoroughly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Fantastic, but not great" The film stars a young, beautiful, but very shy girl, who lives with her mother and two brothers in an old, very cold house.  It is during the first day of summer holidays that the mother comes to the house, and finds an old box on the floor that has a broken lock on the outside.  Inside the box is the little girl's beloved doll, which she can't bear to part with, so she takes it.  The mother is a very old, old woman, and is very strict about not talking to strangers.  She tells the mother that if her daughter takes her doll then she must pay for it.  So, the mother says, "Well, I'm afraid I don't have the money for that now.  Perhaps you can take it in the spirit of kindness, and let me show it to my daughter."  She takes the doll and puts it on her lap, which makes a very terrible noise.  So, the woman gives her the doll, and leaves.  A short time later the little boy comes home to get some candy from the candy factory and the little doll appears to him in the kitchen.  He takes the child aside, takes the little figure out of his pocket, puts it back in his pocket and puts the child on his back.  When the child comes to he picks the doll up by the ears and puts her in the oven.  Meanwhile, the little woman is trying to reach the mother with the old woman's phone.  This doesn't work.  At this point, the girl starts crying.  Suddenly, the old man comes in, puts the doll on the table and starts to cry.  "What is the matter with you?" he asks.  But the mother doesn't answer.  Instead, she starts to talk to the doll.  Her voice becomes hoarse and she loses her diction, and she begins to cry more, and more, until she stops.  And then she grabs the doll in her arms, and starts crying some more.  As the old women is talking to the little dolls, the doll begins to talk back. "Mamma, I can't do what you want me to do.  I'm not going to take that doll."  The old man takes out a small piece of paper from the paper bag, and hands it to the child.  While she is looking at the paper

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I don't know what it is about movies that makes them so hard to watch, they just seem so boring and it doesn't get any better than this. It's a movie about a man who is sent to prison for the murder of another man, the man was on vacation with his girlfriend in the middle of nowhere. When they went out to enjoy their vacation a bunch of wild animals attacked their boat and killed all the passengers and crew on board. As the man is waiting for the rescue that is never going to come he comes across a small girl that he meets before he gets sent to jail. This movie just goes on and on in its long and boring running time. I know this was a short film that was intended to be a mini short and in the time it takes the girl to get to him he goes through about 10 other girls, which isn't too bad, but he was supposed to be lonely. The thing that kills the movie for me is the fact that the guy just has this sad and broken up look on his face and he doesn't care, he doesn' care that he didn't get to kill anyone or that he has to be in prison. The last 10 minutes was just too much for me, it felt as if it was over way to quickly and not enough thought went into the story, at least give it another try and make it a 4 or 5 minute short, I will most definately watch this one again and see how much more you can get from it. But it's not going to give me any joy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a lot of movies that I have a ton of affection for but I had never seen a movie before this one that felt like something from a different universe than my usual fare. It's a fun movie with some great performances and a plot that I'd never seen explored so completely in a film.  For those who haven't seen it or who just can't get enough of it I highly recommend it.  My rating: 4.3 stars I have had a lot to complain about this film. It was a movie I was looking forward to seeing because it was a reboot of the classic 1980's show. I was a fan of the original and had always wanted to see the new show. My biggest problem is the cast. I understand that it was the 80's and that there was no guarantee of anyone pulling off the roles of the characters we know. That being said, I really wish they had done a better job with the actors and not relied so heavily on the original series actors. It became almost like the film wanted to be a remake but then threw them all aside and made up their own new cast. It also has a lot going on in this film so I won't talk too much about it here except to say it is pretty good.  The thing I hate about this movie is the plot and characters. I just don't get it. This is a movie about a man who has gone back in time and has met his daughter but never told her how he was. He has taken her on a ride to find her mother but also to save the world from some other bad things. The movie is about his daughter trying to figure out who her father is and how he became the person she knows he is. It has great performances. Michael Jai White gives an excellent performance as the father and I just can never get over how perfect he is in his portrayal. I loved his character, I was just never satisfied with his storyline. I don't understand how his daughter was able to see him for all these years and never figure out his real name. It is the same problem with this movie with the story and the actors. There is nothing really good about this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Dahlia is a movie that I will not soon forget.  As the movie starts we find out that it is not really the first time we have had a serial killer who went on killing all the girls he had been in a relationship with.  The film starts off with this killer (as well as the two other killers he was with in the movie) and how he killed the girls.  The two main killers in the film are both of their names come from the infamous Dahlia and her brother (who was also murdered by the killer and is played by a different actor).  The movie also explains the details of the serial killer's crime.  You can also look through a newspaper article in the beginning of the movie and it explains how the girls' bodies were discovered.  They were found in the kitchen and it was obvious that they were sexually assaulted before their deaths.  All these details are also explained to the audience in the interview with the killer.  It is obvious how important the serial killers were in this area of the city.  One of the main characters even has a black and white photo of one of the girls who was murdered.  Also, the killers would hide from police officers in the area and it is even revealed in the end of the film that the killers were a couple.  This movie is a very good time killer movie, it has a lot of twists in the plot and the movie is not afraid to show it.  I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, the story was great and this movie shows how horrible the people in this world could be.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________. I enjoyed this film. I also enjoyed the ending, although there were some moments that did feel a bit too rushed and forced. I did like how the film didn't give you the time to get used to all of the characters before they started to really develop as the movie went on. I had mixed feelings about the ending too, but it didn't really bother me as much as it did some of the other people, so maybe it doesn't matter too much. Overall, I liked the film, but I do think it is worth checking out if you have the time and like a good, old fashioned vampire tale.  Share this review:  Tweet   Email   Like this: Like Loading...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Blackbird' (1963) The Blackbird was the first movie to get me into Hitchcock, and it's a good one. As with many of his films, it's just as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror thriller, and though there's a lot of tension and terror in it, the film really does take its time building its horror and suspense elements to the fore. This is not your average '60s, '70s horror film. There are no jump scares, there are no big, fat monster heads (although a little bit of that is present in the last minute), and there's no gory violence.  Instead, there's lots of tense, psychological dread and a real sense of dread and unease, all played out with a mix of subtle, off-the-cuff dialogue and slow, creepy music that really works.  The story is set in the late 1960s and concerns two FBI agents (Anthony Perkins and Robert Mitchum) who are assigned to a small town in Maine.  One day, the local sheriff (Milton Berle) makes the decision that a series of murders (which take the form of serial killings) are no accident, and that something is very wrong with the town. When the FBI comes to town, Perkins and Mitchum are assigned their task as they try to unravel the mysteries.  The film takes place mostly in the local tavern, a place where the only customers are the people who work in the tavern, and there are several characters that come in and out of the tavern throughout the film.  Perkins and Mitchell appear in a few small roles as well, so it is clear that this was not the two men you would see in any other film, as they both bring a genuine sense of presence and an almost ethereal quality to their roles. Anthony Perkins Robert Mitchum It's a really solid Hitchcock movie. It's got an interesting mystery, an interesting twist and just enough gore to satisfy a slightly older audience.  I've seen a lot in my life, and this movie was something special.   For more information about 'Blackbird',  see my review at  http://filmblog.com/post/134914/ Posted by  Robert Harrison   at 3:37 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly __________________________________________________________ There's a long list of movies that people have been saying are a "good", and some that are "bad". Some are a little over the top with their violence and some are a bit silly and childish. Some have a lot of character development and some don't. Some are dark and dramatic and some aren't. And then there are the "Ugly" movies. Some just aren't good and some would be considered "the ugly". I don't think this is all that important in this list, because we can all agree that the "ugly" movies are bad. But I think this list does have some "good" movies in it. There are a few films that I would consider a classic in the sense that they've never been out of print in any format. In my opinion, they are: - Dirty Harry (1964) - The Apartment (1960) - Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1971) - It Happened One Night (1949) - Chinatown (1974) - Rocky (1976) The "Bad" ones: - Psycho (1960); - The Outlaw Josey Wales (1956); - A Clockwork Orange (1971); - American Gigolo (1970); - Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977); - Carrie (1976); - I Know What You Did Last Summer (1995); - Schindler's List (1993); - Reservoir Dogs (1992) And then some "uglies" in the form of films that are just plain terrible: - The Bad News Bears (1978); - Shaft (1984); - Dead Poets Society (1991); - Little Shop of Horrors (1989); - Teen Wolf (1999) I think all those films would rank on my "uglie" list, and I could probably come up with a list of films below that are considered "bad" or "ugles". What do you guys think?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  -The Devil in the White City is as bad as any movie ever made about the Devil, and there is not a lot in the way of redeeming qualities to be found in it. It is an anti-Christ movie at its very worst, which is quite an accomplishment. I highly recommend it to any person that can see past its superficial and often offensive qualities.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ What to watch: The movie is a remake of a film from 1982 (the same year as The Princess Bride) starring the late, great Robert De Niro. The movie itself is one of those films that is a cross between a comedy, horror, fantasy, and musical. The music is one for the ages, especially for the songs that feature in the movie. I really cannot believe this movie is 25 years old and I've seen it 3 times. The only problem that I had was that at times, the film was too long. Some of the moments are so amazing that you will not be able to bear the amount of running time, I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it for me to watch it. If you love the characters in the film, this will be a fun time for you to watch. If not, then this will just be a very entertaining movie that you just have to put on repeat.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In the end, 'Fury' is a very simple movie about the meaning of life. At times, the message of the film seems obvious (the idea of death and the idea that it is part of life, in fact all life), but the film also presents a very positive message: life is an adventure and can be filled with joy. There's a lot of humor in this movie, but also a very good message that can be found in the story. The cast in 'Furious 7' is pretty good, but not very original or very good. The actors in the movie are mostly there to make the scenes more interesting and to make things funny. It's not that they aren't good in the beginning, but in the end it doesn't mean that they are better than in the first or second film, because they are still very average. The production value of the movie is also good, and the sound is good. Overall, I found the movie 'Funny House' to be a more entertaining movie, and not a bad movie, at least for the first half.

It was the first time I met my future wife. She is one of the nicest, most pleasant, charming people you will ever meet in your life." ~ John Krasinski "The greatest of all films I have ever seen is the work of Stanley Kubrick. It contains not only the greatest number of unforgettable images, but a marvelous and moving story." ~ Edward Dmytryk, The Philadelphia Record "The most wonderful of films ever made." ~ George Cukor "My favorite films are all Stanley Kubrick, but I am especially fond of the work that he has done with Richard Lester in the excellent "Full Metal Jacket" and "Barry Lyndon." His later work with David Lean in the terrific "Full Monty" and with the superbly trained actors in "2001: A Space Odyssey" are equally good and I am sure that the films of that latter period will come to be regarded as among the best of the 20th century." ~ Howard Hawks "The best film ever made - a masterpiece. The sheer power and range of Kubrick's storytelling ability is overwhelming." ~ Christopher Nolan, Director, Inception "A masterpiece, in every sense of the word.

There were 2,500 ships, which were destroyed or damaged in the war, and it was predicted that another 6,500 would be lost. At the end of the war there was only a tiny remnant of the fleet, and all of the survivors were put into suspended animation in cryo chambers to save the lives of the surviving humans. Then in 2225 A.R., some Rebel forces broke out of the cryo-chambers and destroyed an Imperial Star Destroyer. This caused the Galactic Empire to attack the planet, and after some intense
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best comedy of 2017 is definitely The Hitman's Bodyguard  (2017, 20 minutes, PG-13, with an R-rating) It's been almost a decade since the last time a new James Bond movie came out, but the producers seem more determined than ever to keep the series alive. While Skyfall had to deal with the 007's recent death and subsequent succession, Spectre  had to deal not only with a new 007, but also with a rather unfortunate loss: Daniel Craig.  What I like most about Spectre  is how it feels like a new start. It's a very different movie from the previous Bond films, one that feels like it has been ripped from the headlines. There's no longer a love triangle in play, and even though Bond has gone on to have a child with a woman named Madeleine Swann, there's also a new focus on his daughter, who is played by Charlotte Le Bon, who you know from her work on Peaky Blinders. Bond is even more determined to keep this secret than ever before: while on a date with his old flame and Bond's boss, Solitaire (a character played by Léa Seydoux) he meets Solitaire's son, Daniel, who has the power to create time. As in the movies, Bond is forced to find a way to stop Daniel's power from destroying the future, while still maintaining his secret identity. The final moments of the movie have Daniel telling Bond that if he doesn't kill Daniel's mother, Solitaire, he'll be forced to kill Bond himself. The whole thing feels like an homage to the Bond comics, which have been very good at building out the backstories of their characters while also exploring the idea of time travel.   I'm really glad that we're now getting a new Bond movie every year. I'm a huge comic book geek, so it was an exciting surprise when the film rights were acquired by Sony.  Bond movies don't just have to be action-packed and gory; they have to make us want to buy new T-shirts and keep reading the comics as well. Bond doesn't get the credit it deserves, and I think a lot of that is because his recent movies feel like an extended version of what we've seen before. It feels like every Bond movie is the same: 007 gets involved in a crazy situation and then he gets saved by a super secret organization called MI6.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really great movie and it's my favorite of the three so far. My only complaint would be that the third movie is more visually striking (I think), but the first two are a lot more subtle. The story is pretty simple, but it's not overly complicated. The characters aren't particularly interesting. But they're interesting because of the story they're telling, not because of any kind of interesting characteristics. The two women are very well drawn and don't look like generic cartoon characters. Rated 5 out of 5 by Rach from This is an epic! It's funny, scary and dark. It's worth it to see this film. The movie was filmed very well and had a unique soundtrack. The acting was top notch and the film has a very interesting storyline. You get a good feeling for the world as the film progresses and you get a little taste of a future dystopian world, a dystopian future world! It was well made with great special effects, but they are in the middle of the desert and we don't see much of the film. It was like watching a movie that happened in 2040 in the future! Rated 1 out of 3 by jmikeh from Not worth the money. Not worth it. There were so many things wrong with this film, it was not funny. The script was terrible. The only funny thing was in the beginning with the bad guy trying to make a movie with a movie camera. The girl was not very attractive. I felt that it would have been much better without her. The character of the mother and daughter was uninteresting. They were uninteresting, unappealing and very boring. The plot was nonsensical. There was a lot of talking between people and it was very annoying. The whole movie was pointless. The ending just made no sense. I wish I had waited for the DVD to get a copy of it to check the plot out. I don't recommend watching this movie. A few more reviews on the same title: A.D.

And this episode, we go back to the case files in the case file department. We'll dig a little deeper in the details of the murder, and what happened to the man responsible. (Did he commit suicide or what?) And I know that it was the summer, I know how hot it is in New York, I think it was maybe a bit of a heatwave, you know, it was summertime and it was warm enough, it's just...it's not like, "Hey, we can go to the beach!" (Laughter) It's just that day I got here, you guys are getting back to work...but I'm back to, what was it, you were going to do? (Laugh)   So that's what I'm saying, we're gonna dig a bit deeper into the murder and then maybe get some answers.   And how about you, Ryan, what's on your mind?   - Well I think the episode that we just saw was really interesting, I thought it was really good. I think there were things I wasn't able to see in my head that I wish I could have seen. And there's also a good thing that happened, I was really pleased that I was able to watch it, because I actually had not seen it, but I was like, I'm not gonna watch it tonight, I'll just watch it tomorrow morning, or I can watch it the day after. And so I'm really glad that I'm able to share it with you guys, it is really, really good, I have to say.  All this talk of the case and the case...a lot of the times when people watch the show, they're like, how are you gonna get away? And this season, the show... I think when they first came to us and said, "What do we wanna do?," we said, yeah, well I think that we can get away, I mean, the people we really got away with is a lot of us. We got away and we're not necessarily gonna go back and...so, if you guys want to get rid of the people that we got away, we'll help you
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great film with a great ending. The film is about a man (Michael Keaton) who is in love with a young woman (Emma Stone) who was conceived during a rape. The man is an alcoholic with a high libido and who is obsessed with sex. He has been seeing the same woman for a long time and has also slept with other women. She is beautiful and the man is in a desperate state. After a few weeks of this, the man meets the woman's mother (Meryl Streep), who is one of the only people who will help the man with the relationship. I think there is a lot of potential for this film. In the beginning the film really wants to be a classic story about a love triangle, but it is not. If you read the book it does not have that many of the characteristics of a typical love triangle. The story is a bit dry and it lacks a sense of comedy. It could have been a great film but the ending of the film took me out of the movie. I think the film would be great to watch when you have time and want to learn more about an interesting subject.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  "The Shining" is one of the best horror movies of all times. It is such a classic that there are people who have been making copies for years, all in the attempt to keep it away from you. The story is so amazing and well written that it will haunt you for many years to come. The acting is the best I have ever seen in a horror movie. It's amazing to see how well played the actors were at their jobs, and how real the feelings that these actors were portraying. The film is a psychological horror that was made in the 80's, but the emotions that these characters experience are timeless. A perfect blend of horror and horror with a touch of love and romance to it. This film is perfect. One of the very few great films that are still going strong, and should be watched by everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What's it about?: __________ A few years ago, a young journalist named Adam West (played by George Peppard) has a stroke in the middle of his reporting. The paper he works for doesn't report on it until days later, and then only in an extremely obtuse way. The journalist and his family are soon homeless, and the only thing they can't get is the paper that's been reporting on them. What's this movie about?:   It's about a bunch of people who work together as journalists. The film is loosely based on the real-life West, who is still alive and has recently been in a wheelchair for the past decade. I can't say too much more about it because it's not even in theatres yet, but it's got George Peppell playing Adam West, and George Peppe and George Poulter (who played the late Bill Bixby on the first two Peanuts specials) are in it too. Adam West is very much the patriarch of this family, and they all work together, and when they do, they work really hard. It's very sad to see this guy go, but there's something about the way he walks and his voice that just makes me think "wow, he could still be good at this." The plot is pretty weak and the ending is a bit of a letdown, but that's hardly enough to detract from an otherwise great film. The cast is pretty great, though. In terms of the comedy, Adam West was the funniest of the bunch. George Pepper was, by far, the best character. It wasn't really his voice I wanted to hear, but his voice is very funny. Peppe is the one who plays the journalist, and I think you could really tell they didn't want him to go. He's just such a real guy. You couldn't help but cheer for him. This was the second Peanuts TV series, and it was also directed by a guy named Hal Roach. He also directed the first Peanuts film, but with the voice of Steve Martin, so it's probably not the best comparison. I really like this movie, though, and there's not too much of a chance you'll be disappointed.  Watch it on YouTube Watch it on Blu-ray

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is very entertaining in the beginning as a normal love story and then all the sudden becomes very dark and disturbing. The plot is really disturbing as it shows a girl who loves a young boy and the boy does not reciprocate and this causes an incestual relationship between them and the film does not make it a positive as the whole film shows a disturbing scene. Also it is quite difficult to watch this film as there are some strange scenes. All in all a film that deserves to be watched by all people interested in such horror as it is a thriller and some scenes and the ending are very disturbing.

It's so good to see someone new doing this genre. The movies they make are so good and the quality is awesome. You'll enjoy this one, I'm sure.  Oh yeah, don't you think it's kind of weird that they had to bring in so many extras to say goodbye to Mr. Anderson. And, of course, there is this amazing cameo from a little known singer called Miley Cyrus, singing the song "Grown Ups" with some other people.     The trailer for this movie is on Youtube and here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GwJ8aOiW8 I can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD and Blu Ray.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape is an American comedy-drama that tells the story of a young woman named Annabel Lee (Jennifer Lawrence) who is recruited by the U.S. Government to join their secret military team which is sent to infiltrate Nazi Germany. At the start of the movie, Annabel has been taken in by a group of people called "The Wobblies", who are based out of a church in Indiana and are led by Reverend Bill. As the movie goes on, it becomes more apparent that Reverend Bill has turned Annabel into his personal slave and is manipulating her every move. Rating: 4/5. I enjoyed this movie very much. Review:  I think that I've seen every James Bond movie made up to now. I've read every Bond novel. I even have the James Bond: The Complete History Book (which is the best James Bond book ever!). But I had never seen any of the films starring Pierce Brosnan, Michael Caine and Roger Moore until I watched Skyfall (2009). I watched the film when I was in a bad mood and my girlfriend had decided she needed to watch it with me (and, of course, she ended up watching it with us!) The first thing that I thought when I saw the film was "what happened to the good times?" Yes, I've watched a lot of Bond movies since I got into the franchise, but I haven't enjoyed them as much as I used to. There was something about it all that reminded me of when I first started watching the series and how I enjoyed the films because I had a feeling of anticipation and love. I think the franchise has had quite a long period of time since the original movies were made so it would make sense that it is all going downhill now. But that doesn't mean that I am going to stop loving the James Bonds. I have seen Spectre (2015) (which had just come out the same year as the movie I had just seen) and I found the film more enjoyable than Skyfall was. I don't know why but after watching Skyfall, it felt like I needed another Bond movie and I was excited to get another one (and there is going to be a fourth Bond film coming in 2018). Rating 3/5 for Bond movies: The movie had some great action sequences and the script was enjoyable. What I liked:    The action sequences were very well done. The special effects were beautiful. The music

And then the ending changed my mind completely, I realized that it had to be made here. It took me a few days to get used to the film's pacing, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. If there's any sequel that I'd want to see, it'd be the second one! It was also one of the first films I ever had an extended conversation with someone about, after the fact.

It will satisfy a lot of people, especially those that enjoy movies with a good plot, interesting characters and a good story. It's got some good action and there's not too much stupid stuff like the recent "Saving Private Ryan" but that doesn't matter to me. I loved the ending. It was perfect.  I have seen the movie so I'm not going to say anything specific about it. It does take place during WWII but the characters and setting are different enough that you could easily pick up the story right away and not feel like you are getting a complete history lesson. There are a lot more twists and turns than I would have expected but I didn't mind them and the ending left me feeling satisfied with it and I'm glad that I didn's get it. Overall a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hush  is a great movie.  The story is great.    It shows the dangers that can be experienced when dealing with young children.  I have a feeling that the producers of this movie were afraid of how parents would react to the movie.   The film is also about two brothers who are going to a party at a nearby golf course.  The kids are going into the house unannounced and a boy named Kyle (who is a bully) comes into the room.  Kyle is the kind of boy that will say what he needs to say to get a reaction.  When Kyle leaves he yells, "Hush".  The girl in the house yells back.   She is called Jessica and she has a big brother named Chris (also a bully).  Jessica gets scared and takes a nap.  She wakes up when Kyle comes in and Kyle tells her what has happened.  Chris is angry and tells Jessica to get back into bed.  He tells her that she doesn't know him, she is just a stranger.   Jessica, however, doesn't care that Chris is just going to bully her any more, so she gets out of bed and goes into her room.   Chris tells Kyle to stay out of her room and Kyle does.  So Jessica does her homework and gets in bed and does not hear Kyle's voice in the next room.  Kyle comes back and tells her to turn on the light and when she does the guy comes in. Kyle does not know him but knows that Chris has a gun and he is going to shoot Jessica.  Jessica does not believe that the guy would go to that much trouble to kill her brother, so he starts to threaten her.  But just then the sound of a shotgun is heard and the guy runs away. Jessica is in a panic, and gets the gun from the nightstand and shoots Kyle. Chris yells at her to run away.  Eventually Jessica is taken to the hospital and Chris is arrested.  After this it is revealed that Jessica's dad had shot her for playing "with" Chris.  Plot summary:   Jessica's father is a cop and they are having problems with his ex girlfriend's son Chris (she had a restraining order against him), so he decides to kill Chris.   Kyle, the bully brother of Jessica and Chris, was scared and came over to her house and played with Jessica to make her scared.  And then Kyle, who is a

It has a nice story to it and is pretty entertaining. The music is great. The cast of actors are fun, and I especially enjoyed this film with my grandson.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I can't believe how beautiful this movie is. I have always loved the music and have always wanted to do a soundtrack for a film, so when it came to this I was thrilled. This is the best soundtrack I've heard since "Kung Fu Panda 2" and I'm loving it!" -Rene Cervantes I really wanted this to be good...I can barely believe how good it is!   "Halo"   I have been an avid fan of Bungie Games since the release of Halo: Combat Evolved in 2001, but I had never been able to watch the TV series.  This was the first time I had seen the entire series in its entirety, and I was in heaven!  It was a journey.   The main character of the series is a woman who is a Spartan IV (Combat Evolved's equivalent of a Marine), and she is tasked with the task of saving humanity from the invading alien race known as the Covenant.   This is what I like about Halo:   it is easy to follow because the series focuses primarily on the Spartan IV's, and while I can't think of a single time where a character doesn't get the job done, it is not an easy watch at times.  She is also tasked with trying to stop a seemingly invincible alien race called the Flood, and it was the best thing that had ever happened to me.  It is a story about a group of people who, despite their skills, are constantly put in danger by enemies, but their teamwork is what keeps them alive.  This series is an extremely intelligent piece of entertainment that will definitely stay with me forever.    "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" I was very fortunate to see "Dawn" on the big screen at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.    It tells the story of the last days of a monkey's family.  For those of you who don't know, the monkeys' story is a metaphor for the human experience.  The first part of the story is of the monkey family, who must survive until the day that they are adopted by a new family.   We then get a short story about the apes, who become humans for the first part, then become the new family in the second part.   It is beautiful.  I saw it on the screen and felt like I was standing in their world for a minute.  "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Titanic" is one of the few great movies of this year's Oscars, but it won't be remembered as such until the final day, when the world's worst and best reviews will be written on the internet and the "R" rating will be a bit more accurate. A movie that deserves to be seen, not watched, or at the very least, rewatched. I think it has the right to be remembered for its stunning cinematography, cinematography that will be the most beautiful and mesmerizing in the history of cinema, the most innovative soundtracks, the film's acting, its score (and then, its soundtrack that should be compared to the Beatles and Elton John's), its plot, its drama and its heart. It was one of those movies that is both great and really really bad and you cannot really find an enjoyable way to say if it is good or bad. The problem with Titanic is that the characters have been reduced to caricatures, and the plot is so nonsensical that it makes you wonder what is going to happen next. And the most annoying part is that it is in black and white, so if you don't have the patience to sit through the entire movie, just keep a record of the plot. What you might get is a movie that is trying too hard to be "true", that the actors are not capable of portraying, that the music is not catchy and you have no reason to watch. This might be one of cinema's biggest failures and I am sure that I will be accused of being an apologist, and I'll admit that I do love this movie and I would do the same thing if I saw it today. I've always said that the best "Titanics" are the ones that make you look back at your favorite movies and wonder why they have been forgotten. "Titans" is exactly that. Titanic is a piece of cinema that I've seen many times and if I ever made another film, I would want to do something with it because it is a really great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie had some good scenes, but didn't really feel like a proper film.   But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The movie is more of a sci-fi adventure.  And yes, the story itself is a little odd.  But, as a sci -fi adventure, it's not bad.  I enjoyed the first half, but the second half did not appeal to me.  It felt too sci - fiy and I didn't enjoy it.  But, even if the movie's storyline is somewhat strange and there's a ton of unnecessary characters in the movie, it does at least get interesting at times.  At times it does seem like the movie is trying to pull a Blade Runner and Alien style.  Even though, it ends up not doing it as well as the other two movies in the same series.  So, if you were a fan of these other movies, then by all means, you'll enjoy this movie as well.  If you're not a fan, then you may want to pass.  Grade: A As a sci fi adventure,  Starship Troopers  is more interesting than a lot of other sci -Fi adventure movies.  A great time was had by all in the theater.  You can see the reviews by clicking the links. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Does anything here have to do with a plot? Of course not, but it does have a good cast. The main character, Alyssa (Karen Gillan), is very funny and interesting. The film is also a great reminder that not all humans are bad and, despite the horrible ending, some good things can come out of all this. This film is funny and heartwarming but it is not really a horror movie and should only be viewed as a story. In the end, I didn't even feel scared for a moment and the ending leaves me cold, but for now, it is a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is really nothing more to say about this film. There is an old saying that I would love to use but can never come up with anything that is truly accurate.  However, the following quote sums it up perfectly. "No man ever succeeded in his life until he achieved one simple thing. The success of nothing was not, to him, sufficient" I love everything about this movie. The acting is the highlight of the film, it takes its time to get to the point and it never lets up on the emotional beats that have been set up throughout the film.  We get to see all of the characters that have gathered around the tree for the festival, it gives the movie a real sense of immersion that has been lacking in the recent remakes.   The musical score by the legendary Glenn Slater was also one of the best ever to grace the screen.   The special effects are excellent, and we get to witness the old world that the kids are trying to enter.   While the film does end up being a bit too long, it ends up being something that we can truly relate to.    This film is an absolute must watch and is truly worthy of being in our movie library.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight Rises is the latest addition to a stellar collection of superhero films.  I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  The visual effects are spectacular, the story is clever and the acting is top notch.  However, I was a little disappointed with the ending.  In my mind, Batman and Bane have to fight for the fate of the world.  There are two possible scenarios.  Either Bane or Batman kills the Joker.  Bane then becomes the new Batman and Batman is forced to kill him and become the new Dark Knight.  Unfortunately, this doesn't add up.  Batman and Joker aren't the most interesting villains in Batman history, but I can't help but wonder if this is what the Joker meant when he threatened to destroy the world if he couldn't control it himself.  Then again, maybe it is.  I have to say I have had more fun with Superman Returns, Batman & Robin, Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Batman Returns, Superman Returns 2, Batman Forever, Batman Begins, Batman Vs Superman, Man of Steel, and Batman V Superman than I have with this latest Batman entry.  Honestly, I am surprised it took me so long to start a comic book collection.  What's that, you're wondering?  I have been reading comics for as long as I can remember.  This isn't even my second favorite comic book.  That would be Wonder Woman.  Don't get me wrong.  While it is the most successful, it also is my least favorite.  For the most part, it is still pretty good.  It's just not good enough.  And for the most portion of the movie, I honestly didn't mind.  If you don't want to know why, then you don´t have to read this blog entry. In summary, this is an incredible movie.  But it is not the best Batman movie.  I guess that's for the fans to decide.  Personally, I love this movie so much.  Maybe it's the fact that I am a huge Batman fan.  Of course, the other people who like this movie are probably the same.  So that´s why I like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The only real flaws I had were that the script was a little corny, the first part where the girl gets dumped by the older guy wasn't very exciting, and when she was being kidnapped by the kidnappers, they weren't that good. There is a lot of sex and it was nice. The music was also nice. I did like the ending. There was some good and bad scenes in this movie, but it's the best romantic movie I've seen recently.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Cargo' is a really solid action movie. It has a great cast, the story is entertaining, the action is intense, and there is some great visuals. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes great action movies and is looking for an easy watch.  I also recommend it to anyone interested in a movie about people who are caught up in the political struggles of their day-to-day lives.  'The Last Jedi': The Last Jedi is another great installment in the Star Wars franchise.  It is filled with a great number of exciting action scenes, and the new characters seem to be well developed.  The story is interesting and well paced, and I can't wait to see more of Rey, Finn, Poe, and others in the upcoming movies.  This is a must watch. I would definitely recommend this book for fans of fantasy and sci-fi thrillers.  A good read, with lots of action and action sequences.  If you like to read about heroes going to war against a greater evil, you will love this book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! This is my first time watching this type of movie, and I am so surprised that it is so great. I thought the story was not great, it had so many good parts in it, but still it was a boring and simple story. It's kind of hard to be too harsh because I like the story, it was kind of a good story, but it didn't really made me think more or be interested in it. I'm not sure what the story is about, but what I'm sure about is that you get to see a lot of fun action scenes. I know there's a lot to like about this movie. The story was good, but the fact that they didn't follow the main character through his story is so confusing, but that's the point of the movie. It has a great action scene, you know how they have? That's what I liked about it. It had so much action, even if it's a short movie, it didn\'t really take much time. I really enjoyed it. The movie is funny too! I love watching action movies, it's so entertaining!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ - The story is not interesting, but the acting is very good.- The main character is so well developed, that he could easily be a supporting character, but he is still a real person, with his own thoughts and feelings. And we love the guy!- The director is very funny, he makes the movie funny.- The cinematography is amazing!- And we can see the whole picture, because the movie is so short!- You can see all the mistakes made by the studio. It's the only movie in which they are really embarrassed about their mistakes and mistakes in the marketing, that they made!(4) - Good. - But not for the budget!- There are so many mistakes in this movie. - The way the characters talk to each other is very unnatural, it's like they are speaking in the third person. It was never done before. - All the people are so stupid and stupid! - There are a lot of stupid things in this film, like when they all try to talk about the same subject, but in different ways, like the character who goes to see the doctor, the doctor he sees, and the girl who is in love with the girl he saw at the doctor. - There is so much dialogue that the scenes are unbalanced and the characters never change, like in the other three movies. - When the movie was being shot, they wanted to show how the whole "Halloween party" was going to be, so they threw together all these people from all these different backgrounds, and they were all trying to be funny and witty, but they are not, and this is a real problem in many "funny" films. - No actors are good in this, so all the jokes that are made in this must have been made by a group of interns. It is really sad to see all these talented people working so hard on a stupid movie. I can't recommend this movie.- The first 2 hours are very boring, but you can see a great scene towards the end of the movie that gives the movie a nice finish. But you have to understand that it's only a teaser and a teaser, and you can never get a real movie out of it. - They took a lot from the previous two movies, but what is there isn't the same as in the last movie, and in fact it is quite bad. - I think this is the worst of all the Halloween movies.- It is the most retarded
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ Why this is #1: The "Hulk is in the basement of a house!" montage sequence was definitely one of the best bits of the film. It was very reminiscent of the "Planet Hulk" montage in the recent Captain America movie. And it was awesome, so well done. The Hulk, while still a great character, isn't really at his peak of strength in this movie. Hulk doesn't fight any bad guys (though a few did drop by to drop the "f" bomb) in the movie. He just hangs out in his house, drinks a beer, reads, and reads some more, watching TV, etc. It made the movie feel like an average family movie in the '70s or '80s. In the Hulk movie, Hulk is just a guy who does a lot of dumb things when he's not fighting the Avengers. ___________________________________ Why this isn't #1...: It's not perfect. Hulk was never really shown doing any heroic things in this one. He does drop in on an old guy in a wheelchair and they talk for a bit. He drops in on Hulk's little brother and they banter. But it's all very one-note. In some ways, this movie actually made Hulk look like a more "human" character. He still has the same silly little personality, but it's not like it was always so one-dimensional. _______________________________ RATINGS (out of 10) ---------------------------------------------- Overall:  8/10 - Great movie. Great montage. I loved this movie a lot. I don't care how you want to describe this movie, it really is a lot to take in. ___________ Special Effects: Â 10/10 __________ Sound: __________________________ ______________________________ Overall: 10/5 ____________________________ - Recommend if you're a big fan of the Hulk, particularly if you liked Planet Hulk. - Don't expect Hulk to fight very many super villains, since his biggest challenge is just hanging out with friends in a house. - I don,t think this movie got the credit it deserved, since it isn't the best Hulk film, but its really enjoyable. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My favorite movie of the summer is the last installment of "Dirty Dancing." I was a fan of the original with Mandy Patinkin and it's great to see Patinkins return as Dancer. She's a fun, flirty and hot character and a great addition to the "Dancing" franchise. There are some terrific dancing scenes between Patinkina and James Caan.  The movie is an absolute blast to watch, and a really good time is had by all." -David Z Check out this review of the film:  http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5... c_p?id=18398645 There's a lot more good stuff on this film at Goodreads: A review from the AFI's "AFI 100" program. This is the only movie from this list that I know of that was actually released on DVD. It was originally released by Paramount Pictures in 1997. Some other great reviews from the New York Post:  "Dancing With The Stars is a triumph of big-city excess: an extravagant, overstuffed celebration of the modern dance form that, like the 'Fiesta del Norte' celebration it celebrates, is both ridiculously expensive (a reported $10 million) and hilariously vulgar (the movie has several explicit sex scenes and one in which a woman is whipped by two men)."  -Roger Friedman "This is a comedy-drama of extremes, full of sexual and drug-fueled excess, and it is not a very good comedy."  -Michael Gascón "It's like watching Michael Jackson perform on acid. It is like watching the Beatles perform on speed. It's like seeing Frank Zappa perform on a gurney. It also includes a couple of songs that, on first hearing, sound like they were written for this movie."  –Richard Roeper "That's the only way to describe this movie, a kind of psychedelic nightmare: an epic drug party with no regard for public decency or the rights of others, an inane, ridiculous movie that's a blast from the past. It would be fun to see as a drug dealer's fantasy come to life. As an entertaining, outrageous comedy." -Stephen Holden, New York Times Some highlights:   - James Caanon and the gang don't even look like themselves - James' character looks like he

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ __________ ____________ ___________ _____________/ The Story of Our War on Terror The first half of the movie does not seem to be too strong. It's a war movie with strong characters and a great cast. The second half, however, goes into overdrive and makes the story a very good one. You can see the world through the eyes of the main characters and you can see their emotions. The film's story is good and you get to see a different world and you begin to understand what happened and why it happened. The ending is just so good. The plot isn't very developed and there are some things that are a little confusing. I think the film's biggest flaw is how predictable everything seems to be. The main characters all make the same mistakes over and over again, so they all think the same things and their thoughts all make sense. It seems that the film is saying that if you're not fighting in a war, you are just as stupid as the enemies. There are so many things that don't make sense, but they seem to fit because they are all things you hear from your friends or your own thoughts. The script is really good and it really gives you that sense of danger when things are going wrong for the heroes. _________________ In the dark of night, when the world around you is changing, it is easy to feel alone, and it is natural to want to avoid the pain and darkness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Stand, John Hillcoat's debut feature, was a fun ride with some excellent acting and a great twist on a familiar character from the old westerns. The plot, while a bit confusing at first, was interesting enough to keep the film from becoming too dark and uninteresting. I liked that the film focused on John, a man who was caught up in a world he doesn't understand and who ends up defending a group of rebels against the government. 5 out of 5 stars.  Highly Recommended.

Richard has a great story for this one. His life as a child was very different from his parents' lives. As his parents struggled to make ends meet, Richard's father was a drug addict, and Richard's mother had a habit of taking to her job as a nurse to support Richard's family. But Richard's life as they knew it ended that day when he was just a toddler. When Richard woke up, his mother was dead, and his father had been badly injured during a motorcycle crash. Richard had no clue about what had happened. For years he tried to tell his mom that she was still alive, but she would only talk to him when it was convenient for her. In 1992, Richard was finally able to talk to his mother. He was also able to find his dad, who was living in a nursing home. He found Richard and brought him to his parents. Richard's mom told him his dad was in the hospital in critical condition, and it was only through Richard's efforts that he was able to get his father the care he needed. The next year, Richard graduated from college and moved to Los Angeles to be with his parents, who had become extremely ill and died in 1997. Over the years, Richard has learned more about his past and has tried to overcome his demons by returning to school and helping others. Richard now lives in Los Angeles, where he is a successful actor. Richard grew up loving the Star Trek series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband, being a fan of the series from the beginning, and a fanatical collector of memorabilia and props and images from the movies, we went to see this one in the theatre. As far as I am concerned this is the best installment of the franchise. It doesn't feel like a cheap adaptation but rather an adaptation with the intent to give the fans the same experience they had when they were kids with a movie that had some great special effects. We were in for a treat because it looked and felt just like a "normal" science fiction movie with a huge cast, a great story and some brilliant special effects (the holographic scenes being some of the best ever). If you don't like science fiction or love science fiction, I don't know why you would ever see this film. It is a great experience, not for the faint of heart, but definitely for the fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The best part of the film was the ending. "A man on a motorcycle riding a small jetty in the ocean has a run in with a ship that has gone down and all but sunk and he is being towed back to shore by his boat. On his way he passes by a little girl that is being pulled in by a truck by a boy with a huge truck driver's hat on. The child is taken aboard the truck and the truck driver calls out to her, 'Where's my baby, baby?' The girl turns around to find a little boy standing on her shoulder and telling her, "I'm not your baby, I'm my brother's baby. You're my brother and we're all brothers". The little boy says 'Don't you think that makes me your brother?' and then the girl replies, 'Yeah, it does and so does this truck'. The truck driver goes back to his truck and tells his truck driver friend, 'You know what? This truck is the one that's always going to win. If the truck is on top of that boat, he's going to run right over the boy'. So the truck pulls up alongside the little girl and takes her aboard. But then the truck stops for a minute and we see that a man is standing on the other side of the truck. He tells the driver, 'Oh no, the little boy's got me!' 'Oh, come back here,' says the trucker, 'I'll do it.' "After a minute he starts driving again and we get the shot you're familiar with, the boy running from the truck, he ends up in the water where the truck turns around and runs him over. But wait, it gets better, the truck then tries to run over another man and that man runs right over it. When the truck finally gets run over, it turns around, takes the little man that's still alive, puts him in the back of the little boat and then pulls up to the side of an island where there's a small village on a boat." "The last shot was the best, it was just such a great and funny ending to the film, and it ended up as a bit of a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Walt Disney Pictures'  Beauty and the Beast  continues its impressive run as the highest grossing animated film of all time, and it looks like it won't stop there.  As it's being released today, Disney has given us a new synopsis that goes even further into the magic of the film.   "Beauty has been separated from her Beast and left to roam the wild and beautiful land of Eternia with a mysterious young woman, LeFou. As they travel the countryside together, Beauty slowly begins to realize that the young woman is... human. LeFoul and Belle share a close bond and form an incredible bond as well. A journey of discovery begins as these two heroes embark on an incredible journey to save Belle's best friend from the evil that surrounds her and her kingdom, and ultimately find true happiness."    Now, I'm no expert when it comes to the intricacies of Etherealism, but this is still a pretty cool synopsis.    To me, this is the perfect way to describe the magic in this film, and how it relates to the story.  Beauty and the Beasts  does a great job of bringing the magical realm to the forefront.  While Eternian magic doesn't actually have any kind of tangible effect on the physical world, its presence has the same effect on other parts of the world.  The idea that LeFur is Belle's human friend seems like a pretty good way to explain LeFour's existence, and hopefully explain why she's so close to Belle.   While the plot is still being filled in, we know that after Belle and the beast escape from the castle, Le Fou is with Belle and she's about to go through a magic test to show her that the Beast has really been replaced with a girl.  That's pretty interesting because Le Fou's name seems to be the first one that comes to my head when thinking of LeFours, and if we assume Belle's mother was one of these women then that would make Le Fou a mother to Belle's brother as well, meaning that she's a pretty important character as well… which is a bit surprising because she didn't seem to be very much in the first film.  Now this all sounds pretty interesting, but what's really exciting is how they've added a third main character, which is even more exciting as this character is not named Le Fou, but a character called "Le

There was one that really stood out to me, and that was the one character that we never got to see. He's the only one that is never mentioned and never given the chance to show the audience what he did or what he was thinking. I hope that we get to see him in another movie. The movie was not all that long and it went by pretty quickly. I had a good time watching it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was a good film, but it wasn't really a horror movie" (Michael Futter, Cinema Review) This was my favorite movie of 2014 and it's even better that the people in the comments haven't heard of it.  I just want to get this out of my mind for a day, and not have to look at it for a long while.   3.  The Revenant  (2014) It was like the Wild West on the inside.  The Revenant is about a young Native American man who was attacked and killed by a white man.  His wife is a beautiful woman, who fights the bear in the woods.  She and the boy are in a cabin and it is a long fight to escape the bear and then they run outside into the snow and get separated.  It's a beautiful and chilling tale about survival.  I liked how the story was told from the hunter's perspective, and how it was just how I experienced it, I have never seen it. This was one of my favorite movies of the year, I loved all the people and I loved the story.  The only problem was the film just did not make me cry.  This is a very emotional film and for some people, I think it was a little too hard to watch, but for me, it was an amazing movie.  And the fact that it was made by an amazing director made it a true masterpiece.  3 2.  Hacksaw Ridge (2014).  It's about a man who lost both his legs in World War Two and became a disabled veteran.  He then became the captain of an army regiment.  In the end, he loses one of the four soldiers of the regiment to a sniper attack. This film was my first time to see Hacksaws Ridge in a theater and I was blown away by its great performances. I loved that the film tells the story from the perspective of Desmond Doss, a man with one leg.  As he recounts his story, it's a very powerful and moving experience.  One of the best performances of the film was by Andrew Garfield who plays Doss.  What made this film so amazing was that it's also a very realistic story about what it's like to be disabled.  Like I said, I watched this film for the first time at the screening and the only other movie I saw it in was the Hobbit and I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One of the more remarkable films I've seen this year. " A solid, well-crafted film, set in a beautifully photographed and photographed town. It's an interesting approach to storytelling as the town is both the setting and the audience surrogate. What I found most compelling were the characters, whose stories are told from multiple perspectives and are in constant dialogue. The setting, on an isolated island, is richly evocative, especially in terms of its location, climate, flora, and fauna. "I'm impressed by how well-written and acted this film is. Not only are the characters believable but so is the story. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wolverine - The Movie  (1989) Rating: 5 out of 5 stars    I will admit right now that I have no real interest in watching this movie anymore. I mean it is not bad at all (although it is a little slow) and if you like Wolverine I highly recommend you watch it. For my money I would say this is a good little movie, it follows Wolverine as he goes to rescue a girl who is being held prisoner by the Green Goblin, and of course you have the great fight with the Red Hulk and the Green Skull in the end.  What really strikes me about this movie is the fact that this was the only time we actually see Wolverine in a movie, and I think it works really well.   This is a solid little action movie, but you should not let that stop you from watching it.    My Rating: 6 out of 10 This was the last time we saw Wolverine, a little film was released that we will never forget, so enjoy the movie. If you liked this review, then you will also enjoy the other Wolverine Movies that are coming out soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do yourself a favor and watch THIS before you watch ANY OTHER MOVIE! This movie is simply outstanding in EVERY way imaginable, from plot, to acting, to story, to overall... everything! It doesn't get any better than this movie! It's an amazing journey of a man named William Burch, who's just a regular guy with a lot of problems. When William first arrives at the asylum, he thinks his life is a bit brighter, until he finds out that the doctors aren't all that great at what they do, and the patients in the asylum aren't so nice to each other. And in this world, the patients don't have any rights to the food and the water they're given, and there are even a couple of patients that are in a deep depression and think it's all their fault for being so unhappy. Well... there are a lot worse things than being unhappy! William decides to make himself into a better person by helping out as many of the patients as possible, but eventually, he starts to realize that being nice may not be all it's cracked up to be. He'll have to face the harsh realities of the world, and even make a decision as to whether he wants to be a better man... or if he should stay in the dark about all of the terrible things he's done.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ _______________________ My review of This film I thought was so amazing I had to share it. I really liked this movie. It was well made and it was well written. It had good acting and the acting was really good. It's hard to pick a favorite in a movie like this. I think it's best to say that I don't think I could pick a better film that would be worth buying on the big screen. It has a good plot and an excellent cast. I hope to see more from this film because I thought it was so good. I was also really impressed with the music in this film. I thought the music was perfect for this movie, I like when a movie has a cool theme and this movie had great music for that. I also really liked the special effects in this movie because I think they were perfect. I had never seen a movie with CGI and a lot of it worked really well. I like that they got some of the special effect effects from old movies. If you like action and are a fan of action then this movie is for you. It doesn't have a huge budget but it does have a lot going for it. If I were to give it a higher rating it would be because of the acting and it's plot. But overall this movie really did not disappoint me. This movie had a lot to offer and it just didn't disappoint me at all. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies and has a love of the genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is fun. It doesn't take too long to get going, and you'll have to do most of the watching, because this movie makes up for its relatively dull plot in the moments where it can take its fun. For all the things we take for granted about the 1950s, the fact that a couple of people have to get together for a holiday isn't one of them. And the reason for that is pretty obvious--the film is actually set in the mid-1960s, and one of the main attractions at the local amusement park is a very popular balloonist. His wife has to quit her job in order to support them, and her friend has to go on a trip to Alaska with her new husband. All three characters have the same problem--they have to spend most of their time at home, without anyone to show them around town or to entertain them. It's not a story that's going to be especially interesting to older audiences, who would have been bored by it before we get to it, but the fact is that this movie is a pretty funny, fun ride, and a great way to get the family together for the holiday season.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Giver - Excellent 5 stars out of 5 "How can there be two sides of the same coin?" "That is how the world works."  We don't live in a perfect world; our world is a lot like the world of the Giver, a story about a young man who is born with two sides to his personality.  One side that wants to be free, a normal person.  the other side that is consumed by his need for a father who has abandoned him.  The Giver is a story of a child who learns about his "birthright" as he grows up.  At the same time his mother is in a similar situation.  And both children are fighting to be accepted by their parents, their families and their society.   The story is full of twists and turns.  But it never gets confusing and seems to be very straightforward.  There is no doubt that this is an incredible film.  It is a beautiful film, a very moving film and a very emotional film.     The world of The Gifmer seems very simple but it is one of those stories that is worth telling in your life.   I enjoyed the movie so much.  I have always wondered what the life of The One who wants to Leave would have been like.  He is a very intelligent person who is consumed with his desire for freedom.  How could he have done the things that he has done?  His parents abandoned him in the first place.    The movie takes us back to a world where we will never experience.  We are watching the same story in reverse.   "I was born in the way that I am; but I did not leave that way; and it was not easy to leave that.  They did not love me, I was abandoned.  That is what I am."   The story does have many parallels to our own world.   The One that wants out of a family and society has a similar story.  Our society has left too many people behind.  If they had been raised as a normal child and not been taken from their parents and put in a world without the love of their parents they may have not made the same mistakes.   But the parallels are just too real and I can imagine many of the people in our world.  Why did they do it?  Was it a form of revenge, or the desire to find love?

The ending is really cool and emotional and I love that the girl is an actual zombie and doesn't die after she kills the guy in the end.

He also ends up getting shot, but it's still a great movie. I recommend it to people who like zombies and/or horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I would rather be anywhere else than here!" Rating: 4 stars out of 5 When he was a teenager, young Jack, the last survivor of the Great Disaster, is forced to leave his home. It is a small town near the coast, with the only inhabitants being a single family and their two daughters. This is a tough and lonely existence, with everything to fear and nothing to expect. But one day a small boat appears on the horizon. It contains a strange group of men who are in desperate need of help. One of them in particular, who appears to be the son of the old farmer who sold the young boy into slavery, seems to have special talents. He is a skilled mechanic, a fine swimmer, an adept marksman, and an expert swordsman. But he also has a secret. A secret that could bring him the end of his family and the village of his birth. For such a simple idea, the film has a lot of depth and intrigue. And I found that the film's strong points came from all the interesting characters and the good story and setting. The acting was wonderful, the music was very catchy, and there was a decent amount of humor in the film. The best part of the film was the characters and their interactions with one another. One of the things I really liked about the film were the two different types of characters. One was the male protagonist, the other the female one. The male was the main character who seemed very interesting, but was also a bit too much of a bully at times. The female lead had a very different role to play than the male, but it was still entertaining and fun to watch. But, unfortunately, the female lead was very much just an "evil" woman. There was nothing wrong with her character, but there was nothing to be like about her either. The setting for this movie is very nice and the story was well done. It was interesting to see how everything turned out, but I would have rather seen the film in the 1950's, rather than in 2008. But that is the only thing I would complain about. This is a good horror film. It's a little dated, but at the same time it is fun and entertaining, with a very good story, good acting, and some good action. If you are into the horror genre, this film should be a great start to what could be a wonderful series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is what you can get when you're in the right place at the right time. It's not an overly ambitious movie, but you'll get the sense of it being a bit of a coming of age movie, the best part of which is the main character.  You'll get a nice introduction into this world, and an explanation of the world and history in general.   The movie is very slow, so you should have a little patience.  But then the movie actually begins to kick off.  As I said earlier, it's set in a dystopian society where the government is run by a totalitarian dictator (an extremely unsympathetic character, mind you).  The film opens with a character (a young girl named Emma) being abducted by the government and taken to an underground facility where she's taken to a lab and injected with an experimental drug that makes her forget the world around her.  It's a very creepy film and if you're not into that sort of thing, don't look into it.  However, as far as dystopia goes, it is a pretty good dystopia.  In this world there's a military dictatorship run by these brutal, evil people (who all look quite the same, it does remind me of something from a sci fi film).  However this regime also has the ability to create their own private army and the government doesn't do anything wrong, so the world is somewhat at peace.   But the government isn't all that great at running it, so it's up to the population to take matters into their own hands to overthrow the evil regime.  But the film doesn't take place in this dystopian future world alone.  The story is told in flashback form from the point of view of an unnamed narrator, telling the story of an ordinary man named David.  David is the son of a wealthy family, but when he's a boy he's kidnapped and taken into this underground facility, and there he begins to see things that nobody should see.  At first this is all pretty horrifying, but as the film progresses the world he sees becomes more and more complex.  This isn't some cheap sci fi flick that goes around the universe shooting people in the face, it uses it's narrative well to tell the story, and that is what makes it so good.  For the most part the story is very simple, but in order to make the film seem complex (because it really isn't),

This film is one of the most amazing and influential westerns ever. I've had to see this film again and again. I would say this is my favorite western of all time. It's also one of my favorite bad movies ever. It is a must see for every western fan. I'll start with some plot info. The story is simple, two brothers are feuding over a goldmine, and one brother decides to go after the gold. But the brother he follows, goes after the brother who is supposed to be following him, so he is really following the bad guy. The bad guy tries to kidnap the goldman, but he is saved by some old Indian dude. The Indian is killed, but the bad man gets away, and goes after his brother. He gets him by stealing the gold, and it is up to a bounty hunter to catch him. But, as it happens, the bad guys own a circus that is also a show business. And the circus clown is a lot more than he looks. You'll love this movie, because it is funny, and the good guy is really good at using his skills, and not just being a gun wielding bad guy that everyone can sympathize with. *This was an awesome, cool little flick, and a favorite. *Check out this movie on the following sites: * IMDb * Wikipedia * TV.com * The Devil is in the details: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK6b-dJ6lk0 *Check this movie out on the website for the film's distributor: www.theevildaniels.com

You think that I am so stupid that I don't realize what is going on? Are you going to believe that?  No, you'll never believe that. But it's true. Because I was really a little girl when I had your baby, and this is all true.  In my baby, I saw the future of the future. I could see how the world would look like. And I was convinced. I was so sure that we could have such a beautiful family. That I could protect you and your baby and bring you back.

I'm sure it's true that some people find her beautiful, and to me, she was sexy and I enjoyed the movie, I like how it's not too fast paced, there's not much action, and it's all about the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------  This is a fun romp about a "possessed" kid with a weird sense of humor and a super-cute dog. The acting is really top notch, with Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular being great as the lead. My only real criticism is that the ending is sort of contrived, but it does give me hope that we may be getting the return of the "Nightmare Before Christmas" sequel soon.  _________________  Kinda like "A Christmas Carol", but with a little more romance  P.S. -- that dog looks awesome!  Reviewed by: Anonymous on 08/06/2009 Rating: 3.0   The Movie:   A movie like this is really only as good as the actors in it. The rest of the movie is nothing special. This is another remake/re-write of a remake/rewrite.   If you liked Night of the Living Dead and are sick of horror/thriller movies that never really got any better, you'll enjoy this movie.   the plot has the "classic" zombie-franchise-type thing going on. You know, all the main characters get killed by zombies and then it's all downhill from there. The "special effects" are OK, and some of them are kinda cool but never really go anywhere.   I don't understand why this was a movie about a girl trying to rescue her friends from zombies. It was just as much about "survival" as it was about fighting off zombies. And the only "happens" to our heroine in this movie is that she finds the way home after being lost for a week.   be prepared for a lot of weird humor that is a lot like the movies from the 70's   My favorite part of the film was definitely the zombie-hunting dog. His lines were funny and his "juggling" with our heroine was pretty great. He had a lot to do with the ending. Overall, I think it is a good little horror movie, but not very good.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A dark, grimy, gothic horror story that doesn't disappoint. A story that seems more fitting to the likes of the original Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, and with some clever ideas to boot, The Grudge deserves the status of being the most original entry in the franchise. The story takes the form of a young woman (Linda Hamilton) who was a victim of a serial killer named The Reaper. She becomes involved in a supernatural battle against him and his minions, only to find herself a part of a much bigger, and much scarier, war between the forces of good and evil. This story is absolutely mind blowing, and has a truly epic scope and scale. "  What does it mean for a movie to be "epic"?  One of the most important and most overlooked aspects of the success of The Grinder is the quality of its writing and its ability to capture the imaginations of its audience, whether they were aware of it or not. The film's production budget was well over $15 million, so I will let the movie speak for itself when it says "Epic."  The Grinder (2003)  THE GRUDGE was filmed at a whopping 2,000 miles per hour, and that's only to tell you about the stunts. It is the most epic, over the top, most intense, and most elaborate film I've ever seen. If there are two words you would use to describe the film, "epistemic" and "epidemiological," that is what you would think it was. The Grudge is epic in the sense that it will stand the test of time, because it is not a story that anyone could ever forget.  It should be no surprise that the film is a sequel. This film is far more ambitious and ambitious than it first appears to be. : The Grudging is a great film, a movie that every one of its fans should see. The production values are phenomenal, and the acting is top notch, and it should have been nominated for an Academy Award. It's the most exciting, mind blowing film I have ever seen, and is worth the price of admission alone. .

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very intrigued by the idea of a movie which follows a group of teenage girls through their teenage years, and how their friendship develops. It is very well put together and well written, and I was glad to see that the movie is not trying to tell me something, but to let me experience the things myself, and to let my imagination take over. It seems to me that I really got to know these girls very well through their friendship, and it really shows in the movie, and even though I did not understand all of it, it was still nice to watch. There is plenty of heart and emotion here, and there is a lot of humor as well. There are moments of levity in the film, and we see the girls growing and developing as teenagers, but it is very realistic. It definitely has a lot going for it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Thank you for watching!  "The Great Lie" was released in the early 1980s, and it is a story about a man who believes that he can turn into anything he desires. The story follows the lives of several different men, all of whom share one common goal: to become men.  For a movie about the struggle to become a man, "The Great lie" is very good at showing that you can become anything that you want to become. The main character in the film, Alex, is quite brilliant, and the story is told in the same manner as an essay: Alex takes a few ideas and uses them to create a new life for himself.  and the ideas that Alex comes up with are so fantastic that he thinks he will become a successful businessman. This leads to the movie's plotline. Alex, along with his best friend Alex (William Hurt), are all convinced that they have discovered the secret of happiness and that they are going to make everybody happy. Alex also believes that his girlfriend, Jennifer, is going to be happy if they marry, and he is going in to the marriage believing that he will provide Jennifer with everything she wants. The film is all about Alex's obsession with happiness, so Alex and Jennifer start a company which will be successful. Alex soon becomes convinced that the whole world is going down the drain, and this starts him believing that if he really wants happiness, then he has to do something to fix the world. -Plot Summary-  Alex has always liked girls. He feels that he is more attractive than many girls and wants to start a dating magazine where he can get girls interested in him. Alex is trying to create his own magazine by creating a "Happiness Index" which is a measurement of his self-esteem. Alex tries to attract more girls by telling them about his own achievements, which seem to indicate that he might not be all that bad. Alex becomes frustrated when he can't find any girls interested and decides to take on the role of a salesman, which is another way for him to attract women. .  the movie starts off with a lot of romance. Alex meets a beautiful, rich, and sexy woman, Jennifer (Lena Headey), and after a night of passion, they end up getting married. Alex has become the owner of a dating website which is called "The Happy Index," and Alex has found his life to be better and more fulfilling than he ever imagined

I love the character of Willard. I thought the way he was played, and the way it ended was the best way to end a story. The movie was fun, and I could only imagine Willard playing the guitar and singing about it. This is a good film, that does not have any of the cliches or bad sequels that usually pop up, which I really liked. I would recommend this movie.

It is not that I think it's un-film-like in any sense of the word. There are indeed plenty of elements to it that are filmic and worthy of the title: the setting, the dialogue, the plotting, the direction, etc. But none of these things are as important as the final image of the titular car. In fact, as a film, it is one of the most boring, most over-acted films I have ever seen. In the movie, Marlowe, the protagonist, gets a job as a "fixer" on the set of a film called The Malterettes, starring James Stewart. Marlowes job is to pick up women, who he then has to put through a series of contortions in order to keep them in a state of near-comatose, to keep their "flirting" from ending. In a nutshell, Marlo's job is as follows: When a woman begins to fall in love with another woman, Marloes job is simply to keep her talking and laughing and enjoying herself, so that they are forced to continue talking and spending time together. In short, Marloweres job, in order, is to keep the woman on the edge of a very, very high, almost unbearable, emotional cliff. The whole movie is just about this. That's about

The film is an entertaining but tragic romance. The two old folks have a love affair. They love one another and one day they decide to get divorced. The woman is very old and the man is very young. As time passes and the years wear on they have no interest in each other anymore. They do get together at one point and then it's clear that they just don't see each other as much as they used to.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** If you're looking for something funny, well-paced, well shot and written, then check this movie out. A nice comedy for the time. I loved the character of The Kid. I can only imagine how much fun she was in the old age. I could picture her saying, "I had it all - my wife, my business, my life, my kids, and I even had a bit of money to my name. But when my kids turned nine, I became a widow. I was alone. I needed a little adventure, some excitement, something to make me feel like I was still a man. So I called my brother and asked him if he would come with me. I told him I was ready to go on an adventure with him. That was the last time we talked on the phone. Two weeks later I left for my adventure. We got a ride to California. When we got to the train station, we noticed our tickets had been stolen. The conductor was a tough guy. We walked around to the back of the train and waited for him to finish the ticket book. It was a lonely feeling. The Kid was crying because she was alone and didn't have a place to stay. The other passengers became very suspicious of TheKid and she felt that they too were out to get her. It didn't take long for her suspicions to be confirmed. A man had entered the train after the conductor left, took TheKid's ticket book, and ran off with it. She became hysterical and began to plead for help. A woman next to her grabbed her arm and said, "Don't worry, we will catch the man." "Don�t be silly," she said. "This is California, and the man was probably a transient. We must continue our trip." I was amazed. It wasn�t very long before I became convinced that this woman was the most important person in our lives. That night, she took The Kid to a bar. I didn�t understand why she did this, but I trusted her. I would later see that the bar was in an old-fashioned building with a sign that said �Good Times.� It was the only bar on that train. A girl came over to talk to TheKid. She was very attractive, about 25 years old, beautiful, slim and sexy. She had brown hair, a perfect body and her eyes were brilliant. TheKid became extremely excited and started kissing her. She felt

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had been waiting to watch "Possession" for a while, but finally got around to picking it up this year. I had to wait until the new year for the film because it is still on their New York screening run. In fact, the movie was so popular that a month prior to it's release, it was announced it would go on to be an official selection for the New York Film Festival! I knew it would be a good film, but I didn't think it would blow my socks off like it did! It was good, it wasn't perfect, but it did everything I hoped it would do. The story was simple, but was told in such a way that it was engaging to the audience as it played out. As a whole, it had some strong ideas and a compelling story, but the problem is that the story was a little too simple. I do believe it is possible to do that kind of story very well, but a story that is simple and is told with the intent to be engaging. This film does not reach those goals. It doesn't feel exciting or memorable, but for some reason, I don't think that's the fault of the script. If there is a fault, it's because the actors are not able to convey any of the emotions and their actions do not make much sense. But all in all, I think this is an interesting film that has a lot to offer!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I don't have to be good to make the crowd go nuts," laughs a young woman with a shaggy head who was sitting in the front row of the theater when I first met her. "There's a movie out there for everybody, and that's the way to do it, no matter who you are. I guess it's a bit like having good wine in your cellar," she says. As the lights go down and the first reel begins, she has the same question I do - What do I see? I wonder if it's the same one I saw when I was a kid - but I see something that looks a bit different. A long, long way down the road and beyond. As in a vision that's been seen many times before, and never the same. The trailer gives away the theme, and the movie's director, the Irish director Peter Strickland, knows it, but even as he shows us this time-traveling tale of a woman who goes back in time to stop her father from committing suicide and who ends up with her childhood self as a new kid in school, he keeps revealing the truth of the tale: the woman is not the only one who has to travel down the path that she does. In this case, she's the only real daughter. The story has the air of a coming-of-age tale that begins on the page, but one that moves with the same energy that the movie does. The movie's title, a line from a song by the late, great Johnny Cash, might give the impression that the story takes place in a distant future, but the movie isn't about anything in particular that's really distant. The time-jump is set in the last years of the twentieth century, as Americans find themselves in a recession that has wiped out the middle class, and with the rise of the anti-government Tea Party movement. As our hero (Liv Tyler) is leaving for New York for the day, she stops off in a small town in the middle of nowhere, where she meets a young man (Chris Hemsworth) and falls in love. A small village in Michigan, it's called. They marry, and settle down there. Things are looking up. A new house is built, their children start school, and they feel like it's just what they need. But things are about to change. The local mayor (Timothy Simons) is a man who has spent his entire
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What can I say, I loved this movie. It was my first film that I actually enjoyed. I'm sure many people have this same thought when they first watch this film, that it's a comedy, with funny characters, funny dialogue, but then they get into the film and realize this is a serious drama. There's a lot of dark humor in this film as well as some real emotional weight behind it. I found the acting to be very good. The scenes were well staged and acted out and the writing was quite strong too. The movie wasn't boring either. This is not a movie you would rush to see. The ending was really very good and the story kept you there for the entire film. I give this a 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is a classic in the genre. It tells the story of two kids who have to help a friend in a scary situation. I have seen the movie on more than one occasion and have been very impressed with the special effects. It has a lot of great action scenes. I would highly recommend this movie for those who like action movies and have a love of children. I like to give children a chance "And now, it's time to eat! Aaaaaaahhhhhh!" When my children were little, I used to feed them in the bathtub. My wife was shocked and annoyed when she saw my tiny children and her small family. She asked why I let the little children stay in the tub instead of a sink. Then I told her that I have my own children now and it's not such a great idea to let them sit on the toilet bowl at night. And the worst part was when the old man that had been sleeping in the bathroom, would go to the bathroom and he would have to go back up because he would not be able to sit on his own toilet bowl. Now that was a scary thought. But I learned quickly that I should never be worried about my kids. They are never afraid of anything and will never let anything get them down. When my kids were small, they were little kids and I gave them a chance to see a movie and some of my favorite movies are:  "It's a Good Life" by Martin Scorsese - A great movie about a man who loves his wife and children. "The Bad and the Beautiful"  by Robert Altman - A very interesting and very true story about the old people in a nursing home who lived in an old house. I especially like this movie because it's so realistic and touching. If I had one thing to give a child, it would be this, a smile, a big smile. It will make the world around you a lot more beautiful. You might even find a way to get the person in front of you to smile, too. Thank you for the awesome memories and great memories! Your book was very informative and I really appreciated that you explained to my son what was the difference between a good and a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Keep writing and I'm sure that you will keep writing more great movies for children!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you need a reason to go out in style, this is the movie for you" If you are looking for a great romantic comedy this is it.  I loved this movie and it was worth the long wait.    The plot is simple:   A couple have a honeymoon in Europe but there is something wrong with the hotel they are staying at and they can't get out of the problem.  One night the wife takes her husband out to dinner.  The two enjoy the dinner and then go to the movie.  As the night goes on the couple gets to thinking about the past as they walk up to their room.  It is then revealed that they are in an orphanage and the husband is a new baby.  They leave and realize that they have no money for the bills.  Now they have to deal with the situation.  I didn't care much for the movie but it was okay.  There was no special effects but it didn't really matter because it was a romantic comedy and the script was very well written.  All in all it was fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We were driving down the road and a cop pulled us over for speeding. A good movie, lots of action. The main character is a cop, but he was so cocky he didn't think he had a chance. So I watched him beat the crap out of another cop. I thought about it and I said, "Gee I should try the game. I want to win that stupid game." I didn't want to play the game anymore, but I was in the car with my two little boys and we were so excited. The cop got in the cop car and the kid's name was "D" and he got so mad when he saw that D was a big tough guy he started getting in D's face. The kid started choking him, he punched him and the cop said, in a way you can't believe, "Why are you doing this? You're the only one who would ever beat up a cop." And D was like, "I'll take you down and get even with you. You can't beat me, because I've got a big gun, and a lot of people hate me, but don't let the cops beat you." I thought it was so funny. They gave him an Oscar for best supporting actor, and the movie was the number one film in the country. It got nominated for five Academy Awards and won three, including for best picture, with some of the best acting I've ever seen in any movie, including Gene Hackman and Mel Gibson in the same film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhere over the rainbow, you may find the Rainbow Family. This colorful, animated family is as wholesome as they come: all-round good people who never forget the best part of their lives. I'll bet that the Rainbow family are all singing, dancing, and being merry as always.  All they have to do is sit around talking and having a good time.  "The best part is that I'm never late!"    In the second episode, the RainbowFamily are having a dance party, and the only person who can stop them from dancing is the most evil and obnoxious, a girl by the name of Miss Crinkle.  It's very clear that she hates the Rainbow People for their misdeeds, but what she doesn't understand is that the whole world is still in a terrible state.  When the Rainbow Girl realizes that her father has abandoned his entire family, she tries to do something about it.  After getting all his money, she steals the Rainbow Baby (another Disney animated character) and leaves with it. While traveling back to her home, the Baby falls off a cliff and is crushed.   The Rainbow Family takes the Baby home and name him after the evil girl who stole his money.  Now that she has her money, the evil evil evil girl has a lot more money to spend!  The Rainbow Girl is now in charge of the whole town.  If her evil ways weren't enough, she can't even keep the Baby safe! The Rainbow Family are now in complete and total control of their town. What's wrong with people? I'm glad the show never really bothered to answer that question.  The show never tried to explain how people are so evil, and how they live in such a world. The only explanation they offered was that the evil of the world comes from the bad decisions people make.  But how can they really know what's right or wrong?  All of their bad decisions made them evil.  I guess they thought that people who aren't evil are just dumb and are not allowed to have opinions.  There's one scene in particular that shows that the show is just as shallow as it gets:  A boy and his friends are all at a party and all of a sudden a strange man with a weird speech impediment comes up to them.  He doesn't talk at all, just gestures and stares around the room. The boy tells his friends to leave

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The Black Mirror is a sci fi drama that deals with the rise of a technology that allows people to see into the minds of people around them, but also allows them to see what they are doing behind the eyes of those around them. There is no action here, but there is definitely some good tension and drama. The acting is pretty good. I found it pretty difficult to watch at times and at times it was enjoyable, but when you try to figure out what was going on, you are constantly wondering "is this what we saw? or maybe we missed something". The cinematography of the film is also not as good as it could be. The film starts off with a very beautiful day in the woods and then it gets dark and eerie very quickly and this is definitely not one of the better films of the year. ********* I would recommend this film for anyone who likes a good twist on sci fi and dark science fiction. It has a great story and a good atmosphere. I would even go so far as to say that the acting is very good and the movie is worth watching. The ending was a little disappointing but still entertaining. _________________________________________________________ Check out all of our reviews and see what we think! __________________________________ We love hearing from our readers!

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- My wife and I rented this on a Sunday evening and we watched it a second time on a Monday afternoon. It was good, though nothing spectacular. I have seen better, but I've also seen worse. The plot of the movie is pretty simple and has some good moments. It could have been better, and maybe I just have to take in my wife's reviews more. As far as a movie I wouldn't suggest going into with the intention of watching a comedy, since this movie has very little humor. It's still good and it's funny, but that's all. It had the same feel of some of the comedy I've seen on the web, like "Hood," and "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." And that's about it. The main characters were nice enough, I think, and the characters weren't stupid and were believable in what they did. I wouldn not recommend this movie for a first viewing, unless you want to see what comedy can do for a few minutes. I think if you're a comedian, or even if you just like a little silliness, you'd probably like this movie. The characters had some good gags and the jokes were funny. If you like the kind of comedy that involves characters talking to each other and are not interested in the plot, this movie is for you. If this is your first comedy, you probably don't need this movie, but it's a nice first movie to watch. It doesn't have a lot going for it, but if you have time, and can handle a little bit of silliness to fill your time, then you may have a good time. I give it a B. The picture is a little darker than I would have liked, but otherwise, I wouldn this a C.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just watched this one and I'm just floored.  When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew it would be a hit.  The movie is an adaptation of a book,  The Princess Bride.  It is based off of an amazing book by Rob Reiner.  It takes place in the 70s when a young married couple take their vows and vow to each other.  The story goes to a faraway land and then they come back and take their place on the same side.  They find out the country is in a civil war so they decide to leave the war and go back home.   This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I think it has everything.  There is humor, heart, adventure and romance.  This is a movie I would go to the movies to watch alone.  While this movie is very old I feel its timeless.    I'm sure you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************************** I first saw this film on the big screen at the AMC Loews in Santa Monica when it was released and was extremely pleased by it. I have a hard time believing that this film was made by the same people who made the first and second. This film was a bit more action-oriented than the first, and did have a few great fight scenes. However, I was disappointed that the third didn't even come close to the first or second. The story follows a young, good-hearted man named Mark who gets his life on track when he is introduced to the world of computer science. He goes to a prestigious university and, while there, meets a young girl named Melissa, who happens to be in a love triangle with a high-school football player named Jason. He falls for her immediately and the two begin working together. Unfortunately for him, he soon learns that Melissa has a dark past and is a member of a cult called the Order of the Black Sun. This cult does not want Melissa back so Mark must decide between his friendship with Melissa and his love for his computer science degree. At one point Mark meets another young man named Alex, whom Melissa claims to have a crush on, so he decides to stay with the Order. One thing leads to another and Mark and Alex get involved with the cult. Unfortunately, this also causes them to fall in love with each other. When Melissa becomes involved with Jason, Mark and his friends decide to leave the Order, but not before trying to save Melissa from the cult members who have captured her and Jason. I was not a fan of this film. The action scenes were fairly generic and not anything very special, while the story was a little convoluted. There are also some weird sexual references, but they were not all that offensive. Overall I would have to give it a 2 out of 5, although it was enjoyable enough for me to go back and watch it once again. - December 27, 2009Harsh Rating

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We've all been in a situation where we know a movie has a good story (or at least, an engaging one) but we have no interest in the characters or the setting. For the love of Pete and the rest of the gang, tell it to us! The main characters in 'Gigli' were great, from the beginning. And we didn't know who the characters were, which is something a lot of sequels struggle with. I liked the character of Samuels, his relationship with the others, and the setting he was set in. I loved the setting, it was so different from anything else in the genre and it was fun. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie wasn't just a sequel, it actually became a little more than that. If you liked the original, and are like me, then you might like the sequel better. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is that the story gets a little bit confusing at times, though I guess it is an intentional choice. It was also a little slow, but I guess that's what happens when you're trying to tell the most important story of your life. For a movie about a murder, that is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a fine movie that has a terrific cast that includes Sean Connery as the great character Sakamoto, Tom Cruise as the cool samurai and Bruce Lee. Here's a review from the time it was filmed: "The Last Stand" was the last film directed by Sam Peckinpah before he died in 1974. The film was a dramatic take on the old western mythos. As Peckinpoah is leaving the production, he tells his young assistant that his next picture will be The Last Stand. It is the first of three films in the trilogy. The story is about a sheriff who comes to the frontier town of M'lin where he is confronted with a strange and deadly ghost that is the product of the man's evil lust for vengeance against his brother. It was a pretty good picture. The casting was excellent with both John Wayne and James Coburn playing the outlaws in M'Lin. Sidney Poitier as the sheriff Sean Connery in his final role. Sean Wayne as the outlaw M'Lin. The production was very well funded by Universal. They did everything but the editing.  The only flaws that I could find with this movie are that it is somewhat slow paced but that's not too much of a problem as the scenes were excellent. The last of three movies and the last one directed by Peckinpuff. It's a good time.  The last image of the movie. If you are looking for a good western that is not too expensive, this movie is worth a look.   I really enjoyed the last Sam Peckins movie. "The Magnificent Seven" was a fun western that was a lot more action oriented. "Magnificent Seven"" is about seven men who are taken out of the posse and given the task of taking down the ruthless gangster. This gangster is also part of a crime ring and he is the leader of an entire drug trafficking organization. "Walt Disney's The Three Caballeros" is about the three brothers in this cowboy story who want to prove their cowboy skills.  "The Three Cabaleros" has a wonderful cast and is a fun and exciting western. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This movie has to be one of the best action films I have ever seen. It was amazing. I was amazed at the amazing stunts and the awesome fight scenes. I loved every minute of it. I have to say this is one of those movies that you have to watch on a big screen to really see it. The fights were so close to real. They were choreographed to the music that is playing in the background. I also liked the whole movie because the characters were great. The people we have for the most part were very different, but we are all united in our love for the movie. This movie was not so bad and it was an awesome watch. You could have seen more than 10 movies like this in a night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a great movie that I feel like I didn't see coming. The first few minutes of the film is very confusing because it starts off with a lot of action and doesn't really explain what the heck they are doing on a spacecraft. It feels like they have no idea how to do things and they are running from some kind of alien creature. It has an absolutely great monster design, even though it is not a big action star monster that I expected from "The Thing." The thing is that the monster is incredibly slow moving and moves very slowly. It is very strange and I don't know if I would like the creature. The thing looks very similar to the one from "Alien" in that it is very well designed, yet it moves very slow. The creature is about as far from the kind of monster I would have expected from a "Alien"-inspired film. The special effects are very good, although it is a horror film, so expect to see some effects of a horror genre. The monster itself is very scary and scary. The things that the creature does are very impressive and the effects really make it look like it is trying to escape. It does not make it seem like it wants to hurt the people, but is very slow and mysterious. I was really looking forward to watching it and was expecting a very good film but it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. "The Big Chill"  was not what I expected. I loved the trailer and had high hopes, but the trailer was not at all what I was looking forward too. It was slow paced, made me feel uncomfortable, and I wasn't entertained in the least. I guess that is how it goes for the horror trailers. I am not sure if they had low expectations for this one, or they are just trying to make a quick buck. I think they should have given me some kind news and just called it a bad movie. I can't believe I am giving this movie a four out of five, but it is still a nice, scary movie that is well made. I liked it, but I just can't give it a 5. The next three are my least favorite: "The Other Guys"    This is the movie that made me want to get rid of my cable. It took me two weeks to get through the whole thing. The main character is so boring and I do not like how it ends. I do like that
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ You're just a person looking for ___________ to see a good film, are you not? _______________ Just as your life may begin in the East or in the West, my life may also begin in _________ the East, or in ___________________ the West. My path is just as long as the one before me, but it will be wider, and it will not end in despair. I do not look for success. I want ________, and I will find it. I seek to be happy. That is all there is to it.  This is the kind of movie that's hard to describe, as it's very much a mixture of the mundane and the fantastical. I'd say this movie is something like a mix between the two. If I had to describe it in a single word, I'd have to say it's like an Asian version of Fantastic Mr. Fox.   The cast is pretty much perfect, with an almost all-Asian ensemble cast (I'm not sure how much of the cast was Asian, but I'm not counting the one guy who does voiceover). I thought it was nice to see some Asian male characters on screen, even if there weren't that many (the only one who stands out for me is the evil Chinese doctor).   I'm pretty much a fan of the Fantastic Four, and this movie isn't a bad film by any means, but if you're looking for a great story that combines fantasy and science fiction, this isn't the one.  -M
Write a positive review about a good movie:    https://youtu.be/vL6Qjx-v8vw We get a quick recap of where the story is going before we are dropped right into what I found to be the very least satisfying part of the movie. A bunch of young kids are all excited to get back into the car and drive out of the park. We are then given a quick scene of the three girls running to get out of their vehicles while it's raining. After some light action (I don't even think there was any, it was just some silly stuff that didn't really mean anything) we are given a brief scene of one of the cars flipping over in some sort of freak accident, which just so happens to involve all the kids in the car. I found this to be very lame and felt that this was just there to just show that everyone was fine, the point of the scene was to be a silly, light moment that I didn't feel needed to be in the movie at all. In a rather disturbing turn of events, we cut back to the other girls, a teenage girl who is now an adult, a girl who has grown up in a home with drug addiction and who had to get her child removed from her care a few years ago. As soon as we are told that there is another kid on the loose, we see that she, "has a little boy." This doesn't really explain much, especially since we never see her before, so you can guess that the young boy is her daughter. The whole family is going through a bad time, and this young girl was living the life in between, her son being removed, and the drugs. She was a single mom with three kids who was also dealing drugs. It really just made the movie feel incredibly clichéd. The only interesting part about her is that she is actually doing the right thing. The fact that she was willing to go to the lengths to help her daughter is impressive, but that doesn't change that it is extremely lame. We are then treated to another shot of a young kid, this time it is a little girl who will soon be taking the next step in her life. She is the one who gets the most screen time and we are treated to a nice scene of her going to school, where she seems very happy and happy to be going. Once again though, the movie is completely lacking in any real conflict. A few scenes
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The following movie is the first in a trilogy of books I'm writing about the events of the first year of the apocalypse. The world is in chaos. A massive plague has taken out 90% of the population, and the government is using every means to try and contain it. The people's collective paranoia about the plague and the authorities has lead them to think that the apocalypse is already here, and they need the authorities' help to defeat it. I'll try to be brief in this review, because this story is a fascinating read. The first three chapters are very well written. It's an amazing read, and a great read if you want to understand how people think and act during an apocalypse. I'm interested to see where this story takes us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Pretender (1984) is a classic sci-fi movie about a man who, after having been brainwashed, returns to his old planet, his home for the past few centuries, and his own family to find his wife and child. This time around, the planet is under the control of an evil, manipulative, and ruthless "prince" named the Prince of Hell (played by Michael York). Now, as the villain, he's out to conquer all of the world, and he's willing to do anything to accomplish his goal. As the human hero, Jack, you'll fight alongside Jack as he journeys through the planets' different cities to locate his family. The whole movie is a great combination of comedy and drama, as Jack and his daughter, Sarah, embark on their journey to save their family. Jack is a fun, well-acted lead character, as he's a very fun person to watch. He doesn't have much to say, and just goes on with his journey of becoming a hero. Even though he's not the most original character in the movie, he does have his moments, and this is a good character for the movie to bring back. As for the cast, the film is filled with some of the best actors of all time. Of course, there's William Shatner as the evil Prince of hell, as well as Michael York as his faithful companion. There's also a great cast of supporting characters, and a lot of great comedic moments. Even when the movie gets down to its lighter moments, it still has plenty of action, and the special effects really make it an enjoyable ride. Overall, the movie is great, and if you're a fan of sci-ffi or classic comedy, then you should watch The Great Pretenders.  The Great Escape (1963) One of the most famous movies ever made, The Great Escape is one of those movies that many people still remember fondly. One of the greatest suspense films ever made (despite a little cliched humor), The Great Flight is one of the top suspense movies ever created. The film follows  a group of soldiers who have been stranded on a ship for three days. When one of them hears a disturbance, the rest of the group try to find out what's going on. As it turns out, they're being chased by a man with a huge sword and a pair of cats. But the bad guy is only a hallucination, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ This is a story of love and loss. It's a story about the loss of a family, and the loss is in the form of a young woman. I have to confess this is the first movie I've seen this year that has inspired a change in my life. This is the story of a girl named Katerina who has just lost her family to the war in the Ukraine and she has to find out what happened to them. She must take the last surviving member of the family with her to the home she's left behind and figure out what they did. It is one of the most heartbreaking and heartbreaking films I have ever seen. The cinematography and cinematography alone is amazing and the performances in this film are astounding. I was able to see this movie over and over in one sitting, and I know it will haunt me for the rest of my life... I don't care how many times I see it. This film is truly amazing, and you should see it for yourself. Also, when the credits rolled I felt a weight lift off my shoulders... A year of sorrow is over... My life is finally worth something... Thanks for the memories! _________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the second movie that I have seen in the franchise, and the one where the "R" stands for "Red". The first movie was the first one, and it was good. The second movie is the first time I thought the "V" stands with "Veronica". The third movie was okay. The fourth movie was great. In the fifth movie, the "E" stands alone with "Elaine", not because it was bad, but because it is the best in the series. The sixth movie was a good one, with a strong and fast paced plot, and good characters.  The final movie, I watched this on video, and I must say, this was one of the best movies ever made. The acting was great, the movie is long, and well, it's great. This movie will stay with me for the rest of my life. There were some issues, but the movie itself was great! The ending of the sixth movie is really awesome.  I want to go back and watch this movie again and again. It is well made, and funny, and has one of my favorite endings ever.

I would have liked it to take a more serious tone if the plot was changed, though, the character development and drama is good enough to make it worth a watch. What I did not like about this film: It isn't an action movie, but it isn't a very long one either. The special effects work well enough, but don't do anything to separate this movie from others with better effects. This was a very good action movie and was worth watching, just be aware of the fact that it's not a film you will be watching over and over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Days of Disco"  (1982) I have never liked the movie "Disco Inferno" (1985) as much as I enjoyed this sequel and I'm sure that this particular movie is not even partly the same. I don't like that the movie was made for a very specific kind of people. People who like the disco genre in general and not in specific, more or less "disco rock" or "dance movies" or any other kind of dance movie.   The movie "Disco Inferno" was one of the first to make me hate the "D.I.R.Y." people who do this kind of movie for a lot of the audience. The film is obviously a parody of "Dirty Dancing", with the only similarity being the way the music sounds when someone's dancing. I can understand the obvious parody but still the music is not funny in the least. This movie is a bit too violent. The whole movie is about a gang of gangsters and the main characters are the gang members. A bit too "gangster" for me. The first part is the same as the first part of the original film "Dancing on the Edge", with the main character fighting with his partner until they get arrested and are sent to prison.  This part has also a lot to do with some police who kill the police. The movie ends with the police being killed by the gangsters, with the music playing again. I mean, I can see the movie not very "serious" and it could have been made to attract a wider audience to the genre and not just for the "real gangsters" (like in most "gangsters" movies). The movie could have had a lot more comedy with more funny scenes and less violence.  "Doo Da Daddies"  I haven't liked "Dodgers"   since the first time I saw it. I thought that I was watching a lot less silly people than in this movie. I also have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to watch a movie about a baseball player, with a baseball bat. One other issue with this movie was the actors. I've seen people call "Dude O.J." the funniest and I agree with them, but in this case, it's "Dodo

The story is set in the same Lego universe as the movie and is the sequel to the movie's end. The plot follows the same concept of the Lego Movie and this movie really shows the genius and genius of this Lego movie. The main character, Emmet, is Emmet. You may know him from the movies or his role in the Lego movie, but he is a young boy who has an imagination. As the story progresses, he gets into many adventures with his Lego friends. This film is all about the adventures and how they are put together. This is the Lego world and it is an awesome film. The only thing that is missing is the voice over, but hey, it is a Lego movie so they are doing that all the time.  The Lego Movie is a great film and I highly recommend everyone to see it. If you have any doubts about this Lego film, you can probably watch it now. I'll give you a spoiler free review, but if you have not seen the Lego movies, you may want to check it out to see what all the fuss is about. I highly suggest it and I would highly recommend watching it, but I think it is really important to note that it does not have a voice over in it. I know you may be confused at this point, but the Lego Film is just about Emmet and his friends with no voice over. I personally like the voice overs as I think they bring more to the film, but it may not work for all. Overall, the story is good and there is a lot happening at the end of the film. Overall I gave it a 8/10 and I can't wait to see the Lego film 2 and see if they can keep the success of this movie going. The Lego Film 2 is on September 22, 2015.

It is also worth mentioning that the cast is pretty good. You don't see many people walking around in t-shirts and jeans. And it is not always a surprise to find out that the main character has a sister, a brother, or a child. This is the type of movie that you should probably not be afraid to watch. ___________________________________ It's a shame that we don't have more movies like this. ___________

Includes the Catholic Encyclopedia, Church Fathers, Summa, Bible and more — all for only $19.99...  Pope John XII. (1422-1486), the last pope of the Roman Catholic Church, was a Catholic and a devoutly devout man. The story of his early years is often told in Latin by writers. The account by Giambattista Valla (c.1475-1492) is the most complete, and was translated into English by G. G. R. D. MacDonnell (London, 1895). It was reprinted (by Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1909), and was also used by the Catholic Association (1891, London, 1901, New Haven, 1903).  John XII.  At the age of thirteen the boy John had seen his father slain by the Turks. He was then entrusted to a lady of the name of Gisela, who was the wife of the Venetian, Giuseppe Sforza, at whose palace he remained for the next fifteen years. When he was sixteen his father was again killed, and he took up his residence in Milan. He began life in the service of his uncle the count of Bologna, who had a small house in the outskirts of the city, not far from the Piazza San Marco. Gisella, his mother, lived in the same neighbourhood, in a large house, and there they lived three years, until her husband returned from Constantinople to Venice, where he was to remain as long as his nephew lived. ... The whole history of the youth in the household of a count who had so far remained a boy is very well told by Della Porta, who says that in the beginning his father had much to give to the service, and that at first the count himself was somewhat of an object of hatred.

His relations with the ladies were such that he could even pretend that he wished to be one of them, and even gave his name to one of their friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The final product is simply the best sci-fi movie I have seen in the last ten years. The visuals are amazing and the actors are amazing. I really think the reason the film has received such a good reception is that it takes a few chances with the concept, and it doesn't shy away from giving the audience a sense of adventure and action, which is something I have always felt missing from science fiction in the recent years. It may not be what everyone else is going to like, but it is a movie that I will be coming back to time and time again.  Review by Richard Locker   5.0/5 stars for good movie  Posted July 17th, 2007  What does it take to win the hearts of sci-Fi fans? In this film, they did it.   While The Martian may have an average Rotten Tomatoes score of 53%, it has received praise from everyone from Robert Redford to Adam Wingard. One of the film's major strengths is how the script takes its time and lets the viewers take a good long look at the Mars of the near future. That is not to say that the film is easy to follow. The film is very slow and it takes time to establish the story. The pace is maintained throughout and this works to the film benefit. The plot involves a crew of astronauts making their way on Mars to repair their equipment. This would all be fine except the ship is damaged during a storm and the astronauts have to stay behind to fix the damaged part. Things quickly become very interesting with the crew trying to make it to Earth before the ship fails completely. There is a real sense of danger during the film and it shows in the cast and the action sequences.   I really enjoyed the movie and it had enough of the originality of the novel to make the film stand out from the crowd. The movie also did not shy away at it's sci- fi aspects and the character work was excellent. There were a couple of flaws in the film that made it feel rushed, but this did not take away from the overall experience.   a good sci-fy movie   The Martian   Production Code: B-   Released: 07/15/2007  Studio: 20th Century Fox   Director: Ridley Scott   Writers: Drew Goddard, Mark Boal, Justin Rhodes  Rating: 5 out of 5  Synopsis: As Mark Watney's

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "There's a lot going on here, which is a lot, considering how little you actually see of the plot in most films. There are all the usual suspects, all the people we have come to expect to meet here: the crazy uncle with a gun, the old wise man who teaches the children a "new" way of looking at the world, the creepy young woman, and the creepy old man. But there's also the mysterious black cat, the small town sheriff, and a gang of bullies with an obsession for "a girl with long hair" that is clearly out of place." -J.K. Rowling. This is a pretty standard story about the bad guy trying to pull the wool over the town's eyes. He's trying to turn the town against his "enemy," who seems to have come from the future. This seems to be a classic plot, but it's far from standard in my mind. This kind of story always seems to fall flat in my opinion. Sure, the kids in the town are the bad guys, but not only are they just trying to survive the cold and the snow, but the townspeople are completely ignorant of what the baddies want to accomplish. Even the villain is trying to get the town to hate his girlfriend. He gets one last chance to change the town by playing the hero. Unfortunately, the hero is so good that they forget their past hatred and work together. It all seems very rushed and a little flat. As for the big bad, he is a very uninspired and annoying villain. He is supposed to be the mastermind, but his personality just isn't very interesting. There's also an odd romance going on between the town sheriff and a young woman who's just trying her best to survive. It was a nice touch and I wish it had been a more prominent story. A few other things I didn't like. First, I felt the scene at the funeral was rushed. The kids and the mother go from bad to worse to worse very quickly, and it feels like the town is being put through the ringer. Second, the movie didn't use the music very well. The music during the scary scenes was a little too creepy and had a bit too much emphasis on "vibrations" (what they call the shaking of the walls in the movie) that was very distracting for me. A little more tension would have helped keep me from falling asleep. Finally, the ending had a very
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It is a masterpiece...a wonderful piece of art...one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen."  I could watch it again and again and find things I love, and things I don't.  It is the story of the two lovebirds (played by Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman), who come from different backgrounds and yet have the ability to understand each other as people.  It is an inspiring story of love and understanding.  This film is such a work of art and the actors are brilliant, but the story is so personal that it really resonates with all of us.  The story is about the loss of one's relationship, the struggle to be loved back, and the discovery that love isn't always what it appears to be.   The film is a story about love, but it isn't so much about one person, or one couple, it is about all people.    If you haven't seen this film before, this is definitely the one you should see.  It is the work of two masters, and if you want to have a great time at the movies you need to see this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My parents bought me this one and I don't know why I didn't buy this back in the day. It is a great little film about the family of a young boy who wants to be a musician but is prevented from doing so by his mother. It's really just a story of love and hope for a young man and his parents, but as a little boy you can't help but be swept up in its joy, warmth and charm.    A few other children's films have touched me since then, like the animated short, The Secret World of Elmo, in my opinion a real gem and a film that is truly loved by all.  There are more wonderful films out there, but these two are some of my favorite of all time. _________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ I saw this a couple of times and enjoyed it at least once. I'm surprised by the low rating because this is not a bad movie. It's a good horror movie. Not a great movie. If you don't want a killer movie, you will not be disappointed. _________________________________________________________ ______________________________ It's not a good flick by any means. But if you enjoy scary movies, you might enjoy it a bit. It also has a pretty good plot and the ending is pretty good. _______________________________ _______________ Wasn't that a great flick? _______________________________________  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mr.K from I didn't really enjoy this.    It's a little slow and boring. It had a great plot, but I couldn't follow it at all. The actors seem to be very good and I thought the music was beautiful. I thought it was a very scary movie. The ending was very creepy. The only thing I don't understand is what happened to the girl. I think she was murdered. Also, I like the art style of this film and the characters looked very unique.   Rating: B-  Review: This is a horror film. It has some really scary moments. You can't really tell where the killer is coming from or how to stop it, but it is still a fun horror film to watch. The movie is rated R, and it is a real shocker. If it didn't have a pretty scary ending, I think it would be a pretty boring film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "Dune" is an interesting and fascinating film. As I've said in my reviews of some of the others, I like to watch a lot of science fiction films in order to get a better sense of what science fiction is and is not about. It would be nice to have a more traditional science fiction story than this, but the film is interesting enough to satisfy most fans of the genre. "DUNE" stars Frank Sinatra as Paul Atreides, the "king of a desert planet. He is a ruler of a peaceful and harmonious people. Paul is a great fighter, but he is a man who loves to drink and to party. He has a secret son whom he keeps imprisoned. In a secret passage of his palace lies a "dune buggy" which is able to travel through the sands of the planet. Paul has taken with him his lover Atreide. The sand is a deadly substance. When Paul is in the sand at the wrong time he could die, but when Atreid is in danger he has a special ability to "stun" or "drown" other people by spraying water on them. When the dust blows back at him he can run away. Paul, like all good kings of the desert, has a small harem of girls who he allows to work as servants. This is not a problem, as Atreids father can afford to take care of them, as well as the other royal families. A major problem of the film concerns the mysterious "Dunes" which have apparently arrived on the planet from a distant planet. These are extremely dangerous to Paul, but also to his people. Atreida is a young and beautiful female, who is not at all afraid of Paul and his men. At this point in the film Paul has been married to the same woman for some years. He tells her that she can keep the secret of his dune buggy, or he will make her do it. He promises that once the film ends he will marry her. She is happy about this, until they get together in the middle of a battle to kill the Dunes. The result is the death of the princess and Paul's disappearance. The remaining members of his harem are then led to believe that he has gone back to the desert where he has hidden the "Dewdrop." The princess tells Atreidas father that she has a plan. She will make an air bubble and create an explosion of sand

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Did you like this _________movie? Let us know it by rating it and commenting on it. Let's talk about this movie and how the director and all the cast did their best to create something really special. The movie was good, but the script wasn't too complex. The story was the one thing that bothered me the most about the movie, which I will explain later in the review.  __________  Movie Review :  The movie follows three friends who are working on a film in the middle of a fire. One of the friends happens to be the director of the film, who makes the decision to stop the movie at a certain point, before the film gets ruined. The director does this because he thinks it will make the movie more interesting, because he wanted to be like his favorite movies, and so he decided to stop it.  it turns out that something strange is going on in the film's production, and a few strange things start to happen that may not be what they seem at first glance. One friend may be the only person on set who is supposed to be mute, while his assistant says that he's mute as well, so that he doesn't get in trouble. The others may seem to be good friends, but there's something else that may come as a surprise. The film is being directed by a character who is a big fan of movies, but his real interest seems to be in a strange film called "The Conjuring" that he watched at the theater one night.    I thought that this movie was not that bad, at first, but after watching some of the later scenes, it was hard for me to watch the movie as it started to get really creepy, and it made me wonder if it was really a dream or something else.  The actors didn't try to be funny, but they tried to be as different as they could to avoid making it too dark, but I thought that the movie didn't really have much of an "event" going on. There was no "bad guy" to fight against. There wasn't a big story arc, just a random and random number of events.  is the biggest problem with this movie, and I can't really blame the director for it, because the script is the only thing that is really important to a movie, so why is it so important to have a good script? I found it really difficult to find the movie funny. It may
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ ___________________________________ In the spring of 1995, after a month-long search, filmmaker Mark Romanek, an amateur filmmaker and editor, and I located the hidden treasure of the ancient Greek theater, the Athenian Theatre. It was hidden behind a wall that had been hastily painted over, revealing the structure and the many secrets within. We set off at night to explore. The Athenian Theater had long been a legend in Hollywood. A story is told in George of the Jungle, where the title character's father, a real Greek, visited the Athenians and discovered the theatre. He spent a fortune in excavating and reconstructing the theater. In that movie, the Greek was played by George Foreman, who was in the midst of a legendary feud with Sylvester Stallone at the time. The truth is that the movie was an epic hoax made by a Hollywood executive who wanted to build a bigger studio on the site. In truth, the movie-maker was Mark Romanick, who made his way to Athens in order to find the real story. Mark Romanoff, who is a friend and assistant of mine, was a co-producer on the movie. I'm sure many people in Hollywood were wondering what had become of the real Athenian, but the truth was that in 1997, the old Athenian was sold to a private collector who made it his personal residence. At the time, the actor who played the part of the actor was an aging actor, and he passed away during construction, when the entire theater was dismantled, to make way for a brand new theater in the town of Grecianapolis. A number of actors, directors, designers and architects came and went during construction. During that time, it became clear that a new and original version of the Atheniean was going to have to be built. In January of 2000, the original Athenieans were painstakingly restored. Once the theater was rebuilt, the real Greek actors returned and brought their acting to the new Atheniea Theater. It is a real honor and a great privilege to bring this movie to movie theaters all around the world. We will be unveiling the movie during the San Diego Film Festival, in June, and will be at film festivals throughout the summer of 2000. For those interested, I have created a web site with film and video trailers and news. I encourage all interested film lovers to visit it. I have a new book that will be released soon that will also
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of months back I went to a screening of the film  Zulu. I did a blog entry about that, which I will link at the end of this review.  It is a pretty good movie, and I like the direction it is going.   I went to see it and it was about the time the trailer was released, so I knew a little more about the film.  And I have to say, I loved it!  I do not know if I would have liked it the same if I had seen it as a new viewer, but it was good to see.  A good movie is not just a story, or a cast, or an opening, or even a plot, it is all those things and then some.  So with that being said, I do want to say that I liked this film a lot.   It started off slow with a lot of quiet scenes.  The beginning was pretty bad, but by the time it started it was actually pretty good.  There were a lot a great performances and I loved most of the performances that I saw.  I was impressed with the film and I can't wait for the sequel.   This movie will surely be in my Top 10 movies for a long time to come.  Here is a review of the movie I saw at the theater: Movie synopsis: The story takes place in the near future, where a new technological race, called 'Zululans', are in the midst of their own technological evolution.  These new Zululan super-soldiers, who are being manufactured on Earth, are given the designation "Rekindled".  For the most part, the film is a look at how the new breed of Zulunians will change the way the world operates, but there is also the personal side of this story.  For example, the story is set in a time when the government is doing their best to keep a lid on the Zulanian phenomenon.  After witnessing the brutality of the new Rekindling soldiers, a young man by the name of "The Master", seeks the help of his father, a retired, retired General.  With help from his father's former aide, "The Lieutenant", the Master and "The Lt" begin to uncover the true nature of the Rekinderlings and a conspiracy to bring them under control.  After being betrayed by both of his fathers,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________Sandra (1/5): This movie has a few good things going for it, the first one being that it's written by a woman who has a lot of experience in writing action movies and who also has a strong emotional range. It's also a pretty good movie. I mean, I didn't hate this movie as much as I expected to. The story was good and the acting was good, but it didn't do much to change my opinion of this movie. There are some things I really liked and some things that I really didn't like about this movie, which is a lot worse. The movie opens in a small house where a little girl is sitting on the steps watching TV. She has a red book, which she doesn't have time to read. Suddenly, a monster pops out of the TV and starts attacking people in the street. The little girl runs out of her house and finds a way home, where she meets up with a man. They end up fighting the monster together, and the man's friends, all of whom have their own reasons for fighting the monsters. It doesn't seem like the little girl can really help any of them, and when the fight turns into a giant monster fight, the little boy takes the monster's side. In the end, they end up saving the town, and everyone who was attacked is saved. After the movie ends, the girl and boy say goodnight to each other. As the little girls goes back to bed, the monster comes in to the house and tries to get her to eat its eyes, but she doesn 't eat the eyes and leaves the house to sleep. The next morning, the woman who writes the little book comes to the little house and the little baby is awake, but only just. The woman takes the baby, tells the baby she loves her, and kisses her. The scene fades to the inside of the house. The mother of the girl goes into the living room and calls out her daughter's name, while the girl, still in her room, looks up to see her mother, who is standing in the middle of the room, smiling at her. She goes back in her bedroom to cry. In a couple of hours, the movie is over, and now I've written a review on the worst movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My girlfriend and I took our daughters, and one of my daughters got sick, so I couldn't go out and see the movie at a normal time. It's worth a few bucks and you get some laughs, but it's not worth the time, the money, or the effort you're put forth when you buy a movie ticket. The best movies are made on a much larger budget, where you're able to see the best special effects and special effects-laden characters in the movie, and you're just as entertained and interested in seeing as much of what's going on as the actors and director. But it just doesn't happen for this movie. I'm not sure that it was the worst movie I've seen (I know that it's possible to find some that I didn't like as much), but I would not recommend it for anyone under 14. The actors were not the best actors, and the story didn't make sense. I would only recommend this to people who are familiar with The Office, or who just don't like people who don't talk or act with a lot of emotion or interest.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** **************************** I know it is called "Dance Fever" but this film has nothing to do with Dance Fever! The Dance Fever is a game, a game for adults to play. This is nothing like the Dance Fever games! The main character is "Polly" and she is trying to become a dancer by "playing" her favorite dance routine to "Piano Man." I don't think Polly's father would approve of her being a dancer. However, as she is a very smart young woman, she is able to figure out that she will not have to go to school and can get a job that she likes. But Polly's dancing will be seen by a group of men who have decided to be dancers as well. Polly's step-mother and her daughter are also dancers and Polly learns some great dance moves to keep up with these guys. Polly is then forced to perform a ballet in front of the whole group of dancers. She makes some great steps and she wins the competition and a job. The film is about a typical young person in the 1960's who wants to make a career in dancing and decides to be a dancer at a ballet school. After getting this job, she finds herself with her step-mom, her sister and her stepfather. The movie is a good, if boring, comedy and this is definitely not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is an excellent movie. It takes a few elements from the best in the genre and blends them into a film that's great fun from start to finish. The film, which was directed by Wes Anderson and co-written by the Oscar-winning screenwriter, has everything that is right about the genre - the film-making, the acting, the writing, the visual effects and of course, the beautiful cinematography. The Grand Budapest isn't your run-of-the-mill genre film as far as plot and action goes - it's set in the very same world of the film The Royal Tenenbaums and it has a lot of similarities to it as well. The grand hotel is home to the most famous hotel in the world - a hotel that has the reputation as the "most romantic hotel in Europe". This hotel has a long history as a venue for great events but when a series of unfortunate events occur that destroy the hotel's reputation and ruin its business, the owner sets about rebuilding it. He also makes a few new acquisitions of various oddities to make the hotel seem a little more normal than it once was. The hotel now stands on the edge of a new and dangerous town - the city of Buda. There's an old school and there's an artsy theatre. There are some pretty big buildings, but the main area of BudA is a very busy shopping and tourist area. The movie takes place in the last few days before the opening of the new hotel. As the new hotels open up and bring more tourists to the city, more people start to disappear. People are disappearing and it's up to the hotel staff and residents to help get to the bottom of it. Some of the people disappearing in the film are not from the hotel but some of them are and it all seems to have an eerie, eerie tone. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's work and love grandiose ideas and gorgeous locations, then The Grand Hotel is definitely worth checking out. I had high hopes that it would be an absolute treat for the senses and would be something I'd definitely watch again - and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was a film of very good quality. It's not the kind of film where the plot gets bogged down in it's own exposition and plot and character development is all but ignored, but it's still a very interesting film in it it's way.  What The Grand Hungary Hotel lacks in action

The only thing is that I can't believe that it's only 95 minutes long. I guess that it was done with only 3 days for the production and the editing time is pretty short. This is a must see. The soundtrack is just as good as the story, so you can hear the sounds that are going on while you're watching the movie. Overall, this is a great movie that I recommend to everyone who likes a good story. If you're a fan of science fiction/fantasy, then this is for you. This movie is worth every penny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My Life in Ruins" is a great movie, with amazing performances, a brilliant cast and some great acting. I was impressed by everyone, especially the actors that took the lead roles. I'm in awe of the production value of the movie, and the movie had a terrific ending! I recommend this film to everyone, but especially to fans of Michael Bay, and Michael Jackson. I've seen the film a dozen times since I first saw it in 1998. I like the movie's story very much and I can't wait to see the movie when it is released next week. "My Life In Ruins" will be one of the great movies of the year. It is a fun and interesting look at what would happen if Michael Jackson had a child with a man named John Kowalski. What I like most about the movie is that it is quite intelligent and there is a lot of depth to the story.  If you don't know much about the events of Michael Jackson's life, you should go into the film knowing a little bit about them. There is a scene in the film that is worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would say this movie is on the short side at only 92 minutes.  It's a good and refreshing take on the "ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings" genre.  There were many scares throughout the film, including a few jump scares.  It would have been nice if this movie had the same "look" to it that The Others did.  However, I'd recommend watching the trailer for this film and thinking "Hey, is that what they're doing?  I wish I had seen this earlier!"  "The Good" The film's primary focus is the "good" and the "evil" spirits that have been seen throughout the story.  This "goodness" (being represented by a white female in a "nice" costume) seems to be very "goody goody" to the point where she is willing to play along with the other ghosts, even going so far as to make a deal that she'll share her powers for free with the "bad" spirits.  The good spirits are also portrayed by three other "goodies" who seem to share her goody-goody characteristics.  They are: a woman in a red dress, a black man in a white hat, and a small black boy.    The "bad," as we'll come to call them in the review, are represented by the white-skinned, "evil-looking" black man.  He is portrayed as a stereotypical "vampire" type of monster who has the ability to absorb energy.   This bad-guy's name is "The Black Man" in the trailer.   It is in the midst of these "good-spirits" that the story's protagonist, Ben, comes to confront his own dark side.  His dark side is represented by an evil spirit of the very same type as "The black man."   His name is Frank (played by a creepy Christopher Plummer) and he is a "voodoo" type spirit of sorts.  Frank takes the form of a small white, demonic-looking man.   Frank can also become invisible to other humans by using his powers of invisibility and disguise, although he cannot see Ben (who he calls "Little John"), who wears white.  Throughout the movie we see a number of ghosts and spirits of the same type from the trailer, including the "White Rabbit" (who wears a red, white, and blue

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Dear Mr. Williams, You are not supposed to be able to see this on the same screen as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This film is so much better than all of the trilogy combined. The Lord or Tolkien has never been a great storyteller, but you don't get that here. The film is not only a great action film, but a wonderful story. The special effects are very real and realistic, the acting is great, the music is great and this film is a lot of fun. This is my 4th time watching this film and it is probably my favorite of all the LOTR films. It is one of the best LOTR movies, no question about it. Thank you for all the help with this movie! Thank you Mr. Nolan! I have to say it, my wife and I have never been more pleased with a movie we've watched in a long time. It's wonderful. Thank You for a fun movie, and for doing it in 3D. Your movie is a masterpiece, and it was fun to watch it, and make the short film I did as well. My wife and myself have been hooked on watching the films for the last year, but I really had to see it on my big screen, I think I will see it a few more times. This was the last Lord of The Rings film, and I've always wanted to see the trilogy, this was a great experience, and if you haven't seen it yet, now is the time to see a movie like this. This story is very good, and you should see it. Thanks again for a good experience! :)  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ (the worst review possible) This movie is the best. It is the only movie I have ever seen that takes the classic horror movie trope of a woman (The Witch) and makes her a woman with an incredibly deep, sympathetic, and sympathetic (even sympathetic) male sidekick. The Witch is a very real person in our world and has to contend with a corrupt government which is trying to take her away (she is the sole hope for humanity at this point). It is hard to watch this movie and not come away thinking this was the best movie ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a classic, an instant classic, and a must see. If you're a fan of B-movies, I would highly recommend this. It's simple and straightforward but there's a lot of emotion and great acting. A little slow at points but worth the time and effort. It would be great to see a remake.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I will start by saying that I had not heard of this film before reading this review. However, it has a decent amount of action, comedy, and suspense. It had me hooked from the very first minute. This film is also interesting because the main character was never seen until very late into the story. So why did she go to the school? Was it because the school was attacked, or is it something else? What was the point of her being there in the first place? There is a lot of questions and questions need answers. But, as with any good movie, the story takes time to make sense. I liked this movie, but the suspense could be very much improved, it was also a little slow. However the characters were good, the acting was good, and the plot was very intriguing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The House by Stephen King. This is not a movie for the faint of heart, but if you are a fan of the works of King and have never seen it, this one will give you a great taste of what it is like to be a Stephen King fan. The movie centers around the events surrounding the death of author Robert W. Chambers. Chambers was working with a group of people and they began to disappear and it came to light they were all victims of a mind controlled killer. This movie has a very disturbing feel to it that is worth watching. You will not want to put this one down. If you want to read a Stephen king book, you are in for a treat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is well-constructed and well-acted.  It does not attempt to explain anything, it is just a well-crafted thriller, with a great plot.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and recommend it to anyone interested.  4 out of 4 stars  (My rating for the movie)
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I enjoyed this film so much. It is such a great follow-up to the last movie. As you could guess it does not start off that well. The characters are not that great to begin with. In fact the story seems to come together as we get to know all the characters better. This is a good thing because I am a bit worried about this film. The story is very simple. A young man (Ralph Fiennes) is a prisoner in his own home. After a terrible car accident he meets a woman (Naomi Watts) who will become his wife. There is a story about their journey as they try to make it to New York City on a raft. This film is very much a character study. The film is filled with a lot of subtle jokes, great characters, and the overall feeling is that you know what is coming. You can see the signs, you see the reasons, you even see the consequences. The actors do a great job in playing these characters. They bring out all of the best in each one of them and make you feel like they are family. I enjoyed watching this film a lot and I hope you do too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You may not like this movie. It was well made. And it was definitely worth the price of admission. The film is set on a post apocalyptic Earth where an alien race called the Reapers have come to destroy the Earth for what reason we don't know. This is a fast paced movie, and the ending is surprising. The cast is fantastic and they brought a lot of the characters to life. It's hard to imagine a world without the Reaper and these people. This film is a must see. The special effects were excellent and the characters are believable. The only thing is the ending doesn't match the rest of the film. It does a poor job at keeping the story going. The Reapers and their leader, the Sovereign, is very poorly portrayed by the film and it doesn't make sense. It could've been a lot better and that was something that this film just can't do. Overall, this is a good, fun, action packed film that will make you wish for more. I'm a sucker for all things alien.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (You can provide a short bio if you'd like, but we all know you've seen it)  The Movie (5/5)  "There is no one that can stop you now."  My first experience with this director, I'd heard nothing but praise for his movies, and in fact I'd just watched his last movie with some friends. This one had no problem making me feel like the only one left in the world. It was a great film, I had no idea what I was going to see until I saw the trailer, and I was blown away. This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. He really took this franchise from a low budget horror movie with a very simple premise, and turned it into something far more enjoyable. I love the gore, the violence, and the overall theme that this film brings.  For a sequel I would say it was better, but I have no idea. The only thing I will say, is that the first film in the franchise was absolutely brilliant, so I'm glad that they had the chance to make a sequel to something that could have been so much more. It wasn't just the same story, but a whole new spin, and one that was still enjoyable. .  the film has a lot of gore in it, some of it not very good, but there were some nice sequences. I can't believe I'm recommending this to anyone, and while I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, you should at least give it a try, if nothing else it's an action packed movie that I would suggest anyone that enjoyed the first to go out and see. -C-  .

The story of a little girl who was put in a foster home for being abused by her step father is so realistic that it really touched me. My favorite parts were the two ending scenes, the first being the foster mom and her husband leaving the home, the second being the little girl's mother, who got emotional as she saw the foster mother leave. The two ending parts really showed the sadness that the little child was feeling. It was sad but it had a good end. The movie really made me sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It is the story of a woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who gets an offer to spend the night with a mysterious man (Robert Stack), who tells her he has been studying her, and tells her there are four people in her life who would love to have a night alone with her, if she would give him the money for the train ticket, and the keys to the house where she lives.  The plot is very simple, the only twist is the fact that he offers her to be his girlfriend (if she agrees to be "in charge"), she refuses, and he keeps on pressuring her to get his money. .  "The Man Who Couldn't Breathe" is not a typical suspense movie. It is more like a thriller, the action starts out slowly, and then explodes like a gun blast, but it is still not suspenseful because it is so fast paced, we cannot figure out what is going on.   I give this movie 2 stars because the story is interesting, the suspense is not very real, it does not feel like a horror movie. This is a horror story, and most of the suspense comes from the characters. But it was worth the watch, and very well acted and directed. The actors are very good, but they are a little bit overdone. The music is not that bad, but the sound effects are not very good. I gave this movie 1 star out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  Cameron Crowe is a true artist. He makes you feel so much love, and when he makes love to the audience, it makes you fall in love. Crowe created the movie, but you, the audience was the main star. Cameron Crowe made a movie that you can remember fondly for all time. This is the story of our heroine and it is as real as you can get. A tale of a woman and her friends who all want to escape into the woods one evening, but a strange car has been spotted on the road and the group decides to investigate. The film follows the girls from start to finish, and at every point you are caught up in the action, the comedy, and the romance. Cameron's direction is top notch, the characters are rich and the humor is very enjoyable. His performances are flawless. His characters are believable, and if you are a fan of the movies, you will not be disappointed with this movie. If you're a fan, you may want to check this movie out, it is an amazing film and an amazing way to show the real side of the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film stars Daniel Craig (who also co-stars in it with fellow Bond actress Monica Bellucci), and was directed by the man who gave us Casino Royale, Skyfall, Spectre, The Woman in Black, and Live and Let Die. We are introduced to the villain, a man who calls himself "The Red Dragon". He has just taken over a small kingdom on the west coast of England, and has made the people of the kingdom believe that he is a dragon. He has even taken over the British royal family and has been murdering them one by one for months. He's the bad guy of the piece. But Craig isn't the only one making a good Bond. Daniel Craig was actually born as a male, and is now a woman. He plays Bond for the first time in the film, and he actually has an excellent turn. He brings a sense of gravitas to his performance. He was really impressive, and a lot of people praised him as the best Bond ever. So it's a good thing that the film works as a whole. It is a well-written film that has a very interesting plot that takes place in England, England, Ireland, Italy, and Spain. It's a lot to keep track of, and it's not a particularly fast paced film, but the acting is good and the scenes are exciting. The film is interesting because it is very different from all the other Bond movies, as it deals with a character from before the time of the films, but there are some similarities. One of the major differences is that the villain in this film, who is really, really bad, is actually a man, but with a female body. The villain, who has taken over an entire kingdom, is really evil, and the other characters in this piece are a lot like our characters, though they are now in a slightly different place. It isn't a bad film by any means, and I personally found it a lot more enjoyable than other Bond films, which are really, honestly, terrible. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Bond, or has ever wanted to be Bond. ___________ Watch Online: The Film
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My name is Jon, I am a 19 year old from California. I have seen and love all the Spiderman movies up to this point. I love his role as Spiderman. He is like a father to Peter Parker and like Peter I love that he keeps trying to do the right thing and make the best of life. I just thought about the many times he went through dark days or just trying to have fun. This movie shows us just what it is to be Spiderman and how he keeps his faith and the ones he loves and how that is sometimes more important than the lives we all are forced to sacrifice to have that fun. I think this is a great film and I really hope it will inspire more people to go see this wonderful and funny Spiderman film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I've seen a couple of these, so I'm pretty familiar with the genre. This is a story about two young women in love who meet at a funeral and get a little lost in their own personal Hell. _________________________________________ It has been my experience that most horror movies take place in one of two places: 1) the house, and 2) the basement. I'm not too sure about the basement in this particular movie, but that's just a personal choice. _________________ The film follows four friends who are all in love with the same girl. One day a man named Charlie kills his ex-girlfriend and then decides to marry her. Then, when they realize they're no longer in love, they all begin to do some digging into the events of the day they met. The results are quite disturbing, in the extreme. ______________________________________________________________________________ What does it all mean? That's a question I don't know, because I don of course know nothing about this movie. However, I can say that the film is based on a true story that took place in the 1970s.   The movie starts out slow enough, but then, when things get weird, it gets really fast. There's one part of the movie that actually made me laugh out loud. It's one of the more disturbing moments of the entire movie.  It was hilarious! The story is good, and if you haven't seen it, you really should. It has a lot of heart.  I enjoyed the movie a lot, and I think it will have you rolling around in your chair for a good long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Share:  Bruno, a young boy, moves to an isolated island in a bay. He doesn't know the people on the island but he wants to make friends. The first day, a hurricane hits the island. When the kids are playing in the sea, they are killed by the storm. Bruno decides to try to make the island like the island on Earth. But as the years pass, Bruno is growing up and he decides to build an airplane and travel to the moon. He goes to the ship, it's loaded with bananas, but he can't fly. So, he flies on a banana raft, with two turtles as passengers. In order to escape, he will have to find the secret that made the island possible.  I thought this movie was really funny. There is no music, just some sound effects and the sound of a cat scratching a banana. This film has a very simplistic approach to the movie and that really helps it to stand out. When we saw a banana, the sound effects were used as a metaphor. But then, when Bruno flew in his banana raft into the moon, he used the sound as a reference to the sound and the way it sounded when he was on the raft. The way the film makes you think. The soundtrack is really simple but makes you remember the sound the way the banana was scratching the bananas.  the film is so simple but the fact that the music is so strong at times. The movie is so short but it's so good. I think it would make a perfect movie to watch during a boring afternoon. The music is perfect for the movie. You can really feel the music when you watch this movie. It is also a little bit funny, like with a comedy with a twist. The twist is that there are actually two different versions of the story. When Bruno flew into the Moon, there was a small island. In this version of the movie, the banana island was also on a small beach. But in the film that Bruno flies to the Moon in, it is an island in the middle of a bay, which is separated from the beach by a big wall. This makes me think that they don't want us to know exactly which island Bruno lives in. He also has two pets. Bruno has two friends who help him out in his adventure. They are named Tug and Swish. They help Bruno to learn to fly, while he helps them to learn how to

We loved it so much.  It was the first time in a long time we saw the Goonies in the theater. The characters were like siblings to us. We are really glad we went. I hope they can do another film. The only complaint we have is that the kids get stuck on one scene a lot of times. They have to pause it, watch it again, and then they get stuck. We also felt like we were watching another movie. I know it has only been around a year, but I hope it is made into a tv show. It's such a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband had to wait until the last minute for this movie to come out in the States, so we took the trip to the Philippines. While there we had a great time with the kids, seeing their friends, and going to some of the local sights.  What was your favorite part? The story! It's a great story that follows the kids as they try to escape the evil of the evil factory that's threatening to destroy the world. It had lots of comedy and adventure. The best part of the movie was seeing the kids run around the jungle and make their own games with the local animals. The art is very realistic and well made. The jungle was colorful and cool. The animation was good. The movie has a lot of fun moments.  There were some scary moments that happened throughout the movie. The film was fun and good. What did you like best about this movie?  The ending of the film was really funny. The kids make it to the final battle of the day and they win it. That's pretty funny. It also was very cool watching their friends fight each other as they tried to find the secret door.  The art style was also very interesting. This film uses a lot more traditional Chinese characters that are very different from the characters seen in other cartoons and films. It adds a little more depth to the movie and adds to the experience.  I loved seeing their faces during the fight scenes. I'm pretty sure that all of the characters were drawn by the same person.  Overall this movie was a good watch with great characters and a great animation style. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a good action adventure or kid's movie with a strong story.

(Photo by Richard Corkery/Invision/AP) The Postman always Rings Twice :       "The Post Man Always Rings Two Times" was a pretty good movie for the year it was made — 1998 — and for many years after. "It's a fantastic story, with some great performances, and it feels like it could be a timeless classic," says critic Ken Tucker. "That's a great problem to have — and in my opinion, it's a problem that Hollywood is in the midst of solving."  The screenplay for "The Revenant" has been around since 2006, but had not yet been made into a movie when "The Dark Knight" was released in 2008. "You think it'll never happen again," producer Harvey Weinstein says of that movie, "but you'd be wrong. It was great. It's one of the great films in history."  toon of a man who is forced by an avalanche of injuries to survive in the harsh wilds of the Alaska wilderness with a teenage girl (Rosamund Pike) in tow. But the movie's real hero is a man with a sword, not a sled dog. It took nearly 15 years to finish. But after the first film, director Alejandro González Iñárritu set out to create a sequel. He assembled a crew that included "Tron: Legacy" scribe Eric Heisserer (who is writing the third "Titanic"), and a handful of filmmakers including "The Mist" director Peter Straub. "I thought, 'This is a sequel, this is a horror movie, it has to be about survival and the environment,' " says IñÆlez I.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ So, I did this movie after I watched this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1284209/?ref_=nv_sr_1 I have read all the reviews and they all seem to be very positive. So I hope that if you read this that you will like it. I don't want to give any spoilers so if you want to read some of the reviews, that is fine. If not, go ahead. The movie is called "The Great Gatsby". It was made in 1925 by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The main character is the rich man Nick Carraway who meets his destiny, he falls in love with a rich girl Daisy. The whole movie is told through Nick's eyes. He is writing his great book and his best friend is his narrator who is also the only other person he talks to. He goes from day to day and night. He has all these dreams and they seem to change into reality. When Daisy asks him what is his life about, he tells her it is about making the best of it. There are some other characters like the beautiful Daisy who plays piano and the other young ladies (including a gorgeous girl) who also like the great Nick. There is a lot of drinking, drugs and partying. He doesn't have much money, but he is a great talker. So you go from day one of the movie to the other. The ending makes you cry. There were also some scenes that were just too fast for me. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of 16. I really hope this movie is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ The story of a guy who lives alone with his cat, and how she helps him overcome his loneliness. It's got a pretty unique premise for a comedy, which I enjoyed. It isn't a bad movie by any means, but it's probably not something I would recommend. The pacing is pretty slow, and there are times when I thought the movie wasn't trying to be funny. It works just fine if you're into that sort of thing. The soundtrack is pretty good and fitting to the tone of the movie, but that's about it. There are moments where you will appreciate it. Overall, though, it isn't something I can see myself enjoying. I guess it would be better if it had more jokes or something.  Helpful to be serious, but I wouldn't say this is a good one. There is nothing particularly funny about it, and it doesn't make much sense. There aren't any great lines in it, there are a lot of awkward and awkward sequences in the story. It is fairly slow paced, but the story is pretty interesting and well written. It also has a bit of an undertone of romance. It might not be for everyone, but if you like movies with odd premise, or you like to hear more of your partner's thoughts and feelings, then give it a shot. It won't be anything to write home about, but definitely worth a try if you've got some time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Boys on the Bus was not your typical boy band. It wasn't as if they were coming off of their recent hit, "Bad Religion" or "Weezer" or some other commercial, but the members of the group were still young. When I first heard the song, I was immediately hooked by the infectious, almost punkish beat of the song. The first track off of the record, "I Got You Babe", was the first track I heard that got my attention. The vocals of the boys themselves are good enough that I can get behind them. The group has a good variety in their sounds, but that isn't what makes them interesting. They were more memorable because of the music and the energy that each member brings to the stage. This is what they are about. The energy and the group of the guys have such a good chemistry together that they get into each other's faces and the music just seems to flow with them. I can imagine being in the audience for the show and just dancing along. I love the energy of the band and their enthusiasm to get in front of the crowd and play for them. If they can keep it up, I think we are in for some great music and a great group of guys in the near future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pierrot le Fou (1883) is one of the most beautiful films ever made, and possibly the most well-realized.  It is a story about a young girl, Marie Antoinette, who marries into the imperial court and falls under the spell of a young count, Count Pierre.  She is a young woman, and when the king is captured by his enemies, she becomes a political prisoner.  Marie Antoine and Pierre have the same name, and she has to choose between her own happiness and her love for him.  The film was made in three parts, and it was considered revolutionary because it was about an enslaved woman, but it wasn't.  As I watched Pierrot le fou, I remember thinking, "what's so revolutionary about this film?"  It isn't about the film itself, because its a wonderful piece of art that doesn't need any more revolutionary status than that given by the title.  What makes Pierrot Le Fou so fascinating is what's inside its own head.  That's the thing about the brain.  Just as a movie needs to be able to tell us something about the characters, a film needs to tell the story about the inner workings of the mind of the characters.  Pierrot makes the claim that the film is a film about a woman whose thoughts are more important than her desires, a woman who cares more about her husband than herself, a wife who doesn't like her husband but loves her children, and a woman with the self-denying wish that she and her husband will be together.  This is why the film resonates with me and resonates so strongly with women.  A woman who is strong in her choices and who doesn`t let her self-centeredness get in the way of those choices is so different than the woman who can be led around by anyone and is easily swayed by anyone.  And the woman in this film is in no way a villain.  Her actions in this story are driven by her own desire for freedom, and we get to see her as the real hero in this picture.  If this movie is about a man, it is about how he reacts to a woman's actions.  But Marie is such an amazing, complex, complex and beautiful woman.  We feel for her because she feels the same way for us.  I think that this is why I find the movie so beautiful.  When I watch the film, I
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* This movie is the first time I saw the late great John Wayne. I haven't had a chance to watch a lot of his movies but this was the first one that I saw and was amazed at how his voice sounded as well as how good the movie was. It's a shame that most of the movies that he was in were of the western genre as most of them were too cheap to be taken seriously. It was a bit of a bummer that he didn't make more films though as he was a great actor. He also did great action scenes. Great movie, watch it!  A bad movie but a must see movie. The late great actor John Wayne plays the villain in this film. It is set in 1920's Hollywood. Wayne's character is the ruthless crime lord who does not give a damn about anything. His plan is to kill a young girl in Hollywood and sell her to the highest bidder. However, things take a turn for the worse when a bounty hunter named Lillian (played by Elizabeth Taylor) tracks down his whereabouts and confronts him. Unfortunately, Wayne doesn't realize she is his old lover and tries to kill her. Lillian manages to get away and heads into the Los Angeles area to take him down. However she is betrayed by Wayne and she is forced to flee back to Europe, to the place where all of her old lovers are waiting for her. Written by John Oswalt

This movie is as close to a perfect horror movie as I can think of. The acting is great, and every scene is just a masterpiece. This is a very well made movie and it's very well acted. The movie is very well paced. Every time you watch it you will have something new and interesting to look forward to. This has to be one of the best horror movies of the year!

The music was so good and I really loved the performances. This is the first movie that I ever saw with Daniel Radcliffe as a lead and I had no idea what to expect, especially since I had been told that I wouldn't be seeing a lot of "Harry Potter" in my lifetime. The movie wasn't great, but it's not a terrible movie either. It's not my favorite Harry Potter movie, but I really liked the movie. I found it fun and well acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ It is the only movie I saw on the new release DVD, and it made it feel like a good one. It is not really one of the better "action" flicks out there, but it has its moments. I think if they had more time to put into it it would have been a better movie. The writing is a little too long, so it takes a while to really get to know who the characters are and where they come from. I felt the movie would have benefitted from the addition of a storyboard, or if you have not seen any of the films on the disc, I highly recommend checking out the storyboard (seen at 6:30). As it is, it is good, but not quite up to the greats.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first of three films featuring the likes of Bruce Willis, Sean Penn, and Sigourney Weaver, I Am Legend is a thriller featuring an older couple and a young woman (played by Weaver) who arrive at a small resort in California to find that the owner has taken the lives of his wife and their children. The only way for the two to escape is to go on a killing spree with the help of a mysterious character named Jack. They will have to kill as many of their guests as they can before the resort closes down. The film also stars Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, and John Hurt. I Am Legion (2012) is a fantasy film which follows a mercenary as he has to go through a series of tests in order to get into a military academy. He starts off strong until things get weird with the school teacher who tries to kill him. His only defense is a pair of magic wands. The final of the three films which was written by Sam Raimi and has Tom Cruise as the lead, is a horror film that sees a pair as they try to find their missing friends. One of the most impressive things about these films is how they manage to maintain a high level of suspense even though the audience is aware that something isn't quite right.    _________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember when I first saw this movie, I wasn't too thrilled about it.  Then I realized that if you take the story and character development to a whole new level, it becomes something totally different. ___________________________________________________________ Now I can only say that this is a GREAT movie, and for me, it's the best thing that has come out of the 90's. ____________________________ G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra - 5 out of 5 If the name G.I Joe: Rise of the Cobra wasn't a little too long, let's just say that it is my all time favorite cartoon series of all time.  I've been a fan of this series since I was in elementary school and I've actually got more of a connection to this series than any other cartoon I've ever seen.  There's nothing wrong with G.R.O.C. and the original Cobra, but Cobra Commander?   He is a guy who has his life turned upside down.  He's been a top dog in his unit, working with Cobra Commander, a legendary military commander.  But now, everything is falling apart for Cobra Commander.  When the leader of his unit goes AWOL and starts causing trouble, Cobra Commander knows it's time to step up his game.  And that's exactly what Cobra Commander does.   Cobra Commander, his friend Iron Hand, and his loyal men, join forces with Cobra Plunderer, a new Cobra Commander-clone.  The plan is simple, the bad guy wants Cobra Commander's face, so he's going to destroy the country of America.  Of course, when Cobra Commander and Iron Hand get involved, the results could be completely different. As far as action, this one is pretty good.  With Cobra Commander leading the charge, the Cobra Plunger, a huge battle tank, and a couple of helicopters, the movie looks and plays just like a cartoon.  If you're a fan, you're going to have a blast. The movie does have a couple problems with it. First off, there are way too many characters.  This isn't a movie that you can watch for the story, but if you like the cartoon, then you're in for a treat.  You can easily get lost in Cobra Commander because he has all these characters. And second, the story is a bit of a mess.  Sure, the guy
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The Best Of (1951) - The greatest American western. This is one of the very few American movies ever made which is actually funny, despite what a lot of people say. The actors all did very well. It is a simple story of a bandit group and their chief, who are captured by a man in the mountains. The main character is captured by the chief's brother. They are then sent to the chief who refuses to release them unless they promise him one thing. The chief gives his life for the bandit, but they must kill his wife if they are to be released. As a result, the band of bandits are freed. The band has to fight their way through the mountains to freedom. This movie is very much based on a novel by Richard Condon, which is a great book. I read it while I was in the army.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pickup on the Road (1948) - One of the best westerns ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Bad movies are all alike, and all alike are bad. There's not much you can do about that. And even though I was so looking forward to this film, I have to say that I don't think it will be remembered as a "bad" movie. Sure, it's a movie that can only be described as "meh", but I also really enjoy these types of movies. Some films can be just really "mehs" but that is not the case here. The movie is mostly very enjoyable, and even though there's the "mehh" factor, it never gets old. The cast does a great job and I loved how they played it in a funny way. In the end, this movie is pretty cool. I will probably watch it again in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Girl from South Africa" is very nice. It was my first time seeing a film by the wonderful director, Steven Soderbergh (director of "Ocean's Thirteen" and "Traffic"). I liked his movies and thought that this one was a good one. There was a story, but it didn't get too complex. I don't think it is too complicated to follow. The acting was good and I didn't find it so annoying as I did in "Crimson Tide" (see below). It is more like the acting in the "Ocean" films. However, the music was very nice and I thought it was a better choice than in "Traffik" ( see below ). "The Girl From South Africa"" I liked it! It is very good. Very well acted and I liked the music. One of my favorite movies from this year and I hope that Soderbegh will make more movies like this one in the future. Here is another movie to watch! Seth Rogen and James Franco are in it! A very good movie. Sarabande is quite interesting. A good, well produced movie.

For years I have been searching for a movie that would take place in the late 1800s or early 1900s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'd say that "The Big Lebowski" is the best movie I have ever seen. It is like "The Great Escape" but with a lot of comedy and is more intelligent. When I saw this film I immediately thought of John Waters and thought "this is exactly what he wants us to think". "The Dude" is like a crazy old hippy. He's so cool and witty. I thought that there was a lot more going on than the first two movies but I never got that far. "The Lying Game" is a very well made movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously and instead goes back to the beginning. I never understood why this film had to have the lead characters lie in the first place but if you want to try to see "The Devil Wears Prada" then I suggest you do. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later is the best movie I have seen this summer. It is the summer we have been waiting for since 2008. It takes its cue from a summer classic and it delivers as a fun, exciting ride filled with fun people and awesome performances. While the summer is still young and new ideas are constantly being hatched to try and take it to the next level, this movie is the proof that the summer will not slow down anytime soon. The Best Movies of 2015 (So Far): The Raid: Redemption – I have to say I am a huge fan of James Wan's The Raid franchise. While they started off pretty rough for the studio, The Raid had some really good moments and the performances in this film were fantastic. It was a much more action driven film than the first two, which was a nice change of pace.  Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice – Another superhero film that has brought in huge buzz. I enjoyed this film more than Suicide Squad. The cast was great and I enjoyed the fact that there was some character development.  In conclusion, this was the most enjoyable film of the year so far.  Watch it. It will be a great experience and you may not be disappointed.  I will definitely be back to watch some more of these soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man with the Golden Arm" is one of those classic war films that should have been a major film of its day. With the huge successes of the "Rambo" films, "The Man With the Golden Gun" has been a box office giant for years. This time, the film's director, Akira Kurosawa, takes us on a journey from the frontlines in the European theater of World War II, right up to the final days at the end of the war. I think that anyone who has watched the movie or even the previous "Man with the Gold Arm," should at least give this one a try. "The Men Who Stare at Goats" -  An American soldier, Harry Kellar, who was in the Pacific theater, is sent back to the United States to assist with an experimental atomic bomb that is being tested on a large farm at Sandia. The farmer's daughter, Jane (Cherry Jones) and her two sons, Max (Peter Fonda) and Pete (John Candy), are the target of the test. While at the farm, Harry finds the farm hands talking about the test and how it will affect their future. The men also talk about how they are all related to each other. Harry begins to believe that this farm is the "mother of all men" in the world, and is convinced to leave the farm to find out for himself.  "Pompeii" -   The story takes place in the late 19th Century at Pompeii, Italy. During an expedition to a small hill on the outskirts of the town, two men, Lt. George Gordon (Bruce Dern) and Pvt. Walter (Tom Courtenay) are buried alive during a massive landslide. The survivors survive and are able to make it to a farmhouse. There, the surviving soldiers are able tell each other where they are going and where they've been. After a chance meeting with a young man, they are able find each other and find that they are brothers. After meeting a young girl, they decide to leave Pompeii and embark on a long journey to another civilization. The Golden Child -   The story is told from the point of view of a young boy, who lived on a small farm near Naples, Italy and was raised by his mother, a wealthy widow. This young boy was an only child and would often sit around the farm with the others. The story begins when he meets

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A good movie is usually more than its share of the fun. I've heard people say that they don't like comedies. I know that that's not true for me. What is true for most is that, when I go see one, I usually enjoy it very much. That's what makes a good comedy and a bad one bad. My favorite comedian is Eddie Murphy. I loved his films. I wanted to learn more about him, and he has always been very gracious about that. I recently saw his last movie, The House Bunny. I was blown away by it. It was just about the funniest movie I've ever seen and he had the best scenes in it. I hope we get to see him again soon, hopefully soon. I'll give him a big "thank you." I also like to laugh. Not at stuff I like. But when people don't understand something, it's hilarious. Like this one time at a party when someone tried to explain a joke to me, I didn't get it and started laughing. So I was saying, "I don't get this" and my friend was laughing. I didn?t get what he was talking about, I said, "what's this?" He went on about this "you're a funny guy" thing. And I said I?m not funny, I? m not funny at all. I had to go. I still don't know what he's talking about. But it was hilarious. (I also like old school comedies.) I liked A Bronx Tale. I like Goodfellas. And The Jerk. I'm into The Jerker. (It's not as funny as it used to be. The writer has gone off his rocker.) I love the new one by John Waters, It Follows. And a lot of John Waters? movies. And the great Woody Allen. And Martin Scorsese. And so on. And on. I really like Woody Allen, I do. There?s nothing he couldn't do. In fact, he has done all these amazing things and he?s my hero, even though I don?t understand some of his movies. (There is this one movie where he did a whole thing with a guy who made people come out of their dreams and stuff, but when you looked at the director's cut, it was all real. That?s why it got so many awards for best director, but I didn

I mean, look at the ending. It is terrible. The script is so ridiculous and the acting is just plain terrible, I am not going to waste my time watching this film. If it was made by someone else, you would have seen better. I would say, if you do not have much to lose, wait until it is on DVD, or buy a copy of the book that inspired it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was fun, and a good lesson on what can happen when an artist is on their own for a long time. The script was great. And the acting from all the main characters was great! The only characters I disliked was the guys from the group called "Frog and Toad" (Dana, Tom and Carl). The story line seemed pretty stupid in the beginning, but once I got into it, I was amazed. They did have an interesting story line, but then I realized that it wasn't. There was an event that they were supposed to get a new frog character created (a frog that was supposed to help get them in the black market business), but the guy from the Frog and Toad group, and Carl, made the character ugly. And they had to hire a new artist to do the character and he wasn't good looking either. I was pretty disappointed, but the character is still fun and memorable. I didn't find any comedy to this movie, but there was a lot of heart. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been some really great movies over the years, but I don't know that I could ever remember any that I've ever been absolutely ecstatic about.  I'm going to give my review the benefit of the doubt and say that "A Clockwork Orange" is one of those movies that was just a little bit too much for me at the time, but now that I think about it, it's probably one of the top ten best movies of all time (and that's not even considering all of the films that preceded it).  It's one of only a handful of movies that I remember being just a bit too dark and twisted.  A Clockwork and Pauline are in a bar in London.    I'm not sure exactly where this bar is.  Now that I say that, I'm probably going to have to add "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to the list of films that make me shudder.  I was born in 1986, so I was 10 years old when "A Room with a View" came out, so my initial impression of the film was that it was like "Jaws" in that it made me very fearful of the ocean.  It has very strong seasickness, as you can imagine, so after seeing it, I tried to avoid the ocean as much as possible.  Fortunately, I didn't do too badly... at least for the first couple of days.  However, after a couple of weeks, my fear began to dissipate.  There are a lot of movies in which I have been terrified of the sea.  "The Godfather", "The Shining", "Raiders of the Lost Ark" are all films that have made me nervous of the oceans, and all of these films were probably made during the height of the "Great Fear" of the nuclear bomb.  This movie definitely got me more frightened of the seas, although I've been on board submarines for most of my life.  But I'm sure that this isn't the only movie where I'm afraid of the water.  For example, in "Hustle & Flow", I'm terrified of swimming in the ocean because of the danger of drowning.  In "The Muppet Movie", I had a fear of water, and I think that's the film that first made me think about the dangers of water that I have today.  The other two films I mentioned before also probably had a part to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is another excellent example of a great story and a good performance from John Turturro as the protagonist, the son of the former Deputy Director of the FBI James J. Woods. "My best friend's mom is a cop and my dad is the head of the F.B.I." You'll know what this movie is like when you see it because its title will remind you. I'll be honest. I didn't want to go see this movie after seeing the trailers and trailers for some of the previous Woods films. When I saw the movie, I thought that it was one of those movies that you'd love to hate but you can't because the performances are great. It is a great looking movie. I liked John T. Thornton's ( The Firm ) performance as the tough guy but his character was much more than that. The real star of the movie is John Tulloch ( The Hunt ) as the F-bomber pilot who makes the right decision and decides to take out his nemesis ( and his father ) at a vital time. He's played by Tom Berenger ( The Bourne Ultimatum ). This movie was a pleasure to watch. I'm going to watch it again because John T, Thornton and Berengar do a great job. - June 19, 2015Great Movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a wonderful movie.  I think the cast of the film, especially Jeff Bridges, are wonderful.    It is a very fast paced movie.   If you like fast paced movies like I do, you will love this movie.     I gave this a 7/10.   "The Man Who Wasn't There" is the film about a man who is called as the witness of a murder.  It has a similar plot as "The Biglebowski".   The only difference in "The Man who wasn't there" is that the main character isn't as lucky as his partner.  He is called a witness of the murder of a man named George.  The movie is funny, the lead actor, Peter Farrelly is funny and his girlfriend is pretty hot.  This is a great movie for those who like to watch something funny and is not too dark.   I gave it a 4/5.     I think I have covered all the movies that I liked and disliked.  They are great movies and there are some that I don't know if I will like.  I loved the movies I liked the most.  If I had to choose one out of the ones I disliked, I would pick "The King's Speech".  I have seen it and liked it, but it was not a perfect movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) A new martial arts epic by the great Zhang Yimou from the early 90's, the story centers around Zhang's character, a young Chinese master who is torn between his family's traditionalism and the traditional way of the martial arts and who seeks to use his family wealth to change his culture to one that emphasizes the former over the latter. Zhang gives us a great character, one that we can relate to for his struggles, one we can admire for his fighting prowess and one who is an extremely likable person. The film follows the life of this young master through the course of his training and finally to the final battle with his old rival who is the villain of the piece. The movie is so fast paced and so exciting that it is one of the most action packed and fun martial arts films I have seen. Zhang Yi plays this character to perfection, making him such an exciting fighter with all of his skill and all of the emotional turmoil he goes through on this journey. I cannot say enough good things about the film; it is a perfect mix of action and drama and so full of story and emotions that it may be the most complete of all of Zhang Yidou's films, if not the best.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   GODDAMMIT! THE FIRST REVIEW IS DONE!  What I really think I wanted to talk about in this film is how the whole town is obsessed with their family's death and the reason why is because the whole film is about the characters trying to prove that their family was not the killer. I really feel like the entire movie is the family trying to get back what is theirs. I am not a fan of that type of story line. I always like the fact that you have a reason why this person or people is doing what they are doing. This is the reason.   The characters:  This is where the movie is not great. I do not think the characters are believable at all. The main character, Kevin, does not like people, he likes his own family. Kevin is very selfish and seems to have no friends and I don't believe that is him. The people he likes seem to also be very nice to him, like their names are also the same. I felt like he really didn't like anyone else. The love interest in the film, a beautiful lady, was kind of annoying to me. She has her own agenda and I did not get why she was so interested in Kevin. I think she probably liked him because he was the only male in the town. I didn't really like the whole idea of having a love interest when your only friend is someone who you are trying to keep at an arm's length.  . I feel like a lot of the people Kevin is friends with are not really liked by the film at all and they feel very little like a part of the plot.  Kevin's mother was very different from her husband's character in this movie, she is not in it for the money and she has a very strong character of herself, which I felt a lot like in the movie and that really is what is interesting about it. I thought the love interest was very unnecessary to the plot in this one. I would not mind if they had just made a whole other love interest for the main character and then made it a romantic comedy.   the main plot:  I feel this is a very boring and not very interesting film. I mean the only thing I really like about the film is the main antagonist, but that is just a facade. He was in a lot more trouble in the first half of the movie then when the film started in the second half. I wish he
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was really good. I'm not much of a fan of the Alien franchise, but this one made me go, "wow". There are tons of great scenes, and the script is good. The director did an excellent job of making the alien look creepy, alien-y, and menacing. And I loved how you could get a great sense of scale from it. I wish there was more to this movie, but I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (5/10) This film is great. The main character is great, and the story is really cool. There's also a fun, cool, interesting ending that just seems to fit the film perfectly. But that is what I find most interesting about this movie; the fact that it can be a very solid movie if one knows how to approach it. This is the most realistic, and realistic movie I've seen in quite some time. There is no one-dimensional villain, and I found that most of the antagonists were actually more likable than the main character. One of the best features of this movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack was great, it fits the film, the music is unique and fitting for the story. If you like a good, action-packed movie, this is a great one. If your looking for a serious, character-driven movie, then this isn't for you. Overall: 9.7/10 The only major complaint I had was that I was unable to properly comprehend how the alien found its way into our world. The story is so convoluted that it's hard to understand how something like this could have even happened. But what really bothered me about this was the fact it had very little to no character depth. I know I said I had a love for this movie, but I don't feel like any character in this story is as fascinating or interesting as any of the other characters in the movie. There really is not one character that I could really get behind. And that's a good thing because this is really a one-trick pony. There were not very many interesting scenes or moments throughout the movie, and even though the ending is cool, it just does not fit the story and the characters. I will give this movie another go but I just don't think I could get into the story that much. So maybe I should just look at a more realistic sci-fi movie.

It is an absolute masterpiece and it should be in every cinemas across America. It's just a beautiful film, so many good performances, a fantastic story, and amazing performances throughout. It feels like you're going through the same day over and over again, but never really feel the time passing. The performances are all on point and are absolutely spot on. Every single character is played by great actors and they really sell the emotional journey we go through during the film. The script was also spot on, with very little repetition. The ending is also incredibly touching and makes the film that much better. If you're looking for a great comedy, look no further. If it wasn't for the amazing screenplay, I would have given this one a 4 star, but it deserves that 4 star. I can't wait for the inevitable Oscars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In The Room, director and writer Tommy Wiseau (A Serious Man) introduces his own idea of a movie: a surreal horror/thriller/romantic comedy, set in his own insane home. In this case, Tommy has created a nightmare and then is trying to get rid of it. It's an over-the-top mess that tries to be funny, which it mostly isn't.  But Wiseau is a genius. He knows how to get to the heart of the matter with the audience. He uses the audience's laughter and amusement as fuel. There is a dark, but hilarious sense of humor that goes way beyond the joke to make you laugh out loud. When you find yourself laughing out loud, you aren't laughing at a joke. You are laughing at Tommy Wise  Wiseau's story is a bit of a long one and the film could have been more intense. But the director does a great job of cutting to the chase to show the audience the plot and characters without taking up more of the screen. ,  The Room's only weakness is that the acting and writing are mediocre. All of the characters look and act like they are trying too hard and the actors seem to be on top of their game. But that doesn't stop the film from being an entertaining and well-made, if absurd and surreal nightmare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Giant" is a story about a young girl named Tiana, who becomes fascinated with the giant spider-like creatures that inhabit her local forest. The story goes something like this. A man named Frank who works on a construction project finds an unusual spider (we think it is an orb weaver). He brings it to his boss and the two decide to bring it home to Frank. The spider is found to be an unusual looking creature. In a state of distress Frank decides to leave it behind and take it home. The next day he finds the spider in his house. He tries to get rid of it but it won't leave. The following day Frank is back and manages to get the spider back home. He finds that the spider has grown larger. Tiana is very worried and runs away from home. She goes on a search for the spider and finally finds it. T is told that the creature is a giant and is a little different than the ones that are found in the wild. T tries to tell the spider that she doesn't want to see it. The giant spider doesn't listen. T soon finds herself trapped in the creature's web.  In a desperate attempt to get it out she grabs the spider's leg and pulls herself away. The creature begins to chase after T and begins to tear through the web. Eventually T manages to escape and runs to her parents. She tells her parents the whole story of how the spider found her.  The story isn't too long and is probably the best part of the movie. The movie is about 4-5 hours long and there is a good amount of nudity. It is a fairly simple story and is pretty much set in a forest.  There are three types of spiders that are seen in the forest. There is the long, slender looking arachnids that tend to be found near the ground and the smaller orb weavers that tend towards the canopy. The last creature that is seen is a very large and hairy looking creature that seems to have been created by a large, strange insect.  This creature is not like any spider seen before.  It's size is a testament to how large its legs are. This creature was also described to be like a huge slug.  I think the idea of seeing these giant animals was cool and even though I didn't really like it I can see the potential for a spin-off movie (like "Jurassic Park".  There is a sequel but

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The fact that this is an amazing film is obvious and obvious, but the story line is so interesting that you don't really need to be told that you should be excited about the movie. If you haven't seen this film or read the book it's best to just go watch it right now and you will be surprised by the story. If any of you read the books, please go back and read them because they are absolutely brilliant. I recommend the series to every serious fan of science fiction, fantasy and horror.  Watch this amazing movie: In this film, we have the first ever 3 dimensional creature that is created by using a new method. It is created from an organism called a human. The organism that is the first 3 dimensional monster is named Tryptone and it is created with the help of a scientist, Dr. Lecobello. Trypton is a very unique creature and he is not like any creature in existence. The fact is that the creature is not a dog but a living creature who has three legs, can walk on two legs and has three eyes. What makes him unique is that he doesn't look like any other creature on earth, he is more like a human being, and he's also the only 3 dimensional being in the world. When he sees a human, he will attack him. This is how he was first created. The scientist, Lec, has created Tryptonite to get rid of the zombies, but he didn't expect that the human would turn against him and use the technology against him. The human has developed a machine that he can create three dimensional images to make up the 3d picture that the 3D monster takes. And the human uses that machine to try to destroy the monster but it doesn't work because the monster can use his machine to make the human look like a 3d image. The problem is that Dr.Lec's 3D machine is not the only way that the monster could take the human. T.T. (The 3d monster) also has a 3 dimensional camera with a 3rd dimension camera which is able to see through walls and see into other dimensions. Dr.Lece's machine is only able to make images and it only shows what's inside the 3 dimension machine but the monster is able also to see the images in his 3d machine and he can see through the walls and the other dimension. LEC uses a 3D camera to show the 3 dimensional images

The story line started out with a cop and his partner getting drunk in the bar, talking about the great work the police do, and the cop asking the cop partner how long they have been working together. The cop says, "I don't know. I was just a rookie. This is my 7th year. You'll get the picture." A little more talking about this and the guy asks, "What about us?" The cop responds, "Just a bunch of cops. We make a lot of money, but we're in it for the work." The guy starts to get frustrated. He says, "...you've got to be kidding. You don't get to keep this job for the rest of your life." The cop replies, "No, we do."  Ricky: We can't go to a bar. You see guys on the bar and they don't even know how to sit down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was good, but not great. It is a very well written movie, with some clever writing and interesting characters. I liked it a lot, even though it had some flaws. I think this is the second or third movie from the guys at Superstar Pictures that has had the "good kid, bad kid" story line. This is an interesting concept. It follows the life of one of the characters who is a bully at school. He gets caught in an incident with some bullies and they go to jail. He is sent to a mental institution and it is there that his mother moves in. I don't know if I agree with it, but it seemed to make sense to me. The movie was very well acted. I particularly liked the scenes between James and his parents. He had an amusing dialogue with his mom and he had a lot of great lines. The characters were interesting and very well made. I was not a big fan of the film but I would have watched it if the plot had been better. The story was interesting and it had a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** It's an interesting little film, a quickie that gives you a taste of the work done by the great David Cronenberg, who's a master at getting inside a person's head and creating a world of strange and disturbing possibilities. The film starts out as a horror thriller, and you have to believe that the film's first half is a good one, and is only hampered by the film not being able to be taken seriously by any sense of reality or reason. The main character is a woman called Janice (Kim Hunter) and she is a writer who has some sort of obsessive fear of her husband. They move into a house and the couple have no children, but her husband is a notorious creep and he is obsessed with Janice. Janice is not a bad woman, she's a writer and her husband likes her work, but she's afraid to leave him. At one point he goes to a restaurant where he leaves his wife behind and she goes to meet him there and she ends up on the roof of the restaurant, screaming her head off. I think she should be taken a little more seriously as a character, but it's only a little bit. The ending is very odd, but I think Cronenberg is trying to make it about something, or maybe he was just trying to get us to laugh. In any case I think it's an entertaining little movie, even if it doesn't last long enough to be considered a real horror film. It's a smallish budgeted film, but Cronenberg certainly doesn't waste any time. It would be nice to see a sequel, perhaps even a remake, and there's still hope that David Cronenburg is going to make a third movie someday, so there is at least a slim chance that we will see what is the second half of the film that was shown in a recent French film festival, "Inland." It's just a shame that we never get to see the film again, or even more, but with Cronenberg there's always hope.

This is an adventure story filled with laughs, adventure and plenty of love! Rated PG-13 for some violence and sex.  Review: This movie was a real treat. We were introduced to an incredibly cute and lovable protagonist named Peter that really didn't have much going for him. He was basically just an average guy that got the task of helping his friend Pete get around the world. He didn't know that there were other guys besides his friends as well. Peter doesn't know any of the details about his own life as well and the only people who have been introduced are his friends. As he tries to help them get through the various challenges they face, he quickly discovers a whole new world that they didn't even see coming.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Well, this movie doesn't really work. It's basically about the author being a little kid who finds a video game he made as a kid, then realizes that he's made it with no real skill at all and doesn't know what he is doing. It is just silly and dumb and weird. So the author starts working on creating something new, but gets distracted by his father's latest TV show and decides to record it instead. That is, until it shows a dog in front of the camera and the dog turns out to be the author's dog. And then, after his father discovers the video, he decides he wants to play it, which of course means being kidnapped by the author for his game. So basically, this book is just a stupid video game story with the author as the bad guy and the bad kid as the good guy. But that doesn't stop the author from giving the story a silly, dumb feel to it. The author has no idea what he's doing and doesn's just start doing things that have no logic to them. There are all these stupid situations like: the dog and author start walking to the author house and the author sees a car coming, so the author walks to the house and tries to make it so the dog can't escape and so the puppy that is on the road will jump out and follow him, and the puppy never does because the author is too stupid to get his dog's attention when it comes out of the car. But the most ridiculous example is the author tries to get the author to be his dog, but that doesn' t work, because the dog doesn't want to be. I mean, I've had dogs that are just as stubborn as the author, but the author will still keep trying to get it to do his bidding because he's trying to create a video games-like environment, but it won't work because the book isn't even written yet, which means the author never created the video game to begin with. There is also an explanation of how the video games get their names, which was kind of strange, considering they just appear out of nowhere and don't have any kind of plot, except for the fact that they all look the same so the names are easier to remember. And a lot of characters just don't make sense to me, not to mention there's not a lot about the world that I like, like how the author says there are three different countries in the book, and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl with All the Gifts was a movie that I think made a lot of young ladies (and some men) go back to the cinema after seeing a movie like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo or The Girl Who Played With Fire. It's a bit like a teenage version of The Princess Bride, or a cross between The Last Temptation Of Christ and The Silence Of The Lambs. This movie follows the story of Sophie, who is a 17 year old girl who can turn into a cat at will. She lives with her parents, who are both in their 80s, and her older sister who is the head of a family-run fashion company. When she's not being a superhero, she's working in a cafe where she teaches sewing and has a crush on her customer, an old man. But as she grows up, the cat and cat girl get into trouble with their parents and are forced to make their way to London to try and get help. The main theme of the movie is the way we use our animal instincts as a means to get what we want, instead of doing what's right. If I were to give this a rating, it would probably be a 3.5/5 stars. It wasn't just the ending, which I won't spoil, but it was the entire movie that was fun, interesting, and a lot like a good romance novel. I found this movie to be very funny and charming, and I loved that the ending was unexpected. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is definitely one that I would recommend to any young lady.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film in that it has a story that has a moral to it, something to believe in and something to learn from. The movie does not have a strong moral to its story. That said, it was a good look at how the world works and its the job of cinema to show the world from another viewpoint, one not held by the characters. I would have liked to have seen the characters come to terms with the world around them and the ways they relate to it and the things they take for granted. I can see how some may hate this, but that is the reason I like this. It is simply a very human film that just so happens to have a happy ending. I had a hard time watching the ending. But that is not what the movie is about. If you see the ending and don't like it, you don't have to see the movie. This is about the journey that the characters go through to overcome the obstacles they face. The characters have a purpose and their journey is to try and make it through to the end of their lives. In conclusion, this is a great movie, a well made movie with a nice ending that you should see. I hope you all enjoyed it and found it worthwhile to watch. If this was your first time seeing this movie, I would also like to say that this is not a typical film. It takes place on a very large scale with the lives of a large number of characters and it is one that has its own set of issues and the kind of character it represents. If I have one criticism to give, it would be that the film sometimes suffers from its own production problems. The lighting in the movie looks better than it does in most of the other films I have seen in this category. This film has its ups and downs and I cannot say that I enjoyed it as much as some of the films I watched and would like to think it is more than a fun little film. If that is what you are looking for, you can get the DVD on Amazon or other places. I like the movie, but it was not as enjoyable as I hoped. If it has any redeeming qualities, it is the fact that it is an effective reflection of what is going on in the world today.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ What's Good:  I love this movie.  It is definitely a sequel to the first (except for the plot) and they tried to take the formula and improve upon it with this movie; it was very well-made and the plot is great.    There is still some of the same issues the first had, but that's why it's good.  But the movie is definitely worth watching.  The art is a little outdated for its time but it does it's job, especially the CGI.  For some reason the movie didn't have enough CGI in it and they added some that made it look awesome.  You can look at the movies poster in my review to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.  It's a pretty bad looking movie and I hate when it is compared to older movies.  However, it is a good sequel to it's predecessor and even better than the first. What's Bad:   This movie is one of the better sequels from 1984.  In 1984, they started doing sequels and you would find out that they aren't the same at all, but this movie is so different.  That isn't saying much as this film has been done again and again with the same story lines.  Also, the CGI isn't that great and the characters don't look very good. I have seen more CGI in a bad movie than what I've seen in this movie, but I'm not mad at this movie for that.  One thing that I don't like is when this movie talks about a young woman who gets caught and punished for killing her mother, and she has a flashback of her mother telling her to kill the man that raped her.  She has this flashback that I thought was really inappropriate, and when she looks into the mirror, her reflection is saying "I love you so much I can't stand it!"   I have to give props to them for adding a flashback, but it was unnecessary and unnecessary for a good reason. I can understand the flashback as it is part of the movie to show the backstory and show the character's past.  The same is true about a lot of the characters.  This movie was pretty well acted and it also has a great soundtrack.  Another thing that really stood out about this movie was the ending.  I'm a huge fan of the "the hero gets away" ending in movies and this movie definitely has

It's just a beautiful piece of work, not one to be missed. - August 1, 2005It's worth a watch
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was pretty excited to watch this movie, especially after seeing the trailer. The trailer looked great and I really liked the movie, and it was all set to begin with. And then the movie didn't begin. And it just kept going and going and not really doing anything. But it was soooo hot out that I had to sit there and take it. It was really hot and I'm a good boy. Anyway, my problem was that I wanted to cum so bad. I couldn't get off on any of my porn. I didn't get really hard. I wasn't even really turned on. The way it went, I had a chance to cum on some guy's cock, but that wasn't really my favorite. I just got some water on my dick, and I couldn"t cum. I started thinking about all my friends and how hot we all were. I thought of how much I wanted us all naked and going at it with me in my room. I was in such a bad mood. I wanted some hot sex to make me feel better about myself. I got the movie over and I started watching it. I have to say, I found it hard to watch. I don't have a huge problem with the acting. There were a lot of girls that I thought looked really hot. But they didn't do anything. They were just hot. I knew the scene with the guy and the nurse. I mean I thought they were hot. They looked hot in their outfits and I thought the guy was really good looking. But the sex was pretty weak. The sex with me wasn't that great either. It wasn't anything exciting. It just got hot in the bedroom and it just went on like that. I had really high hopes that it would be good, but it didn't really make me orgasm. I guess it wasn't supposed to be really good. It's too bad it wasn"t. Maybe if I could have been that into it, it might have been a good film. But I couldn' t get off. I felt like I just couldn't be there in the room. I enjoyed the movie. It got me off once but I couldn'"t get to it again. It is all right. I'm not going to tell my parents. My problem was I don' t want to do it again, and with this being my first time, I think that will be a bit hard. So, thanks for
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Drowning' is a great movie. It has it's good moments, which I have not seen in a long time, but it is also the most confusing and disjointed movie I have ever seen. The plot is completely different from each scene that is shown, with the most important thing being the character of the main character. Even the name of the film is a mystery, as if it was a fake name put on to fool the viewers. The pacing is too slow and I have seen too many bad movies that do not keep a steady pace of the story. 'The D drowning' is an excellent horror film, which is just what you need after a boring week. There is not much to say about this, as the film will leave you stunned and speechless, and will take you straight to the point that the horror comes into play.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ The only way to describe this film is as a "modern day" The Wizard of Oz. Not only that, but it's so good at capturing the magical aspects of this classic story, that even though it's a little bit hard to take it at times, the fact that it has all these things going for it is enough to make it a worthy effort. ___________________________________ "LITTLE, LITTLE BABY" (LITTLLLL) By: Elmer Bernstein ___________________________________________________________________________ The main character is a young boy named Tom Haverford. He's a smart boy, which comes in handy in the world of the Berenstain Bears. The bear characters are the same, and are known as the Littlest Berenstein. Tom is also a kind, funny, generous boy, and has a great sense of humor. _______________________________________________________________________ I love this film. It's just a really good story, it's really well made, and it has that classic Berenstaren charm that we all love. The characters are so lovable. Tom and his friends are fun, sweet, and really have to deal with the cruel world they live in, but are very kind and helpful. It really captures the magic of the characters and their wonderful friendships.   5/5 stars.   I really hope this film will get a big release at some point, it really is one of the better movies in the B-grade section.     __________________________ UPDATE:  So, after I finished watching this movie, I remembered this review on a forum called "Gumshoe". I watched the whole thing again, and my comments were pretty much the same. The only difference was, I did not see the "I Want To Live" scene, but that doesn't take away from the great film. The rating is 5/5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   The biggest difference between the 2 movies is that the former had an awesome music score by Mark Mancina, and it made the movie look and sound like a Hollywood movie. But the film was a really good and good looking film, and at the same time it had its own charm and wit. The only thing I can complain about it was that the acting was a bit uneven. The acting of the lead characters were good, but not as good as those from the original.   For those of you who think you can't like a book about a monster called "The Abomination" and that this movie is just a cheap money-grab, try the original book by Tim Seeley. It's a pretty good book too and I would definitely suggest it for all who are fans of horror. If you like the Abomination, give it a chance, you might just enjoy it as much as I did. The story is a good one, and if you can accept the original author's style and characters, you'll have a good time with The Abomination.  .   is a novel written by J.D. Payne, and published by Dark House Publishing, published by the same publishers as Barker's and Dunbier. The book was written on September 27th 2007 and was written by Tim M.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ Just when you thought there couldn't be any more crazy cult-horror movies to come, director Stephen King comes knocking at the door with a new twist on the genre, and it's not the sort of movie that'll leave you rolling on the floor, clutching your pearls, or wishing for more. No, this is just a simple but very effective story about a man who can be a demon but he has his heart in the right place. When his father dies, he's left a lot of money, and for the first time in his life, he decides to try and make it back to the old West. But, things don't go to plan, and he ends up trapped in the house with his new girlfriend, a beautiful young girl who has the most terrifying and unforgettable name ever... H.P. Lovecraft! While this movie has the usual suspects in it, it's definitely worth watching just for that. Even with a bunch of weird monsters roaming the house, the plot never really gets too crazy, and if you're still not convinced this is a must-watch, then watch it anyway. Even if the ending is pretty terrible, at least it's in the movie. :)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  (5/5) I'm pretty sure it is the best film ever made about a woman being raped.  I think it's pretty safe to say that the woman is the most important character in this film, and the rape was the catalyst for her to do the right thing.   It's a story that is not about rape, but about survival.  The film follows a group of young people from all over the country who have been invited to join a small group of people who have survived and thrived by working as guides in the wilderness.  In the last few years, they have all encountered strange beings who have lived in the wild.  Their leader is known as "the Beast," and he is feared by all who are not of his tribe.  The film starts out with the group being lead by a man named Will, who is trying to find out how to survive in the woods.  While on the trail, Will is attacked by "the beast," and they are both taken to the campsite where the women are being held by the tribe members.  After the attack, the tribe turns Will over to the local police for questioning, and then the men come to the camp to find the women missing.  A day goes by and no one knows where the group is or if any of them made it to the town.  When Will is found in a hospital, his friend Jesse finds out that a group that was supposed to be escorting him to the city has disappeared, and that they could not have left him behind because he was not drunk.  Jesse wants to find his friend, so he tries to call Will.  Will is then brought to the hospital by Jesse.  They find that the people who left the men were not from the group, and there is a man waiting for him with an axe.  It turns out that this is "the Hunter," and while he seems friendly he is actually a man with the power to turn into an animal.  At the end of the film, the group starts to discover that the Beast has a friend in the government who is keeping a large cache of weapons hidden in the jungle, and if the Beast is allowed to find those weapons, he will not only destroy the world but everyone who comes into contact with him.   In the end, Will does what he can, and when he finds the weapons, they are turned over to him, and he and the others are able

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* [review is in Spanish.] "A good thing about this documentary is that it shows a more mature side of a famous actor. I was watching this documentary and I was thinking about the different styles of acting that have been seen in the movies. It seemed like I was seeing different styles with different films, and it made me appreciate what I saw in that movie. What I think is that with every movie there is a reason why it made money or not. This film shows a reason, and a reason that is as great as the movie itself."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a really good movie, but it takes a while to get going. Star Trek III  (1979) This film is a perfect example of how Star Trek can go off the rails as a result of a poor script and/or a rushed production.   It's not just that there are too many characters; it's that they're too similar. The same people are involved with the same plots and stories, and the cast is so over-the-top that the audience has no chance to get engaged in their lives and plot.  The cast is a bit larger than what we might have expected given their relative screen time, but they all get their moments in the sun.  It's an entertaining movie.  The story concerns the crew of the USS Voyager's return to the Alpha Quadrant. It opens with a series of flashbacks to Voyager's first year, and it also features a few very cleverly constructed subplots (the first, at least, is a fun "Who do you think you are?!"). The film itself has a number of interesting ideas about the nature of time travel, but the execution is quite poor.  It's slow and slow-moving, and as a consequence it feels as if the plot has lost momentum, and while the movie does have its moments (mostly involving an alien child who gets taken in by a Starfleet captain), this feels like a movie which was rushed to meet a deadline and then abandoned at the last minute.  Even in the earlier scenes the audience doesn't have the same sense of place and time as we get in the final two thirds of the film, which makes the action scenes feel like they're stuck in the past. It all comes to a head in a very disappointing conclusion.  Star Trek III is a very strong film, and I've actually been thinking about it a lot recently as it continues to grow in stature.   I think that if we're going to get the film we need to get it out of the way early.  This was made during the height of the Reagan era, when Reagan had just taken the oath of office and the Soviet Union was still a part of the Cold War. It's the first time that Star Trek has been shown in the US, and since the movie is set before Star Trek: The Next Generation, there's no reason not to see it, especially given the success of the previous two movies in the franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I really did enjoy "A Hologram for the King" a lot, it was very well made. The story itself was great, it's about a man who wakes up and realizes he is a Holographic projection of a King. The acting was amazing, as it should be with a guy as talented as Michael Cera. Michael Criana was able to make a great villain out of this, with a great performance and a very good acting style. He really has a talent for doing this, and it shows. The music was cool, although it wasn't that good and the acting was good but it was nothing special.Overall, I thought this was a very fun movie to watch, even with Cera playing a terrible villain. If you like bad guys and a good Holography movie, this is a must see. It was an epic way to end a great movie, if that's even possible. Also, if you have watched the movie already, then you may enjoy this even more because you will know Cera's performance. I would recommend this to people who like bad Holograms, and Cera in general.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm going to tell you a secret about the movie, which I haven't told anyone:   I actually found myself laughing quite a bit at it. This is not a light, "It's a kid's movie, they're going to get in trouble" funny movie. It's got an adult sensibility. It deals with adult issues, and it does so in a very funny way. The story is about a boy who's been playing with dolls all his life. One day, a beautiful doll comes out and he gets obsessed with it. He begins to play with the doll, and he begins to like the doll. When his mother discovers that the doll is a girl, she sends him to the doll's house. But that's a far, far cry from "A kid's story!"  When he gets there, he finds out that the entire house is full of doll, dolls who are basically like him, only more intelligent, better looking, and with more personality. The movie deals with issues about how we identify with dolls, about how a doll can be the same as a human being (a very, very important lesson), about how our sexuality can be so strong that we can be completely in love with dolls without a thing between us. The dolls have been created for a specific purpose in this story. It is meant to be a critique of the ways we treat our dolls as "just things." That's one of the themes the movie tackles in a great way: It shows us how we treat dolls as things.  And that's pretty great. I also found it funny, and I'm not just saying that because it was funny, I mean it's a very, VERY funny movie, especially considering the subject matter.  There are some very touching scenes that I won't go into here, as I don't want to spoil the movie for you. It really is very good, and there are some really funny scenes, especially the scene at the end. I just hope that you give this movie a chance, and you'll enjoy it.  It's really that good!  But if you don't like jokes and are afraid of them, or if you're worried that this movie might be too much for you, you should probably not bother watching it. I really don't recommend this movie, but if you do watch it, don't be afraid to laugh, because it is a good laugh, I promise!  I will end this review here.

It took me a bit of time to understand that what I was watching was not a movie but rather a drama. The two actors are very good and the scene and the dialogue was quite well done. ,  I like this film because the main character is so simple and good. There's so little that he is doing that it seems ridiculous and yet he is so believable and believable, and his wife is such a real person. Her husband is a complete fool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In a nutshell, this is a movie you could almost call a horror comedy, which is a bad thing because, at the same time, it's a movie that is really funny. There are plenty of jokes to be found. In the case of this movie, it feels like they were inserted to make you laugh. That's probably how I should have felt about this movie. I think the director, Tim Burton, and writer, Rob Epstein, had a point to make. They made you think about what you are doing when you're making a movie and the end result is a really funny and entertaining watch. So I won't ruin it for you and tell you how it is but, I really enjoyed the movie."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a first-time filmmaker, it's really easy to set the right tone.   When the story is told from the point of view of a young American family, I think that the first thing we should try to establish is that they are still trying to get by in a foreign land. There are people in the audience who are so naive, they can't even imagine that their lives are any different than theirs and so we must try to give a clear image of the struggle these people have to survive. They must still rely on whatever work is available, whether that be a job, a family member, or whatever it may be, because whatever little support they have is being taken away by the system, that system is being used as a tool of oppression, for the purpose of making sure the poor stay poor. This is clearly stated in the opening titles, for example, where a woman, the wife of a man who is already struggling to keep his family's food on the table, is told that a man in charge of the economy and politics in the city has decreed that no food will be sent to families who do not have a man.   to work. For a young child, hearing this for the first time could be devastating. I was a young boy, when the Cold War was in full swing and America was fighting for its life against the Soviet Union, and there were a lot of mothers struggling to provide their children with the basics: food, clothing, shelter. I had a big red blanket with my name written in black letters and I was very proud to know that I would be in the same position as my parents were. However, I never thought I would have to worry about being sent to the camps of the Gulag. I could hardly have imagined a future like that in my wildest dreams.   The fact that a child can see the difference between being alive and being hungry is a testament to the sincerity of the filmmakers. They are not playing with reality; they are showing us a world that we could have never imagined and, in some ways, it is comforting that they managed to create something that is real and realistic despite the horrific nature of the situation.   It's impossible to know for sure what would happen to a child that lived under the watchful eye of the state. We might take it for granted that if the family had a man, they would be able to feed their children. But if the husband is in prison,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you are looking for a film that can bring to mind a 'good' or 'pleasant' experience, then look no further. The story is about a girl and a boy living with their grandmother in rural Taiwan, who have inherited a farm from their father and have worked there their entire lives. Things start to change when their daughter is mysteriously killed, and the boys become involved in the investigation. The setting and setting-the rural Taiwan countryside-are quite the perfect setting, and its atmosphere and cinematography capture that perfectly. With a story that is set in the countryside, the film is also very much set in a style that is reminiscent of classic silent films, a style of storytelling that is now a cliché, but this is something that the director and cinematographer are aware of and is handled very well. " (Jude Bell,  Kino,   London, 2014) " "The film is very much about what can happen when two people try to live in harmony together, but not always when you are a man and a woman." (Dianne Smith,  The New York Times, May 27, 2010) Jude's review of This is the End: "It is a movie about a boy and his grandmother's life in a rural Taiwanese village. In some respects, it's a comedy: the plot is fairly straightforward and straightforward, though the movie is so well-written that it's hard to follow the story as well as to like it. It is not a movie to sit back and watch, and in a sense, it does not take itself too seriously. But, again, it is about what happens when two lonely people try, through sheer luck, to get along in a way that works, and, in the end, they find themselves in a happy marriage with a son who becomes a father.

As the movie progresses the characters have to figure out their own problems with some interesting twists and turns. The acting was good with Chris Evans doing a good job as Steve. The soundtrack is pretty good and it fits the film very well. The two leads did a good enough job. However I did find it confusing that one day Steve becomes the best man and the next he wants to kill people. I will have to give the movie another chance. It is worth a watch. Recommendation:

It is a classic noir story about a detective that gets a little too close to what is really going on in his job and he begins to lose himself and his way of thinking. I really don't know how to describe this movie but it is a very fun movie to watch and I recommend it for anyone who has ever seen a movie.  I also really like it when a movie has a lot of humor in it and that is certainly the case with this movie as it has an excellent time with lots of fun scenes and funny lines.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw the trailer for the film, I immediately thought of "The Great Escape." When I first read the description of the film I thought, "Great Escape in the style of "Rear Window." If it was set in the late 1800s with the French Revolution, "The Man From Tomorrow" could be the most awesome movie I ever saw. A great cast, great music and a solid plot. Well...I was wrong. The Man From Yesterday is definitely not a great movie, but it has a few interesting ideas. This is the story of the man who goes around changing the world for the better. I was disappointed by the ending. The movie does not have a conclusive ending. It left me a little sad after it, but I did have a pretty great time seeing it. It's probably not for everyone, but if you enjoy sci-fi, action, suspense and a little bit of comedy, this movie will be right up your alley.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers is the best superhero film in decades. It not only breaks the four-quadrant mold and delivers the most ambitious, exciting, action-packed blockbuster of the year, it also delivers the film's biggest and best set piece yet.   The Avengers has the potential to be one of the most memorable films of the decade.   But for all of the good, it does take a few steps backwards in some aspects.  As usual, the first issue is the film was so poorly directed, it's hard to figure out who the main protagonist is. The film's narrative is extremely fractured and its characters are so underdeveloped, you would not think anything about them. One of the biggest shortcomings of the film is that, from the moment the movie starts, it feels like it is a parody of its own source material. Â Â It feels more like an attempt to replicate a Marvel comic, which has a long history of doing this.    However, the film also has a lot of the trademarks of the Avengers franchise: Â witty banter, wisecracks, comic relief, and big action set pieces.    It's not a bad thing, but it's not exactly engaging either.  The other issue is that the film gets bogged down in it's own mythology.  At times, it seems like the movie is trying to be a superhero action film set in Marvel's comic book universe.  For example, they go back to the beginning of the Marvel comic book timeline with the opening sequence where they are introduced to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and he tells Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to never tell anyone he was created by his father.  This is almost exactly the same story that we saw in Iron Man 2.   But it also takes it's time to explain who the major characters are.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is introduced as the "Ragnarok Warrior," which means he will kill Thor.  The Hulk (Mark Hulks) is also introduced as "The Incredible Hulk," and he is also a character of immense power.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I enjoyed the movie, despite a few rough parts. However, it was pretty interesting, and the film's main villain was a pretty clever one. ___________ Overall: _________________ There are two points to be made about the film, I guess: the first is that it's a remake of the French-English movie of the same name (from 1982), which is a pretty excellent French-language thriller, the story of a young man who discovers a dead body after a long car trip in the country. The second is that this film is an English-language remake of a French-French classic of the 1960s, and that this original film is not so widely available anymore. I suppose the remake is an attempt to capitalize on that film's popularity, even if I can't get into the remake, because it's just a few scenes longer and a lot funnier. However... I think the movie's director, David M. Evans, probably wanted to try to adapt the original as much as possible, but he's probably not that interested in this film as much. The acting was, I suppose, not bad at all, but I've never heard of any of the actors, and most of the film just seemed like a lot of running around and shooting people. And the shooting itself is just a huge waste of time. __________________ "The future is the past: it only gets better."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I like to think of the movie as the perfect Christmas gift. It's not a movie for children, nor is it a movie about Christmas. It tells a story about three people. One is a girl who is in love with a boy who she doesn't know is her twin brother. The other two are two friends who are also in love and also not quite sure about the whole "one body, two minds" thing. It also is not a typical love story or even a movie. It takes a different twist on love and relationships.The three characters are different, and the movie is filled with a different kind of humor. I enjoyed this movie, and recommend it to everyone who likes films that are different than your usual. The only thing I would have added to this review would be that a second time I would really like to see the twins play against each other in their first fight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Somewhere over the rainbow" - Jim Carrey  and Robert Englund  play two out of control drug-addicted soldiers who get in a bar fight, end up in prison, and get separated in the mail.  Then they are given a chance to get back together and get things right. _________________________________________ I've seen every single Star Wars film.   The thing that most bothered me about this one is that Lucas decided not to change the tone of the film. He gave us a dark, hopeless, gritty and tragic story of two men who get separated, one on a quest to destroy the Death Star, the other on a mission to rescue the people he loves from the evil General Hux.  It's a very dark story, with dark characters and an evil villain, that is full of tragedy and sorrow.  However it's still a Star Wars movie and not a Disney cartoon, and so it has to be funny at times.  Also, the characters were very unlikeable at first, and I felt that Lucas made them all the same.  The only characters I liked were Luke, Han and Leia. I felt it was important for the audience to empathize with Han, so that his pain at losing Luke felt real and his grief at the loss of Leia felt genuine.  I also thought Luke was a bit of a goofball at first but he grew on me.  Luke and Han have a strong friendship and they work together to fight the Empire.  They have a family, but it's all at the expense of someone else.  As much as I enjoy a good cartoon or a movie, there was a certain sadness that I wanted to forget about when I watched this, but I'm not sure I ever did.  One of the most memorable scenes in the entire film, when Luke has to watch the death of a little boy and his father. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Room, by Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero.  The Room.     A very well made movie, a dark comedy with a very strong storyline that has a plot twist at the end.  The story is about Tommy Wiseaus (Timothy Hutton) who moves in with his aunt, Norma (Catherine O'Hara) and uncle, Dan (David James Kelly) on the farm of a friend, Will (Bradley Whitford).  Norma, a divorced alcoholic, was once married to a man named David (Brad Pitt) and had a son named Tommy (Timmy Wiseau), who Tommy and Tommy grew up with.  After the divorce, Normas life was going nowhere until she met Will, who also has a young son named Johnny (Derek Waters).  In fact, he had been Tommy's babysitter as a kid but never really knew him as Tommy was the more socially outgoing boy.  They fell in love and the two went on a date.  When they were there, the entire farm turned off the lights, so the two stayed and enjoyed the date, but then Johnny ran off, and Norma became very jealous of Johnny and began to take advantage of him, even sending him to the school she worked at so she could be by his side 24/7.  Tommy and Normas son was born and the story begins.  You will see things that you don't expect and even if you do, you still feel that you know what is going to happen.  Even though this is not the first time this type of movie was done, it is a very funny film that has you laughing with laughter throughout.  As you see things from both sides of the story, it makes you think about what you want to happen in your life and not so you don' feel it.   Tommy wants to take Johnny to his house on the hill and Norms parents are upset, so Tommy goes with him, but it quickly becomes clear that he has to leave before Norma gets angry at Johnny, and when he finds out, he tries to take back what he did.  We do see that Tommy was abusive to Johnny in the past, which is shown in flashbacks, but what you will see is how they grew up.  In the end, the movie is very sweet and I will always have a special place in my heart for the character of Tommy and his girlfriend.  I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The worst aspect of the movie is the ending. It's a half-assed conclusion that lacks the energy of the film, and a couple of scenes that don't really add to it. Also the movie uses some clichés that don�t fit this story. For example, the movie was a very good thriller with suspense, tension and romance, but it was missing its heart to go to a climax and have a satisfying ending. One of my biggest gripe with this movie is that it is very unrealistic in a lot of aspects. But that�s only my opinion. If you are looking for a nice adventure thriller that has no gore, no sex and little to no action, you should check this movie out.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** "Tombstone" is one of the best action movies of all time. The best thing about it is that you don't have to watch the whole thing to enjoy it, as you will have a good time from start to finish. It's a great mix of good actors and funny moments that are so funny that you will find it hard not to laugh at them. This film was a hit with many people, as it received a "R" rating from the MPAA for violence, strong language and drug use. Some people felt the movie wasn't as violent as the R rating would indicate, but I don't see it that way. It is, in fact, a very violent film. The fight scenes are some of the worst of the genre and the language used by the main characters is the kind you would expect from an R-rated action movie. In fact, the violence in the film is so bad that I'm not sure it was even intended to be "tied" to the drug and sex scenes. "Tombstones" will not be for everyone. The violence and sex is definitely meant to be viewed with a very adult taste. There are also some extremely graphic and sexual sequences which are not meant to appeal to teens. In a lot of ways, it resembles a more violent version of "The Dirty Dozen" which was a great movie for a teen audience in the 1960s. It does suffer from a few flaws though. For one thing, the main character doesn't seem to have any motivation. He seems to just be there to be a bloodbath, and then he's killed off. But there are a few redeeming factors. There is something very sad about how this film's ending was portrayed. The film's soundtrack is very fitting, and the final shot, which shows the protagonist's body as he's about to die is a haunting and beautiful image. It also makes the film very personal, as the characters really seem to be living out the last hours of their lives. "The Tender Mercies" isn't a perfect film. But it's really good, and that's a good thing. ******** " The Tender Mechies " (1972) is a very interesting drama about a family of serial killers who live in the small town of Woonsocket, Rhode Island. " The Teller and the Killer " (1976) is also a great film about a group of young men that start out as killers
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a good film... but it's not exactly good in my opinion." – David B, Bostooglandia It's probably the only movie in my life that has had more than a few people asking what's that supposed to mean. In my opinion, this is a great, funny movie, but there's a reason it's called 'I'm Not a Hipster' and that reason is that it doesn't seem to fit in with the general public's tastes. I think if they had just called it 'I am a Hipstaurant', I think you could have probably made that work. I didn't like it, I hated it. In a way, it was too stupid. I'm not saying it's a terrible film. I just didn't really get it. That's how I would have described 'I Can't Live Without My Radio' had it been released the same way. This time, the film took a darker turn.  But let's keep our ears open for the next one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been a while since I watched The Hateful Eight, so it's a bit painful to revisit this movie. But it was an enjoyable, violent, fun-filled watch. I like that Quentin has some really nice sets and costumes. Even the horses looked really awesome. The soundtrack is also really cool. It's good! But the plot is so stupid that it makes me feel like I'm watching a children's cartoon. The ending felt a little rushed as it didn't do enough with the last few hours and gave me the feeling that I should see the last ten minutes again, but that is silly. It was also a very long and brutal movie that is hard to find in theaters, especially if you aren't a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. I would recommend this to fans of Tarantino and his films. But the idea that he wants to make a western that's about family and freedom, but it's really just a bloodbath and an insult to the family unit and the way they fought it, is really sad. I really hope that we will get something more from Tarantino in the future, because I enjoyed this movie, but in the mean time, just go see something else. Recommendation:

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Is it worth watching: ____ No, the ending was terrible, and I was tired of the boring movie. It was not a good film, I am sorry. Do you have a better description of this movie: I don't care, it was bad! I give it 3 out of 5 stars because the characters were interesting and I liked the concept of "trying to do good". It was a bad movie with bad writing, terrible acting and terrible direction.  I do not believe that this is a classic film. It is one of the most boring films I have seen in a long time. The film did not provide any excitement or even a small bit of mystery for me. It made no sense why the killer would be chasing people in a small area. It took me to another movie about trying to do the right thing. This movie had nothing to do with the story and I really do not understand why the film tried to have a plot, or any of the characters. I also do not like that they took time out to have an old man running through the movie as the movie did not go into detail about why he was trying to kill people. In fact, the movie was so bad that it did not make me want to watch another horror movie. When I heard that this was a remake of the movie I had a feeling that the movie had not been filmed properly. The first thing I noticed about the movie that I did not like was the ending. The people in the theater at that time thought it was a joke, but the movie made it quite obvious that this film was meant to be a remake, not a new film. I do not recommend this film because of the bad ending. This is one that I will watch over and over again. I have no idea why this movie was made and this movie is not worth watching.

There were a lot of great little things in the movie that I loved. The story is really nice, and the acting was great. This movie had a very good pace, and it ended on a nice note. You could see it had been very well made, and there are not many movies I see that have that many big scenes and so many little things to the movie. The soundtrack was awesome, and I had a lot to laugh at (it was funny all the way through), and the movie was so well made I never found myself getting bored, and that is very rare. I am happy to have had a great time seeing this film, and would highly recommend it to everyone who likes a good thriller.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Do you remember the scene in Star Wars when Princess Leia is running around the jungle, and Chewbacca says, "This place is amazing!" That was not a statement of fact about this movie. That was an assertion of fact. The jungle scene in the first Star Wars was a stunning accomplishment. The second Star Wars, the one with Harrison Ford as Han Solo, was so good that, when it came out, critics almost universally declared it a masterpiece. When I read that statement, it seemed like a little too much praise. The movie's most important scene was not the jungle scene at all. It was the one about the Millennium Falcon, about which we still don't know much (it had two pilots and a droid) or the planet Dagobah, which we're told is "beautiful." When the movie opens, Han Solo and Leia Organa are fleeing the Death Star in the Millennium Star. On the surface of Dagobod, there is the strangest and most beautiful place on earth. The planet is a massive oval, just under a hundred miles across. The surface of the planet has a greenish hue, and the hills are so high that you can see for miles. Its landscape has the feeling of a giant tropical rain forest. You might even mistake Dagobid for a tropical paradise.  Advertisement  But the Death Force is here. When Han and Leia escape the DeathStar, they pass the surface by a gigantic wall of energy, called the Death Ray, which has been built by the Empire. The Death Ray is so powerful that it draws energy from the Death Stars, destroying them. As the DeathRay passes, it blasts huge bubbles of death into the surrounding universe, like a giant blowtorch. The bubble of death is an immense green ball, ten miles across, and on the day after the battle, when Han and his friend Princess Leia are standing on its surface, they are sucked into the Death ray.  in the final movie, the Death Rays are not drawn by the DeathStars but by a huge machine that looks like a huge starship engine.  is there a more beautiful place in the universe?

I'm also not sure if I'll love or hate the movie but I did watch it just for the reviews on IMDb and that was enough for me to go in. First thing that I noticed about the movie is that it has a good amount of suspense. I can see a great movie in here and that is why I picked it up. I thought the movie would be kind of dull as the story is just a little bit old, but it actually surprised me a little as I liked the story. The ending is not that great but it's still a nice movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I have nothing against a good old fashioned slasher flick. I also love the cheesy 90s/00s slasher flicks, the good and the bad. This particular film was ok, it had its moments and some good suspense but in the end it just wasn't that great.  The film was interesting, but it was not an absolute gem. If I had a complaint it is that some of the acting was a little off. I don't have a problem with poor acting in a movie, in fact I enjoy it when I see it. The problem was the poor acting of the lead female character. Some of the dialogue from her character sounded more like an improv with different lines and characters thrown in every now and then. Not much that could be done with that, but what made me go "Oh my god what an idiot" was the fact that she was the only character who seemed to have a voice. The others were all pretty much all the same character with different dialogue and different character types. Not a very good cast, which didn't help the film, but we'll get to that later. I would've liked to see this film with an all female cast to help make it a better movie, but I suppose I will probably end up watching it just for the good acting with the lead character. Came across a small gem in the summer release of this film called "Masters of Horror 3: The Dark World" which I found to be a very fun and well made slasher film. The film did have some serious scares, which was very nice to see, as a whole this was not a great film, nor is it great horror. It just seemed like a fun time. For a summer release I think it was worth watching and I do recommend it to those who like the original, or who are new to the genre. . If you want a slasher you might want to check out the slasher films from the late 70s and early 80s which are probably worth checking out. I have not seen much of these, but they do seem to feature some decent scenes. I recommend the following films to help get you started: "Escape from New York", "Scream" (1984) "The Hills Have Eyes (The Scream series) "Jaws" (1975) "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) "House on Haunted Hill" (1973) "Nightmare on Elm Street" (1983

I have seen most of the best of the movies and this one was by far the best. It's so good that I cried and had to do it over and over again. What you should know about this movie: This movie has a great story line and a lot of characters in it. The movie does take a little longer to get to a climax then most movies do, but it never gets to where the climax is that it makes you feel that you are in that same place. I think it's best for the first time movie viewers to really know that there are not that many things going on that will catch their attention. There are a lot more action movies out there than this one, and they don't have so much of a story. This movie also takes place in the middle of the Vietnam War, so it was interesting for me to see something that was different from the Vietnam war. It did get a little confusing as to how everything was connected and if we will get a happy ending or not. We will see more of this in future movies. However, I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone. -Katherine Zirbel -

His first big Hollywood project? This crazy futuristic science fiction, starring the likes of Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, and Eddie Redmayne. A guy from a distant planet goes back in time and gets himself kidnapped by the good guys. I love this movie. The special effects are crazy - you can't even see the characters moving through space! And the way they do it is super cool. And it was very well done.  One criticism I have with this movie is that it was just a one shot, so there is not a whole lot of character development. The whole movie was just this one scene. But I do like the idea that the people are not aware of how crazy this place is. And in the end, they all make it out alive, so it was worth it for me. ...  2.7 5/27/08 ____________________________________________________________________________  a. "The World's End" - When we first meet our hero he's a little weird - he says that he needs to "do some soul searching" because he is no longer the person that he thought he was. It's a funny movie and I loved it - there is a little romance here, a little bit of action, and a lot of humor.  of course there is no romance in this movie, but there is plenty of action and some humor. I just think that we need more movies like this. I think it's weird that the last Star Wars movie is the best. I guess I am getting spoiled a little because they are sequels and stuff, but Star Wars VII is the funniest movie in the series - I can't believe that it got such a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes. They made a huge mistake there. It really was one of the funnier movies I've ever seen. So I guess you guys are going to tell me how good this movie was. I'm not really sure. I do love this guy from planet earth, I think he is very cute, and I think there is some romance in the movie. But as far as the actual story of the movie goes, I don't know what to say.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It was good. The first half of the movie takes place in the first person perspective, so I'm not sure where the idea of it being in a third person came from, but the movie made it work. The third person story line is a little confusing at times, but that was expected from a director who worked on a "horror" film back in the day, and even at this stage, he's better at this than most. And he brings in the characters and their emotions and feelings to make the movie work for me. There's a bit of humor, but it's not just there to be funny, it has a purpose. There was also a very nice cameo from Richard Gere in his first movie. The final third of the film is really good, although it takes a little while to get there. It was really creepy at one point, and there were some really tense moments, but they're worth it. There were a couple of times when there were a lot of close ups, but I think that was the idea here: the viewer needs to get into the mind of the character, but not be a voyeur. I wouldn't change any part of this movie, it was really good. **********  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What the Hell Is Going On?  This film is a bit of a misfire. The actors play it too straight, but at least they are not stupid. I can't stand the ending. I guess they were trying to have a happy ending because that is what we are told. The bad thing about this film is that it's almost impossible to see the point, but it's not that hard to see it, since it's been done several times before. For instance, I don't think this is an original idea of the film. A man takes a new job at a newspaper, and gets the job after getting a letter from his ex-girlfriend. The guy who wrote it is his old classmate, and she wrote him an abusive letter. The boyfriend realizes that the letter is not an abuse letter. That's the first thing we see. The next thing we hear is that the boyfriend is in the apartment of the woman's mother. When the boyfriend enters the apartment, the mother is there and confronts him about the letter. It is not abuse. Then the mother takes the boyfriend back to his own apartment and there they talk. The mother says to him "I've been waiting for you here. I'm so happy that I have a son who's not like you. You know what you're doing to him!" The boyfriend is now angry and walks out. Then he walks in to his old apartment, which is very dirty and full of trash. Then something happens which is never explained. He picks up the trash and puts it into a bag. When he leaves the apartment he puts the garbage bag in the garbage can outside. Then when he goes to his new apartment, he walks by the same trash can outside, and it's gone. We see the garbage man walking by, carrying the trash bag. He puts it in his pocket, and goes out. When we watch the movie, we don't see how he got the garbage, or who did it. And the movie never explains why he leaves it there, or what he has done with the garbage. We have no idea if he did something, or if he just forgot. Then we see the same garbage man back at the apartment. And it is in his bag. And when he walks outside he puts it back in the trash can. So, all of the pieces of trash he picked up are gone. Now that is a pretty strong clue that he stole the trash! We don't know if
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********A very enjoyable film that I found highly entertaining. The film was beautifully written and with a good mix of action and comedy. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with the movie. I can definitely see the influences of many different films on this film such as Jaws, Alien, Ghostbusters, Blade Runner, Aliens, Batman, Indiana Jones, etc. and that's what made the movie stand out so much. I love the movie and definitely will look for it again when it comes out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Airbender was not what I expected, and there were times when I even stopped expecting it. The story takes place in a city in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hills and valleys that seem to disappear for large parts of the film. The characters are colorful and interesting and you can tell that they know what they're doing with their story. There are scenes that are quite dark and disturbing that I had to stop watching due to the tension building, however, that's what makes The Last Airbender so great and memorable. It has everything a fantasy story needs, from strong characters and interesting plot to beautiful artwork and a fantastic soundtrack. The Last Battle is my personal favorite of the bunch, which is why I'm giving this movie a solid 8/10. I can't wait for next year's release, but if you haven't seen it yet, give it a shot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Chill  (1979) is a fun, quirky family film from writer/director/star Jack Nicholson and producer Bruce Cohen. This is a tale of a boy who is being raised by his grandparents (Nicholson, his sister and her boyfriend). They have had a rocky relationship with his stepfather (Nichols) and are on the verge of splitting up. They try to get him to join in with their various hobbies, but his father insists he does not enjoy them. This leads to a lot of tension between the three as he struggles to convince them that it is not so bad. He also has his dad, who is trying to make the best of life as an ex-pro wrestler who has been out of the business for decades. There are many funny lines in this movie that should make it entertaining for any family that has a TV in the house. It's a nice little film that will give you plenty of laughs. I think the best part of this movie is the fact that Nicholson and Cohen actually made this movie for a family audience. I think that there should be a sequel for this film and I am hoping for it. There's no way it should not be an Academy Award contender.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- ------------- ------------- I liked this a lot and wish I could see it again! If you watch it, don't change the ending. I'm not going to lie, it took a while for me to see it the first time. I thought it was going to be like "I Love Lucy" and "It's a Wonderful Life". It's not like the previous two but it isn't anything that I wouldn't see on TV. It's funny, it has the feel of "The Honeymooners" and that is what I liked. I really liked the comedy but I had trouble with the plot. It felt slow but I guess I should be in a different mood since it was a Christmas movie. Overall, it was good.  RAW Paste Data  Christmas movie for you: -------------- --------- --------- I saw this at a mall and it was Christmas themed. I was very disappointed because this was a bad Christmas movie and it should have been called "It Was a Very Good Christmas Movie". I saw the trailer but thought I'd never see it. The film is supposed to be about two couples who are going on a cruise to Hawaii. The movie is supposed take place between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. There's a lot of kissing and it looks like this was filmed at a gay resort. The couples were really good looking. The story was so bad and the film was made for little kids. The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending but that was it. I think this is an excellent example of why they made "It was a Wonderful" and why they never made a movie about Jesus Christ. I gave it a B- I'll see it when they put it on the TV. I liked the theme song better. "What if we could all be happy all the time?" Well if you are a Christian, that is the question you must be asking yourself. I will never understand how people can go into a movie and say, "That's what I believe!" I like the song better but I can't believe how bad this is. I also thought the end was too much and that's what made it so bad. I've never seen a Christmas film that made me cry like this. I'd like to watch it a second time but I wouldn?t waste a good vacation watching it! If your going to see this, put it away! You won't like it! I'll go see "It took a village" when I
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ ______________________________ The only problem with the movie is that it is one of those '80s films that does everything well, but is at the same time not up to par with later films that were even more innovative in their style. However, the acting, writing, and direction of the movie still hold up to today. If you can get past the plot, you will find a fun, exciting action film that should be on any filmgoer's list.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A wonderful film about two very similar characters. The difference is that this film tells its story about a young boy who was taken from his family when he was 9 and the life he lives in a trailer. The family is abusive and does not love him and the only thing that has helped him is his job as a janitor for the big company. He is a very shy man with a strong sense of justice and when a girl in his life comes home to stay for a week for her wedding he decides to stay with her. The story is wonderful and he becomes very close with her which eventually leads to her leaving the family and his relationship with her changes. The film itself is very well done and it has a very strong message about domestic violence, child abuse and the need for children to be taken away from abusive parents and never be seen again. The only thing is that it is a long time after its release and that the trailer did not really tell you much of what you wanted to know. It would have been better if it had a much better ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saw it when it first came out, liked it, and had it added to my annual viewing list. I will never forget the time we were at the movies one day and all of us watched the same movie.  We were all so into it that we did not notice the small guy sitting next to me.    He was probably a good 15 to 20 feet away.  I got up and walked over to him, sat down, and asked what his name was.  He got up out of his chair and walked a couple of feet closer. I asked him if he wanted to sit in my seat and he happily agreed.  Then we started laughing together.  The only thing I noticed was that he could see the entire movie, but I was so focused on his laugh I could not tell if he was being funny.  My son is 13 now and I told him the story recently and he asked if I wanted to take the picture of us.  This is a great example of how one little person can make a big difference in a movie that has a lot of people in it.  If I had not gotten up and helped him out I'm sure I would have missed it!  - Amy G., Minneapolis Thanks to Amy for sharing the photo!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I'm a fan of the old black and white movies from the 50's and 60's. So when I heard that I could get a DVD of that I knew I had to buy it. It was really interesting to see the changes that were happening with the films as they were going by. It didn't help that I was watching the old ones with my Dad because I was too young to understand what was happening. It seemed that we had some weird kind of connection from when we were kids and how they had changed as the movies became more popular. The movie was a nice trip back to when I was a kid because it was a fun story with a cool ending. _________ The film was about an innocent young woman who just has to survive in the wild. She is working as a nanny for her older sister's family and finds that the wild life is full of danger and danger. Her sister is dying and is being cared for by the family of a man who has to be hidden by the children and she has to decide whether she will be a good person or a bad person. I thought the movie was good and made me want to look up some of the movies when they are on VHS and watch them again. The only thing that I didn't like was the way she was treated by the older men of the household. They were more important than her because they were protecting her sister. The way they treated her was wrong and I don't think it was the correct way to treat someone who was being cared of. It is good that we can enjoy some of these old movies again but it will be interesting if this is the last one we see of the characters. I would recommend the movie because it is a good one to see. It doesn't hurt that they are all in black and whites and so it is easy to see in a dark room. ______________________________________________ Posted by The Real Girl at 7:59 AM

It's difficult to get too carried away with a story like this, especially when you've watched some of the better films of the past year that are more 'tough to follow' or, as in this case, 'easy to follow'. With that being said, you have to watch this film with an open mind and hope that all the interesting elements come through as the plot is still very loose in places. "
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It doesn't look like it's in the movies very often. A rare sight these days. I always look forward to seeing a movie with this type of genre as it is one of the few that has never failed me. This movie is not a Hollywood made blockbuster like the others on this list and has a very unique story with an amazing cast. It is a really interesting concept and will keep you turning the pages for more as well as being a really well told movie. I was a fan of the first "Ace Ventura" movie and was not disappointed. I would recommend the whole movie to anyone that likes a good and unique movie. ************************ A nice action movie to pass the time, if you have anything going on. ******** I am very interested in seeing how the director is going to use the film. There is a lot of comedy to enjoy here, I'm not saying this is a comedy, but it is definitely not a one dimensional, one note comedy. It has a lot more to offer in that department. I do not want to spoil anything that is coming up, but I am guessing the movie will be a fun ride. I definitely recommend this for those with a love of action movies. *************** ********** One of the best movies I have seen this year. ******* This movie gets a big thumbs up. ***** I don't know what to say other than how much I enjoyed this movie. This is the second part of a two part movie series. I can not wait to see the next installment! *********** The first part is a classic and the second is a fun action flick.  ****** ******** This is a great movie and definitely a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't already, please read my review of     The Mummy. You know you've seen one when...      It's hard to get out of the theater.  That  is all.   You know what I'm talking about.  It's a tough one to pin down.  I've seen it maybe three or four times.  There are a number of elements that are common to most good horror films, like a group of misfit friends who are on the run from the monsters or a group that has been captured and is forced to endure torturous tortures.  The key to this one is that it's more of a crime drama and less of a gory one.  In fact, it's almost as though the monsters in this film are doing what they do because they are just doing what monsters do.  For one thing, it reminds me a lot of   ________ (or at least the name sounds the same)  I think that might be a case of the monsters being more human than the people who are trapped in them.  This is also a movie that is very funny, although not always the funniest.  Here is an example:   There is a scene when the lead detective, Mr. Cazalet, and his partner, Mr LaPlante, are investigating a series of bizarre cases that have occurred at a local cemetery.  But then they meet a lady who has apparently been going to the graveyard for as long as she can remember.  She has a very old dog, a large black dog.  And you know who else has a dog that is black?   We are in an all black room so you could probably count on me counting black on that one. However, at one point,    It shows how the detective and his team are getting the dog out of its grave and he does some pretty amazing acrobatics.  They're getting ready to bury him when he notices that the dog is starting to grow back hair.  So he's going to cut off the hair in the cemetery to stop this.    What follows is a very funny scene with a very well acted performance by David Warner as the detective.  What's even funnier, is that in that same scene, a lady comes up to him and says, "I'm going to kill

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cave Girl" is a wonderful, moving, insightful, and funny film.  It's just not the kind of film you can watch as a romantic comedy.    I wish there was something I could say more about this movie, but I don't know how.  I'll try.  It's a great film, but you really don't want to take it on the ride it deserves.  The story, in fact, is more than a little familiar.  And, yes, I know that, even though it is written in the first person, it is really about a guy called Bruce.  But, it's the performances, the direction, the humor, and the art that makes this one of the best movies of the year.  We don't really know anything about Bruce (which is how I like to watch movies, by the way) so I would say I'm trying to keep up with the plot.   But it doesn't help that, every time I think it has started to get good, it keeps getting worse.  My favorite moment of the whole movie is Bruce's attempt to find out the reason that his wife has left him.  Bruce is, by this point, in some kind of serious relationship with a young woman.  He knows it's wrong and he's determined to change his ways.  Instead, Bruce is distracted by the antics of a cave man who wants Bruce to join his tribe and do the chores.  Not only does this reveal nothing about Bruce and his wife, but it also does nothing to advance the plot whatsoever.   It takes a while for the film to really get to its point and, in the meantime, it comes across as a pretty conventional romantic comedy with the usual tropes.  Sure, the caveman is funny and, yes (in a bad way) Bruce is trying to save his marriage, but he doesn't really advance the story.  That all starts to change, however, when we discover that the cave woman (I am not sure what his name is; maybe someone else will tell you) is a lesbian.  This is all done by the end of the film but even when it's not, it still manages to get under Bruce's skin and he finds out why she's leaving him.    Even with all the great acting, I think the film still has a few flaws.   I love how much it plays with our expectations of this kind of

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ A lot of my old films are too short, too violent and so on. And I was just thinking of a similar movie which has just been shown in America, and was the greatest of all time. It is "La La Land" and it was directed by Baz Luhrmann. The film has two versions and I have the French and the English version. Both are great. The French version is much better. It tells a story in two acts and it has a great score by Alexandre Desplat and it is just so beautifully done. The main thing that is wrong with it is that the film has the old cliché of love and romance between two people and it does not work. But the best of all is the music. The music is fantastic and it makes me want to sing along and dance and even do all sorts of things. And when I dance I don't look at the screen. I just look at each other, as if we are two dancers in the same room. I would like to give this movie a ten. The only thing that makes it nine is that it has the best ending. I don´t know why, but this is the best film about love and life. The second act is amazing. And then there is the ending. It has the kind of ending that makes me think it is a fairy tale ending. And it is so beautiful and so moving. I´m not saying it is the most beautiful ending in the world, but it is great. It makes me remember my favorite ending and all the great endings in all of cinema. So I would give this a ten and it would be a perfect film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) has a plot that is actually pretty much everything a movie can be (apart from a "who cares" ending).  And it works in this case.  Lebowski is a movie that you enjoy but don't really want to have to watch again because the plot can change on the fly.  The film's story is set in the year 1989 and features the main character, Big Lebowsky, a high-rolling, over-enthusiastic gambler who works for the government and whose main "job" is to find someone with a lot of money to bet on the future.  He finds that there is an Indian millionaire named Raman Sharma and the movie focuses on the two's battle over money and Raman's family's well-being.  The film's plot revolves around the idea that people with a certain type of attitude can become wealthy simply by playing the odds.  It has a very unique tone that isn't really "fancy" in the sense that it is very simple and yet still interesting.  You watch it and it's obvious that the filmmakers spent a lot on the graphics, the music and the direction.  This is an interesting movie for the right person, a film that should be watched by all moviegoers who enjoy simple, entertaining and occasionally dark films.  I think the best part of the movie is the cast, in particular that of Jeff Bridges.  And even if you don't want to watch it again, there's no harm in buying the DVD.   (3) (4)

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "       (2017) " " "    In this dystopian world, humans are the only beings able to think beyond their immediate needs. The story revolves around a young man named Sam (Dylan Minnette), who is the only person who has the ability to think outside the box when it comes to finding the answers to a series of questions.   " "  " "    While it may have been expected from one of the year's most popular teen dramas to have a heavy plot with a multitude of plot twists and turns, "Stranger Things" never strays from the main characters' well-defined lives and the events that transpired in that fateful night in Hawkins, Indiana.     The first season of "Strangeland" was not short on drama and suspense with many of the key players having to be rescued from the mysterious Upside Down world before a devastating final confrontation between the forces of good and evil.    To say that "Strangers" is a horror-comedy hybrid would be an understatement as the series takes us to a strange and disturbing place that was not only surprising and original, but terrifying and fun all at the same time.   Although Sam is the primary character in the series, there are several other important characters such as Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), the daughter of the Chief of Police of Hawkins; Mike (Finn Wolfhard), the son of the Head Sheriff of Hawkins, and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) who is a good kid who just wants to do the right thing.  In all, the cast of "Twisted" is well developed and fully fleshed out with a myriad of quirky personalities who bring some of the most exciting and exciting moments that are witnessed on television every week.  From a very early time in the show's history, the producers of the series have been adamant about portraying the true life horror that has taken place around the world as seen through the eyes of the characters on the show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A must see, The Fifth Element is the third entry of the franchise and an all around great flick.  The story is similar to the first and second movies, where a race of aliens called the 'Empire' invade Earth.  They invade by using a device that turns humans into'molecular robots'.  In the movie the scientists on the planet who have the knowledge to reverse this process, are being attacked by the Empire, who have captured the scientists and are using them as slaves to perform scientific experiments on them. A brilliant, clever story, the movie does a great job of explaining the background of the events while adding an element of tension.  Although the movie starts out with a 'boring' setup, it quickly gets more action packed as the characters are thrust into an incredible adventure.  There is a great script that takes the plot in all directions and adds many layers to the story.  As a stand alone film this movie is great, but as part of the series I'd recommend watching it with a friend, as it goes into different directions.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I saw the first four Pirates of the Caribbean and thought it was a classic - and I thought it had some of the best dialogue that any of the films had to offer. Then I watched the fifth and sixth. I don't know how many times I watched those two and thought, "That's it. I can't watch that. It's just that good." I was hooked - again. I couldn't stop watching it. The first time I saw it was in my car on the way to work. I got so immersed in the story that I went out and bought a book for the family. Then when I got home, I told my wife the whole story. I said, "This is the greatest story ever told in the English language." I'm a big fan of William Goldman's work and all of his novels. I read his book called ''The Little Prince,'' which was just fantastic. I loved the characters in that book and how it was told. I love stories that are told with so much depth and suspense. The movie was so wonderful and it made me laugh and cry. I never thought the Pirates of The Caribbean series was going to be one of the greatest ever. They never did anything that was new or unique. This is the first one and I think it's the best.

Humans and the creatures they fight against often battle to the death for control of various important resources. While magic is usually used to create tools of war, it is also used to control the world, to control your soul. The film, however, is less concerned with battle and more concerned with characters and relationships. "This film is not so much a story as it is a love story. It is an epic tale that spans generations and spans across cultures. You don't just see a typical man fighting for power.

A lot of our hero's journey are filled with self discovery. You can look at him and see a character who is struggling with his identity. This is an essential part of the story. "You don't have to have a strong opinion on the movie to see how beautifully shot and written it is. There is no shortage of action in this film. The fight scenes are incredible. The dialogue is so well-written and it makes for some of the funniest movies out there. You may or may not enjoy it all but you will surely enjoy this one."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie a handful of times in multiple theaters but I think I finally went back and watched it in the theater. The story takes place over the course of two years in the summer of 1962. I really enjoyed this one. It's pretty short for the length of it and it's a very quick, fast paced story. If you like action or any type of suspense or thriller you will definitely enjoy this movie. The characters all have a little bit of a different look to them and that really fits with the period and the period of time. It was fun watching these characters as they do funny and crazy things. This movie is very fun and entertaining.

Helpful is so overrated when it comes to the best movies out there and this movie is no exception.   This movie is so cheesy that I feel like I am watching someone else's movie. It is not very interesting and I do not see how anyone could enjoy it.  I have heard a lot of great things about this movie. This movie will probably be shown in high schools around the world to be a great role model for children to look up to. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I loved this new movie. I liked the story very much and I love how it was set in the future. It was very simple but I still found it to be very entertaining. The movie had some very cheesy parts but this didn't bother me at all.I enjoyed the characters and the fact that the movie is set in a future where children are learning how to fight and take care of their bodies.I also enjoyed how the film is set on a space station in space. It felt very futuristic and it was very interesting to watch. The whole movie had great music which really made the movie stand out from the rest. The plot line was also very interesting which made it enjoyable for me. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning how the body fights and fights against viruses. The fact that it is set at a future time makes this movie even more realistic and it is great to see something so realistic in the sci-fi genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I thought this would be a great idea to make a short movie in the style of a horror movie. My friends and I were planning to make the film after a party but I had no idea how to go about doing so. After a few drinks, I decided that it would be fun to make something and went back and started brainstorming. Eventually, it came to me that I just had to do it and see what happened. I think I found my inspiration from a friend's movie that we had seen one too many times, that made me think about how crazy this movie would be, and how the characters in this movie could play a part in my dreams. I decided to call it "The Dead" and had some friends do the sound mix and make the costumes for the actors. I was not really expecting much to come of this and was surprised that this went beyond my expectations.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is an entertaining movie. I laughed a lot. I love the humor and all of the characters and their wackiness." What did you like best about this movie? "The humor, the actors and the performances. I loved the movie." Was this a fun movie to see?  How long did it take you to get through it? I have no clue how long it took me to get thru the movie... the first time I saw it, I thought that it was a bad movie! The second time it was great! It took about 45 minutes to get trough it.  Any additional comments? This is a great, fun movie... The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I didn't like how the main character is called "The Wacko", and the "Wacko" is also the reason why the movie was a little slow... It could be sped up! Have you seen the "Tron 3" prequel "Beyond the Nexus"?  What did the movie have to do with this?  Not much.   Any further comments? 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- A lot of people say "Well I'm not sure if I love this movie or hate it, but I liked it." So I will give you my opinion about this movie. The movie is about a little boy that has been kidnapped by some people and the people take him to the big house and then they start to kill people and things in the house and the child ends up dying, but then he has a vision of his little brother. So he knows where his brother is and it shows him in a place with his brother and he has to save his brother. Also he has been chosen to become a human sacrifice to a god. It is a little bit of a dark fantasy film. I liked the characters in the movie. I thought the child was very good. It was very different from most children's movies. You have a little kid who is going through some really messed up stuff. His mother is abusive. He has his best friend who is in danger of being killed. Then his little sister. The film starts off with an action scene. The action scene had a very unique feel to it. It didn't just show a bunch of things. It showed the little kid in an action shot. Then I got some more action shots. You saw some of the other characters in action and I felt like I was watching a little movie. Then we got to the final act. There were so many things happening. You get to see how it all goes down. The kid has this vision of the God and he goes to him. He tells the God that his little brothers been killed and the God tells him that he is his chosen and that he will save his friends from dying. There is so much stuff going on and you can't help but be hooked by the movie and then when the film is over you can watch it again to see what happens. It's kind of a creepy and dark fantasy. The ending scene was very very interesting and creepy. It wasn't a surprise because the film had that. The acting was really good in the film. It had some great performances and I really like the character. I really liked the way that they handled him. I have to say that the director did a very good job in telling the story. It has that horror feel to the film but it is still really enjoyable. I give it a 4 out of 10. I can't say it was a perfect movie but it was good.  favorite favorite favorite favorite  As
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ Why is this movie in my top 25? ______________________________________________________________________________ Because I am a huge fan of action movies. I watched this at the same time I started watching the "Fast and Furious" movies. The movie has a strong plot with some twists and a good ending. The fight scenes were amazing. I like how each character had a different personality. It was funny and fast paced. I am not a fan of comedy films. But this movie is a comedy and was a good start for the series. What is your favorite "Fast & Furious" movie? ______________________________________________________________ This is my favorite! I am so happy I saw this and now I can see more "Fast" movies! I wish this movie was in "Fast 8" but I am glad it is. I would love to see this in the sequel and other "Fast movies".  Rated 4 out of 5 by TheAce from Good action movie that lacks the fast cars. Good story and well acted. Not the best action movies and doesn't really add any new characters. The car action is very good but it doesn't have the real fast cars of the movie. The cast is great and the action sequences are very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Was this helpful? Yes No 0 / 0 users found this helpful russel kirwan 9 Reviews It was a great time, a great movie. Great actors. The movie is great. And I have been watching the films on tv for so many years that I feel like I have seen this movie many times. I have to admit that the director is a great director and a great writer. I do not know what I could have done better, I am sorry but you must have missed the point of what was going on, and why you were not supposed to make it so. You got the point, it was all so obvious, why it was so obvious. The only people that were telling me it was not obvious was the audience. And then the movie went off the rails. I had never heard of the phrase "We will have a revolution in this country, they're gonna wake up and realize that they can't do this, we are not gonna go on, we will get rid of these people who have ruined this country and the only way we are going to get rid off these people is to get in the ring and fight and the winner take all and that is not what we want, that is like a movie I am not going to show this movie in my front yard with my kids, my son is 12, it is not funny, it makes me sick that the country is run like that, no matter if you are the president or the CEO. No, the country can not be allowed to be run like this. I know you are going for the money and there is that, but what was the point? I was in college and a lot of these students I know, and they are not dumb, they are intelligent and they should know something that is a little different from a person who doesn't know what they are talking about. There should be a revolution and when there is a revolution the money will dry up and you will have to fight for what you think is right. I am sick of what is going on with this country. I want to see the president and the Congress arrested, so the country will be run better and it is going to start with an open mind. I think this movie, this movie that you did has really put it to rest. A little more emphasis on what is wrong and what is right and the things that are real and the way it is done. Thank you so much for this movie.  Goes great

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhere in the late 1990's I saw this movie when it came out on a cable channel, not realizing that it was an adaptation of a novel by John Updike, that's one of my favorite writers. It has a fantastic storyline with some great writing and good acting. The plot is about an aging playwright named Jack, who is trying to make a comeback. However, as he tries to win back the support of his new play "Laughing Man" he runs into a character named Peter and decides to make him his manager, that eventually leads to his career back on track. The cast is all great, they're all great actors, not to mention the wonderful script written by John Hughes. This is a very funny movie that shows the real life ups and downs of an old playwright who has been trying to find his mojo again. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a funny movie about a old playboy. It's a must watch for any serious movie lovers. See the trailer of this movie below: 4/5 stars Rating: 3.6/5
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone. It's a decent story that has a good cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only reason it isn't higher on my list is because of the fact that it is a remake of the original that was made before the '90s, and it's a good remake, but that wasn't enough to make me pick it up.   It is basically the remake of The Stepford Wives, which I also liked.   I liked that the Stepford wives are all still single but not as annoying as they were in the original.   And it's all played out in the present and it feels a lot more present than the original because of that. One of the other reasons it didn't get more than 3 stars is because the director doesn't get much of a chance to show off his skills as a director.   He mostly focuses on one character in each scene, and the movie isn't very good at showing us how each of the women get along with one another.   So instead of the movie being more like the Stepmothers, it feels like there's just a ton of unnecessary talk and a lot of dialogue that's just not necessary. For a remake, the new version of this movie was pretty good.   The costumes were great and the way they played out was great, and they were good characters to watch.   But the original version was so good, I can't pick it apart that much.   There are lots of great scenes that don't have any dialogue in it and the director tries to give the movie more plot by showing us the Stepfords' children.   Honestly, I feel like he wanted to show us more of the Stepfamilies and the Stepfathers in the movie and make it about them. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the Stepmom movies that came before it.   For those that didn't like it, this movie is actually pretty good and they do a really good job of giving the original characters new life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't like this movie, because it doesn't try to be. The movie is about the lives of a couple of friends from New York, who get together in Paris and go on an intense trip. In the end of the film, they return to the US (where they lived for a while) and are still the same, happy, well-adjusted friends. However, this is the last movie of the series of movies. The reason being that the producers didn't like what they saw in the US, and they wanted to make a film that they wanted a more realistic experience. As such, this film takes place in a fictional New York where, because of global warming, the world's most dangerous species, the Ice People, have escaped into New York. These are the people, in short, that would make up the world of the new movie The Day After Tomorrow. I did like the movie, though, and I thought it was well-made. The acting was very good, the story was well told, and the music was excellent. It would probably be a good idea for the producers to make more movies in this genre, which would allow them to have a more original and interesting storyline. Rating: 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wolverine was just an awesome movie. Even if it was a little bit repetitive. My only complaint with this movie was that the action scenes were not as exciting as they could have been. It would have been a nice little romp, if that were all that Wolverine had been about. Overall I would give this movie a B.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* This movie was a good idea, an enjoyable story, but the director and writers were out of touch with the audience they were trying to reach. The whole thing is so out of date, in the last few decades. It's not an exciting movie for anybody. There are so many things wrong with it that it would have been better off been made 40 years ago. The story was terrible, it was ridiculous. The character development was lousy, the story was ridiculous, the action was ridiculous and the characters were so weak. It would have made a great movie for a school kid back in the '70s. I'll give it a good try to make it into a modern movie, but it is going to be a long time coming! **********  What a way to end the year. Here we go again with a movie that I'm going to hate. A story that will be made for the big screen in the future. The first thing that is wrong with the story is it doesn't seem to have any originality. A group of people decide to make an action movie in the year 2012. Well, first of all, they call themselves The Green Hornet's. Well there are three of them, but in this movie, we only see two of them. The third one is the villain, which I guess we have already been introduced to in the movie. Then, they have to take down a supercomputer because it is on the verge of destroying the earth. Well I guess it's already been done in the past. In the last year there have been several movies that had the super computer as the main plot element. So why not use the same idea to create an action packed thriller. The problem is, there are too many things that were wrong with this movie to make this movie an original and exciting film. Let me count the ways: The villains were terrible. The villain was nothing but an over-the-top caricature of a super-villain. The villains are not even trying to be original. The supercomputer is nothing but a super computer. It has a super powerful computer that does what is in its best interest. The main villain is a character that is too stereotypical and over-acting to be convincing. The movie would be better with a different protagonist. This protagonist is boring and unoriginal. The ending is rushed and doesn't even make sense. In a movie, a story must be exciting or else it isn't even a story
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It was so nice to have a nice day. I'm usually a bit of a worrier and I've had an anxiety disorder my entire life so I was really happy to be in the sun all day. There were a lot of great performances and I loved that it was a very simple story and it was all done with such a nice feeling. The most beautiful part is how much fun and laughter the characters had and the music in the movie really brought it all together. I really enjoyed this and recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy a little bit of sunshine. And if you're an anxious person you're going to really love it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by michaelh from A cute movie for the whole family! I've seen this movie a few times at home and my family always enjoys it. My youngest (ages 6 and 5 at the time) loved it. We were sitting in the back row for most of the movie and my oldest watched the whole thing with me. We had a great time. The plot was simple, but I thought the characters were very well done. , a very cute and heartwarming story of two babies and their mother, played by a terrific Amy Adams. Both babies start out as babies. Babies get very attached to each other and get frustrated and cry if they can't play together. When the mother and her husband find out, they are very unhappy with the children and start trying to get them out. Their son is very upset at the mother, the wife, and her son and tries to hide and hide from them. He gets very annoyed at everything, but he can't tell mom that he wants to get out of the house to play with his friends. The father finds out and is very concerned and decides that it's time to "discipline" the kids, but in a very humane and loving way. He tells mom that she can get him out at night and leave the babies with him but that he can see them when he's there. This is a good thing, as a father is always very good to his children. He makes sure the parents get what they want, but also teaches them how to think for themselves. When I first watched this I was very disappointed that there was no sign of the mother. I thought that they would have shown a picture of her sitting next to the boy. I was so disappointed that they didn't. I also thought that it would have been better if the father
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film is well made, and a nice story. There is a nice variety of scenes and each one has a distinct scene or action. The acting is all great. There are plenty of laughs, and you will enjoy it as you sit down to watch. I can see it being a family film, or for kids to enjoy. It has a unique style. There seems to be a lot of blood and violence, but I found it amusing. You can tell it has been in production for a while, and there is a large amount of footage for this movie, but it is not too long. It does go over a bit quickly, but not so much that it is an annoyance. The camera moves from the interior of a car to the street scene, and the camera pans out the windows. The film has some great effects, and I would have liked to see some of the action scenes. They do not quite come together, but they are good for what they are. A great movie that will not disappoint you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In general, I've been a fan of the film series. I watched the first film, The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, back in 1985, and loved it. I had never seen anything like it, with a plot that was a bit silly at times, but always kept me hooked. This new film, though, is so good that it could be seen as a direct sequel to the first one. There are a lot of jokes in this film, and some of them are a bit funny, so I found myself grinning.  The story is actually really well done, with some good twists and turns, and it has some pretty good fight sequences as well. The story takes place in a future where Earth is being invaded by alien creatures, called the Zee-lans. The aliens, who are the most advanced alien species we've ever seen, have been trying to steal all the technology from the Earth for centuries. So they have constructed an enormous spaceship called the Exodars and have a base on the moon called the Moonbase. But things aren't going so well for the aliens. Because the aliens are not very intelligent and they need a very high tech to escape the Earth, they decide to steal an old robot from the moon to build themselves an exodar.  Once they steal the robot, they plan to take Earth for themselves, and they have been setting traps for Earthmen to keep them out. A small group of Earthmen make a deal with the Zees to keep Earth out of the Zeer empire, and one of them is sent to steal the Exobars from Earth. A group of military men and women take the robot to a military base on Mars to stop the Exo from escaping. Then the exo steals the Exocaster from the base, and has a battle with Earth, killing the leader of the military group and taking the Exox on a suicide mission to Mars, then heading back to Earth. And so the story begins, as the military tries to track down the Exos. The plot moves fairly quickly and the action sequences are very good.  You know what makes this movie so good? The voice acting. The cast is very good, and the acting was fun, especially with the different characters. I liked the fact that the story didn't really have much of a main character (unless you consider Buckaroo's robot a main person), and that the action was really focused on the military
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wesley Snipes and Chris Hemsworth in X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an extremely fun movie. It has great fights and even though there are a few instances of the character's over-the-top antics that you won't appreciate (as the majority of the audience certainly won't), they are all well done and the acting is top notch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Marvel's superhero films or just a fan who enjoys action films.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ A young female detective and her husband are traveling through Europe for the holidays when the plane they are on crashes. Their only survivor is the man who was supposed to be the co-pilot. In the wreckage, the couple discovers the dead body of the co pilot, with a piece of paper with the name and address of their destination written on it. While searching for their missing loved one they stumble across a mysterious cave. Inside the cave they find a woman. She is not human and she is not of this Earth. She says she has come to find the only male on earth and that she will destroy him if she doesn't get to him first. After a few scenes of her wandering the cave and making odd statements she appears before the couple, claiming to be her mother, and she demands a ransom for her son. When the husband finds out the ransom is a million dollars, he says that it's too much and she will have to kill him to get the money. She agrees to take him, but after a few days they meet again and this time she demands to meet the husband in a deserted field. Before the woman can kill him, her son suddenly appears from the sky and kills her. When her son is found dead, the wife tells the husband that she can bring back his son if she is to have the right to bring his son back. He accepts the terms. However, the woman is now in charge of their son. In addition to the son, she has now come to take all of the family's possessions, leaving the husband with nothing. So, they continue on their journey through Europe. ___________________________________ Why was it such a good film? I think that the reason that this film was such a classic was that the concept was very original. I can see now how this movie came into being. The movie was made in 1952. When this movie was originally made, it was a big hit. The fact that it was filmed in the early 50's was interesting as it could be a continuation of the trend for films that featured vampires or demons. A lot of the themes that were going on in this movie were very similar to those themes that we still see in today's movies such as revenge, love and family. The film was a classic that was a huge hit, and to this day is considered to be a classic. If I was going to do a re-watch of this film, I would watch it again just for the fact that

That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. But it was a nice movie. And I will rewatch it again.  Love this film. So far it's been one of my favorites. The movie is well written and has a nice twist at the end. It was well done and funny all the way through. I enjoyed it.  The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that there are no other films. I don the film was a one off so why would you go and see another one?  If you want to laugh then this is a good way to do it. I do recommend watching it on it it's' own  Hear me when I say this: it is a great little film. It has a good twist and great performances. It also has one of the best endings to a movie ever. The only downside of this film is it's length. This was made to be a one film. This film is definitely a great film. The only complaint I have is that the film ends on a cliff hanger so if you didn't get the whole story you might want to start another film before you see this. But that's not to say the ending was bad. , 4.5/5 stars, 88 reviews
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sucker Punch is not a bad movie. It has a solid script, some decent fight choreography, and a solid cast. The movie is pretty good on its own, but it also has some potential to get much better if the story is further fleshed out.  The story is very basic, but the movie is filled with some solid characters and a great ending. I think the movie could've been a lot better if it was just a more standard superhero movie, but as is, it's an alright one.  Sucker Punched is the first feature film for actress Amy Adams, who is best known for her role in American Hustle, American Hustler, Lincoln, and American HustLE. She has been in some good movies, but this is the one that got me interested.  The movie has been described as an action-comedy, a romantic comedy, and, to a certain degree, a war movie.  This is a fairly accurate description, although the movie also includes some drama.   It opens with the titular protagonist, played by Adams, waking up in a hospital. She is being held prisoner by a mysterious man known as the "Battler", a giant named Jigsaw (played by Jeff Bridges).   After being rescued from a cell, the two begin a relationship, which leads to them taking on various villains on their quest to find the truth behind the murder of an innocent woman.    Sucker Punch starts with a bang as the two have a good fight, but unfortunately for Adams, her best friend, Maggie, is caught in the crossfire and dies.  She is left traumatized, angry, and heartbroken. While all of this happens, the characters have no idea what is going on, and the plot twists and turns as it goes.      The movie opens with a flashback to Maggie's life.  When she was young, she was kidnapped from her apartment. She had been raped by Jigsaw's brother, and after he was captured, he used her to seduce his sister, who had recently moved in with him.  After his sister moved out, she began to feel lonely, but her best friends, Amy Adams and David Spade, were able to save her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movie  by a director who can direct a movie about vampires and it is a vampire movie and it works. It has some good performances but not really special ones like in the original series by Bram Stoker. It is the same story with an interesting change of pace as the first film but it is still a great movie about a girl who meets a vampire.   The movie stars Jennifer Connelly and David Thewlis

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was extremely intrigued when I was shown a trailer for this film at the local Cineplex. The idea of a dark and violent thriller intrigued me and I was more than willing to check it out. The movie itself was good. There was no slow and deliberate build up, but it was a good mixture of genres. I have heard a lot of people rave about the movie but I found it to be a little predictable and not very exciting. The story was interesting and it had some cool twists and turns along the way. It's hard to talk about this movie without giving away some of the twists and was pretty good. The film got off to a slow start. It was kind of a slow burn but at the end I was completely in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Short  is an incredibly entertaining movie, and is the best depiction of the subprime crisis in a movie I've seen. There are few better movies that are so realistic and unflinchingly honest, and I found it quite shocking and disturbing that many pundits on Wall Street had the audacity to dismiss the movie and talk about it as a "white knight", a "great financial epic", etc., when the film tells a story that is very much like my own. There is a lot of truth in The Big Short, which is why I am so glad that Paulson chose to share it with us through the media and film festivals. I've been a fan of Paulson for years, and was delighted to find out that he is still around after the last few years of his career as a banker.  I'm glad to see that he's making a name for himself.  The big question is whether or not Paulson will be able to keep his integrity and do what's right for the many Americans that lost their life savings to the sub-prime meltdown.  In order to gain some more insight into this story, I've spent the last two days at Paulson's headquarters and interviewed many of the important players involved.  I have yet to see the film, but I've heard good things about it, and it's always great to see Paulson on the big screen. If you're interested in Paulson and the role he's playing in this movie, here is my interview with him, and the rest of my interview here.  The Big Longshot The Big Bankers:   In November of 2005,  Paulson & Co. had just won the biggest prize in their career:  The $15 billion first-ever insurance syndicate  that they had worked out with  Citigroup, Bank of America,  and the other five "Big Banks"  in 1999.    The syndicate had already paid $7 billion to settle two major suits involving the sub. It seemed like a huge payday for the firm. So it's no surprise that Paul "Pops" Paulson went out and spent $40 million to buy a piece of the hottest piece of real estate in the world: The Village at the Towers in Manhattan's Meatpacking District.  He wanted it for a "resort," and since the project was the largest acquisition in his firm's history, he wanted the tower to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A strong performance by the lead actress in this film and strong acting throughout. It's been awhile since I've seen a film with this many outstanding acting performances. I like how the film tries to bring out the more complex and nuanced side of the characters, the relationships and the characters themselves. A really fun film, and one that I'll be rewatching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very pleasant trip to the beach where the girls enjoy a peaceful moment. It was nice to watch the two girls talking about their feelings and trying to be happy for one another. I think this movie is just what you want a happy ending to be; a good story with a little bit of romance and adventure. And that's what I was hoping for, I did not expect this movie to give me a very romantic ending but it did. I enjoyed this movie a lot! I hope I'm not giving too much of a review on the movie, but that is what I enjoyed most. It is a very nice watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A solid sci-fi movie that has some nice moments. A great piece of sci-fantasy. The acting is good and the action is very satisfying. The movie is really fun, and is a must for fans of the genre. My rating: **** A solid science fiction movie. If you have a hard time watching sci-ed in general, give this a try. _______________ The movie follows a man, Jack, who has recently lost his job and is on the street, searching for a way to get his life back on track. When he meets a homeless man, named Harry, Jack has a chance meeting. Harry is the one person who seems to know that Jack is searching for work. After Harry convinces Jack to join him in search for work, they decide to form a job search team. The film shows some nice characters and gives us a nice story. The action is well made, and has some good thrills. The Sci-Fi aspects of the film are nice, and make the film enjoyable to watch. ____ The movie also deals with a lot of the social problems that we see every day on our street. As Harry says, "If you want to help yourself, you don't have to look for someone to help you". That is why I really liked the idea of this movie. It shows a good lesson about accepting people for who they are, and not judging them for being different. The ending was a little odd, but that may just be because I am old. _____ It is a nice watch, and I think it is important for people to see different parts of society that have some problems. I recommend it to everyone, as it shows a lot about life and what we can do to make ourselves better people. ___________________ Overall I would say that "The World of Tomorrow" is a really good movie that anyone who likes Sci-fi should see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If there's a single movie in the history of the genre that I can really put my finger on as the definitive piece of cinema I'm proud to call my own, it's "The Exorcist." With its gory and horrifying visuals, it can easily be mistaken as a film for kids and the most gore-filled of horror movies. However, the film is far from what you'd expect from the source material. The film was directed by William Friedkin and released in 1973. It was adapted from the novel of the same name, written by William Peter Blatty (yes, the guy who wrote and directed "The Silence of the Lambs"). The novel has a dark and disturbing plot that follows a couple who take in a young girl who is the daughter of a demon and a werewolf. The story begins when the child is killed and it is up to Father Merrin (Frank Langella) to investigate the crime and determine who is to blame. The rest of the film follows Father Merritt as he deals with his demonic problem and, ultimately, himself. It is a movie with a lot of heavy-lifting and some pretty gruesome sequences but it's a well made and enjoyable horror film. One thing that I think a lot people don't realize is that "The Conjuring" was filmed and directed by James Wan. When I say James Wan I don't just mean the original "Twin Peaks" but he is also the director of "The Mortal Instruments" and "Insidious." "The Revenant" is an Oscar nominated drama film that is also a true story. The movie follows a man who is on an expedition in the New World where he meets the legendary French explorer, Jean-Baptiste Léopold, a man haunted by an ancestor's legacy. The man goes on to do battle against both the Native Americans and the French as the film begins. The acting is stellar throughout the film but what really stands out is the amazing portrayal of Léo who is in a lot more than a few scenes. It really is one of the best performances of the year. The action sequences are incredible, the story is gripping and the cast is wonderful. I have been waiting for a movie based on the book "Léon" since the beginning of the decade and I was pretty excited to see "The Assassin" finally come out and I'm thrilled that it did. I'm sure I'll be revisiting the story some day and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The new release of "Bourne Supremacy" is not nearly as bad as I remember it, if only because it is only 90 minutes. This is one of those films that would make a great remake, if the story could be made relevant. The old "Borne Supreemacy" film was a wonderful adaptation of the novels by William Goldman, and is in the same spirit as "Battlestar Galactica". The actors are perfect, and the story is well put together. Even the special effects have aged well, despite being made in the 1970's. I think that this film will find an audience in the near future, because it has some serious flaws, but also some great bits of action and excitement. I recommend "Baretta Supremature" to any fan of the films of David R. George III.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________Read my other review here:  Sebastian - 17 May 2017   A- A+   I really liked this movie.   The story is really interesting. It was pretty well written. I liked that there were things going on and there was also things that didn't make it in the film, but I liked the idea of a love story in a world that was in some ways not that different to our own. It also had a good balance of things going in and stuff that didn;t, which made for a well thought out movie. The best thing about the film was the music. The songs that were used in this film really made it. It made the film pretty interesting. There were a couple of scenes in the movie where the music didn't really fit in and it made it a little bit hard to watch the film because it would stop the action and slow down a bit. But as I said before, I liked this film.  's characters are quite interesting. They are different people, but they have a similar story and a similar background, which I found quite interesting and that's why I thought the character development was good. The characters are pretty easy to root for. They all have their own reasons for wanting to do what they do and what they are afraid of. I really liked how they all reacted to the events of the film. And, as I mentioned before, there are some scenes that didnot make it to the film that I liked. But I still liked the story and characters a lot. I don't know why, but this movie really made me want to see what happened in the rest of the books. I was very excited about reading them. I would say this is a great read.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ My wife and I both loved it. It is definitely my favorite of the three, in my opinion. I can't wait to see the others. It wasn't all that long, and it made me think about something that I had been wondering for a while, but the answer was in the film. What the hell do you really think happens when you die? I don't really think of this movie as a horror movie, but I do think it is a thoughtful movie. I think it's good for people who are looking for something deeper. I also don't think it was too scary for an 8 year old. I thought it was a little too subtle and would like to see more gore. I got scared at one point. I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say, I have never heard anyone talk so much as about the movie as I do about it. It has everything! A hero, an evil, a good and evil, three sides to the story, and more. So much has been written about it, it's hard for me to remember it all. Well, the movie I would give to my younger self is THE RING. My favorite character is the villain, who has the same sense of humor and sense of fun I liked about the hero. I think it is all the elements you want in a movie. I love how the villain is just a regular guy who is forced to be evil by circumstance. This movie, along with TURNING POINT, made me decide that I wanted to be an actor and I will never forget the day I found out that my dream would be to work with Gary Lockwood.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ _______ _______  The first time I watched this movie I had no idea what I was getting into. It took me about an hour to figure out that the movie was based on a series of comic books written by Kevin O'Neill about a group of kids who go on a crazy adventure in a post-apocalyptic New Mexico. It had that kind of campy feel to it, and while it wasn't scary, it was entertaining. When I got through the first 10 minutes I was pretty sold, and was expecting the movie to be about a team of superheroes taking down some huge, masked villain. That didn't happen. The movie's main villain was the leader of the town and they took on the rest of the villainous villains (including a bunch of crazy characters from the comic books) from a whole bunch of different angles. As a result, this movie is not like most other super hero movies. It is not a super hero movie. It's an adventure movie about teenagers who have to deal with a buncha kids (mostly teenagers) trying to take over the world, with super powers. It was just so different, it made me a believer. I'm not sure if it would have been able to work if it was going to be the first movie ever based on comic books, but it's certainly a lot of fun, and definitely worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I found this to be a rather good movie. I really enjoyed it. Not an amazing movie, but definitely a good one. If I had seen it sooner I would have watched it more and maybe even liked it. The story is a little simple and a little silly but there is something good here. The movie plays out like a little children's book, and I find myself liking it more each time. I did have a couple of trouble with the sound though. I never had a problem with the background sound, and sometimes it would be kind of loud for the rest of the room. It would get to be loud to the point where you were going to want to close the movie, as it would keep getting louder and louder. I'm not really sure what to do about that. I would really love to hear it quieted down, maybe with the volume of a stereo. Maybe just turn it off. It might make it easier to see, and also make the movie a little easier to understand. Overall I enjoyed this movie, and recommend it.  Reviewed by: John L. Landon, St Louis, MO, USA - 15th November, 2011
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ I saw this film a week before I heard of the incident. I got out of bed, looked for something to eat and noticed that my husband was up and about in the living room. I asked what was he doing and he said he was reading a book. I grabbed the newspaper that had the story on it and he stopped in his tracks, looked at it and then looked around. I had a sinking feeling. He said that we should go to the movies. I looked at him for a moment and realized that maybe he wasn't thinking straight. I said that I had to get ready for work the next morning and told him to hurry. He thanked me and I told him I loved him and wished him a good day. I took my coat off and he asked how I got it off so fast. I told her I had my belt off. He didn't ask questions and we walked to the theater. I was in the middle of the first section when I heard a loud "thunk". It sounded like a bowling ball hitting the screen. I turned and saw a woman's head pop off. The next thing I heard was the sound of a gunshot. It sounded just like that of a.22 but deeper. When we finished the movie we walked outside and he turned to me and said that there had been two women killed in the movie. I immediately called 911 and asked him what he had heard and why the police were there immediately. It turned out that a woman who had been sitting on the right side of the front row of seats was also killed. The gunman was still in the theater but had left the area. I went back into the theater and talked to one of the staff members and she advised me to call the police. She told me to put the phone down, go to my car and drive to the nearest law enforcement agency. I did so, parked my car in front of the theater (which was on the other side of town) and called 911. They sent an officer over to investigate. The police have been great and have told me they will always be there. They don't know who did this or why. The man who did it will not be caught and there is nothing anyone can do. I still have to go to work tomorrow but that is not a problem. As I have stated before I have been a victim of sexual abuse but I am now a victim again of the movie theater. We have had the tragedy of two female victims in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Catch Me If You Can" is a comedy about a small town that is a little off and the main character is a boy who can not catch anyone. I think his best feature is his ability to talk to his sister and I think her character is great. I loved the music throughout the movie and the acting in the movie was really good, especially for a movie this small.  I give this movie 4 stars because it was a little funny but it is a movie with lots of character development and you have to give it a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Would you recommend this movie to a friend?: __________ Would you like to watch it again? __________________  Ricky Gervais - "The Office" (UK, 2010)  "The Office's" sixth season was more than just an entertaining hour of TV, it was a series of brilliant episodes with smart and sharp performances. The British sitcom was never exactly a ratings juggernaut, but that's exactly what made it so much fun to watch. The series, which followed an office staffed by a bunch of different personalities (a wacky-yet-dynamic Andy Bernard, a sassy-yet-"normal" Dwight Schrute, a neurotic-yet"normal" Michael Scott, and a dim-witted Jim Halpert), tackled everything from marriage to the office itself. In some episodes, the show became so smart, it'd take you back to when you were a kid and sat around with your friends trying to think of clever insults and one-liners to make people laugh.  For this round, we've selected the best of Season Six. The show wasn't shy about putting itself at the center of its storyline, but it also took chances, like using the show's trademark "farts" as an insult, or allowing Andy Bernard to be an ex-con (not to mention being one of the series' most recognizable and beloved characters). Even the "fart" gag itself was a clever take on the idea of using words as weapons. "That's one heck of a fart," he said with his usual smugness, but his delivery made it obvious he was telling us a fact about his own past. ...  .  to.. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ A couple of years ago, I saw a trailer for "The Way Way Back," a British film that was made by and starring my wife's best friend. It had everything that I like to see in a film—the acting was really good, the plot interesting, the effects were excellent and the sound was terrific—and I really enjoyed it. It was a great time, the film was made in less than a year, and all my friends and I went and watched it at home with our parents or my parents' friends. On Saturday, we were about to go out for a nice meal and then I decided I should see "The World's End." I had a bad feeling about this movie. It seemed to me, when I saw the trailer, that there were things about it that were off. I felt like I knew what I was getting into, but when I actually went to the theatre, it didn't live up to my expectations. The trailer made it sound like the film seemed to be about a bunch of teenagers having a lot of fun. I guess I just didn't get it. I got a good laugh out of the opening scenes, but after that I just had an uneasy feeling about it. When I came home, my wife and I sat down to watch the movie, and I think that's when we both noticed that we had some of the same feelings that we did about the trailer. The film seemed like a mess and there were some things that I found to be pretty strange and out of place. I don't know what I expected out of it. One of the things that struck me about the film is the fact that it seems to deal with something called "the World's Ends." I have no idea what these things are, or who is responsible for them, and they seem to be rather pointless. I didn't feel that they were really necessary to the plot. There is a scene in the film that involves a young boy and a young girl who are running for their lives. The boy is being chased by a man with a long ponytail who seems to be following the boy. At one point, the boy and the girl find themselves being chased as well. The girl runs into a field of long grass where there is a dead rabbit. The scene ends with the boy throwing the rabbit into the woods and the scene cuts to a new shot of the boy running across the grass in front of his parents' house. I have seen that scene

It is very short and it's very good.  It is a comedy of manners, which is pretty much all there is to a comedy at the end of the day.       The movie is a satire of the people in the upper class who are trying to be so high class that the movie ends up being about the people who are not so smart or high class.   The people in this movie are all just a bunch of idiots.  They even go as far as to make an entire movie dedicated to the theme that they are all idiots and no one really knows what they are doing or who they really are.  This movie is about what it takes to be a "man of power" in this world.  It is funny but it is very serious in many ways.  The people in that world can't seem to grasp the fact that there is no higher class than the lowest class and if you go on too long you are going to get a headache.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ If you would like to know more about this movie, I would suggest you to see some reviews from some good reviews I would recommend to know what's going on with this movie.  Helpful I'm afraid the film has nothing to do with the characters who are only used as plot devices. However, I find it interesting that they would decide to tell this story as they go along. It doesn't feel like they're doing much with it at all. The pacing feels very rushed, and I found myself wondering if there were any real connections between the characters. I'd like to note that the movie had an interesting soundtrack. I didn't quite understand it, but I was impressed by it. It's very atmospheric and a great soundtrack for a movie about a ghost who lives in your closet. But there were problems, too. For one, the ghost is played by a person who doesn't look much like the ghost. I think his ghost looks much more like someone I've seen on TV before than the actual person. I mean, even his nose looks weirdly long and elongated. I also thought that the acting in the movie was bad. There were a lot of acting problems here, too; sometimes they'd just be saying the same thing over and over again. There was even a little bit of acting by some of the people in the mall. They sounded more like actors who were reading a script than actual people. There are some funny acting scenes here and there, too, but it was a shame that they were so common. Even the character who lived in the closet did bad acting. I'm pretty sure he was just reading a story for the sake of reading a scene. One thing that did seem pretty true was that the mall did not look a bit real to me. The mall seemed so out of place in the middle of the forest that it made me wonder if it was just a fantasy. It wasn't until the end of the movie that I actually thought that this is what the mall looked like. I don't think they actually built it. There's one real, true thing that this movie could have had that I think was the only good thing about this film: a ghost that would talk. But even then, the movie still felt rushed and just felt rushed. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A friend of mine gave me an early copy of this, and he had me look through it, and even gave me a copy of
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ Here is an excellent action movie in which all the characters (all played by very good actors) have their moments, but it is hard to get into the whole movie until the last 15 minutes. This is one of those movies where you are looking forward to the final showdown and then suddenly you are watching it, feeling pretty cheated. You know that there was a big payoff, you just didn't see it yet. The characters play well off each other. You can relate to them even though they are so different. It was a very good action movie. This is a good action film with a good storyline and a good twist at the end of the movie. The villains, the three most important characters, are well balanced and all you can see are their flaws. But the movie does get pretty intense near the end. This movie has not the usual action/sci-fi type feel. The violence is real, but not as graphic as you would expect. It's not really a violent movie, just a very violent movie. I really liked the villain, he made up a good fight, but I think he should have been in the movie all along. The story is very good and the script is very funny. I really thought the last few scenes were great and were very emotional. I liked this action movie, I really enjoyed watching it and the final fight was very well written and very exciting. ____________________________________________ This movie is one about a man named Jack. He is an ex-marine, a father, a tough guy, a man who's trying to find his identity again. Jack is a very honest person who is trying to get his life back on track. His old life is fading away because of his drinking, his drugs, and the fact that his son is trying something new and he is afraid to try it out. As you know, it's very easy for a father to get lost in the child in a new life. So, what do you do? Jack does what he has been afraid to do all his life and that is to take his son under his wing and give him a second chance. The problem is, Jack doesn't know what it takes, and his son has to figure out the steps on his own. Jack learns about the world that he loves and that he needs to stay away from. All you can really say about this is that it was a good and well written movie. There are

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. I hope you like it, as much as I do. 1.5 out of 5 I really enjoyed it, but I was a bit disappointed when the movie ended, because it should have continued and I think it would have been an amazing movie.  In some ways I didn't care about the movie, but in other ways it was really good.  It has the same feel to the old West, but is a much better movie than the movie that came before it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Hole  is a fine and interesting sci-fi film with a great cast.   This film has a definite "hard science" component, as there is a lot of "hard math" going on (for example, we are told that the black hole in the film represents the death of the universe as we know it). The film also explores the nature of human consciousness and the nature and origin of the physical universe and the universe itself.  It also is a surprisingly thoughtful and subtle film with many moments that bring the film into an entirely new realm.   I highly recommend watching this film with the lights off, as it is quite dark (and a lot more intense), and it is not something one would want to watch with the sun on.   Overall, a very interesting and thoughtful film that will appeal to those of you interested in science fiction.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, it's a good film. The story is simple but the actors and actresses give it a real touch, which the director used very well. The action sequences are great as well. A great family movie with great special effects. A good watch.  Did you like this movie? If not, why not? I liked it a lot. I didn't like it though as much as I liked the first film, but it is a good story. It takes place in the early 1960's in England. Two children are going to go on a school camping trip, one has a special powers, the other one is having a nervous breakdown. It's a very funny and heartwarming story. The only problem is it's very short. It could've been a little longer if it didn't take so long for the children to get off the boat. I would recommend this film to any fan of the original, just to show them that it can still be funny and fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The film is a remake of a Japanese cult classic anime called The Tatami Galaxy. The original story follows a group of alien beings who, in the year 2116, were sent from the sun to earth in order to teach humans about the universe. This alien race is known as the Muten Rōshi. The Muten rōshi are known for being extremely peaceful and patient people. It seems they are the very embodiment of the idea that nothing ever truly changes, so much so that the only way to get the Mute Rōshis to change their ways is to take them into a new space, which they must find. The Tatame Galaxy is a peaceful galaxy of green plants. While the Mutes are the most peaceful of the group, the Mune Rōs are known to be the most vicious, vicious and violent. There is a saying amongst the Monse Rōsan, "Nothing is ever their fault. There are no problems. They are beyond human understanding." I have seen and loved the original and have been anticipating this remake for a long time. The story follows the adventures of Koyori and her friend Chikage. The movie was quite good, but I will not be giving it any stars because I thought it could have been a little better. The animation and special effects were good, and I loved the voice work of the Mumes. If you are looking for a good, relaxing, good-natured alien adventure with some comedy thrown in, then look no further.  Review written by Steven H.  is the most successful Japanese anime of all time and also the most popular in America. This was the first anime to become a huge cultural phenomenon. It was so popular that the TV version was dubbed by American network TV and the DVD version has become a major hit in Japan as well.The Tatami Universe is an animated TV series based on the manga of the same name. A large part of the plot revolves around an alien race, theMute Roids. TheMuteRoid's are extremely docile and patient, not at all like their violent and bloodthirsty alien cousins. This is the story of two human girls named Koyomi and Chikako and their adventures aboard the space ship Tatami Galaxy, which is about to depart Earth for a new home.The story is interesting in that the MUTES, the aliens, are portrayed very realistically, and it is interesting to see
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Watch The Hunger Games. If not to pass time on the long bus ride to class or to escape the tedium of the day, to get a glimpse of Katniss, to watch a character that is so thoroughly fascinating in person, and to be moved and thrilled by the way they move and breathe. I've watched it a bunch of times. I think I've read the book and still loved it. It is definitely the best film adaptation ever. Now, go buy a pair of headphones to listen to it while you eat your cereal. If you haven't watched the movie, do yourself a favor and go do that. It's the best adaptation since the original book.  If you've watched the movies, I recommend The Hunger games is by far one of the most brilliant, moving, and gripping movies ever made. It takes place in District 12, which is in the northwest corner of Panem, the fictional country in which The HungerGames are set. Panem is ruled by Katnap's brother Prim, whose main goal is to destroy the other districts, all to prevent his sister Prim from becoming king. The district of North is the main rival of PanEM's North District. When Prim wins the upcoming Hunger Games in North, a civil war begins to break out and will eventually come to a climax on the streets of District 12. The action takes place around the year 1984, which was the year after the death of his wife Katnara. The Hungergames are a national event where the young people of PanEm compete to the death in a series of Hunger Games competitions for a chance at becoming the new Hunger Games king. Each of the districts has their own theme: Katnagans are the brave and selfless, while Catching Fire are the daring and powerful, and the last two are The Hunger and The Fates. There are a total of twelve districts (six for each book), each with its own leader, and a large arena to the arena. A team of ten people, which includes four teachers and a leader, known as a chieftain, is assembled to train each district. In District 12's training arena, Katnainte, Kat's teacher, is beaten up by Kat's brother Mockingjay in a game of chess. Katnish and her teacher decide to quit and go into hiding. While Katnana is with her teacher, Katnis and her new friend Gale are playing a game. Katnis is

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ The first one that I had seen of this series was actually in the middle of the year (2002) and I had a friend of mine who I had to buy the whole series just to watch it with him. I am sorry that the whole story doesn't make sense (but it was actually a lot of fun and I really liked it), but I would recommend this one to anyone. __________________________________ The story of the movie is that a strange "monster" has just invaded a town, and that the townsfolk are being chased after it. In the course of the chase, they all become victims of the monster as well as being eaten by it. The first time that I heard the description of it was during the beginning of the film, and I have never been so fascinated with a monster. It seemed to be that the creatures from the planet Mars were coming from the sky and that they were attacking Earth on a daily basis (as the film showed that it had been happening for years), and that these creatures are being fed by the humans and that this is why they are attacking, as the human is being fed and kept alive in the monster by feeding it its food. We then got to see a few scenes with the creature and how it works. We see that the monster has the ability to take over people's bodies in the town where it is lurking, and it was also able to take a small child's body with it when it attacked the children in the woods. The whole process went on for around 30 minutes, and during that time I was thinking that the story was so interesting and exciting that I was completely hooked to watch the next movie in the series. After I have finished the whole movie, I can only say that the series is fantastic and that I am very sad that the first movie that I saw didn't make much sense in the story, but it was a lot funnier and it had the characters that I found to be very likable and interesting (in my opinion). I am glad that I took the time to watch these movies and I hope that they will continue to appear on my DVD-R someday.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ A great comedy about a woman whose dream is to get her parents out of debt and become an artist. She moves back in with her parents and realizes that they are in debt as well. The movie starts out by having her sister and father talk about how her mom has made her feel guilty and like a bad daughter. It's all her fault that she has a lot of money. After her mother is dead, she is left alone with her father and stepmother, who are her only real friends. She gets rid of her old boyfriend and does some illegal things to gain some money to help her mom. When she is a bit better off, she moves into her mom's house again. She finds out that the money she was using to get out of her debt is not enough to do it. She decides to find a job at the local department store and work the cash register. She also finds a job as a security guard. I think the movie is well made. I thought that the characters were real and the story kept me interested. I enjoyed the music and the actors in the movie. I also liked the comedy. I did like the way the characters talked about things. One of the characters was so mean and so mean that I laughed the whole time. I didn't think it was a good idea for her to get married to one of the older people in the town.  Did you like this movie? If so, what did you think about it?

It was kind of funny. It wasn't funny at all. It could have been. There was so much dialogue and so much talking that it was hard to understand what the actual point of the movie was. There is a lot of humor here but it never really builds up to anything. It seems like this is a film that is meant to be enjoyed during lunch time. I'm glad I got that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the kind of movie that you remember for a long time. It's kind of funny too because it is funny. A young actor, Ben Mendelsohn, and a young actress, Meryl Streep, go through a whole bunch of things. They don't really get into it in the movie. We get in the car and go off to New York and we go to the set of some plays that she's done and she was supposed to do with the actor that she was dating at the time. The other actress comes to her and says, "We're getting divorced." They have no money. She's the only wife, so she starts looking for an actress and the other actress says, 'Well, she doesn't look like the kind that I can marry.' Well, they go to a studio to see who would work. It would have been in the 1920s, right? But that's their first attempt at doing it and they end up with a guy named John Gielgud. But that was too soon. She had done the play and then she tried to get into this business. That's the beginning of it all. So we get to the point where we have a new wife who is a very talented actress in Dorothy Lamour. She is played by Meryl, but she's also a talented actress. When you look at the films, that was probably the first film that I saw that she'd done. She was in all of them. They all were in the New York City area. I thought it was so funny. The reason that I say this is because it was funny that she couldn't do the stage because she didn't want to go out and play with all those people. She wanted to have some privacy. But she wanted to do it and she got it. She won all the awards. You know, it was always a very difficult situation for her because she wasn't a great actor. I don't think she was that great in movies at that time. That was the first time where she got all these awards. I think she is a great actress now. She really is. It wasn't very long, it only ran for one season and that was really long. 5.  The Last Detail  (1972) Ben Gazzara: Well, that's kind-of funny because that movie was directed by Mel Brooks. The picture was made at Paramount by an artist named George Marshall. And

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is about the first time I saw my boyfriends little brother get shot in the back. Now he was only 9 years old and I was about 17 at the time, but it's a very sobering movie and shows the fear that comes with being in a crowd with a gun. It's not as simple as being in that crowd and getting shot, but even then it took a long time for it to hit me that something like this could happen to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I'll start off by saying this film has been one of my favorite films of all time. For many years I've loved the films of Wes Craven and I always found it sad that he was not around to direct more of his films.  However, as the years have passed and the films have become more and more dated, I have grown to appreciate how good these movies are.  When you take a film as great as this and add a great performance by Gary Oldman, a fantastic story that is full of twists and turns, and a great cast of talented actors who have all contributed to making the story so enjoyable, you have the recipe for a great movie.   A great plot with an extremely well developed plot:  The film opens up on a man named Tom and a woman named Lillian.  We soon learn that both of them are out to murder the man who will be in control of their lives, Gary Old Man (Gary Oldman).  In order to do this they are using a drug called "The Shadow", which is a drug that makes the person who takes it feel like they are losing control of the person they are inhabiting.  The two of them, along with Gary Olds son Charlie (Javier Bardem), decide to go to the man in control and bring him down.  This is where the story gets incredibly interesting.  It is at this point that we learn that the Shadow is a product of the government who want to keep the population ignorant to what their leaders are doing to them.  In this way, the people will never understand what is happening.  These people, the real people, are only told that these are people who are going to be taken care of.  While the people are being taken care off, they are being programmed and trained to become soldiers in order to take care of those who are being watched.  They are sent out into the world to get them.   The Shadow is basically a weapon that is created to take over people.  When the Shadow enters the brain it makes the victim feel the way they feel about the Shadow.  Those who are taken over become controlled by the Shadow, and when they take over the victim, the Shadow takes over.  However, when the victim has control over themselves they will be able to cut off the Shadow from their minds.  To do this, they must have an encounter with a demon.  Demons are spirits of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that "Dawn of the Dead" is a great movie, not only because of the fantastic horror movie atmosphere, but also because of its excellent story and interesting characters. The movie is not very scary, and this is why I like it so much. The plot is about a zombie attack in the near future, and it is a very interesting and original idea, that I really enjoyed. There is also a little romance, which is not too common in zombie movies, but I think it is really cute and worth seeing. The story takes a turn in the middle, when a young woman, Laura (played by Laura Linney), gets bitten by a zombie, and she discovers that the zombie was not infected from some wild animal, but rather she was bitten by the perfect human being, her boyfriend Paul (played perfectly by David Morse). Now the plot is pretty simple, and the best part is that it has a really great ending, which makes the movie an even more memorable experience for all the viewers. The only problem I had with the movie was that the characters didn't seem to connect as well as they could, especially with Paul and Laura. I would have liked to see more of their relationship, and more of the relationship between Laura and Paul. I'm not saying that I love the relationship, because I think that it's not as deep as the romance between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in "Lone Survivor", but it's still really cute. I don't know why, but the movie didn't do well in the reviews. I think its problems can be divided into two parts. The first part was that it didn't really go with the genre and didn't make any sense, although it's true that it had the best horror atmosphere I've ever seen in a horror movie. The second problem was the acting, which really made me hate Paul and his girlfriend, Laura. They did not fit the roles, and didn'dactely were too good to be in the same movie. Now I don´t know what I was expecting. I thought the movie would be just like any other zombie movie, which would be a great thing. The thing that I found very annoying is that the movie ended on a very boring note, and there was no need to finish it at all. I really liked the concept of the movie, and I hope it gets a remake. I recommend this movie to all of my friends.

The main characters were awesome and the story line did get really interesting. The only thing that might have been better is if the two other boys didn't show up after the film ends, but maybe that could have been done at the end if they weren't really into the story and didn't really care about the two main boys.

The best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date.  If you have watched the movie you know that it is not really a sequel, more of an extended version.  It feels like a whole new movie. It isn't really about The Avengers anymore, it is about Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.  In fact I would argue that it has more of a love story in it.  It has some awesome action scenes, great character development and it is well shot.  My favorite part was the end credits. The story really does a great job of making you feel like you are there on the battlefield.  The special effects were great, the music was great.  There is also a great bit of humour in the film, a good use of music and action and some funny lines.  Overall it was an enjoyable film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lone Survivor is not as bad as you might think. The movie's main character, a Navy SEAL who suffers from PTSD is not all he seems to be. A former SEAL himself, he spends the movie trying to find his place in this new world. He learns to adapt and be more of a normal person, which makes for a good, well made, action movie. This movie is a great reminder to us all that there are good people in this world that want to fight for what is right. I recommend Lone Survivor to all SEAL-types, especially ones who have PTSD. The reason I'm rating this so low?  I wish more action movies would not be so violent. I have a hard time believing that someone could actually be killed in a movie, much less die in one on one combat. I can only imagine the toll it takes on the real people behind the camera. Lone Survivor was originally written and directed by an Academy Award winning writer named Chris Kyle. His film is one of the few that deals with this topic without glorifying it. While there are many excellent action movies about soldiers who have been wounded or killed in action, no movie really delves into the psychological impact this could have on a family member. Lone Star Survivor is a film that deals openly with the effect it has on a person. For all the violence in the movie, it is a movie about surviving in a harsh, unforgiving world. I really enjoyed this movie, and I have heard it is great on the big screen. You should watch it if you like action, a good story, and a good dose of PTSD.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* I think I was the only person to watch this when it first came out (but it was also on cable), and I was quite surprised at how much it turned out to be. I'm very glad I did, especially considering how much I knew about what the movie would be.   I enjoyed the characters very much. I was always wondering if they would be able to work things out. This gave me a very good reason to feel they were going to, but it's interesting that the film ends on this note, instead of just continuing on forever.   it was a little surprising how well the movie is shot. it's an old film, and the effects were done well. The acting is strong, and I enjoyed some of the scenes very much (I liked the fight scene very much, even though it was at the end of the movie. I also liked the way she was played by Susan Sarandon).   There were quite a lot of people that were disappointed with this movie, because the ending was a letdown for many people. I thought that it was well written, and was a well written thriller. It kept me interested throughout, and wasn't a let down at all. I wouldn't have minded a few more scenes. If you are a fan of thrillers, and you are bored of these modern thrillers that are just too long and boring, than this is a good one.

There are not enough laughs in this movie and there is no one to laugh with. The only thing good about this film is the acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie, and I think it was much better than it looks. I think people that are into the dark and violent side of things will like this movie, I mean I could watch this and never worry about anything.  I enjoyed the film and look forward to seeing more, this is the movie I am waiting for.  One of the many moments that really made this film interesting was when we see the two families and their children running away from their killers.  This film has a few scenes that were very disturbing and I had to stop the movie several times in order to recover.  Another thing I found interesting is the ending, I do not know if this will be remembered in the same way as the original, but I will say I found it rather unexpected.  One of the best parts about this movie is the fact that it is not over the top violent or scary at all.   The film does not rely on gore and screams for laughs, instead the actors and crew make you feel for the characters and their lives.  I think that the way the film ends is a little disappointing though, especially since it has such a strong ending.  The movie ends with a happy ending, but the final scene could have been a little more satisfying.   Overall this is an excellent movie and a great reminder that it pays to be careful around dangerous and weird situations.   Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1yfI5iP

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What movie to watch? My Pick: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel __________________________________________ I was thinking of watching this with my girlfriend who didn't seem to like this one that much. However, my friends told me that I should watch it. _______________________________________________________ My girlfriend and I decided to watch The Best of the Best on DVD because it's such a great movie. The movie's premise was pretty simple, a man (Jason Flemyng) is looking for his best friend (Steve Carell) who has been missing for a few days. When he goes to his friend's house and finds out that he has been partying with all these exotic women, he realizes that his friend is not as crazy as he originally thought. I loved the movie, it's a nice blend of comedy and suspense. The main character, Steve Carell is great. I found him to be kind of annoying, he was always so cocky and never really did anything good for anyone. However he does a lot of bad stuff that's just ridiculous. The ending was pretty good. _____________________________ My wife and I watched this movie in the car one night when we were tired. The opening was pretty short, but it was ok. The rest of the movie was really good. The girl was really cute. She was a total slut, and the guys all had to watch and laugh at her, she got a lot and it got to the point where I just started laughing. It was pretty funny. There are many people who have mentioned that the ending was kind of stupid. Personally, I didn't think it was a dumb ending, I think that it was very well thought out. I also think that they did the right thing with the ending, and I think it's ok. __________________ This movie has been one of my favorites for a long time. The story is kind of lame, but at least the plot is interesting. It's just a bunch of funny characters, lots of characters and lots of funny moments. _____________ ____________ I first saw this movie a couple of years ago when it was shown on the DVD in a theater in a small town in upstate New York. I've wanted to see it ever since and have been watching it on Netflix a lot over the last couple of weeks, and it's been a great deal of fun watching it with my dad, and my nephew. ______________________________________________________________________________________ I've always been a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ The story of The Matrix takes place in a dystopian future, where humans are forced to work for large corporations that have created and maintained a computer simulation of the world, called The Matrix. The workers are divided into four teams, A through H, which must work to maintain the virtual reality, or matrix, to satisfy the need of the corporations. The A team members have been sent to a virtual simulation called the "mainframe" which serves as a prison for those who rebel against the matrix. The B team members are tasked with monitoring the mainframe, while the C team is tasked with maintaining the virtual world. As you play, your team's progress is tracked in a database called "The Matrix Database". There is a large amount of action and suspense in The Matrix where you have to stay alive by completing certain tasks to gain access to the mainframes of the other teams, to escape the virtual matrix and go back to your original body. The characters are great and seem real. I really liked them. The story is set up in such a way that you can't go wrong if you choose to play through this. The movie is set around a group of people, all of whom are trying to escape their prison. This story gives you a lot of different ways to approach the story. I like how it is set so that you don't know who is who at first, and that makes for a more interesting story. The only real problem with this movie is the fact that there was a couple of minor problems with the film's plot. Some of the characters seemed a little out of place at first. The first time I heard the word "cinematic" I had no idea what that meant, but now I know what the people in The Machine were trying to do. The second time it happened I found it pretty distracting as well. The voice acting is decent, the music is good and the action is good as well, but I found the story a little hard to get past the first time you hear it. The other problems I found were pretty minor. The last few minutes of the movie were pretty frustrating. I know that it is just for the final moments of the film, but it was really not the end to the story, and if you are a hardcore fan of this movie, then you will want to skip over it. All in all, The Matrix is a very entertaining and good looking movie. I liked it and I recommend it to any

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________ ___________  There are a few positives that I found in the movie:  The story is funny, at least for me. A guy with a huge cock who is unable to have an orgasm gets a girl to do something she hates and is very shy to do in front of others so he gets her to do it while he watches her from the side (and at first it seems like she is enjoying herself). When he gets to the last few minutes of the movie he realizes that she was not enjoying it and is not even sure if she enjoys what she is doing (and even if she is, it probably isn't as intense as he thinks). This really helped the movie to get a laugh out of me. The characters have good chemistry with each other and it seems that they really care about each other (even the girl who is the worst fucker in the world is nice and funny to see)  I have seen the movie before but I felt that the movie needed to be rewatched to understand the different scenes better. I'm glad that I rew watched it because the plot is a bit different. Overall the movie was a nice one but I don't think that I would watch it again.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I know that I have reviewed a lot of horror movies that are not in my top ten. I've been pretty busy lately, and I haven't had a chance to go back and see these old movies again. I am not sure if it's because they're too old to enjoy or what. These old movies are so funny and weird that they're still very entertaining to watch. I was actually really disappointed with "Jaws 2." But I'm glad I watched it anyway. I did like "The Amityville Horror" and "Ghostface" in addition to the original "Jaw" and the remake. But I think "JAW 2" is the best of the original four movies. I can't believe that they made another one. So now I'll watch that next. The "Jenny Jones" is an awesome character. She is hilarious and always wants to do the right thing. I think she's the best character in the series. I just wish that they would have made her a main character. I wouldn't want to miss her in any of the other movies. This movie is a lot better than the "Dirty Dancing" movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Man from UNCLE __________________ Reviewed by David O'Connell (GuitarMan) A friend of mine sent me this and I had to watch it in the middle of the week when I had nothing else to do, I'm pretty sure that it has been in the running for many years on "Must See" list! Great movie, good acting, and excellent music, it's a nice time for all of us. If you like the movies from 1970's then this movie will be very similar to that one but with a little more depth! As a teenager I've always been interested in the early music videos and I think it's only because of this movie that I was introduced to this kind of music. I also think that I saw this movie in my early teens but I'm not sure. Anyway, I like how the movie starts with an action scene (one of my favorite from the movie!) and then the music starts up in the last twenty seconds, not sure when the music was added but I think that it may have been after the music of the movie had finished. I'm still a bit puzzled as to why the music stopped there? Anyway, this is one of the more unique movies I've ever seen, it seems that it is a "feel" movie as far as I can remember. I enjoyed it so much because I love the music and also the acting (both good), and I also enjoyed the humor of the characters. It's a wonderful movie that's been made all these years and I believe that it deserves a place on every "must see" list. It still stands up on my "Must Watch" list because of the great music from the 70's! Recommended for fans of the 70s and 80's.

Write a positive review about a good movie: o           .      Catherine, the main character of this movie, is a young woman who loves books. She's a good kid, very brave, and in love with her best friend, the boy-next-door, and her father who loves her very much. But something terrible happened to her dad, and it will take all of her strength to find her way through this town without losing her dad again.   When I first saw this film, I saw the story and the setting. At first, the film did not have a lot of depth, and I thought it would be difficult to enjoy, and for me to fully understand what was going on in the story. But I was wrong, it was actually a very simple and easy-to-follow story, which is what I love the most in a film. When you do not know what is going on, you just focus on your character's behavior and your enjoyment of the movie.   the movie starts with the story of a beautiful young woman, Catherine (Anne Hathaway), who is the main characters of the film. She was left in the middle of nowhere, as a result of the death of her father, and was left alone. She lives with her mother (Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they have a relationship that is so good that even their mother loves them too. This story begins in the same place, so to speak. Catherine is still very young, so she has just been taken in by her mother, who does not understand why her daughter is going through so much pain. And it gets even more confusing when she realizes she may have to get used to the fact that she can not go home anymore. The movie tells you very quickly what has happened to Catherine's father. The story becomes darker and sadder as it continues, but the whole thing is well-paced, and does not become too confusing at all. The way the film tells its story is very simple, and the story is well written, so you can quickly enjoy the story as you watch it.

It is not a bad movie, but it is not great either. _________   A must see. Sandra was so much fun to watch. I will probably keep going back to this. It's a well acted movie that has a lot to offer in the way of humor, drama and a real sense of place. Sandra's life took a turn for the worse after this film.  …

It has a good cast and is entertaining, but it just doesn't stand out.  I guess that's the point.    This was the first movie where I saw some of the actors and realized that they could have been any of the characters.  For starters, there's a guy who is the most boring character I have ever seen. The guy just stands around talking and never really seems to do anything. His line "That's what you get for buying my book" is a really old line and has never been made in a movie before.  In addition, I find that all the other actors and actresses all look the same. I never thought this film could be that bad, but there were things that weren't working for me in this film. I really enjoyed the musical, however.  "

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The movie is in the best of the worst kind of genre, and that is a genre that usually doesn't get much respect as a genre, except it's one of the best, so it's hard to hate it. The story starts off when two strangers are at a hotel on an assignment, but the man from the office is missing and his boss has a nasty surprise when he wakes up at the hotel to discover that he left a dead body at the scene. It's not a very interesting first episode of a TV show, as it doesn't really explain much about what the job of a reporter entails. And the guy, Ben, who is a reporter is really dull, which isn't that bad, and is actually quite funny at times, but it's nothing special to see a reporter, especially an attractive one, doing an assignment. Ben, is a bit more interesting, he's not dull and he's certainly not boring, he just doesn't stand out very much. And we don't get too much of anything else in this episode, we don not even see much of the hotel. We do see the movie "The Exorcist" which is a good one to see, and we see it with the same old story, the same people, and the same hotel which is also very dull and boring. The end of the episode is quite disappointing, as we see a little bit more of the scene with the man who left the dead body on the floor, but we never see the hotel or the guy who killed him. The ending of the first episode is disappointing because it's the first time we see more of what this story is going to be about. And even after that, the end of this episode is very disappointing, even more so after watching the movie. The second episode is somewhat better, but not much better. The episode begins with Ben and the girl having some fun in the shower. However, before long, they realize the guy from the paper is missing, and he turns up as the murderer, so Ben must go out and find the guy to find out who did this to the guy. The first scene we see is a nice and simple one, and Ben decides to go with the guy because he has a lot of good stories to tell, which makes him look good, and then Ben and Ben go out to find the murderer. The rest of the story is really bland, and not as interesting as before, and it seems like it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this instance, I was completely blown away by what I saw.  I've always been into comedy and the more outrageous a comedy is, the more I enjoy it.  If you haven't seen "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" then you're really missing out on something special.  The show focuses on a group of college friends at a place called a "factory".  The main character (Charlie) is the gang's manager and the main reason they have a factory is to get rid of the high schoolers who make them miserable.  Charlie and his gang manage a warehouse filled with high school students and their parents.  As it turns out, all of the students are a group who are being held captive by some of the higher-ups in the factory.  This leads to a fun group adventure.  There are a few comedy bits that I liked such as the way the character with the bad accent and the crazy mom, are both voiced by Charlie's real life girlfriend, Gail,  and the fact that there was an entire episode devoted to the parents of the kids in the warehouse (you get to meet a lot of them).  The one thing that kept it from being perfect was that I wished there had been more episodes.    That being said, I would highly recommend "It Always Sunny In Philadelphia"  If you haven`t seen it, "It`s Always Sunny" is a show for all ages.  I would recommend " It`s Never Sunny In Philly "

But Bubble realizes that he is falling in love with Yuka, and that he must make a choice between himself and Mimi. The film, written by Yasuo Ozawa, is well-written with beautiful cinematography, a good story, and excellent characters. The music is not quite as good as the sound design.

It is easy to watch all the parts and understand what is happening.  The story line is good, and the characters are well played.  This is a film that I hope people get to watch more of in the future.   If you have not seen Die Hard yet then I recommend getting it. The film is an all star team and is definitely worth the watch.

The music was excellent, the actors were very well cast and the story was exciting. It really gets a bit eerie at the end which was kind of cool. I recommend this to everyone because it is a fun movie to watch and I can see myself watching it over and over again. If you're into horror then this is a must watch. Posted by Chris at 9:18 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ A film with the name of this blog would be just another boring film. But when it comes to this flick we are presented with the story of an individual who falls into the abyss of self-destruction when the world starts to fall apart around him. In his desperate attempts to save himself from the pain, the person we have seen before tries to kill his own children by hiding them in boxes. But what happens when a man's entire world falls to pieces in a matter of weeks? The answer to that is…Nothing! A film of that quality deserves a sequel, that's for sure. This is the kind of film that's worth seeing multiple times if you're looking for a film with a great plot, and a good story. So if you haven't already, I suggest you give this one a try. - David P.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is one of the greatest and most original films in recent memory.  It is a brilliant piece of film making from start to finish and it is also a classic in a way I doubt that is possible at the age of 30.  I really enjoy the film and I have been following it since it came out.  I think that it is one movie that will be in my top 5 list forever.  It is not a perfect movie, not by a long shot, and that is why I enjoyed it so much.  But I really loved it and I can honestly say that if I could go back in time I would have watched it from start-to-finish.   So why did I like it so damn much?  I am not going to say that it was perfect.  While the ending is what makes this movie unique, and is the reason that I could love it so deeply, I can see how other people might see a different ending and find the whole thing as a bit boring.  And I don't want to get into that discussion right now.  No, what really got me to love this movie was not the ending.  In fact I think the movie could have ended very differently and left a much better impression on us.  Yes, the ending of the movie was a bit odd, and yes, it felt a bit contrived.  The thing that I love about this movie is how all the characters feel real and real.  As real as people can feel and be in a movie about a hotel.  This is the first movie that has me really emotionally involved, and for a movie that I don' t really think about too much. I do enjoy the ending a lot and the overall feel of the film.  To get the true feelings of the hotel for me, the most important thing that it did was it showed us the hotel as a place where love, loss, and laughter co-exist as a good part of the day's entertainment.   It shows us how wonderful a place a hotel can be, as well as how beautiful the architecture of a hotel is.  All of this is shown in the most beautifully shot film I have ever seen.  Everything that is shown is beautiful, and the lighting, the costumes, and even the food were all just as gorgeous as they looked on the screen.  After this movie, I don 't think that I will ever

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I was looking forward to this movie but i didn't expect the movie to be as good as it was. The story is very simple, it is about a cop, he and his partner (and a couple of criminals) goes to a small town to catch a man who has killed his family. After capturing the criminal they are ambushed by other criminals and are forced to flee. They escape the city and head to the forest where they meet a little girl who calls herself "Gunny" and tells them how to get home. The first part of the movie is very much like the first part in "The Goonies" which means there are tons of things to do and see, and the music is very fun to listen to. The movie has some great dialogue that is hilarious and the ending was very good. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who likes action-packed thrillers.

The best thing about this movie is the ending! There are many references to other movies and it's really funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Share   Tweet   Share on Facebook  There is a good case to be made that the films of the Coen Brothers (as well as the other brothers) deserve their place in the pantheon of American independent film. They've crafted stories of the American Dream, of a generation on the rise. They're able to do this because of the depth of characters, the complex characters, and their ability to explore the issues that plague people, whether or not the protagonists have that same perspective. The films of Joel and Ethan Coen have a profound effect on our culture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few months ago I bought this movie (and this website) on DVD (and it looks like a nice quality movie!) It features a young woman who is trying to get revenge on her rapist who she had been raped by while he was drunk. The girl is the sole survivor in the crime and the guy she is trying revenge upon has done all kinds of things to her that have made her have a hard time getting over it. The guy rapes many other women in this movie, so the girl has a hard enough time dealing with being the only survivor...the guy, being a pretty cool guy, gets all the guys on his side by giving them free tickets to the next bar. Then, as his last wish, he gets to keep her panties and sends them off in a box with the girl's picture on it. That's the only time this movie doesn't end in a rape. It's just over in a minute. But it does end in some kind of sex scene (in which the guy uses his teeth to keep the girl from removing her panties), and then the movie ends. As a porn, this movie has some pretty good sex scenes that are really well done. It has some very good acting. And the guy (played by the good-looking Michael Patrick Phillips) is a very hot guy (which is why this movie is great porn). A couple of weeks ago I found this movie on the web. I had never heard of it before, but now I am thinking of buying this on DVD. I love the movie. If you like sex and you love revenge, then this is the movie for you. If not, it might not be for you either (though it should be if you like revenge porn.) But it doesn't matter. If revenge porn is your thing, then check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... A man (Daniel Radcliffe) decides that he wants to be a writer. He decides to be in a drama class, but when he goes to read the novel, he finds out the teacher (Daniel Craig) is not very good at his job. He finds out that the novel's author (Daniel Brühl) has become a famous writer of thrillers. He is not an expert in the field, and he doesn't really know what he's doing. He tries to get his book published, but he's not very successful. Daniel ends up being in love with the editor (Greta Gerwig). She takes him to the literary festival, and, despite not being a great writer, he makes an effort to impress the judges. It seems that he will succeed, and his book will be published. However, he decides to read more about the field of literature, and discovers a book called The Grapes of Wrath. The story is about a man who goes to jail for killing his family. He manages to survive by pretending to be God, and eventually convinces a whole town that he is God. The film is a modern interpretation of a traditional epic tale. The movie is not well-loved, but it has a certain charm and charm that is well-worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I'm not going to try and compare this to any of the other books in my collection. If I was a film critic, I'd be calling it: A good book, a good director, a well acted movie, a smart book, an interesting story, an amusing novel, and a good novel. I also loved the style of storytelling here, which is often not my favorite: This was very similar to the style used by Stephen King (he used the same techniques here). This book was much more subtle and involved than King's books, but also much more intense and intense. Also, it made me very angry. Yes, it was about a young girl that loses her mother but goes to a very weird house and is forced to live with a family of creepy old people. It was a very strange story and it was really strange to read. One point I would make is that it was quite a long book, with over 150 pages in it, and I think it's a good length. I just felt that this was a good book. I thought the ending was really well done.Overall, I really enjoyed this book, it had me thinking a lot, it has a good ending, it is unique, it isn't like anything else I have read in a while and it's one of the rare times I have seen a book get good reviews on Goodreads. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horror, has read Stephen King, and likes an interesting and bizarre story. The cover and title, are pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________   This is a very good film, it is the kind of movie that will not give you any nightmares, but will leave you smiling. I am very happy with it, I really like it.   What I can say about this movie is that the acting is good, the directing is good and the story is interesting and well told, the acting in particular is quite good and has some very good acting, it has to be remembered that the main character is a rather dull man who has a sort of an almost passive personality, but who gets into a sorta silly sort of mood when he thinks he is being observed.  , for the most part the story was quite good, although I think I had some minor issues with some of the writing, there is a scene that I quite liked where a soldier is walking down a street with his weapon on his hip, the scene where he hears an aircraft in the distance and looks to his left to see if there is an aircraft, and then he sees something that looks like a big red head in a dark suit walks down the street and then suddenly the scene changes to something totally different, it makes it difficult to believe that this is the same man, who is walking in the exact same direction as the man he saw in the street, that is to say, it seems as though the story would have been better if the two men had actually been in the same place at the same time, but I am willing to overlook that little flaw because the overall story is very good.   He is also somewhat of a hero, not really, although he does have a few good and sometimes very good moments, as you can imagine it does not make him an outstanding actor, but still this character is extremely well developed and the script allows for this kind of character to come to life.   and the film does have some good music and one of my favorites of the film. I found the ending to be quite a good one.  .        If you enjoyed this review you may like some of my other reviews.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The best part of this movie is that it was really fun to watch. It was not too long or too boring, but it was enough that you do not feel like it was too long. The story itself is kind of ridiculous, as some of the characters (including the one's in the movie) think that their love is something that has been around since the beginning of time, like a myth or something. I would not be able to accept that they truly love one another, as it would be too much for them. If you're a fan of fantasy stories, I would say that this is not the kind of movie that you can just skip to.  A wonderful movie about love that actually makes you fall in love!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Million Dollar Baby was an incredibly fun film. "Million Dollars Baby" was a fun little comedy, though I'm not sure if its subject matter had any lasting impact. I can only imagine how great this could have been with more time. It has all the hallmarks of a good comedy: a funny young guy doing stupid things, and an annoying older man (played by Billy Crystal) who keeps him from being successful. It's actually kind of cute how they play it as a bad guy-with-a-heart. If you think of it that way, it seems much more natural and enjoyable. It was funny, but in a very silly, kid-centric way.  The story is basically the same as "A Fish Called Wanda" (a.k.a. "Wanda"), the story of a child who gets a fish called Wanda, and tries to make a good life out of it. This leads her to do a variety of foolish things, such as taking a life-size dollhouse to the ocean, or jumping into a pool of goldfish.  The young guy in this one is just as annoying as his counterpart in "A fish called wanda," the same way that "A few good men" is just like that other "few good men." There are even some "bad guys" who play the role of "funny bad guys" - though it doesn't really seem that funny, and they mostly just talk and seem to annoy the other person, rather than being an actual threat.   This movie is pretty fun to watch, but it does have its flaws. The ending is not that great, and doesn't exactly resolve things satisfactorily, but there's some redeeming value in the story. There are a number of songs from "Wings," including "You've Changed," "The Ballad of 'Wanda," and "You're Welcome." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only major downside is that the characters are mostly one-dimensional, but then, one-dimensionality in the right genre doesn't sound that bad. The humor is dry, the characters often suffer from stupidity, and the music is occasionally out-of-place. However, this one's a fun movie, especially for its time, and has a unique twist that works as a decent follow up to the original, even if it's a little cheesy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ 'The Book of Eli' is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. It's a well made, fun, and heartwarming story. The film starts out with a young boy in an Indian village and the two main protagonists: the older brother and his sister. He is obsessed with his father and doesn't like his mother. His sister was forced to work at the village mill. She is a good girl, kind, and loves her brothers. After working at the mill for a while, she decides to leave. The two go on a journey to find her and bring her back. I think the whole point of the story is to show how the two are really close and how they need each other. It would be nice if there was more of a focus on the older sister in the film. There is a lot of drama in the beginning and there are some dark scenes in the middle but the final half is the most dramatic and emotional part of the film and I found it so very endearing. It takes place in one week and it's an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves you with a smile on your face. The soundtrack in the final scene is perfect as well. I wish this movie was more about the older sibling. It is sad when it ends but the story was so well told and acted. I would love to see more stories like this in the future. I give The Book of ail the thumbs up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a nice little romantic comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome, and does a good job of balancing comedy with character work, both of which were very enjoyable.  There is something about the way they blend the two that makes me feel like a big kid.  They're both pretty much perfect in their own way and both seem to work very well as part of a larger picture.  The movie also had me looking forward to the end of it, as the movie seemed to have a much more mature tone in some places (most notably the sex) than I was expecting.   One word of caution, though.  I would NOT recommend this movie to a 14-year old boy who wants to be a professional wrestler.  It's very heavy on the wrestling, which is not the type of thing you want to have happening to a guy in your family.  While it's definitely one of the more "adult" things I've seen, I wouldn't put it on my annual "Adult" watch list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  The first time I saw "It Follows" at a theater it was so dark and foreboding it felt like a ghost story. But the more I watched it, the more it became something special. The twist of the story wasn't a shock but something that was always there. The performance of Maika Monroe really impressed me, she was able to bring such an evil character to life.  If you liked "It" then you'll absolutely love this. ,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I'm not sure if the title is really "The Last Days of Pompeii," or not, but that is the best title I can think of. This was a really good movie, despite the fact that it was not particularly good. This is another in the series of films about the Battle of Pompey, and again the movie tries to do a "good" battle and ends up with one that is very silly and pointless. I thought it had a great story that was set in the Roman era. But the whole film is like a train wreck, so in the end it just becomes boring. If you don't like movies where people do something bad, then you might want to turn this off. It has some nice set pieces, but it is just too much to get through in any amount of time. A couple of the characters have some funny scenes, but the rest of the movie is just boring, and it is not a good film. There are two sequels to this one, which I haven't seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Thief is a great thriller starring Robert De Niro and Bruce Willis.  It's a movie that takes place during the mid-1960's and focuses on a group of thieves, two of whom are former New York City Police detectives and the third is a rookie cop who works in a South Bronx precinct. The movie deals with a robbery in an old hotel and their attempt to pull off the heist as well as the consequences of the job.  De Niry and Willis take great advantage of the fact that no one in the group has ever been in any police academy.  While their skills are clearly their own, their approach to the job doesn't quite fit with the traditional cop/private eyes model. The film moves at a brisk pace and is filled with great acting and suspenseful scenes. De Nire and Willis bring out some of the best parts of their respective actors and provide some great characterizations of the robbers.  Although the film doesn't have any huge moments or plot twists, it's definitely worth watching for the acting alone. I also really enjoyed the fact the movie was shot in black and white instead of the usual color film.  I would highly recommend this movie and I am sure you will too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are three good movies in here; two action/sci-fi movies with great action scenes and a great sci-fi movie with awesome special effects. I'm going to call these the best of the bunch.  Now, I know, you're probably thinking, 'If I just could have seen this and not this then I wouldn't have paid for this, why should I pay for it when the other two are so much better?' Well, you would have been wrong because I do have a lot more problems with the action scenes in this film than the sci-fis in those two, and the second is better for me, IMHO, but the fact is that the sci fi movie does stand out from the rest and it has great special effects, good effects, and great special effect.   The third one isn't as good as the others but it's still good.  In fact, it might even be better than the first movie, which is an accolade I don't usually give. So, if you like action/action, sci- fi, and/or fun, then you should really go see 'The Rocketeer'.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best feature of this movie is its acting. Its mostly young actors and the movie just takes itself seriously throughout the whole movie. There are moments where the movie starts to get a little silly but I guess it works because the film is good!   It also shows that the Japanese have a good understanding of the American system and I think it will take the country quite a few years before we can learn from the way the Japanese handle our own problems.   A couple of notes about this movie: First of all, this is not an American film, this film is Japanese. It uses some traditional Japanese films that were made in the 1930s and 1940s. Second, there is an American woman in the movie as well as some Japanese men. They get a lot of lines because they play a couple of important roles in the story and they all seem to have some sort of understanding of each other. Third, the movie opens with a Japanese plane dropping a bomb that has destroyed a train station and killed a few people. In the beginning of the film, a couple guys are watching a train leaving the station and one of them looks out of the window and sees a plane drop a bomb on the train. The whole film is basically one long montage with the train and some bombs falling around it. The movie ends with a nice bit of humor in the ending.  Watch the trailer here: This film also uses the old Japanese films and the story is also really interesting. I think this movie shows that Japan has been around for a long time and I can see it in the way they handle their own problems! I liked this movie a lot and I hope it gets some promotion and it can get a release in the United States because I think that it would get a good reaction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has some serious action scenes but it is really a well-directed movie.  It has some really great characters in it like Bill Paxton, Jeff Goldblum and of course Meryl Streep.  It has also some great dialogue between some of the characters like "This is no war movie. I'll just walk away, all the rest of them. This is nothing more than a war movie for the sake of a war film."   It was also made for a much different time then today.    I really like this movie!   It is a well acted war movie and the story was really well done.  Meryl Streppel in The Longest Day  "There's no place like the big city, baby. If I could, I would like to be an old man walking around in a nice little hat and coat, with my cane, picking up old ladies who are still in their nightgowns. " There is no place left like the world of the future...it's just too big. It is a good film.  It would have been good even with a much bigger budget to make, especially with an actor like Bill Murray in the lead role. 3 out of 5 stars!  I really liked it, even though there were a few scenes that were a little too violent for my taste.   It is definitely a unique film. - Rating - It would be nice to have some better CGI, but it did a really good job and the special effects and special effects like the giant robot were done well. I didn't see any of the special features, but they did add some other extras to the DVD that I would have liked to see. One of my favorite science fiction films, so the fact that this one is not available on DVD is disappointing.   It has a little over two and a half hours of good and great action scenes.

It's a happy ending. We don't even know anything about the characters after all." And while that is true, I did have some fun with it. This is definitely one of those rare cases where the ending of the movie isn't the most important thing to remember. It doesn't matter what happens in the movie, because the movie still works. ********* "It" begins with a man and woman who are talking about their lives. This man is George Bailey (Walter Matthau), who is in his 80's and his wife is in her 60's. George doesn't really know how to be happy at this point in his life. His son is dead, and his father is never going to be a better dad, because his wife won't even talk to him. He says she doesn't even remember him, which is why they were always arguing when they were kids. His wife, meanwhile, can't stop the guilt that comes from having killed her husband and son. That guilt is what fuels her. She's angry at herself for killing them. She also blames George for everything that's happened to her. And that's how her relationship with her husband begins. ************ The film starts in the winter of 1929, and the man's son, Jim (Walton Goggins), has just been killed in a freak accident. George is distraught about this and gets ready to leave for his job in Chicago. He decides to go to his old high school and get a job in the Chicago department store. But he gets fired when he breaks a lamp, because he didn't know the right key. He has to go back to work. George's son's funeral is the next day. The man can't get over the death of his son. George has just come back from the store when he gets a phone call. He knows the man who was calling has killed his son, but George can't believe it. The caller, though, seems to be on drugs. This would seem to be the end of the story, but not. Just as he's on the phone, the woman who's been sleeping with George's wife says, "I'm going to kill you, George." George's heart is broken, but he's not going to die, and so he calls a close
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The first and only horror film that had me jump for joy every time I saw the trailer. It was all so bloody good, so violent, so bloody, so well-made, that I could not wait to see it in theaters. I was also impressed by the way that the film uses its short but powerful story-line to build an atmosphere of dread, but also of hope and heroism. And even though it is quite slow-paced and the story doesn't develop very much, it is still a very good horror movie and an excellent movie for first-timers who just love a good horror story. ________________________________________ In this film, the character of "Jack" starts off as a very ordinary and decent boy from a small town in Southern England, where he's an assistant to a local farmer named Thomas. But when his father (Michael Gambon) dies unexpectedly, Jack is thrown into a big life change. His world is now forever changed, as he starts to see visions, he starts experiencing the events that will happen in the town, and he starts acting strangely and acting on impulse, acting as if he is possessed by some spirit. As the film progresses, we find out that Jack has a strong connection with the devil, and we discover how he got in the way of the devil's plan. I really liked this character because of his strong personality, and his desire to change his life, but his personality was also what made him the hero. __________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's got all the ingredients to make a fantastic movie: a well-drawn main character, strong dialogue and a good villain.  If it were made today, it'd be a very different movie. It takes a few cues from American Psycho: Michael, a man who has never experienced a romantic relationship, falls for a beautiful woman who is in the same boat as he is, as he himself is in, he decides to turn to the dark side and takes on the name of the Joker. In the end, the Joker (Michael Caine) is forced to kill someone he cares for, and the movie ends with the conclusion of a trilogy: Michael and Harley Quinn are reunited, Michael is forced into a position of weakness, and finally, Harley is forced down the dark path. In a sense, that's what the movie is really about: the tragic journey of a man. However, if I was going to take anything away from this movie (not sure I could, anyway), it would be the incredible acting. Michael Caine is in a class of his own here. For the other two characters, I found them too shallow to care about. But you'll see them again soon enough in the film Suicide Squad: when Amanda Waller (Margot Robbie), her "Black Mask" lieutenant, decides to test her on her skills, the two of them are pitted against each other. This scene is pretty awesome. Posted by nakamotewriter at 7:19 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sniper," "The Good German" and "The Man With the Iron Fists" are the great and honorable recent examples of a sort of historical-horror genre that has been going on for about a decade now. There have been, for instance, a fair number of films set in the early days of World War II ("Sniper"), and, for all the criticisms aimed at the way Spielberg, Kosove, and Hill handle the subject, they all have the right idea: in depicting the horrors of trench warfare, they capture what war can be like and the moral ambiguity that arises out of it. "Sniper" is not, however, as compelling a film as many people believe it to be. In fact, it could be the most boring and most tedious war movie ever made, with its repeated shots of Germans in blackface and, most infamously, a black man in the German trench (played by an Italian named Carlo Rambaldi) who gives a pathetic, rasping monologue about how the Germans were fighting for what they believed to be right. The German soldiers are even less appealing. The only other thing that distinguishes the film from a dozen others of its kind is its music, which is pretty damn good: a collection of songs that are meant to evoke the atmosphere of trench life and capture the mood of the battlefield in all its chaos and hopelessness. The best thing about the music, however is that it really sells the atmosphere, and the film does a good job of establishing it as the main thread of the picture. (The best thing in the film is its voiceover narration that is as entertaining as the music.) The German side of the trench. The film's most effective sequences have little to do with the war and more to do that with the personal lives of the soldiers, particularly the German side. The story is told mostly through the eyes of two German soldiers, played by James Remar and Robert Forster, who are engaged in a sort-of relationship with each other. Remar plays Lt. Kopp, a laconic, serious-minded soldier who looks like he'd be great for a role in a modern-day "Duck Soup" cartoon, while Forster plays Corporal "Bunsen" (yes, that's his name). There is little mystery as to what the hell the two guys are doing in the trench, and what the Germans are doing there is hardly interesting either, as they
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm a fan of sci-fi and horror, so I was really excited to see this movie. I can see why the movie was so popular. This movie was a pretty good action movie. The stunts were awesome, the special effects were cool, the plot was interesting, and the movie just kept getting better. There were so many twists and turns, and it was all very well executed. It was one of those movies where you thought you knew where the story was going, but then the next scene surprised you. This is why I liked this movie so much, because it kept you on your toes. If you've seen any of the other James Bond movies, you will not be disappointed by this. It's just that good. ___________ What did you think of this movie? Did you like it? Did it make you laugh? Did that get you hyped for the next James Bond film? I would love to hear your thoughts. Did you hate this movie or did you have a good time? If you don't have any reviews of James Bond or if you've never seen this movie, I'd suggest you give it a try. It is really well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. I am a big fan of the original series. The remake of this film is a great addition to the series. If you haven't watched it yet, you really need to. You will not regret it. I also love all the movies that they have done. I love the movies they made for the tv show. It has made me smile and laugh so many times. This film was fun for a little while before it took a turn for the worst. But, like always, this movie is good. It is just not a good time. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. So, if you have never seen it, do it. It would make your day.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" is a fun comedy with great songs, a charming cast of characters, and a surprising ending. I found the film to be well written and directed, and the acting was generally great. A nice movie to watch for the holiday, it had a great ending, which I was surprised about since I think the ending was predictable. I gave this film an A The movie that got me through the holiday season. I am surprised at how much I liked it. The musicals have been so overplayed for so long it's amazing that this one stood out in my memory as being so funny. The film does a nice job of mixing music from the 1930's and 1940's with contemporary songs, and it's just the right amount of silliness to keep things entertaining and not too serious. I can't recommend this movie enough! I have a soft spot for these musicals. I really love the variety and all the different artists that you can find featured on them. I like the idea of them being more than just re-writes of existing songs. My favorite songs from these films are the ones that I would never have expected, especially if I didn't love those songs in the first place. My favorite music from this movie is "My Funny Valentine" and "The Christmas Story" by George and Ira Gershwin. The Gershwins are one of my favorite musicals of all time. I really liked this movie and would definitely watch it again. It is a movie I could see myself enjoying as it is a nice mix of old and new songs, fun songs, funny songs, all the music, and just a fun way to get through the holidays. If you like movies about the holidays or you are looking for a fun and lighthearted holiday movie, then this one is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  The best movie ever written and possibly the most unique movie ever made, "Titanic" is one of those movies where the plot twists and turns in an unexpected manner but the characters and the action keep the entire thing interesting. The entire movie takes place off the coast of Australia in 1985, but the only thing that really ties it all together is the love story of Rose and Jack, who happen to be married to a man with a boat named Jack. Jack lives off the water and has a daughter named Lily, who is actually the love of Rose's life, but as soon as he meets Rose's mother, Rose and Lily start falling in love with him too and want to get married. This doesn't work out and Jack is forced to return to shore, but before he can, the Titanic sinks into the icy waters of the North Atlantic. At this point, we learn that Rose has become obsessed with Jack, wanting to be with him. The love story becomes a love triangle and the only way to fix things is to use the two life boats that Jack built to save everyone on board.   In the movie, the boat that Jack's family built to escape the sinking ship is called the "RMS Titanic". Jack's boat is the "T" while Rose's is the E. At the start of the movie Jack is still grieving for his wife and he wants to go home, but he ends up having to build a new lifeboat and return to the ocean. He is forced by Rose to use a large, special knife that has a special knife built into it to cut through the ice that he and Rose find. As the movie goes on, we are taken back in time to the day of the sinking of the Titanic and it is there that we see a strange thing happen. All the bodies on board the Titanic are slowly melting away and the ship has sunk to the bottom of the ocean and the water has become more dangerous, but that doesn't stop the two lovers from trying to save each other. After saving the lives of a few other people, Rose ends up falling in and out of the ice and is able to grab onto Jack's lifeboat. She and Jack manage to get away and they try to sail away, but they are caught by a whaling ship and forced to swim back to the boat. As they get on board and the boat is about to sink, Jack decides to jump off the boat and save the lives on board

It's really well shot and composed. There's not really a ton of dialogue, but the actors all deliver beautifully. The soundtrack is gorgeous.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I have seen most of the movies in this genre, from the classics of Hitchcock to the contemporary films of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. I am a great believer in the power of a good story, especially if it's told well. The movie is a masterpiece of the form. It is an unmitigated classic of its genre. It takes the conventions of the psychological thriller, and applies them to a crime story about a detective. As always, the story is presented in a compelling narrative, and it is made more interesting by the presence of some very well-written characters. The plot is compellingly constructed. There is a great deal of suspense. The story is a classic mystery that deals with multiple layers of mystery and twists and turns. It contains an excellent, and well-executed, murder. I really did enjoy this movie. It was a good thriller, with a great story, and great characters. I believe it is a fine film. It's great for adults and kids alike. It also has a great soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood of the story. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good crime film.

The house is in such a state of disrepair that the ghost is afraid to enter it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were plenty of moments that made this movie good, and I don't want to ruin any of them, but what really made it good was the fact that it did a fantastic job at not giving a damn about itself.  When it needed to tell you a story, it did.    It needed to be sad because it was sad, but the sad moments were just the right amount of sad, and the happy moments were pretty much the perfect amount of happy, and that was enough for me.  Why I didn't like it:   For one thing, there was no reason to get angry at the kids when their parents were killing themselves.  To be honest, I was happy to see this, but it didn't really make sense that they wouldn't take responsibility for their actions.  I also think that the first half of the movie is better than the second half, but there are a few things about it that annoyed me. First of all, the first time I watched the movie, there wasn't a single moment in it that made me feel bad for the kids. I didn' t think they deserved to die, and to this day I still don't think they did. I think there was a lot of guilt hanging over their heads when their mother died, and it is definitely a character flaw. I also felt that when they went off to college, it was a bit too rushed.  Now, I'm not trying to be a jerk, I think the movie took a good chunk of time off from the kids, so they could really develop their characters.  But to me, I don' t understand why they wouldn' t have been able to figure out a way to make their parents take responsibility.   Also, I just didn't buy the whole "there is a lot to do when you grow up" thing.  There were times where they were out of school, in college, and working a lot, but I really think that they could have worked on some of the more important things they needed to take care of before going off to school.  If they had spent the time on the basics, I would have liked it much more.  They had fun while they were on their summer break, but they didn't do much for themselves.   Overall:  I give this movie a 4 out of 10.  It was a pretty good summer movie, but maybe it would have been better if the kids hadn

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Posted by: Chris on Jun 15, 2017 10:51:14 AM I'm not sure what to say, but I thought this movie was pretty well done. I liked how it incorporated the elements of horror/fantasy and how it was just a solid horror movie. However, I did not like the ending. I felt that it was too rushed to me and I felt like I should have been given more to work with in the last third. Also, it didn't feel that different from many other slashers. It felt like it was kind of an updated version of Evil Dead, which is a good thing, but it didn the same thing. It's not that bad, and I wouldn't recommend it to any horror fans, but if you're looking for something different, it might be a bit much for you. Overall, a great horror film, with a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is probably my second favorite movie of all time, after Star Wars. I love the combination of comedy and action in the same movie, and the way that it all builds together. It's also a classic, so I guess I should know what to expect when it comes out!  The plot is about a small town that is going to get demolished to make way for a high-rise, but people fight against it for so many different reasons.  It's hilarious to see how people's ideas of heroism and sacrifice, and how they make decisions that they don't actually believe in.  And the music, of course!  It's so damn funny, I'll give them that.   A couple things I love about this movie are the cast.  They all have fun, and get to do all kinds of funny, silly, and serious things.  I really like when the movie takes the time to get to know the characters, and just lets them be themselves.  My favorite scene is the one where they have a barbecue, and everyone is having fun and laughing.  A couple of scenes that I didn't mention were the big battle scene, with people flying at each other across the streets.  It was so much fun to watch, and I was happy that it was over so quickly.  And the ending...  Is that even possible?!   But I loved it.  One of the most fun, hilarious, and action-packed movies I've ever seen.   This movie is in theaters on May 24th!   I want to thank my Santa for this amazing gift, and for the perfect timing of it.   This was my first time participating on Redditgifts, and it's been great. My santa was so generous, and delivered on the promise of a movie that I have had my eye on for a long time.  Thank you so much!  Now I'm off to watch Star Wars!

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  Review Title:!!!!  Rating: 9/10  Disclaimer: These ratings are my opinion, and do not reflect the views of any other person or institution. Please consult your local film review community for the latest Hollywood movie ratings and updates. I was a bit disappointed in this film, mainly because I wanted to love it. As a big fantasy movie fan, I was hoping this film would be an interesting take on the medieval genre. While there is an obvious attempt to do that, it ends up falling a bit flat. With this is mind, I thought the film was an enjoyable watch. I did really enjoy some of the character interactions, and even thought it was a pretty good bit of fantasy filmmaking. The acting was very decent and it felt like it was directed by some of today's best film directors. There were a few times when I thought that the magic was a little lacking, but overall, I would have to say that this is an enjoyable fantasy/action film that you should definitely check out. I give it a 9/100.  Advertisements
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last year I had the great pleasure of watching the movie "The Godfather" with my cousin for the first time. It was a wonderful time. Although he's just a little kid, he seemed to know more about what he was watching then me, and he was really into the movie. Then he sat down and watched the movie with me. It had a wonderful ending. I was so happy. He really enjoyed it. I'm not saying I would go watch the movie, but for a first time movie watching experience I thought it was very well done. So as I was watching the film I began to think about a movie that's much better than "TheGodfather" but much shorter. I began thinking of "The Man Who Would Be King". As I was thinking about it I was really thinking of the movie: The Man Who Wouldn't Be King. It also has a better ending, and it's much more of a drama. So I thought to myself, "Why don't I make a similar movie". The Man who Wouldn't be King is a much smaller, much more sentimental movie. It's only two hours long. I thought that it would be a good idea to do a two hour long movie. So that's what I did. It has been a real joy. I like the way it came out. The only problem I had with it was that I couldn't find a really good actor to play a part, but luckily they found someone. He's been wonderful. He didn't want to play the part, he didn't know what it was. His wife, her name is Elizabeth, she read the part and loved it. It wasn't her, it wasn't anything. It came out well, and I think it's going to be good. It might not be a big success, but I'm sure it will be fun.  - June 19, 2005Why Don't I Make A Movie Like The Man Whom Wouldn't...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ What to Watch: The first time I saw a film that was like Star Trek (from the late 70's) I was hooked. It was the first time an android had really been done right. Even more so, it was a great science fiction film that would make science fiction fans happy for decades to come. I went back to it and watched the original trilogy over a dozen times to really get it right. But now in the 20th century, the technology has been taken further. This film takes place in the present day and the characters, especially Lt. Travolta (Tom Cruise) have become extremely advanced androids. These new AIs are so good at their jobs that they don't need the need for people in the post apocalyptic world. They just get along with each other. I loved how they treated all the old-school Star Trek crew. I love the way the new Star Trek has been pushed into the future. It really does take you back to the 70's and it really makes you wonder what's happened. I will say the alien character from the original Star Trek is much weaker than he was in the new series. I also loved how much the film reminded me of The Terminator. This is the first of several sequels that would star Cruise as the character. It's also the last film that Tom Cruise would ever appear in. He died of a drug overdose in 2001. _____________________________________________________ What to expect: It is a pretty standard "bad guy gets bad guy on bad guy" plot. It is the second film that Cruise would have a major role in and it would be his last. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I am not one to have a lot of faith in my own senses.  When I watch a movie that I don't really like or enjoy at all, I tend to give it a chance and give it another shot at a later date. Â It's really a matter of personal preference, and of course what works for me may not work for you.   I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it.  It was the first in a series of movies based on a comic series from a very popular creator.  The comic was published under a Creative Commons license and the movies were based off the comic.  So I wanted to see a movie based off of it, but was unaware that it was going to be a bad movie.  This is the story of Jack Thompson, who is portrayed by actor Robert Loggia.  I found the acting of the movie to be the worst I've ever seen in a movie. Jack Thompson is the villain in this movie, and is the only one of the four bad guys that has his own unique personality.  Loggiah and Thompson are basically the same character, except for Jack's.  They aren't exactly the same, but their performances are very close.  Robert Loggie plays the role like it was written for him.  His character is a very good actor.  He is likable and likable people should be liked.  One of the things I dislike the most about this movie is that they didn't try to make it as entertaining as possible.  Like all of the other movies in the series, there is little plot going on in this one.  Even when you have some plot, it seems to be completely unnecessary.  There isn't much to the characters in this film.  Thompson is just a really mean guy, and Loggiam and Thompson have a nice chemistry together, but it just doesn't work.  My biggest criticism of the film is that I wish they would've put more effort into making the plot more interesting.  As I mentioned before, this is a comic book series, and should be entertaining from that aspect alone.  When you're trying to make a movie about a guy named Jack Thompson from an action packed comic book, it's not as exciting.  Besides, how can a movie get any better than a movie where Jack Thompson tries to stop a superhero from protecting his girlfriend?    So far, I haven't given this
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ "Birds of Prey" is an epic piece of superhero filmmaking, and that is a tough task. With a script from comics legend Gerry Conway and a score by The Who's Pete Townshend, it is a story that starts out grand, but winds up at times a little too heavy handed. But don't let its heaviness (or lightness) fool you, this movie is full of the kind of great fights and character moments that make superhero cinema so fun. It is also the kind that you can spend the whole time grinning and screaming at the screen, even if you've never had a super hero movie before. __________ Birds of PreYea: Birds of Praia, or "Rabbit" as they call it, are super heroes, they are all about using their powers to protect those around them from danger. When a rabbit, who has recently been abandoned by his family, stumbles across the old police station in a deserted industrial city, he is forced to discover his powers for the first time. His next move is simple, to get the help of the most dangerous man in the town. _____ (Rating: 3.75/5) ___________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing.  I really really enjoyed it.  I really hope for more movies like this one.   "If all the good things you see, are made into movies" The Last Starfighter I was really not impressed with this movie, but still I loved it. It is the last episode of the original Star Wars saga.  The story revolves around two rebel pilots, one is played by Mark Hamill.  Hamill is very good, but he was just not good enough for me.  As I said, the story revolves about two rebels trying to save the life of Han Solo.  But, what makes this movie great is that it is the only movie of this trilogy, and it has it's own style, it was very unique and funny.   I also liked the soundtrack and the music in general.  When it comes to the film, it is just great.  I did not have problems with the story, but I was really hoping that there would be another sequel to this.  However, it will be more difficult to get this in theaters.

"I'm a huge fan of the X-Men, and there are so many great ones. The whole franchise has been a blast since it began, and I'm always amazed how they keep coming up with fresh characters with interesting back stories. With that being said, I never imagined myself having an orgasm on screen, and then again I never expected that to happen. It was pretty amazing, even more so when I went back and viewed the scene a second time. It's not a typical X-scene that we all know and love. There is something about that scene that is unique, and it will stay with me for quite a while. " It certainly was not something I would see everyday, or maybe I just don't see it that often.

This film tells the story of the younger Joe as he tries to help his younger brothers overcome the trials and tribulations of life. This

I really like the premise of the movie and I think that it could be good for younger audiences who are looking for a light, cute comedy movie. I was really surprised that the movie didn't focus more on the two main characters, but rather the others. I didn't really see much of the other characters, not until a little bit later, but that's ok as they're just there to be used. I thought that the story was actually well written, the dialogue is good and there's not a lot of action scenes, but it wasn't boring at all. I think the movie is cute, funny, and well made, and the plot actually makes sense as well. The only thing I didn?t like about the movie was the "gag" at the end of the film (I'll explain in a minute). The gag I think was the funniest thing about it, but the whole movie is funny and it's definitely worth seeing if you're in the mood for a cute, light comedy.

Helpful in understanding the story and character development: ______________________________ "This movie is worth seeing in a theater with a good sound system, a good popcorn, and an attentive, smiling audience." - Roger Ebert  _______________________________________________________________   In the words of the film: ______________________ It's a beautiful, tragic, and sad story: a man with a deep-rooted insecurities, a sense of inadequacy, and a need for validation. He does a desperate deed in a desperate attempt to get his own attention, and then comes face-to-face with the terrible truth: He has no self-esteem!   It's a slow, steady build-up to this point: the first half of the movie has us on edge as we watch a man struggle to accept who he is and what he has become. This is when we see the inner workings of his mind, when we get a sense that this isn't someone we'd want to be friends with, but then something happens, and the audience gets an almost visceral glimpse at the darkness inside this man's soul. And then the real revelation arrives, as we discover a man whose dark secret is even more horrific than the one we thought he was hiding.   The movie is a meditation on depression and self-worth, but it's also a touching exploration of human frailty and the importance of self-acceptance. The story's message is a strong one: you can't change what you don't know about yourself. But what can you do? You can do the best you can: be honest, be kind, and always make the most of what you have.   is a movie about the pain and painlessness of acceptance. And it's not as if the story is a total one-note cliché, either. It's told from the perspective of a character who has just seen his life and his true nature. In fact, there are two other characters in the movie who reveal different aspects of his character through different angles. It becomes an interesting examination of the relationship between the characters as the viewer learns about their past, learns about them as individuals, and learns about who they are now. There's a lot to say about. But the movie isn't just about the subject of depression. It also tells a story about the relationships between the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A good movie. A little heavy on the humor, a little slow at times but, what a hell of a ride." 4/10  It's been a few months since this was reviewed, so I'm sure my opinion has mellowed out since then. The film does contain quite a bit of violence and is a little on the over the top for my taste, but it's a great family comedy that's not afraid to bring out the worst in people and shows some great chemistry between the lead cast. I can't recommend this enough! I love the film, I just wish it was shorter.  I think it could've been a lot shorter.  This is probably my second favorite of The Room's movies. It's one of those films that you're like, "what is this?" and then you sit down and watch it.  There are some really funny parts in this film, but you have to be in the right mood.  It's not a good choice to watch if you're trying to be funny, it's one that I really enjoyed just to sit there and just be with these people. One of the reasons I was initially hesitant to give this a bad review was because it was only a short film, a very small one. The way this film is shot and the way it flows really works.  I also like the way this one has the two older actors, and how each has their own unique way to say their lines.  This is one of the most well-written scripts I've ever read, and one of my favorite stories.   My rating for The Room :  7/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1941) is an excellent Western, a period piece that also happens to be one of the most beautiful films ever made, as well as a damn fine time-travel movie, about a time-travelling man who has to make his way through a corrupt and evil US government.  This film is so well done, in fact, that it is probably the best Western of all time.  The story takes place in the early 1900s, and it tells the story of Sam "Old Bucky" Barnes, who, after a terrible accident kills his young wife, goes on a quest to find her (he was the one that found her dead body in the train tracks).  The story, which was written and directed by John Sturges, is a fast paced, thrilling Western, with Sturges having an absolute knack for directing an intense, realistic story.   This film is a great western movie, and you'll definitely want to check it out. So, are you a time traveler?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I am the first person on your planet that has seen this movie. It was just soooo cool! My two friends and I decided to see it when we got a movie night pass for this movie at the movies and it was pretty cool. The story starts in the 80's in which a kid named Will (played by James Earl Jones) discovers that all of the people are teleporting. He wants to find a way to stop the teleportation, which he eventually gets to do by learning all the people's secret knowledge. Then the story starts going downhill when the main character loses all of his powers and becomes weak and vulnerable to being killed off by the other people who have learned of his secret. This gets progressively worse as the story goes on, and it is pretty clear that the writer of this movie, John Landis, doesn't know how to write a good script. I just didn't enjoy this movie very much at all. It is basically just people who want to be famous and getting killed off one by one. It really didn't give me any hope for the future of this planet because this was a really boring movie. If you want to see this movie that I watched, go watch a movie called "Super Mario Bros: The Movie." You will not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ If the guy who did The Mask of Zorro is a great writer, as I am, and the guy in the movie is a good actor, as most of them are, why does he make such a lousy movie? Well, it turns out the Mask of Zen is based on a book called The Story of Zen. The story is about a Zen master who goes to Thailand with the intention of discovering the secrets of enlightenment, but he ends up in a lot of trouble. I've read a lot about the history of the movie and I think it might have been inspired by a Japanese book called Zen in the Art of War. The movie begins with a few of these bad guys, and then we get a good part of the story. The good part, however, was the ending. In the story, it is implied that one of the bad guys will get out of the picture, and all the other bad guys who are left will be in the same situation. In this movie, that happens. I'm not sure why they kept it this way. The best part of this movie is the ending, which is just fantastic. The guy with the gun tries to shoot Zen, but the gun won't fire. So Zen puts his arm around him and holds on as long as he can. When he finally lets go, the bad guy is in a bad way, but Zen, not giving up, goes on for a while until he goes down. A nice little finish that says, "Well, if I didn't have this gun, I couldn't shoot someone." I'll give them credit, because they did a good job of making the ending as cool as possible.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ  There is a moment in a movie or show when you realize that the acting, directing and writing are all top notch and that the film was made by an experienced filmmaker. This is usually one of those moments. In this case, the writer is the director, and the cinematographer is David Fincher. This film is shot by the cinematography team, including Finche and cinematographers Finchel and Robert Elswit (the guy who did the famous "The Social Network"). They used two cameras with anamorphic lenses in some cases. You can also see Finchey and Elswith's work with Finchers "Fight Club". There is a lot of movement and editing in this film, and as a result of the editing, a lot happens at a time. There is only one sequence that stands out: when Finchen says that he has been to the hospital and that they are going to take the bullet out. What follows is a long, intense, and dramatic set piece that shows Finchesters talent as a director. The camera stays on Finchens eyes throughout his entire speech, and you can tell that this was his first major movie.   The music by Hans Zimmer is very good and well used. The sound design is very well done. The use of the long takes is also very effective, allowing you to keep watching the camera moving for quite a while.  Final Rating: 8.5/10  Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  I have seen this movie once, and thought it was a good flick. It really is about a young man who was sent out of town. He got the call one day to come down to an old church and get his friend to "show him something". This friend turned out to be the Devil. He was the one that was supposed to kill the boy, but he never showed up. So now he was in a position where his best friend's soul was taken. So he had to find a way to get this friend back to the land of the living. So the young man, while traveling across the state, finds the perfect town to do this. He goes to the mayor, who tries to persuade him not to do it. He gives him a map that will lead him to the home of the Devil's head, but the devil says he is not there anymore. He's in the woods. So then the young boy goes through the woods and finds a grave that he can't remember. He then heads back to town, where the mayor is waiting. He tells him to meet him in the church that was built over his friend's grave. So after finding his friend, the young men face off against the Devil, the old man, and the mayor. They all end up falling into the hole and the young ones end up coming out the other side, the rest of the group is taken back to hell, and some of them die a horrible death. The old man is taken away in a cart and the Satan head is locked up. Well, the next thing we know is we get a movie of this, and a little while later, the first sequel is released. I can't say I'm sure if I liked it, but it was still a very fun movie to watch.

No bullshit.  was not this one I expected, it is a good film but I wasn't thrilled by it.

Then the director decides to show us the bad things that happen in the world while the bad guys are looking for a way to escape. The acting is bad, but I like the characters. ------------- It starts out with a crazy woman named Linda (who is probably the best character in this movie). She thinks the city is dangerous and needs to be controlled, the city has no police, there are no real crimes. She thinks people should take their guns, but most people don't, they feel safer. Linda wants a way out of the city and when we meet her we learn she has a little dog named Toby who is supposed to follow her around and save her from getting hurt. -------------- The story is about a girl named Marla, who has a pet dog named Todd. She wants to get him back and gets help from her friend Laura who is a doctor. They are trying to get Todd back to her but when Todd is found by some bad guys he escapes from his cage and they chase him. Then they run across Marla. I thought she was really cute but then after a while she lost her head a bit. The plot twists are predictable and are not too interesting. The ending is not much better. It isn't that good either. The characters aren't very deep, there isn't much of a story, and it gets a little repetitive. ------------ I think the biggest weakness of the movie was the acting. It was terrible. ~~~~~~~~~ This movie was very good, although it has a lot of the same elements as other good westerns. I like to think of it as a remake of Bonnie and Clyde.

I hope people who haven't seen it will find this one good.  This review is from: "Proud Mary"  The Story:  When it comes to a movie based on a beloved novel, you know exactly what you're getting. When it comes a movie about a girl who becomes a nun, you're hoping for something more. You know you're in for a treat and you get what you need. This is a wonderful flick that makes the viewer think. This time out, we have one of the most gorgeous actresses to grace the silver screen in a long time; Maggie Gyllenhaal. I love her in the recent "Wild" and I love how she brings a sense of humanity to her character and the people around her. She has a sense that she wants more out of her life, but she knows she must earn it and if it's not going to be by giving, then she'll take it. This movie will remind you that you can do anything with a determination that will inspire you in any endeavor. The screenplay is brilliant.

The history and storytelling is very accurate, and while some of the films are a little cheesy (like "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" or "Hound Dog") others are just straight up cool (like this episode, or "Dead End"). The stories are told with humor, and the actors are very good. The voice acting is top notch, and there is a very cool scene where an older cowboy tells a newbie about his horse, and then tells a joke for him as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- "It is a rare case when a director and a writer can work together so completely and harmoniously, and yet this is no ordinary story of two lovers. It is not merely an elaborate love story. It takes as its theme the interdependence of individual life, the struggle to maintain that independence, and the fact that the bonds that hold people together are often more tenuous than those that hold them apart." "The film does not pretend to be a novel, but is rather a tale told so quickly that you are never sure whether it is a documentary or a comedy. It begins as an amusing and touching love story but grows more complicated and strange as the story unfolds." A short summary that does not do this movie justice: A love story of a woman named Kaili who falls in love with a man named Kajan. Kajen wants to marry her because he is also her uncle, and she refuses because she does not know what to do. After Kajin is shot to death, he decides that if they are to get married he will have to leave Kailia. He leaves Kailias house and she goes into a depression. Then her best friend comes and helps her. She then finds a job as a maid and goes back to the house. After that she does some traveling and starts going to the local school. The whole thing just gets stranger and stranger. The first part of this film has some strong comedy moments and some very intense drama that will have you in tears at times. The second half has some really strong action scenes and some really disturbing things that will leave you feeling a little uneasy. This is a very long movie so be prepared to wait about three and a half hours to get through it.

Club "I really enjoyed this movie.  You can tell that the movie was really carefully considered.  This was John Candy in his prime.  They had a good time doing it." -  New York Daily News "John Candy is an A-list star and here he is, playing a comic genius who has lost his ability to speak and communicate. It is a terrific picture, and in a genre full of mediocre sequels, it has a lot of heart.  A great movie." -- The Los Angeles Times "John Cazale is a big, funny, wise-cracking comedy veteran whose career has seen him move up from being a small-time character actor to a leading man.  That's a strange place to begin, but it's a good place to end.  Cazales plays a character named Dr. George Treadaway, who was once a world-renowned inventor of a miraculous device that would heal the sick through the simple act of standing up.  As the movie begins, however, Treadaways mind has been clouded by a mysterious illness, and he is unable to speak, communicate or make sense of anything.  He and his wife Jean (Linda Darnell), a neuroscientist, live in a house in rural Vermont.  One day, they find a box on the floor of the garage.  Inside is a book, a machine and instructions on how to operate it.  Soon, TREADAWAY finds himself in a world where everything around him seems to be changing, from the machines he can operate to the people who interact with him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you can't tell, this is an epic film.  This movie takes place in the last days of WWII.   It's also about two friends, played by Russell Crowe and Edward Norton.  The movie is really good, even if it has some pretty silly scenes and a very short running time.  A young man who is obsessed with Hitler comes across this movie and starts seeing things that are not there.  He meets a young woman in it who can't understand how someone could be so obsessed with something so evil and her whole life revolves around it.  It's about a boy who is not really sure how he feels about his life and is also not really clear on where he stands in the world.  This film is really well put together and I really loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Troy: A fun little romp about a crazy old man, who goes to an amusement park. After the ride, he meets a girl named Sarah. She asks him if he would like to watch the sunset over her house, but is soon distracted by a strange woman who tries to kill her. In the end, Sarah falls in love with him and gives him the keys to her car. He decides to go and live in the house and start a new life. He is determined to make it to her, no matter the cost, but eventually gets into an accident that destroys his legs and leaves him without a leg. With the help of a couple of old men and a little girl, he gets back up and is able to return to the land of the living. I really enjoyed this movie. It was an excellent little story with great humor and a great ending. It's not perfect, but I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In The Presence of Enemies" is a great movie that is well produced and well acted. The story is a bit cliche, but the film does a good job of keeping the viewer interested and interested in the characters, and the tension is never too high for too long. It is a very well made film that, like many of the films that I watch, kept me interested and entertained throughout.  It's a shame that it doesn't get the recognition it deserves but I have to admit, it was a nice enough film, and I will watch it again. _______________________________________________________________________________ Watch: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1897122/minutes/5321458 The Movie:  This is a movie that I watched over and over again after my parents died.  When my mom was sick I would watch this over and I would be enthralled by what was happening.   A lot of times I would end up crying after watching this movie and I can't put into words how sad I was after I watched this.  If you don't have a lot of patience with heartache and a bad relationship, this movie is not for you.    This movie is based off of a true story.  I don't know if it is a true movie, but I believe it is based on a true incident that happened to a young couple.   In this movie, the story is told in three chapters.  In Chapter 1, we see the first meeting between the young couple and a man named Walter, an older guy with his own problems.  Walter is trying to get the young girl (played by JoAnna Garcia Swisher) pregnant, but she just can't seem to get pregnant and doesn't want it.  So he has Walter put the blame on the young man, and so we get to see the real nature of Walter.   Walter is not an all knowing god, he's just a man who is frustrated with not being able to be successful with his life.  We see his problems and we see his desperation and desperation for this girl.   The first few days of their relationship are great.  They go on a boat trip and we get a view of the love that can live between two people.   As time goes by though, they end up having to move out because of Walter's drinking and it was becoming too dangerous for them to be together.  After they move

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite part of the movie is when the two girls show up with the guy (who happens to be their son) and take him down to the lake.  I like the idea of "kidnapped" kids, where they can't act out and go through the motions, they have to live out their fantasy.    I didn't see the film at the theater (the one that showed it was a lot smaller than the one I saw at Sundance), and I don't have a good photo of it, so I can't really tell if it is real or if it was made up, but I'll still give it a thumbs up.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I've watched a lot of horror movies over the years, so I've seen a lot from all genres. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a horror fan (and I've never been a big horror fan at all), so the way they portrayed horror was very impressive. The acting and directing are really top notch, and while there are some flaws here and there, the story is incredibly creepy and chilling. I'll be honest, I really didn't think the whole vampire thing would work, but once I got past the first few minutes, I actually kinda liked the way it was done. While this isn't the kind of horror that you'd watch if you're a horror nerd or something, it's actually pretty funny. While the film does play with a few tropes, you can definitely get past them and still enjoy the film. For those who haven't seen it, the film has its fair share of disturbing scenes, especially the one involving the vampire, and its one of the more disturbing movies I've ever seen. A definite must-see for any fan of the horror genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is awesome! The movie was set in the 1970's and tells the story of a family of 3 teenage boys (Javier, Antonio, and Javier Jr) who were just living in a suburb of Washington D.C. during the late 1960's.  They go to an amusement park where Antonio is a roller coaster ride operator, Javier is a toy store clerk, and their mom is an old woman who runs a day care center.  Their mom gives them a ride on a carnival ride and then gives them their tickets.  But they have a problem that they can't get off the ride because the ride is too tall for their body's. So they have to climb on top of the roof to get off so they can get to the exit.  And they end up on top an air tank and end up blowing up when they fly over it (this is how the movie begins).  The air tank was called the Super Dummy, and it had a life of 50 years.  The film uses a few real life situations that happened to this family in the late 60's to create the story.  It also has a great soundtrack from the 1970s that plays during the action scenes.  I love this movie and I am a big fan of the original Rocky. This movie is now on Netflix and I recommend it to any fans of this great movie.

This is one of them. It is a great movie and one I could recommend to anyone who loves scary movies."  - Peter C. Gies The movie itself is about a little boy who gets trapped in a cave that is in deep sleep by a curse. He tries to escape the cave but it gets dark and he starts losing memory. A girl is trying to rescue him from the cave. She is afraid of the curse and can't stay by his side. So she can't do anything. So the little boy goes back to the cave and tries to stay there as long as he can.  The girl keeps trying to help him but he keeps losing more memory. Finally, the boy falls in the cave again and gets trapped. Now he is stuck in there forever. The girl knows what the boy wants but she cannot do anything about it. The movie gets really scary because it shows how scary you can be in a deep sleep. The little boy keeps running back and forth to try to get out from there. He keeps looking for a way out and a way to stay alive.  A little boy is trapped in the deepest sleep and that is how he has become a horror movie legend.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* *The Man from Earth* is a film about man's quest to create a new and better way to live.  It explores the potential of man to develop, grow and evolve, as well as the potential problems of that progress.  The story of The Man from...  My main problem with the movie is the dialogue.  It's just not professional.  There are a couple of characters that sound exactly the same, and that's not a good thing.  I thought the dialogue in this movie was bad, but not the actors.    The characters are a little bland, but they do have some personality.   They really work together and you like them.  The acting is great.  For the most part, the movie keeps it's pace and doesn't get out of hand.  My only criticism would be the dialogue is so bad and the dialogue sounds like the guy is just trying to be funny, rather than using his natural voice.  However, at least the music is nice and fits the movie really well.  This movie will probably be in the top 10 when it comes to comedy.  What a fun and light-hearted comedy that would be a good film to watch with kids.

This was one of those movies I had to watch several times while I was younger, and now it's one of my favourites. Very funny and not too pretentious. One of my very favorites, and of all time.   the great thing about this is that the film was released in 1983 - i.e. about 13 years ago. The technology, writing, production and acting is still incredibly good and it is one of the most relevant and relevant movies ever made. The dialogue has aged well - the main characters still sound like they are still young and funny and the acting remains the same as well - very good. The movie is very original, and shows the impact of the internet and all the various media on society in a way that is very relevant. There are also many references to modern events (such as the internet) and social issues in the film that still stand up today.   and of course - the film is in a language other than English, but I guess that in the time it was made, the English language was just the most popular one anyway.    So in conclusion - a very fun and original movie, worth watching. I really would recommend it to anyone!

It has a great plot, the acting is good, the music is great, and the special effects are very well done.  I have to say that the ending was pretty good too.  What can I say about the movie I haven't already said?    The first half is awesome and the movie stays on track with the plot.   When the ending starts to pick up the movie loses its momentum and there's a great fight scene between Thor and Hela and it's really good.  It is worth a watch and I'm sure a sequel would be awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took me a while to find out about this film, I was a long time fan of the series and the first one in the series. I have a bit of an irrational thing with old stuff and I found that this movie was definitely worth watching. It wasn't too bad as far as acting goes. The only issue I had was the soundtrack. It was really bad, but at least it was a different one from the other ones. As far as the story is concerned, it was fine, I really enjoyed the way that it ended. I didn't have to worry about being bored though, as the main protagonist was pretty good at handling the situations he was put in. He was not too likable though, he was very greedy and did a lot of stupid stuff and didn't seem to really care about the people around him. One thing that bothered me was that at one point the characters were talking about how they're going to "kill" the villains, then the other guys say "Don't kill him" and the guys go on to beat the crap out of the guy and throw him into the river. I was not a fan of that either. I think it was more of a cheap way to get the guy to reveal his secrets and to get rid of a threat. I wasn't a fan at all. The main antagonist was a pretty cool one too. He had a lot going on with him. His father was a great man and he was actually a good person. He's the only one of the main characters that I enjoyed. I really liked the way he talked and acted. He kind of reminded me of the antagonist of the first film from the first season of Game of Thrones. Overall I really wanted to like this film but it was just way too cheesy for me and the ending was stupid.

I think the writing in the movie was not good. There were like two characters that I thought were so weak in the book and I thought they were so stupid and so I can't believe they even wrote them as if they were still in the comic book and they're in the movies now.

Reviewer: Mr. V. - favorite favorite favorite - August 7, 2009  Subject: Why are you calling me a moron? I watched this movie twice and I just can't get behind the story. Not enough exposition on the situation at hand! I don't know why you think the war is about to end, it's been going on for 5 years and there's no sign of it ending anytime soon. It does make sense for the world to be in chaos and the USA to be the sole superpower, but what about the people living there? I just don't get it. It is basically a movie about a guy who becomes a super soldier because he is an excellent fighter. The movie does start off with that great quote of a soldier saying "we are going to win!" when they reach a base camp.   Then there are some great action scenes in this movie. The second half of the movie is very interesting and entertaining, it really does have some good fight scenes. The one that I have noticed most was a car chase scene. There was a giant truck in the middle of the freeway. The guys were trying to stop it so that they could stop the truck, and they were doing a good job until they reached a bridge and all of a sudden the truck drove off the bridge and slammed into the other vehicle. The crash caused the bridge to break and it sent the guys flying. The scene was amazing.   I really enjoyed watching this movie, even though it is very short, it has very good action scenes and it's interesting. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in watching a fast paced action movie with good special effects. -August 7, 2008Why are you  Rated: Not yet rated - August 6, 2008
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love The Wolfman (1974). It's one of those rare films that I can sit back and watch on repeat. It's a fun and funny movie with some really good performances by Laurence Harvey and Dennis Weaver. The Wolf Man is a bit of a mixed bag but I've found it is definitely worth a viewing. It doesn't need an explanation. If you liked the "Wolfman" films from the 50's and 60's then this should be right up your alley. This is an early 70's classic. It is hard to classify but I guess it's "silly" or "dark". If you want an old fashioned good time then watch this. It does a very good job at reminding you just why we all love these films. The soundtrack is also a highlight. The music is a great blend of classical and old timey and the actors all do a fine job. The "The Wolf Man" films are great examples of old school, noir style storytelling. I love this classic! 1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  D.J. Caruso, who had played the original's antagonist in this adaptation, came to the fore again in this new version of the classic tale, as a new version. Carraso plays the evil Doctor Zander Rice, who is in charge of bringing back the zombies. He and his gang of zombie-like creatures (all of whom have names, one of whom is named "Goblin" and the other "Killer") take possession of the old theater where the old story is being performed and set the stage for their zombie attack. However, it's not long before the evil clown prince Mr. Gumm arrives with his own group of undead clowns, who quickly steal all of the thunder. The plot of the movie is quite simple: The clowns and Gumm are trying to steal a baby and the clowns are determined to bring back the Gumm and the rest of the zombies and to do this they are trying various means, including tricking the clown prince into believing that his clowns have already taken over the theater and that he has nothing to do but sit back and watch the mayhem and destruction.  The main thing that makes this movie so good is the wonderful music and the voice work by a young David Rinn, who portrays the "old man" Gumm. Mr. Rinn plays this role quite convincingly, even to a fault, and I always loved his role in the film. The other great performance of the film is the young Robert Englund as the old Mr. Rice, the clown king. He portrays the role very well and also plays him with a tremendous amount of love and humanity. The young Michael Caine, who was in this film when it first came out and was one of the main characters of the story in the movie, plays another part in this movie, playing the young man who, in spite of his young age, still has a sense of honor and respect for the old Gumm, who he believes will return his stolen infant. However his confidence is misplaced, as the evil King Rice soon makes him realize the extent of the evil that he is causing.  The Evil Clowns, and their leader Mr. Carruso, are a really fun bunch of ghoulish characters. I always enjoyed their dialogue and the way the actors acted. It's always fun to watch the clown-like King Rice act as the main villain, although he also shows off a lot
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I've watched this movie several times now, and each time I've enjoyed it more than the last. It's a great science fiction story with good science and plenty of action. It is about a man and woman who become partners in a colony of the advanced planet Venus. They have several alien children in their care. I felt that the movie's main attraction is the people. There are many of them. They are all very different, in terms of appearance, behavior, and mental capacity, but they have one thing in common - they are all completely human beings, with the human capacity to love and care for one another. They do not all get along perfectly and there are some tense moments when the two cultures have to work together to make things work. But even with the differences, there are no nasty or antagonistic individuals, just people who want to be part of a better way of life. I don't see any bad aliens in this movie; they are always so very human-like. I like the way it portrays people of different races, cultures and ethnicities working together in harmony. If you are not used to a large cast, it can be difficult at first, but once you get used to it, the movie becomes even more enjoyable. It can be a bit long, but it is a story that will stick with you long after it's over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a fan of comedies.  My all-time favorite are Saturday Night Fever, All in the Family, A Few Good Men, and Caddyshack.  I've never made a list of my favorite movies.  And I don't really do them.  I just like the movies I have seen.   The one I have not seen, or at least never thought of, is My Friend Dahmer.  It's got that great "let's hang" character.  The movie doesn't have many laughs, but the good things outweigh the bad. I loved it from the first time I saw it.  Dahmer had a very distinct personality.  His laugh was deep and dark.  He was an oddball who did things that were strange.  When you see him in the movie, you immediately forget that you are watching a comedy.  My Friend is just a fun character. Dahmer was a really weird guy. He was a man who enjoyed killing people. Dahmeh was a real weirdo.  This is not a normal movie, it is a documentary.  But Dahmer is a very strange guy. I wish he was made into a movie.  All in all, a great movie.   I enjoyed this movie and the way it was made.    I don' t know about you, but I don 't always have to laugh out loud when I watch movies.  Rating:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first film was about a young boy named Jack, who suffers from leukemia. After the cancer spreads to his brain and lungs, he goes into a coma and must learn to communicate using only his thoughts. This is a slow burn, and Jack's mother is just about the most unsympathetic character I have ever seen. At least her son does not think he is a "wussy" or has "poor memory", as she calls Jack every week. As she watches him deteriorate in the hospital, her words of advice become increasingly cruel. When a new doctor comes to visit, she makes her case with such vitriol that I expected to see him run for his life, and I was shocked to see the doctors laugh. This film was a lot more enjoyable when it first aired in 1996.  After the success of The Room (2000), the film had its share of critical acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The Room was a critical success as well. While most of the film was filmed in the basement of a hotel in Montreal, I am not sure whether that was a deliberate choice to distance itself from its predecessor, or if the decision was just a coincidence. The most shocking thing about the film is the fact that it is so successful. I have only watched it once, but I can only see this film as the precursor to The Room 2.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wedding Crashers (2004)  (I liked this a lot more than I remembered!) The movie has a good script, but it's basically a crappy, forgettable, generic, dumb film. I have to wonder if the director of this movie had any experience as a screenwriter.  There's nothing wrong with writing a script or a script with a good plot, but as the director there has to be some sort of consistency in all the things in the movie.  The bad parts are not too bad in the script and they do not detract from the good parts. I will say that the scenes in which the people in the party are trying to pick up guys, are funny but they do feel cheap.   Another reason that I like this is that it's not a buddy cop movie. The lead cop (played by David Koechner) isn't the one who gets all the girl's attention and he isn't all over the guy (played as a comic relief by John Leguizamo) that he's trying to get.  It does not feel like a typical buddy cop story.  In fact it feels more like a buddy comedy.  This movie is good if you are looking for a generic, forget-the-plot-and-therehearsal-and just-go-for-it-and-"let's-chill" action movie. There's some good stuff in the story but it is far from the top-notch material that one would expect from such a movie.   It's hard to really hate this movie because the acting is good and it's fun to watch some of the guys get into trouble.  A sequel was released in 2008.  For some reason there is some controversy about whether it is supposed to be a remake of the movie or a sequel. If you're not familiar with the story then it's probably best to just go with "It's another buddy cop comedy with some new characters."
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (that's it)  Review: My Little Pony (Bronies: Friendship is Magic) is a brilliant children's cartoon that is one of the best animated shows on television. However, it has one fatal flaw, and that is the fact that there are not enough gay and lesbian characters in the show to give it a true rainbow effect. If the producers had added gay and/or lesbian characters to the show, the show would be even better, and the children watching the show could finally watch the characters of their favorite character as they are. And I say finally because even when a female character does come out as gay, she still remains very much the straightest character on the show. She's just not gay enough. I'm sure that if she was gay, and she did a sex scene with a male character, the boys would love her. However if it happens to be a male, the girls just won't get it. That's just one small way that the show is flawed. It has a few characters that are clearly gay/lesbian and it also has a couple that are straight. Both of the other main characters are really not a part of either of these categories. While they are well written and seem like normal kids, the characters in both categories are way too gay/lethally straight for a cartoon with a young demographic. I like my cartoons straight and I don't have the patience to wait a whole season to have a "gay character" on my cartoon. So my solution to this is that the producers and directors should consider hiring more gay and LGBT animators and directors for the show (and any future cartoon). That way they could get to the point where they would have two or three gay and gay-ish animators (or directors) for each show. If this happens then the show can truly be a rainbow of colors that has not only gay and non-gay characters, but some that are both gay and not gay. The good part is that I have no idea what shows the children of today watch (if anything). My son only watches a cartoon on television at most three times a year. So if the kids of today (or the children that would be watching the cartoons that my son watches) saw a rainbow-colored cartoon that would show all of the characters as gay and all of them in bed with other males, or whatever else, then it would finally be something they could see for themselves. Also the gay kids that are

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I feel like I am watching a different movie every time I watch it. In a way, the film can be regarded as a love letter to Italian cinema. It brings together genres and stylistic differences in such a way that the audience doesn't really feel lost." 4/5 stars "We are living in a time where the cinema of the future is being born, where filmmakers and film enthusiasts are re-evaluating and redefining the way we view cinema. In the process, we are learning something from the past as well, by looking back at classics, re-imaging them and imagining new futures that we never imagined possible." 3/5 - A masterpiece. 1/5:   This is a masterpiece and should be required viewing. It may not be in the same league as a Hitchcock or a Lynch but it does a great job of illustrating the fact that we need more movies like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Revenant is a great movie and I recommend it.  While it doesn't quite rise to the level of the other big blockbusters, it's still a very enjoyable movie and it's worth seeing.  In case you missed the previous reviews, you can read them here. There are some people who hate me because I talk about some movies that I like more than others.  These people think I only like movies about women or black people or animals, and they also think I talk only about "white" movies.  That's ridiculous.   The truth is, I just like movies, period.  Some of them are good and some of them suck.  My favorite movies are always different genres, but I don't watch all-action movies or all-sci-fi movies because I want to see what each movie brings to the table.  In a way, I want them to challenge me and see how they stand up.  I think there is no point in watching a movie just to see a good action scene.  Sometimes, you want a story.  But the movies that are truly amazing are those that take you on a journey.  A good movie is more than the plot.  It's not just the movie itself.  They are movies that you can sit and enjoy, and even when you don't like a movie, you might find yourself wishing that you had a chance to see it.   The Revengers  is an example of the latter.  The Revengest is a movie that challenges you.  When I first saw it, I didn't really know what I was going to get, and I was pleasantly surprised when the movie finally revealed itself.   The Revenant  pushes you to do things you aren't comfortable doing, and it makes you question your beliefs on how to be a man.  This movie asks a question that's not really asked in most movies. It asks, do we really believe we can be tough as nails?   I don' t think a lot of people can honestly say they're not scared.  People are very comfortable with that part of themselves.  You are hard, and you have to know how to take the pain and get through it. But The Revengevengers really shows you that sometimes you are not meant to be that way.  We don't have to prove anything to anyone or anything.  And that's a really beautiful

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is a great movie. The story of how a woman gets back her ex lover with the help of a psychic is not your average Hollywood romantic comedy. This movie is different than other romantic comedies in many ways. You can definitely tell that this was a lot of work and it shows in the art style. The movie seems like it's drawn by hand and the character designs are pretty nice. I really like the design of the people in the movie, it feels very real and realistic. I also really like what they did with the ending. It feels like they left it up to the audience to decide if the ending was good or not. The ending is also pretty awesome. I love the ending of this movie, I was just thinking about it for a while after watching it. I would highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a good romantic comedy, the story might not be the best, but I thought it was really well done and had a lot to say.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lights Out.  This is a fun little horror movie with an original premise.   I enjoyed it.   I thought the movie was fairly well done, and I found it fun to watch.  If you're a horror fan, this is worth watching.  It's short, but it's a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate  is a great flick. This is not some kind of horror film. The film isn't full of torture scenes or some other sick shit like that. The movie tells a story of two people who become lovers and have a few things in common. One is a Soviet spy, the other a CIA agent. Both of these people fall for each other and fall in love, eventually going so far as to be married. I don't like a lot of films about spies and relationships. They usually have the spy looking for love or love-making and then being replaced by a love interest for the spy. I like spy movies with a love story as well. I also enjoy spy movies where the love interest does something to make the spy jealous and angry. I thought this movie was a great addition to the spy genre and I'd love to see it made into a TV series. I'm not sure if I'd actually go this far as it would probably be a bad movie, but if this is something that you think is worth seeing, go and see it. It isn't the typical spy movie where you'll find a woman in a white dress or a black suit doing something in the background. This movie does a fantastic job of creating a good spy story. I recommend this to all spy lovers. It's well made, it has a good plot, and it's very enjoyable.

It makes you laugh out loud and makes you want to buy more of the DVD. It is really well-written and thought out. It just has this great vibe and feels like you're sitting down with friends to have a really good laugh and watch a film. It's got the classic, retro, 80's feel to it." -Cynthia G.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Exorcist. It was a dark, atmospheric, frightening movie in which the hero has to make his way through a group of demons with a little help from his family.  It took its time, which is always a good thing, and kept you guessing the whole time. The Ex-Rector of Slytherin, or Harry Potter for short, is a boy wizard. But, he's also a wizard in disguise. He's a Slytherins student who is caught up in a horrible accident that changes his appearance and causes him to gain an unnatural amount of magical power. That power can only be used for good, though, and the rest of the time it's mostly used to hide from a horrible family that's trying to kill him. When the father of his new best friend turns out to be the evil Professor Snape, it's a little too much for Harry to handle. So, he runs away and spends the rest his life hiding from the world. Then, the Dark Lord comes calling. Harry has been the only one who's noticed the presence of the Dark Mark on Voldemort's robes. The only way to defeat him is to take the Dark Robes off his back. Then Harry learns that the Dark Wizard he's trying so hard to defeat is actually a wizard of legend. He knows the Dark Lords past. He is a descendant of the old Wizard who killed off all the other Wizard Kings. He has a very specific plan, to make the world a better place by killing every single wizard. And to do that, he has to destroy the only magical item that can help the world fight back: the Philosopher's Stone. Now, this is when things go from a dark and terrifying story to a very happy story. I was so taken by this movie, it took me a while to put it down. After this, every single Harry Potter movie is a must see for me. This was one of the first movies I remember really enjoying and it remains to be my favorite. Now that Harry's had his head put back on, it seems like everyone wants to give him a happy ending. But I'm not sure that I want to see him finally find out what really happened at the end of this movie. I'm hoping that when the next movie comes out, it will be another great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. See my previous review to the animated Spider-Man, this movie is a different matter altogether. It's actually a story about the end of an era, an era that the movies that came after it were unable to change, the films that came before it had already been tried and rejected, and the people involved with those movies were not as skilled at their jobs as those of us that worked on the original movie. The story begins in the year 1999, when the popular hero, Spider-man has just arrived in the neighborhood with his friend, the wall crawler. But when a high speed chase with another car leads to the deaths of a police officer and a bystander, Peter decides to use his powers to help people with their problems and save the lives of others who are not as lucky as he is. This movie takes place in the future, and is a tale that deals with a great number of societal issues, some personal, some political, and some of the themes involved in the politics of the time, how much can good people do for others, and how much do good people give back to those that help them, these are some of themes that are addressed in this movie, although I would say that it is more a lesson in how the world is in the 21st century, than it is a lesson on what it means to be a good person. This is an enjoyable movie that would not hurt to watch if you are looking for a good old fashioned superhero flick. ___________________________________________ The ratings have been changed to reflect the nature of this movie. A 15 is PG, a 16 is for a mature audience, a 17 is for teenagers, and a 18 is for those who have not watched many superhero movies. ______________________________________________________________________________ (1) - "Spider-Man 2" - The first film of a new trilogy, the story is very well constructed. It has a good flow to it, a good pace to it. You have the normal characters from the comic books and the new ones, but in the movie it gets to the point where you are watching it all as a series of events, and I would recommend watching the whole first half of the movie as the movie gets very intense and the story gets better and better. I enjoyed it, but I was not really into it. The first half was more enjoyable, the second half I felt like it should have ended. But then there was a point where it just went on a little too long and

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I was a huge fan of the original Harry Potter films, which came out more than a decade before the books. It's amazing how much has changed since the movies arrived on the big screen in 2005, but they still had a major influence on me. It was a great way to spend my Sunday mornings, and my teenage years. I remember, for example, the first time I saw the movie at my friend's house, as a kid, I couldn't believe my eyes. The first line of the script said "A few years ago." No more or less than that. I was also a huge movie fan from the very beginning and I was so excited by what I saw and heard the day the film came out that I kept it in my wallet until I got to school that day and got a glimpse of it. It still remains one of my favorite films. I love the magic. Harry is just a kid who wants to live life to the fullest. I also remember being very surprised by how mature the films became and how Harry matured, while still being an eight-year-old kid. You know? It was quite an experience. It also made me think about the characters and why they were so beloved in the first place. It just really changed my perception of them. I really enjoyed the books and can't wait for the movies. I guess the movies are even better than the books, but what do I know? I just don't have the time to read them, so I'll just watch them whenever I can. And I don't want to spoil too much about the story, so you'll just have to watch it and find out for yourself. Just know that it is not just about Harry Potter. It has a strong female role, Hermione Granger. You'll also notice that Hermione has her own perspective on how things should be, but is still very young and innocent. The rest of the boys are her age, but are not as smart or wise as she is. Harry and Ron, of course, are very mature, while Hermione is very innocent and yet still is wise and wise enough. I'm really glad to finally get to watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* ********  I'm so happy this movie is here. I was never interested in that genre and never would have guessed it was one of those "dramas about the apocalypse" that I used to find so appealing. I mean how do you make a movie about the end of the world, and not an apocalypse, but there you go, that's the premise! I actually liked it, because it had all the things I liked about the movies I grew up on but with a twist, and I'm all for that. There's a lot of violence but I've seen a lot more in movies than what actually happened in the movie, and it's never that bad. It's more fun than it is scary or exciting, and the end was kind of sad but it also ends in a way that I always look forward to, so that's a plus. I would have enjoyed it more had it been a little better.   And if you ever get the chance to watch the original in the theater with the actors in it, go for it! It's actually rather nice, and a lot better than what was made.   of 8 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ ____________ I have heard a lot about "Jurassic Park." Well, I just saw it. And I liked it! So, what made it worth the movie-time? The film starts off pretty exciting, with an explosion in a cave. It's a typical "explosion" scene. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, especially as I thought the plot is fairly good at the beginning. I think it just jumps from one plot point to the next. It also makes no sense that a group of park employees were watching the TV when it started going off. That doesn't really make sense either. It is a slow start, but by the end of the film I liked the story quite a bit. I like the way the director was taking the script and working out the movie. I liked how he incorporated several classic scenes from "Jaws" and "Jumanji" in the film. Some of the best sequences in the movie occur as the dinosaur is fighting a human. The action scenes and the dinosaur's reactions are excellent. I also really liked the ending scene in the park. It gives the impression that the "Junkies" were going to have to go to the zoo to see the "lions" again. The ending scenes were very suspenseful and gave the whole movie a bit of a twist. I thought it was very clever. So, what did I like about the film? I liked that the story was slow at first, but once the story got going, it was pretty good. I really liked that this film took elements from "RoboCop" and used them to make the plot even better. It took a lot from the original films, but managed to put it all together into a very satisfying movie. This movie was very good. _____________ __________ I don't think I will ever forget the scene at the end when they go to see that new, dead dinosaur.  I was wondering what was going to happen at that moment, because of the movie's slow start. I didn't really have an answer for that, until I saw it on TV. So, that was one of the few things that kept me watching. The acting and the visual effects are top-notch.  I think that if there is one negative thing about this film, it is the music. Some scenes have a nice theme and other scenes sound too much like the "
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Is a good flick. A must watch. _____________ A well done film. A great little movie about two men who are having a love affair but then fall in love with each other. Very simple yet the plot gets very interesting at the end. _________________ A movie is for those who like drama, a lot of it, love it.  I liked this one. Fantastic and unique action! Lets start by saying that there is alot of great action going on in this film.  The most impressive part of this movie were the special effects.  The special effects in this movie are very detailed.  This was especially impressive with the space battles, I must say that it was awesome seeing the spaceships firing on each other or taking off from the planet.  What more could you ask for?  The most impressive special effects was done by the CGI in the battle scene.   It's very impressive seeing the way the ships fly and shoot in this flick.  So I'm not going to go on too much about the special effect's.  There is some really good action scenes in the movie.  Some really cool and fun scenes.  I'm going to end this review on a super exciting and fun action scene. So here we go.  First we have this great super awesome scene. Now what I'm saying is that the super awesome action scenes always made this movie so fun.  Just to finish off the super cool action scene we have the two main characters getting some serious action going.  Now here's my favorite part of the movie... It's a great fight scene. It's great. I could see why this movie was a success.  When you have a movie that has that kind of great fight scenes you always have that feeling of excitement about the movie when it comes out.   This was definitely the best fight scene I've seen in a movie.    So if you want to see great action then I really would recommend this movie.   Overall this was a good good fun action flick that you really should see.  It has an average story but the action and comedy work well.  If you enjoyed this movie then you should definitely give it a go.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I'm trying to find a way to review all the best movies and the ones that I thought were great and then some. My main interest is to try to give the actors a chance to shine but there are too many of them. Some are fantastic and others, not so much. This is a comedy that works well on a couple levels. It gets the job done but I am never totally satisfied with it and I hope that it gets an R rating because that would be really hard for a comedy. It is good enough that I will watch it over and over again. It does have the typical jokes and good ones, but the best ones are in the last act. It isn't a bad movie but there is so many other movies out there that are much better. There is a reason it is getting a lot of bad reviews. I'm really enjoying it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  The Good  A few months ago, we were introduced to the classic film "Dirty Harry" starring Clint Eastwood, a movie that is an underrated gem and a worthy addition to any collection. The film was directed by Sydney Pollack and starred Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. A brilliant, low-budget film that follows the lives of three young police officers, Harry Callahan, Mickey Spillane and Frank "The Face" Felt. Their lives are cut short by a mugger who shoots each one of them in the head. They go out to find the killer. Their search brings them to the "biggest, baddest, scariest, toughest gangster in America" – the kingpin of the infamous New York City crime syndicate The Four Horsemen.  This movie is a classic in the true sense of the word, so much so that it's now an award-winning comedy classic as well. The story is one of friendship, loyalty, justice and love, so it's no surprise that when "Dyke and the Gang" were asked to do the music for the movie, we immediately jumped at the opportunity. /Film magazine had a great write up on this film that includes a quote from the movie's director, Sydney Pollak, where he says "Dry run to a gangster film. This is our Dirty Harry – we wanted to keep that feel in there but have it not be so serious and scary. The movie is also very personal. It's about an ordinary family – a bunch of ordinary people who are not that special, they are not extraordinary, they're just good people. The gangsters are ordinary people with extraordinary ambition and that is the story of how they become the Four Horseman. That is the film's message, that you have to be ordinary and good to have it in you."  For the musical numbers, we enlisted the help of some of our favorite comedians – Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, and Joe Mande. Each of these actors was able to pull off the character of the Four-Horsemen with ease, and it shows the dedication of the cast.  (This song performed by Joe Mandel)  So how did we come up with the concept of the musical number? As the concept came to me, I could tell that it would require a lot of effort to pull together the right cast. It would have to have some

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen 'the good old days' many times over the years, and I don't think it's a movie that you have to see again, I love it. The movie is a little silly but the chemistry between the leads is wonderful and the comedy and the music work in harmony. I love that the movie was shot in a farm house, I always like old movies with barns and old people and farm scenes, just look at any old silent film for the farmhouse scene in 'Swing Time', or the farm scenes in 'Porgy and Bess'. The music is also very nice and memorable, especially the last scene of the movie. I think it would have been even better if the scene in the barn had been cut down a little, the scenes in the farm house are very long but I feel like it works better in the movie as it is, it does slow down and gets a bit slower than the real thing, I know people always talk about movies being a mirror to life and what you see on the screen is what you end up with in your head, this movie really isn't, it's not what you might see in a movie in the year 2017, this is a movie you might have seen in the 50s and 60s and it's still fun to watch. It's a good old movie, a good little comedy, and it has a nice end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Son is a wonderfully enjoyable coming-of-age story about a little boy who becomes a strong man. His father is a drug dealer who's killed and the boy's mother is a broken woman. The boy's father is an honorable man who refuses to let his son do the wrong thing, so when the boy gets caught doing something wrong, he gets sent away. As his father was sent away, the boy sees an opportunity to go back and get revenge and is determined to do so. It's a funny and interesting story with some dark themes at play.  There's a little bit of a subplot of the kid's father having sex with a young female prostitute.   I thought that this movie was very good, although I'm not a huge fan of the lead character and the director wanted to make this a movie more suitable for kids. I was glad that it managed to capture the youth and energy and felt that the movie worked well.  The Good Son  is an interesting and enjoyable movie that is well worth checking out.  The Good Boy: I had a wonderful time with The Good Boy. The movie is a coming- of-age film and follows a boy named Jesse and his friendship with his older brother. Jesse has recently started to feel a lot of pressure from his older and wiser brother, Tommy. This all is due to the fact that Tommy is being groomed by the FBI to become a special agent and Tommy is taking his brother under his wing and showing him the ropes of the profession. Jesse is very smart and tries to take his brother to a great movie but ends up getting into a fight with Tommy and nearly getting him killed. It is a very interesting movie and a good start to an already wonderful series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can see the whole story from the beginning to the end, which is good, but what I was disappointed with was the fact that it never got better in the sequel.  The story of the first movie is one that should not be forgotten by anybody, especially by those who were not very young at that time.  The movie introduces us to the characters through the eyes of young boys and the story takes you into a world of darkness.  It is a short movie (only 2 hours and 30 minutes long) that was written in the 70's, which explains the lack of depth in the movie.  However, it is worth watching if you feel that you would enjoy a story like this one, because it is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. The acting is a bit inconsistent, which might sound like a negative, but it was the only complaint I had with the movie, but not the reason I recommend it.  Even the special effects are good, especially the effects of the spaceship.  I would also like to mention that I enjoyed watching this movie because of its themes of innocence, the evil in the world, and even the message of good vs. evil.  There was not much gore, but there were a few scenes of blood, and you will probably get some squeamish reactions, especially if you have seen the first part of the movie which contains some gore.  Overall, it was a good, unique movie, which I would recommend to those who like the idea of a spaceship.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The movie takes place at a remote cabin on a mountain. The mother of two daughters (Marlene Page and Della Reese) is in charge and the dad is the local ranger. The family are on a trip and on a whim decide to leave town. The trip is cut short and the cabin is discovered and turned over to the authorities. The girl (Jasmine Cephas Jones) goes to find her mother while her older sister (Lily Collins) goes looking for her father. I really liked the setting and how this would be a part of the larger story. I am not sure how the plot will play out in this film, but I was very impressed with the screenplay by Richard Linklater. The film looks like it was shot on location and was a nice watch. I had an enjoyable time watching it and I am looking forward to the inevitable follow up!

He is a poor substitute for Jim Carrey, especially in the comedy  I saw it in a theater the first few times around 8 years ago. That movie was better. The whole story with the good guy and the bad guy was good, and I liked Jim Carrere as the guy that was the bad bad guy, so I liked it. I thought that it was just like some of the movies that Carrey did when he was with "Spin City". They didn't have the humor, but the acting was fine and the writing was fine.   I also liked the movie when it was released. I just have a bad feeling that the movie will never get made again, but it is nice to see how different Carrey's voice is in "HAPPILY N' EVER AFTER." he gets old fast  and the movie is way too short to make a good film  Ralph_C.  in South Africa  4 posts  orso.........

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was looking forward to this movie since I heard it was coming out. It seems to be in line with the genre I prefer, as well as with my own experience. The cast is also quite good, with both the male lead and the female one (I'm not sure how I feel about her). The action is decent, as the film focuses on the battle between two teams of young heroes; a battle that is often described as 'chosen' or'selfless'. The battle itself, however, is anything but. There are some interesting themes in this film, one of which I will discuss later. The characters' motivation for the battle seems to change based on the decisions they are making, but not so much that they can't carry the same intensity. Overall, a good fight movie, not great, but worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies I have seen. It has great effects, some very well performed and well acted sequences, and a good plot. I thought it was pretty good. I love the movie's action scenes. I especially liked the first act, where the action is a mixture of close up, close and long range combat. It's got an interesting set up. There are also some good "mature" scenes that really show the characters in their roles as soldiers, soldiers who are still in training and are learning. The special effects for the movie are great, especially for the effects in close range action scenes where it's all about moving in close, rather than fighting with long range weaponry. I also thought that the special effects used in the battles, and some scenes in the next two acts were pretty well done. The film's climax was pretty cool. The script is also pretty good, and pretty much all of the characters are well developed. It also has great use of music, as the music adds to the story and the emotion that the characters can show. There's a decent amount of action scenes, but it's really not that much. It isn't a real heavy on the action, which would have been great, but as it stands, it's nothing special. The first half of the movie I did not like because it felt like there was a lot of unnecessary special effects. The second half improved and was more well done, although there were some scenes that were over-the-top. But overall I enjoyed the movie and thought it would be fun to watch again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What happened to me during the movie is a real roller coaster ride. It is a very dark and powerful movie with great performances. I watched this movie after my dad died in 2015, and he told me that this movie was one of his favorites. I remember he said it reminded him of the movie "Silence of the Lambs" when he first saw it. It took me a while to get used to the darkness, but I really enjoyed the dark humor in the movie. There were some amazing performances, especially by James McAvoy. The movie is over 90 minutes long, and I would say the movie would be a good starting point for someone with no background in acting, just because the movie gives us a very clear indication about what's going on. I found the story intriguing and I loved the way it was told. As you may have guessed, the movie also has a great ending. I can't think of anything else that was better than the ending, it is just great! I think the movie was very well made, but it doesn't have the same "impact" as "The Prestige". It still had some great acting, and some great action. I hope someone sees this movie, and if not, I think it's a really good start. _________ Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  The Prestude Rated:   It's about what everyone wants it to be. I loved it. I am one of the more liberal people that saw this movie. I feel it has a really great ending and some of the best performances, of any movie ever. I think that if this were to be made into a movie like "The Dark Knight", I think I would actually have liked it more, if it wasn't for the ending. That ending left me cold, and was quite abrupt. I was just left with an "I can't believe that's my life" sort of feeling. So, if this movie weren't made with the intention of a big budget movie, I could have seen it as a good way to get a bit of a laugh out of a person. Was this movie great? It is definitely worth a watch. I don't think I will see it again, but perhaps if someone were to do a remake, they could do it right! _______________ Was this report helpful to your friend?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Little Hours' is a fantastic movie that will not disappoint.  It's a tale about two teenagers from the middle-class who have a profound misunderstanding of each other, and find themselves in a love triangle between them.  The movie starts off in a simple and uncomplicated way:  "Hey, you're the lucky one who got to play the piano." The two young people have an understanding that one of them can be very useful to the other: "If I am smart, he'll like me more.  If I am clever, he won't like me. " That's what happened after the accident.   "Well, if the car crashes, and it hurts, how do you fix it?"  After two weeks of playing around, the two get their next encounter:  The accident:   The accident was so severe that they had to be operated on.  One of them wants to avoid surgery:  I was born in hospital and have seen a lot of surgery. I don't want surgery, I don?t want to go through it.  "You'll have to pay for it," he said. "What?" I asked.  But he said:  "It's too dangerous."  He went to the hospital and when he saw the situation he decided to go on his own, and get a life insurance policy.  This guy, who was the best-man, was so brave and he made it out, and his wife who was only 25 years old, she was in hospital for over six months.  I didn't want to talk about it because she was scared, and they kept telling us that there was nothing they could do and that they can't save her. And the nurses were telling us "she can't get out of the hospital, she can?t be helped".  And he was talking to his wife, he had been crying for months, and he was crying that she had a lot to live for, and that she can't be saved.  And she was telling him:  Well, there?s nothing we can do.  She said it is her duty, it's her life, she has to go and live it.   "But she?s so young!" he shouted.    "I have a lot more to live.  I?ve got two boys and a daughter, and I have been

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A big screen adventure about a young boy whose family moves to a big town with lots of other families. It's like The Little Mermaid, but for adults. I love the fact that there is not really any adult, just the family with a little child, as well as the other families, the young people and all of the animals living in the town."  --  Paul Tamburri, New York Times Movie Review My kids love this movie so much they've been asking for a sequel since the first movie came out.  It's funny and it's funny, but it's also heartwarming, and it teaches us the importance of helping others and having a positive attitude.    I've seen this movie three times since it came out, and have yet to grow tired of it.  It doesn't hurt that it's packed with adorable and well-crafted characters, and I can't wait to see how it plays out. I am glad it was a Disney movie, and that Disney's characters are strong, vibrant, and just a little bit goofy at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My review:    I'm not usually the kind of person who would pay that much for a movie, but The Mummy (2017) is just that. I didn't get into the original 1954 monster film until I was in my twenties and was a huge fan of the novel written by Peter Cushing. I read that movie in high school and was instantly hooked. It is that good.  I was surprised that I liked this movie so much, I've never read about it before and my dad watched it with me. I'll have to check it out again one day soon. There is so much that's amazing about it. It was an early 80s movie, which is why it's so silly and ridiculous and funny. It takes place in London, the most Londony of British cities, it features the most of London, with all of the London landmarks and the best of them is the streets, the streets that are run down and the streets with no sidewalks. I loved it, and I want to go back to London again someday. It also stars Sigourney Weaver and Tommy Lee Jones who play the titular Mummy and his sister.   Posted by Nick M at 3:37 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Great Beauty " (aka " Beauty and the Beast ") is a delightful tale of a beautiful young woman and her quest for romance and true love, and a whole lot of adventure, along the way.  The film is a bit of an oddball, coming out of the 1940's, and not really dealing with much contemporary issues.   It takes the story of Beauty and her human love interest, the Beast, from the original version of the story (and is more in line with it), and in doing so gives a far more complete and interesting version of that story.   I was a bit confused by this adaptation, and it's not really because of the casting.    The movie's director is a wonderful gentleman, whose work I particularly liked, and the acting in the film was superb.  It's a tale of two women trying to find true love in an age where women are often seen as just as flawed as men and as dangerous.  It's a story of women finding love and making their mark in their own way, and how their actions influence each other and their environment.     The film was based on a very successful play, by the late Victor Hugo.  There are elements of the original novel, however it is more a remake of that.  The movie takes the basic idea of the novel and re-tells it, with a little more humour and charm.  This is a far better movie than the original.   The original novel is set in 17th Century France, and there is quite a bit to be said for that. I'm pretty sure that the French and English have a lot more in common than we give them credit for.  Beauty and  the Beast is set somewhere in France in 1718, and as the story progresses the story moves further and further away from the French, and into the English countryside.  A very interesting story to say the least, I think it is probably one of the better works of its genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  So, you want to see an old fashioned spaghetti western that doesn't have any of that dumb 'thrown in with the guns and guns in a row' stuff? Well here you go...  If you're a fan of the spaghetti westerns of the old style of Sergio Leone, you'll love this one. A classic with no CGI. It's really not much to say other than the characters are all likable, the plot is simple yet brilliant and the cinematography is really good. I also think that the soundtrack in particular was fantastic (I have to confess, I was a fan before and since I saw it).  ____________________________________________________________  Verdict - 9.5 out of 10 ___________________________________________  In my view, this is one of the best, if not the best movie I have ever seen. It is a really great western with great characters, a wonderful plot, a fantastic soundtrack and a really interesting plot. A great way to kick-off your summer movie season and get you back into a well-deserved vacation.  I highly recommend this to all the lovers of the classic spaghetti western films. - Chris  See more reviews at:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always wanted to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but for many years it was unavailable in the U.S. I finally got my chance when it was released in the UK a few years ago, and it was an amazing experience! There was a scene near the end that really resonated with me, and I had to write a review about it. I thought it was a beautiful sequence with the most spectacular scenery ever filmed.  The plot of this movie is really fantastic and the story is very good!  Also, there was a little bit of the film in the TV series Kingdom of Heaven and the film is an extremely faithful continuation of that series, and the characters and the way the characters were developed is fantastic! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" was a film in which a lot of things went right. Director George Lucas managed to bring together the right cast, and they all turned in believable performances.  That's not to say they were flawless performances, but they were convincing, and that's all that counts. _______________________________________________________ " Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith " is another great example of the story being more important than its production values.    George Lucas put a lot on the plate for this film, and it paid off in a big way.  This is another film in the Star Wars saga that can not only be watched as a stand alone, but it can be seen as an allegory of war and politics.  To see the death of a Jedi, to watch a war between the Sith and Jedi, and then a new threat to both sides is something that I thought was great.  In addition to that, we got to see the Emperor and the Emperor's Grand Army of over a dozen star ships, which was also great. The main problem I have with the film is that they never got a true conclusion to the Clone Wars.  The story is a series of flashbacks, and while they may be a way to get us back to the beginning, they do not explain much, if anything, about what happened at the beginning of the series.  If anything, they may have even gone a bit too far in telling us about things we've already seen.  That being said, I still think the final two films in the series are great, and I have faith in George Lucas to return to that world soon, which is great to hear.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Would I recommend this film to a friend? ___________ Absolutely. I would highly recommend this movie to a number of different audiences. It is quite a fun romp, and the cast is quite good. I think my favorite part of the movie, though, is the character development. Every single one of the main characters develops in their own ways, and while some might find some of their development slow, I really didn't find any of it to be annoying. It feels natural, and it allows for a lot of the story to actually happen without much need for plot twists. If you're looking for a well-paced film, or a solid action-adventure film, look no further. If that's not your thing, though (and you probably are) then you're probably not going to find much to recommend here. This movie is a bit too similar to other films in the genre for my tastes, but I think there's a good bit of merit there. If this movie were not a remake, I might be in favor of it. The movie's title was changed in the U.S. and this isn't the original film. __________ A film that was originally released in 1992, this is the only sequel to a Japanese original film released in 1989. This film is, in a sense, an amalgam of three different films - The Secret of NIMH, The Animatrix, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, although it's mostly a sequel to Nausicaa. It's not a direct sequel, and that's probably for the best. In a way, the film is more similar to the first film in the series, as it's based off of a similar premise, but the movie does introduce a couple of new characters that play a larger role than the ones from the first movie. Overall, this movie is mostly enjoyable. The special effects and special effects are good, with the exception of the character designs, which were somewhat overused in this sequel. If the film were not an adaptation of a previous work and had a more unique premise, this would likely be a good film. However, with all the similarities that the three films share, the movie is still a bit uneven in its storytelling, and is certainly not a masterpiece. If I had to rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd probably give it a 6.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I don't know what's wrong with me, but I love this movie. It has such a classic feel to it. I'm sure the producers and crew were very motivated to make this film and they succeeded. The special effects are quite good, the acting is good, and the script is fun and entertaining. I just can't stop thinking about this film. The acting in this film is good and it's pretty funny as well, and there is a nice little romance between the lead character and his girlfriend. The only problem with the film is that it takes a very long time to get through and I felt the story was kind of dragging on at times. But I guess you don't want to watch a movie that takes 20 hours to get to the end and then you have to sit through another 20 hours of boring exposition? Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and it'll probably be a good watch for some people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. It's the most important thing about Nolan films so far. I will always have respect for Christopher Nolan and I think he is a great director. And I'm happy that the franchise continues. This film has the most depth, action and a more psychological side that has been absent from the previous films. It is better than the previous entries, in my opinion. The story is very good and it is very enjoyable. The movie is very hard to watch and I'm sure it was difficult to write. But I'm glad I had the chance to write it. The score is great, too. You don't have to wonder what will happen when Batman and his allies face off against Bane, Bane fights with his own unique style that's completely different from anything Nolan's ever done. The last scene, that was the most intense scene in any film I've seen. I won't spoil it here but it is so good. The performances are great and I wish the movie had been longer. The acting is so great that I wish it had been just one movie but this has become the best Batman movie and I don't know how to explain it. I recommend this movie to everyone and I hope you like it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It is about a young American couple in a very nice house in a suburb of Paris. There are no crazy or exotic places like in the old movies, but it still looks like a little American house. I mean, it does have a big white porch and everything, but the house is really pretty and the garden is pretty, and the whole neighborhood looks nice. It is like a pretty normal house. But of course the young couple goes away for a vacation and they don't leave the house and they get really bored and then they start doing all sorts of weird things, and then in the end one of them gets killed and she wakes up in a strange house in Paris and she starts looking for answers. And of course there are all sorts other characters who are just characters in the film, like, like a very crazy lady who is in love with the young lady, a guy who's got a pretty bad reputation for being a drug dealer in the city, a bad woman who has a lot of money, and an insane man who is a little psycho. It was not made in the late 80s or early 90s, it was made in 1990, I think, and I think it is probably the last movie made before the internet and all these films that you could watch at home. There's a lot more sex and violence and drugs and everything. It has a bunch of really weird characters and it is definitely a weird and fucked up film.  How was the film received at the time of its release in 1990? Did it get a lot worse after the release?  Well I guess I would say there's no real controversy in the world now about this movie because a lot happened afterwards. I'm sure there are people who didn't like it who still think it's weird and messed up, and it might have been just slightly more popular in France when it was released because a bunch more French kids were watching it. But you can't deny that it is a really weird movie and not for the faint of heart. There is some kind of crazy, twisted, insane scene. And you know, you just have to be really careful of what you're watching when you are watching the movie. It can be disturbing and really weird.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good Girl"  is an excellent movie, despite some occasional missteps.  The movie, directed by the talented John G. Avildsen (of The Exorcist fame), takes place in the 1970s, which is around the time of  Deep Throat, a film that I had never heard of, until a couple of years ago when I stumbled across it on the Internet.   My girlfriend and I saw "The GoodGirl" at a movie theater in Kansas City, Missouri, but I was hoping to see it at a better place.  And luckily, I have that opportunity today, with the screening of "The Best of Jean-Luc Godard," at the Missouri History Museum.    This event was well-attended, and it was a wonderful experience.     The movie was also given a special presentation, and a very pleasant one at that.  Jean-Luc's film, "The Grand Illusion,"  is an interesting film, one that is very difficult to talk about, but here is a good example.     There are certain themes that Jean- Luc Godard takes on in his film, and one that he uses to great effect.  There is a very strong connection between art, and the desire to express and to make it known, but at the same time, there is a feeling of something being hidden from view.  When you look at this film, what strikes you is the way Jean-luc moves the camera around the audience, and to the side of the viewer, as if to conceal, or to hide something.  He uses these effects in the movie, and you can see it in the editing.  What I found most compelling in the film, however, is the fact that the viewer is led to see these ideas, or these emotions, or this experience, in a very different way than we often do.  For the viewer to view Jean- luc Godard's film through the lens of film, a different type of understanding is needed.  Jean- luc Godard creates a movie that is both entertaining and mysterious.  "The Great Escape,"  and "The Lady from Shanghai,"   have two different ideas.  They both portray a time when the United States was being attacked, and when the soldiers who attempted to escape were caught.  The films are not all about escape, but about the human condition, and about the idea

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (That's what I call a good ending.) "The Way" (1947) – I'm very picky about films that begin with a bang. This one gets me going on the strength of a pretty great score, an all-star cast, and an alluring lead. (In addition, there's one more surprise when the bad guy finally appears.) It's a little slow but when it comes together, the climactic sequence is a masterpiece. "My Way" is a very short movie. I'd estimate it at about 4 minutes long. This is one of those movies that takes the viewer on a journey, not only as a viewer but also as a writer, or as I've found to my disadvantage, a director. You see, "My way" is not exactly your typical Western. In the film, which was directed by John Wayne (who also played the lead role), the character played by Ford is called J.W., who has a horse and a woman with whom he has a brief affair. In this romance, Ford's character is the one who is on the road, looking for a safe place to settle down. He's the man who must deal with a dangerous situation that involves his wife, his horse, a band of outlaws, the FBI, and the local sheriff. At the end of the film J. W. gets away. He returns to his horse and his wife and makes his way to a farmhouse where he gets on a horse. He gets off the horse and walks up to the house. It is there that he meets a beautiful woman who is waiting for him, and they get on the horse again and start to ride. They go on their merry way, but soon, it is revealed that J. J. is a fugitive and must find his way back to his wife. To do this he has to pass a border patrol and he is caught. At this point he's a dead man, and if he didn't die, the other characters in the film would surely kill him. He escapes by telling them that he's an escaped convict, and is soon on his way again, trying to evade the law once again. This happens to Ford in many ways, although he doesn't know it yet. One of the interesting points of this film is the way that it seems to reveal that Ford is a bit of a madman, or at least someone with a tendency to think outside of the box. In a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I just saw The Great Outdoors this afternoon and I was so surprised by how good this movie is. The only complaint I have about this movie was that it does not take place in a typical western. Instead it takes place in South America, in an area where no one has seen a western movie. The movie started with a couple walking in a small valley and were suddenly attacked by wild animals. The couple fought back but it soon turned out the animals were not wild at all, they were all in the family of a little girl. We were then introduced to a family of people living in a house that was built by a white man who was later discovered to be a witch and murdered by the villagers. They were all then told they are about to be massacred by the witch. We then traveled to a mountain where the villagers had constructed a fort. The people were being attacked by Indians and their leader wanted to kill them. The village chief and two warriors were then killed by the Indians and the little girl was told she would be eaten by the wolf. The two warriors then killed the wolf and when the girl had finished eating the wolf they shot her and told her not to tell anyone and to stay inside her cabin to be eaten. The girl then tells the people what had happened. We soon got back to the cottage and there was a giant wolf that had just killed the leader of the village. The wolf then started to kill everyone in the area including the little boy. We got back on the horse and rode down the mountain until we came to a village where the people were trying to hide in the woods. We eventually found an old man, who told us that the villagers have seen a wolf and they are all dead, including his daughter. They also all knew that this wolf was a witch so they started to cast spells and put a curse on the wolf to make it eat only sheep. The wolves were so terrified by all the attacks from the people that they did not attack the people but the animals. We decided to go back to our cabin to eat and get away from the wolves, but I think that it was very funny because I don't think I have ever seen a movie that had such a good plot. The characters were all interesting and I really enjoyed the cast and the director. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes western movies, especially ones that are set in South American. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In terms of filmmaking, this is a great example of a film that goes against all the rules. This is an epic in scale and a cinematic experience for fans of both The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the classic film The Big Lebowski, and this is easily the best adaptation of the source material to be released in years." I really didn't want to go in there. The Biggest Loser  is the ultimate in low-energy reality television.  It's a documentary that follows a bunch of people living in and around a small town in Indiana, and they live their lives as if they're all doing a terrible job of losing weight.   You'd think it would be great that such a low energy group of people would be able to get to the end of their lives in such a short amount of time, but instead, you get this  documentary that is just awful.  As I was watching the first episode, I was genuinely hoping it would somehow be funny, and that would be the most exciting thing about it, but I can't really think of anything else that makes this documentary stand out from everything else that's been done on the subject.  The Biggest Lingerie Pageant  This is the only documentary that is more than two hours long, and it is a terrible documentary.  It tells the story of a bunch  of models who have a contest in which they're asked to show off their bikini bodies.  You have to really love the contestants (who are not even the best looking ones), and I'm sure that everyone watching this documentary was very excited to see what kind of shape these women were in. Unfortunately, I found that it wasn't funny, it was just sad.  The models are all beautiful and they're really trying to show their bodies, but then they go and have their pictures taken in the same outfits that they don't like.  Instead of laughing at the ridiculousness of this, the audience should be laughing at this woman, because I'm pretty sure this woman has never seen a woman in any of her clothes before, and yet she is posing them for pictures, and in some of the pictures she actually gets out of them!  Pamela Anderson and Sheherazade  I'm not sure why this documentary is called SheherAZADE, but apparently it's because it was shot in a house where the "she" (P

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have to watch this! It's just one of those movies that is so bizarre that it's fascinating to watch it. When we hear stories like this one we think "what in the world is going on?"  So we wait patiently while the story unfolds and soon enough the mystery is solved...  If you're looking for something that is completely different and unlike anything you've ever seen before (even the movies you thought you'd never see) then I would highly recommend this movie!

No. He's going to live forever because his brain has been wiped." This was actually a pretty good movie, despite the fact that I've never liked any of the heroes in them. However, I think that the character of Joe is just too cool.  I think I'm in love with Joe. I can't say that I'm a super hero in the traditional sense, but I love the fact of that I can be a superhero. I'm not going to lie to you. I love how smart and clever he is. I think he's way too smart to be a super-hero. I really feel for him. Joe doesn't need to be one. Joe should just go with it.  That's what he's doing.  If you have the chance to see this movie, go watch it. It's really cool. And it might just save your life.  It's a nice change of pace from super heroes like Batman or Superman.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about bad movie: The best thing about The Grand Budapest Hotel is that it is a charming, well-made film about a charming Hungarian who escapes a war-torn country to live with his American hotelier friends and family on a luxury houseboat in Budapest, Hungary. With a screenplay by Wes Anderson, one of America's greatest living filmmakers, and a story by Wes and Anderson's son, Nick, who wrote the screenplay for The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, the movie was made in the old style of Hollywood, as Anderson (a very gifted director) took a small studio in Los Angeles and took on the task of adapting Ernest Hemingway's 1926 book for the big screen. The result is a modernized take on the classic fairy tale, and the kind of story that's perfect for Anderson. There is a certain charm to the way that it moves, and it doesn't suffer from the same pitfalls as many other films that are set in the same time and place, as it is set in a world where people have a way of getting along just fine in the midst of war. The story is simple, but the way it is told is absolutely wonderful. The cinematography is top notch, and is shot in a style reminiscent of the best films of the '60s, so it is all very interesting. The musical score by Hans Zimmer is superb, and helps to make the film feel like a very different kind of Disney film, with an epic feel to it. The acting is also really excellent, with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin providing terrific performances. There are only a few minor problems, and one of them is that the movie's main characters are all somewhat boring, although they do grow a bit over the course of the movie. The best performance that I saw, however, was that of Ralph Fiennes as the father who runs the hotel. The fact that the actor actually plays the role well is the kind that makes you realize just how talented he is. The other thing that bothers me is that this film is just kind of a mess; it is not as sharp as it could be, and there are a number of scenes where there is a lot going on and it is just unclear what is going on. It is a well-acted movie, but it feels like a mess to me. Overall, The Grand Hotel is a really nice movie, and if you like movies about charming people living in a charming
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... Mr. Bill, a movie about a young woman who takes up the job of protecting a wealthy man's property, was very good... the movie was funny.. but.. i loved the movie so much.. it was a great movie.. you gotta see it.. good job..   I haven't seen the movies "The Good Earth" or "The Right Stuff" and my guess is that those will be good too.  But I have read the novels by Robert A. Heinlein, which were published in the 1940s. They are the best science fiction I have ever read, and there are some others out there that I might be tempted to read in the future.  of The first book in a trilogy set in the early 1960s, Heinlein's protagonist is a man who loses a lot of money in an investment scam but is rewarded for his daring with the honor of becoming the head of a spacefaring nation that takes the name EarthGov. Heinlenski's protagonist then begins his space voyage to discover the nature of life and what lies beyond the Earth. Mildly fascinating:  The man's name is Robert W. Heinrich. He is the director of the California Institute of Technology's Astronomy Department. I'm a huge science fiction fan. (When I was young I had a book of Robert A Heinlein stories on my desk at home, and I was very proud of it.) I love the genre, especially science fiction. And I'm especially excited by the idea of the spacefarer. I can imagine myself riding in a rocket that went out beyond the atmosphere, and then taking off for the stars. This was the first time I'd ever thought about the idea. I don't think that's possible any time soon. Even if we could somehow make travel to the stars possible, it would be a hundred years at the most, at best. A person could not live in the vacuum of space for even a year at a time without getting sick. Not to mention that space travel is inherently dangerous. And that's what most of us are worried about: how to survive. The only way to ensure the survival of a human in space is to make sure that he or she doesn't come back. A long space trip means living on the moon for the first year and then eventually

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ This is one of the better movies I have seen in a while, though I think I'm going to have to re-watch it to figure out what exactly it is. I like the idea that it is some kind of "revenge fantasy", but I wasn't really drawn in, the "villains" are the usual suspects: a group of women who look like a cross between the White Walkers and a female version of Hannibal Lecter, and the villain is an insane, abusive man who has a bunch of women tortured to death with a metal hook for a hand, but that's really about it. A bunch of people get killed off in pretty fast succession, and then we learn that the villain has actually created the army himself and is only using them as proxies to get to the leader of the Free People, who happens to be the president. The whole thing feels pretty random, but the final boss was actually really cool, I liked that he had a big black eye in the beginning of the movie, but by the end of the fight he was wearing a cast. It's pretty hard to judge a movie with only three movies in it, I think they should probably have shot more of it and cut a few scenes, but there was something about this movie that made it worth the wait. _________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It is a very good film. I don't know about you guys, but I had to leave the theater as fast as I could. This film did not leave me indifferent to the film. My only complaint is that it would have been nice if the writer had taken into consideration the effects of AIDS on the society and not to have a woman on the screen. I think it is a fine film but there is something wrong with this one. I hope that the writer will make a sequel for all the people who will love this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The Man Who Fell to Earth (1981) is a well-crafted, surprisingly engaging sci-fi movie. It has a great cast of actors, all of whom are excellent. It's funny, poignant, and very funny, with plenty of pop culture references and plenty of good acting by both lead actors, with the only real issue being the screenplay.  The movie is basically set in a future where a group of scientists discover that a group in the future developed a means of traveling into a previous time. What do you do when they arrive? What do they discover about our past? What are the dangers they find in a place they haven't been to before? The Man who Fell to earth is a very good film, with a strong script and an interesting, fun story. There's a great amount of tension in this movie, as we see a bunch of different scenarios unfold and are often unsure who is being played by who, or even who is the real guy. The movie is good fun, though the script is probably a little too over the top for the general viewer. In conclusion, I liked the movie The ManWho Fell to planet Earth, and found it to be a fun, enjoyable sci- fi flick.  Included with this review is an interview with director Brian Gibson of the film The Man from Earth, a review of the soundtrack from The Man From Earth, with a video review of The Manwho Fell to Planet Earth, the trailer for The ManFromEarth, and a short review of another Gibson film, The Devil's Advocate.  A link to the full review is included at the bottom of this post.  The review of John Carpenter's The Thing  is found at this link.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people know that the film I reviewed on July 5th is titled the "Troll 2" movie, but many don't know that was actually a sequel. The first troll film "Tales from the Crypt: The Cryptkeeper" was released in 1981, the second film was released on August 2, 1982. This film follows the first troll that the cryptkeeper had to defeat in the first film. This troll is named "Sorrento" and he has no memory of his previous encounter with the crypt keeper. The crypt keeper has taken Sorrento in the hopes that Sorrente will be able to find out where the other trolls were hiding. He brings Sorrenta to a forest to teach her how to defend herself and she finds the rest of the trolls, but the crypt keeps them all trapped in the crypt. The movie does the job it was originally created for and shows that there is a lot more to the cryptkeepers and Sorrent's adventures. I do have a few problems with the movie. First of all, while Sorrentino was really a great character in the original film, he's just really annoying in this one. He is too over the top and not very believable. There's a great scene where he explains to the other troll's that his name means "Grizzle." I mean, he knows how to say it and I really doubt anyone in his right mind would take it the wrong way. The other troll that he brings to the forest for some reason does not make any sense. When Sorrentio says "I'm sorry, I think I got the wrong place. It's "The Crypt," not "The Dungeon"". In fact, that troll never says anything in the entire movie. Why is he not fighting? Why does he want to come to Sorrenti's house? Why did he say he knew how to use a bow? Why didn't he attack the trolls when they first show up? And so on. The second thing I'm confused about is why did they bother making the crypt too big and where is the food for the other vampires? They seem to be just wandering around the forest trying to find each other. This is a very weird movie and even though I enjoyed it it did not really add anything to the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I love The Hateful Eight. In my opinion, it is the best, most beautiful film in the last few years. It is as much a story as a film. The actors are the stars and that is all there is to it. It's a very slow burn, but it's a slow burn worth experiencing. The best thing about The Haughty is that it's in black and white. This film is very easy to see because it's beautiful and the color is so beautiful. The picture of the snow is such a contrast with the reds and yellows.  Did you watch it yet? If you have and you are not in the mood to think of it like a film, you can watch it on Netflix right now and watch the trailer here. You can check out the synopsis on IMDb here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3855486/ The H, is an 8-part, Western-themed, drama written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins and John Travolta. The film will debut at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2015. The H. is produced by Tarantino's longtime collaborator and former girlfriend/wife Erika Jean (whom he married in 2009) and her company Red Granite Pictures. The project was based on a play by writer/director William Golden and is also based on the novel The Long Goodbye by Taranto's former screenwriter Mark Millar. Golden was approached by Tarant, who wanted to make a film based on his novel but he declined because he was unsure if he could adapt it as a drama. Golden is also a frequent collaborator of Tarantino. Golden and Tarantino collaborated together on Kill Bill, which is considered one of the best westerns ever made. The idea for The Hates came to Tarantino after Golden's play The Long Haul that he produced in 1993.

I loved this movie better. The actors were great, and the humor was sharp, witty and entertaining. The best part of this movie is when Jabba the Hutt shows up at the end. I love it when Jaba the Hoot is in a movie. There is always something humorous going on. I have seen many of the other Star Wars films and I never got bored with them. This is one of the first that I have been interested in, and it is a very good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ಡ  The story is a little slow. The first hour is a bit repetitive. I mean really. The story starts off about two teenage boys on their quest to make friends in their new town, but the story quickly gets bogged down in a few different issues. The movie has some excellent action scenes, and the story really gets into the head space of the kids and what they are trying to do. But the story feels repetitive. There is really no mystery to what is going on. The boys are just trying to learn how to survive in their hometown. I think it's safe to say that this will be an easy re-watch for me, since I never liked the first one. If you like that kind of story and enjoy some of the more bizarre things going on, then you will enjoy this. If not, then I would say it's not worth the money.

Not that I believe you'd have any reason to spend an evening watching this crap. For all the flaws, I could see some people watching this movie. My first inclination would have been to watch the two hour remake, but it's a disaster by all means. I'd still watch it, though, and, if it's not available, watch it again with a fresh mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've only seen two of them so far (with the third on the way) and I'm excited to see them again. I think they're both great (and a lot of fun to watch) and will enjoy their sequels.  A lot of times I feel like people have only heard good things about Star Wars and forget that there are a ton of movies that are great and aren't even called Star Wars. I loved The Empire Strikes Back (which was actually the second movie, it's like my third or fourth). I loved Return of the Jedi (again, my third, or fourth, or whatever). And yes, I loved Empire. But I think it's good that we've talked about the good ones. So many people say that Star Wars sucks, but if you're not a die hard fan of the Star Wars franchise you can find so much good in it (I'm talking about the books, movies, etc.).  As for the Bad: There are times that I'm annoyed by Jabba (in particular at how he's portrayed in the prequels). But he's not the only bad guy. The bad guys aren't bad because they're villains, they're bad because... well, they are. The plot is a mess in places, but this is what happens when you make a bunch of characters go against each other. If you had one bad guy and two good guys you'd have a nice movie (I hope Lucas is reading this, I'd love to see the prequel trilogy with Han and Chewie).

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I just picked up this movie on iTunes. I've heard it so much I had to give it a chance. I didn't have high hopes for it. Not only did the movie not live up to the hype it was given. It was quite slow, which is a common problem with the genre, I think the pacing was all over the place. The acting was also lacking, I don't mean the actors themselves but rather the actors trying to carry the entire movie by themselves. It would have been nice to see a few scenes of the other cast as well, although that would have made this one longer. The script and direction were not too bad either. It felt very much like a story that a man had told his wife but the tone of it felt more like a thriller or a police procedural. The movie wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I would still recommend watching the movie though just to get an idea of what they are talking about and maybe have an idea about where it could have gone.

We didn't see it all together, but my son was always talking about it. When I saw it again recently I was amazed at how the movie was still relevant. The movie features a young girl in a bad situation with a bad boy, who doesn't love her. In the end she becomes a good girl. The girl is a pretty girl, and she ends up having sex with a stranger who she loves. It is a good film with good acting. It has a really good soundtrack, and it is also a good story.

The Good girl is available on DVD (not in the US but in UK) in the following languages: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gravity" is a breathtaking, beautiful movie that will make you fall in love with every single character, every single scene, and every single piece of scenery.  The story is simple, but it doesn't take away from what is so good about this movie.  A few things stand out, the first being what would be described as a "gravity effect".  There is no sound, only the movie's soundtrack.  It's as if gravity is pulling everything and everyone towards the earth.  That sounds like a bad idea but I'm sure the effect makes the film come to life.  Second is that there is a lot of tension that builds up throughout the movie.   It starts off good enough, there are plenty of scenes that build up tension, but then it gets so good.  We see the gravity effect and a little boy is hurt as the house he lives in gets pulled into the earth, and he runs for his life. It's not until the end when things start to get really good, that the audience sees how much the audience was scared.  If this movie is as good as I expect it to be, I won't be surprised if people watch this movie a few times to get the full effect.  What I Like About This Movie:  If you've ever seen an alien planet, you'll see why this is a great movie to see.  It's so beautiful and so big.   There is so much to see and it shows.  They have created a very believable alien world, and it feels like we are really there.  But what really makes it great is the direction.  John and Andy Wachowski have a vision for what this movie should look like, and they do not disappoint.  The film is filled with beautiful cinematography and fantastic photography.  Some of the best cinematography ever is present in this movie, but most of it comes from Andy and John, so you can see why they are considered two of the most talented directors in this generation.  There are so many great performances in this film, not just for the main couple of characters, but for everyone involved in the film.  This movie has some amazing visuals.  There is just something so beautiful about the visuals in this picture.  And for those of you who want to see a big budget action movie with a beautiful story, this is the movie for you.  You will be so happy with this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who are unfamiliar with The Room, the premise is as follows: the world is being destroyed by an evil, mysterious, evil entity named The Room, and a small group of "experts" are tasked with trying to figure out what it is. The room is said to exist in a perpetual state of purgatory, where it has no rules, where every time it tries to leave it gets stuck in its own purgatorial purgation, and where every visitor is subjected to a trial or two of its own. The experts are there to ensure that The Room does not destroy the world yet again, but for some reason they have been unable to figure anything out. It is this mystery that keeps The Room entertaining. And it is this mysteriousness that makes The Room one of my favorite movies. As a fan of horror, I loved this movie. Not because of the gore or even the scary stuff, but because of how cleverly the film manages to be scary. The Room feels like it's trying to be a modern version of The Ring, but instead of being an innocent man trapped in a terrible room, it's a group of people who have no idea what they're in for and have been drawn into the movie's bizarre world, just as the group in The Ring were. In this film, the experts are tasked to investigate The Room. The rest of the movie follows a group called the Trio, as they try to figure things out. What makes The Disaster Artist a special movie is how much this movie is a story of what it's like to be inside a strange and wonderful mind, and how many different personalities are being brought out and brought to life. The most notable one is Kevin Spacey, who plays the group's leader and main character. As the film goes on, he's able to gain more and more information about the Room, such as how it has to exist inside of some kind of "space bubble" in order to survive and how it will only come to life if people visit it, and what The Room's victims have been subjected to. This is the most intriguing part of the film, and one of the only reasons the film has a little bit of the "you'll know it when you see it" quality that the rest of it has. And Spacey really nails the character here. He's not perfect, though. I found myself rooting for him a lot more than I usually would, but that

This is the greatest film that I have seen in years and decades.   I cannot wait for the DVD release as there is nothing like this on DVD.  Great film! A great film about people living in the wild. The most wonderful story I have had the pleasure of seeing!   I feel like I have been sucked in by this movie, as I cannot stop watching it.  The film is a masterpiece and should be on every person's DVD collection.  If you are a fan of the outdoors you must see this film!  A well-written, and moving, story of friendship.

Write a positive review about a good movie: )  Say what you love about it ) ______________________________________  "In the next ten years, you're going to be a writer." – John Updike  For those of you who've only ever heard the phrase 'write a script,' I'm willing to bet you're getting a little jaded, as all too often it means you've got something up your sleeve, but still not nailed it. If I was a young screenwriter in the late 1990's I was definitely thinking, "Well, what's the worst that could happen?" You know, I'm not worried about getting a job writing for a major studio. It's not worth getting fired over a script. Then my life took a turn for the worse when I took a job on an ABC pilot. My first script turned into a half-hour series, which was then reworked into an hourlong series. The first season of that show only lasted nine episodes and the second season lasted an additional two. It was not the end of my career, but it was a very dark place and I knew there was much work to be done, so I quit. I did go on to do a few other pilots that went nowhere (or at least I thought they did), but there was no real future in the industry for me, and I was ready to move on.  Then the script I read turned out to be so compelling and so different and fresh that I just couldn't get it out of my head. It wasn't a big studio project, but I had the opportunity to have a chance to get to work on my own project. It also turned out that I had been a fan of the show for years and really wanted to see it come to life on the small screen. The idea of having the chance to direct an hour-long episode of a TV series with a big budget didn't just appeal to me – it seemed like the right thing to do, not only to me, but to my brother, who I've worked with for the last 12 years and who I thought would be the perfect lead on the series. In a strange way, I think my writing career was actually beginning to take off, and that this was actually going to help me achieve that success I so often talk about. , I was lucky enough to work with the talented John Gemberling on, which we worked on for a little over two years. It ended up being

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Phantom Menace is a fantastic action epic, which is why it's hard to rate it. You need to watch it for the lightsaber fights and the characters, but you are also drawn into the story with its intricate plotting and fascinating characters. The plot is a lot of fun, and is set in a galaxy far, far away. There is some really funny characters, and a good deal of action. There's a lot to learn from this film, both about acting and writing, and I think it's a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby (2012) by F. Scott Fitzgerald This film is the final film by F Scott Fitzgerald, and the last film he ever made.   It is the end of a generation for the younger generation of filmmakers, and it is also the end for one of the most celebrated writers of all time, the "Father of American Literature."  It was an extraordinary film that managed to capture both the glamor of the era and the dark and lonely underbelly.  Like many of Fitzgerald's works, it captures both the beauty and pain of the time, but also the hope and promise of the future.   The Great Gatzby (Gatsby, 1925) is a novel that features many of the elements of Fitzgerald writing in his later years, though his characters and the world he created are all in his 20's.  The film stars Jay Baruchel, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Brad Pitt, and is a film based on the novel by Fanny Hill.  It is an adaptation of the book written by Fount Fitzgerald who lived from 1894 to 1961.  He wrote a number of novels including The Great Bell, The Crack-Up, and The Great Expectations and is famous for having written "The Great White Way," which he said was the best written novel in the English language.  The book was written in 1924 in the first of three iterations and a film adaptation was released in 1925 by the Paramount Pictures.   The GreatGatsbyshow a good story, but this is not a true biopic and it's not based on a true story.    Gatsbys   is a fictional tale about Gats by the author F.Scott Fitzgerald.   Gats is a young American millionaire who meets his future wife and falls in love with her and then he dies.  This novel is about the rise and fall of a young wealthy man's ego and love.  There is a real world influence to the film, but the film still has the flavor and feel of a film about the author of the classic "Great American Novel" that is in the style of a Hollywood Hollywood romance film.   This film is based on F. Scot Fitzgerald's novel, The Great White Nights, which was published in 1924, and a novel about the story of the writer F. SCOTT FITZGIBBONS, who is portrayed by Jay Baruch.   Fitzgerald's character

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I like this movie a lot! I liked the story, I liked how they got the money, I like how the actors made it, I guess it's like a "hanging out with the kids" movie where you have to be able to do what they want and they get what they deserve. The acting and the music were good too. I'd say for me it's "better than" it's sequels because the original is more serious (more drama) and I think that this is more "happening". The music in this one is more on the fun side, the only thing that stuck out for me was that it seemed like all the kids had a pet and it was a dog that wasn't really dog-like. And I guess a wolf is a wolf. I wish I could remember the name of the music I was listening to when I was watching it. It was this one, but I can't find it now!

As a big fan of the television series it is an honor to be able to see it on the big screen. A great script and a terrific cast. I can't wait to see what happens next! - August 4, 2013Fantastic film  Reviewer: jasonstark - favorite favorite favorite - December 17, 2012  Subject: So bad! So bad. I am so very sad. I wish I could just stop reading this and find something to do with my time. There are so many things wrong with this. First of all, there is no Spartacus. I cannot believe this even happened. This movie was a complete waste of time. We get all the usual political crap and there is a big group of slaves/prisoners, all with the same name (they must have been born in the same year) who are forced to go back and forth across the sea to the north. These slaves are put to work. They build boats, build a fleet and take it to war. The whole thing is ridiculous. There is no slavery, no war, no slave revolt and then when they return to their masters, they are not happy and no one is even given enough food to stay alive. At one point, we see a group of slave fighters (there were so many of them, I am starting to doubt there was even a real war) who have been through so much and are trying to take care of themselves, but we never see these people. Instead we get a couple of soldiers who are trying just as hard to take the slave ship. Then we get to see how the slave ships get to battle. They are pretty slow. They do not even make it to their destination. I do not know why, but they seem to just disappear. At the end, there are the slaves and there are no slaves. Just bodies. That is it. We never get to find out what happened to them. Then, it is explained that the ships are destroyed by the Romans. There were no slaves on the ships, so they were obviously destroyed. The slaves are shown as being very happy about that. Then it is stated that the slave soldiers are dead, so no one really remembers them. We then go to a place of celebration and then we see more slaves. There's not much to say about them, except that they look the same as before.

It's an adventure story, I think. I had to pause and think of an appropriate metaphor for how it works, but I think it's a metaphor. It is a metaphor of how good movies can be, and bad ones can be. It's like an onion. It has many layers. You'll never get into the middle. The top layer is that the Empire is an evil empire that kills a lot of people, destroys a lot more things, and is basically a bunch of weirdo space Nazi scientists who make crazy experiments that turn their soldiers into walking bombs and their planets into moons. The middle layer is the reason you're not surprised. That's why the Empire gets it so wrong. The Empire is a great evil empire. That is why people who are good don't get it right. They don't understand it. They can't see it. The second layer is where people are happy to be with their family, they get the most happiness. And the last layer is this is a story about this guy who has been given the chance to take back his home planet, his family, and his friends. I don't think the first layer is going to change your mind. I think you'll stay where you are. I'm a Star Wars fan and I'm going to stay a Star Trek fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ is the perfect film about the power of music, and about the people who make it. This is music in its purest form, a joyous celebration of the very best that music has to offer and its most beautiful and powerful performances. The film is very much about the artist, about the joy of creating, about creativity and about what it means to be able to do the best you can and the best thing that you can create, to do it with passion, and to share it with the world. _______________ is a very good movie. It may be one of my favourite movies of all time and I think there are plenty of reasons why. It has so much to say about music and about creativity, it touches so many areas that are important to us, and it does so with a lightness and a fun sense of humor. There is always the sense of wonder that comes with music, with the creation and the connection that can only be achieved through it. There are so many wonderful performances throughout the film, and we get to know them so much better, too. It is an amazing achievement, and I am very happy that this movie has been made in the year 2007. It feels like the future of filmmaking is bright, and that it is only a matter of time before we see many great movies like _________. I was a fan of this movie, a bit of a musical nerd, but it was the soundtrack that made it for me, so it's hard for me to say whether I would have given this movie 5 or 10 stars had it been made as a pure musical.

The show is now available on iTunes and YouTube. (Photo by ABC/Disney Enterprises, Inc. via Getty Images) This is the first time an episode about suicide has been aired on American television. (credit: ABC/ Disney Enterprises, LLC) This was the second time an American television show had aired a special about suicide. The first time was in 1993. (Credit: NBC/Paramount Pictures) This episode was first aired in 2000. ( Credit: ABC) The special featured interviews with many celebrities who were suffering from suicide. ( credit: ABC (Credit photo: ABC Entertainment)  On Friday night, ABC aired a documentary called Suicide Squad. It was the fourth time the channel had aired the episode, but the first since September 2015. It had to have been a big deal — with Suicide Squad playing at a time when the number of suicides in the U.S. has reached an epidemic level. (For more on the epidemic, click here.)  The special focused on a famous character called Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie. Robbie's role was not that of a suicide victim; she was a superhero, working as a caped crusader against criminals and supervillains. She was also a friend of Batman, played brilliantly by Ben Affleck.  In one scene, they're having a discussion about superheroes. Robbie says, "I think the reason why people like her is because of her attitude." Affleck responds, "What do you mean?" Robbie responds, in a deadpan, "Well, she's an all-American girl. She doesn't drink. She wears jeans. She's smart. She loves Batman. She plays the piano."  Then there's a moment that really caught the attention of critics. The director asks if Batman would consider suicide. Robbie responds that he has. He says, sarcastically, "Oh, so you want to go out with me?"  That line was one of the more memorable in the entire episode. The writers made sure to keep the joke in there — in a way, Robbie would have been the one who was talking to the caped Crusader.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I was excited to see a new movie from "The Dark Knight" (2011) director Christopher Nolan. But the truth was the movie didn't really work well in terms of quality. I was expecting an epic movie about Bane and Batman battling each other. The movie is so generic, it's boring and you can tell the director really wanted to make a "Batman Begins". He wanted to use the same actors but they looked like they were reusing the same stunt guys from "Batman". But it's a big disappointment for me because Nolan created the Dark Knight and this film doesn't have anything to do with that. I don't know why this movie had to be made, but it's all about Batman and Bane. I didn't care for the villains, it was just "Bane" fighting "Batman" with no changes to the story or plot. I'm really disappointed by this movie because it's not really like the movie from the comic books or Nolan's other movies. If you're going to watch the movie, you should watch the book. It was more of a continuation of the story of "The Batman" than this movie. The story was interesting and thought provoking, the characters were likeable and well done. The ending was a surprise and it was pretty good. The sound was pretty bad and the special effects, especially on the water and the smoke, were really crappy. I can't wait for the next movie because I really liked this movie, but I won't be watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________.   Watch this movie: Get yourself a free blu-ray of the movie and read the story!  I wish this movie would have been a much better experience. There were times in this movie that I wished it was a little more story-driven, but still very much entertaining. It has been said that it is based on the book, but it is not really a story as much as an exercise in art. The main character is a little bit arrogant, and it is difficult to love him when that is the case. That is why this movie is not a classic, it is a very well put together piece of art, and the director really nails the way he shoots the camera. I enjoyed the art of the picture and the cinematography and there were also several great performances. This movie is one of those films that people who like art movies will enjoy, because it is so fun.

The Magnificent Seven (1974) Director: Sergio Leone I would say that this is the most famous western of all time, but that is not very accurate, it is more of a classic. If you have seen this film you know what I mean, it will stay with you for the rest of your life. I do have a few criticisms, but I will get into them a little later. This film is amazing for a number of reasons, it has all the great classic western tropes from the start. The music is incredible, and the action scenes are top notch. One of the best things about the movie is it has great characters with wonderful lines. There are a couple of minor issues with the movie, like the opening and closing credits. They are slow to start, and they don't work at all. I would love to see a longer opening and ending. I will just say that the first couple of minutes of the movie are absolutely amazing. Then the movie has a lot of great scenes, but again it is slow going. The last 10 minutes are very, very good, but it is very slow going too.  The film is also rated R, which is an all-time great rating. I will say that some of the characters don't like each other very much, but then the other two actors are really great.  They are great characters, and I wish they had been made more famous in the movie.  I would have liked to have seen more about the other characters. 7. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) Directors: Sergio Corbucci and Clint Eastwood This is the original version of the film, and is pretty much the most popular and well loved Western. The action and the setting is excellent, and this is also the first movie that I would say has the greatest soundtracks ever. The violence is pretty brutal, but you need to see it to understand the violence in this movie. I also really liked how the film deals with the Native Americans, they have a very bad reputation and we don't even see any of their side of the story, but they also don't make any mistakes. The characters are all really well developed, and it is a shame that most of the roles were left open to the various actors in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end it is hard to tell what is the real point of this movie. The main point is to sell toys to children. If I remember correctly, the toys they were making were very similar to the ones from the 70's and 80's but with some modern additions. This movie tries to sell these toys but fails miserably. There are also some good jokes in this movie but I don't think they can ever be as funny as the ones in the original Star Wars Trilogy. They are pretty good though and the movie does show that the toys have some serious problems but it seems that some of the problems can be solved by the new characters in the film. So, what did you think about this movie? Is it a good attempt to get money for toys or is it just another Star Wars ripoff? Please comment, share and subscribe!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie! I liked the story, the characters, and the plot. It is not a deep and complicated plot but I liked it, it had a very unique twist. It was interesting and I liked how it was different from anything I had seen so far. I would recommend this to any fans of the X-men franchise, especially fans of The Last Stand. If you are like me, you will definitely enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ The only thing I could think of to criticize is that the movie seems to be taking place in a much darker and more violent universe than I imagined.    As a film, though, it's an incredible piece of work, and has a strong moral as well as some very great performances.  The movie has a very dark sense of humour and a pretty serious tone, so it's a little hard to get a clear picture of its content until you get a bit more involved.  It's not a perfect movie by any means, but that's mostly because it was written so quickly and so loosely.  The only real fault I see is that this movie is very, very short.  There are only three episodes, and only the first and last two were all that were used for the whole movie.  For the most part, the episodes just serve as introductions to the characters and the world of the movie, and not much else.  Posted by Mike D at 10:44 AM In another episode of the  Movies We Like  we take a look at the classic horror film, The Exorcist.   The Excorcist  is one of the earliest movies to make use of this method, and it remains a classic to this day.  Although it has a few problems, The Conjuring  also has many that are quite interesting, and the fact that it was a good-looking movie at the time was a bonus.  In this episode we take a deeper look at this movie, but it still isn't a good film by any stretch.  While it has some wonderful scares and a great cast, the acting is pretty bad.  Even the special effects for some of the most frightening scenes aren't that great.  After the first few minutes we are introduced to a new character, and we learn that she is very much an ally and not the enemy that we are initially lead to believe.  Once she is introduced we are given some of her motivations and her goals.  She doesn't just want to be a part of this new group, she wants to stop the supernatural.  Her motivations start off as simple and logical, and then we quickly come to see that they aren't.  When I first watched this movie it took a bit for me to get into the story.  I'm not sure if I was too young when I first saw it or if it was just bad, but I

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I was in a little mood and this movie was right up my alley. I am a sucker for stories that are dark and gritty and this has got everything going for it. I found myself really feeling for this guy. He is really a man of his word, which is always great to see in a movie. There is some very serious content here, and there are a few bloody moments, but the action and suspense are kept really interesting and well crafted. There are also a couple of funny moments in this film and I laughed quite a bit at the ending of this movie. I guess the thing that is missing here is some kind of villain or something to really make the story really worth watching. I hope we get one of those as we have been promised one for a while now and I am sure they will deliver something good, just maybe not this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ It was the first movie I ever saw where I was completely convinced that they were not just making a movie. I was not expecting any kind of action/thriller genre film from them, and was very impressed. However, after the first couple minutes of the film, I really felt like this was a comedy. The way they were handling the story made me laugh so hard that it hurt a bit. It was a funny, energetic movie that wasn't afraid to show its characters as silly characters and have them goof around. It had a good variety of characters, with some funny parts mixed in and a few funny scenes. _____________________________________________________ Score:  A  (7.6/10)

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!.  I love the ending. It's awesome.  and the ending just made me laugh out loud. . The movie was fantastic.  the actors did a great job. and it was great to see that they didn't do a ton of makeup. It was just how they look without makeup, and it worked fine. I think they could have used some more, but it wasn't a problem at all. I liked the idea. But, there was no way they could make this into a good film. So, the ending was great. The music was wonderful. It didn't take away from the film. The cast was excellent. But if you don't like the ending, you might not like the film (you're not going to get the movie out of me). But, if you like a good ending, I recommend that you watch this. The film was wonderful, I'm sure. It just wasn't the movie I thought it would be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "All Hail the Queen" is another great production by a top Hollywood director. Director: John Madden Cast: Michael J. Fox, Anne Bancroft, John Travolta, Diane Lane, Jane Fonda, Peter Sellers Plot: In 1960, Queen Elizabeth II is imprisoned at Balmoral. She's a captive of Queen Elizabeth (Jane Fonda), her husband Philip (John Travolas) and their two daughters (Anne Bancroe and Mary Steenburgen). Queen Elizabeth is being held prisoner in the form of a wax statue at Balindi Palace, on a castle in Scotland. Queen Elizabeth's three eldest daughters are constantly looking out for her. They are the only ones who know of the real Queen Elizabeth. She is being kept in the Castle of Balindis, in the castle where her brother Edward had been buried when he died. The castle and its inhabitants are so secret that no one knows of it's existence. The Queen has become accustomed to her confinement. She has made it her routine to wake at 6:30 in the morning to exercise and then she spends her day at work and recreation. The film opens with Queen Elizabeth sitting in her room at Bal Indre, the castle in which her mother, Elizabeth (Bancrofts), Queen Victoria, and her other sisters were held prisoner. Queen Mary (Steenburgen) tries to wake Queen Elizabeth from her sleep. Queen Anne (Boleslaw Fajcsik) tries also. Anne has an affair with Queen Mary, and Queen Mary and Anne are at odds with each other. Queen Victoria (John F. Kennedy) is visiting Bal Indrea, as she is very ill. In a dream, she's watching a dance which her daughter, Elizabeth, dances in the moonlight. She thinks her granddaughter has become more beautiful, as well as a more capable and loving woman. Queen Elizabeth decides to escape from the castle to escape the guards. She knows she will be found, but she does not know where she is going to go. She does not want to be caught because she's so lonely and miserable. At the castle, she discovers the secret of her mother's imprisonment and is able to flee. Queen Queen Elizabeth tries to persuade a group of her maids to return with her to the palace. As the group of maids leave, Queen Mary's maid (Greta Garbo) arrives and warns her not to return because Queen Elizabeth has

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I saw from this director was The Haunting (1985). This film is very similar in style and style in the way the film tells the story of a boy named Charlie, who moves to a small town in the middle of nowhere, where nothing seems to change. There's always something creepy going on, and the kids are always in danger. In this case, Charlie's older brother has just gotten married and has a wife and a child. The first time he sees Charlie and his wife, his sister shows up and has him escorted out of town. Then one day, Charlie sees the bride and groom walking together down a dark path. This is the same path where the boy and his brother were killed, so the fact that they were married, with the couple walking down the same route as the boy has him running away. That's what the kid wants to do. He has an axe in his back and he wants to end his life. Charlie has nothing to live for, and he ends up finding a strange man in the woods who's got a knife. He lets him live, and Charlie starts seeing him regularly. The man is The Red Man, and his job is to take the spirits that are haunting Charlie, and then return them to the world. However, when Charlie first meets him, The Red man is not at all the person we'd expect. He's a very strange and creepy old man, who speaks in a way that makes it impossible to understand what he's saying. Then later he comes back, alive, and reveals that he's never actually killed anyone. He just takes people's spirits, and gives them a new life as he takes on their identities. He is a nice old man who wants to help people. However it also becomes clear that The Red will do anything for his own selfish reasons. He wants to be with Charlie, he wants Charlie's girlfriend to be his wife and they have a son together, so he kills Charlie's own son to get to Charlie. And it gets worse, later in the film when he is trying to murder Charlie's father, the father turns to The Red, and in the spirit world, The Old Man explains that Charlie is not dead, but he has passed on. He had been moved to the other side, and now he is trapped in the other world. As he explains this, we see Charlie walk away from him, and we are left to believe that he was the one who killed him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  I am so thankful that I decided to make this post. For those of you who are going to try it (hopefully it works for you), I hope that you have fun with it. If you don't like it, then I'm sorry to have bothered you, but if you do, let me know how I can make it better. The idea for this was actually born out of a conversation I had with my friend on facebook a little over a week ago. We're pretty casual friends, so we've never really talked about horror movies. I know that horror movies are great, but I've never been a huge fan myself. After a couple months of playing League of Legends (a game that I've always had a soft spot for, and my friend has recently fallen in love with too), I started asking her about horror and she immediately responded with an animated gif of a vampire in an office chair, so I thought that would be a great conversation topic. This conversation lead to me coming up with this idea for a zombie movie, that I'll now make into a blog post. The script is written, I've made some connections with some friends and producers I know, and I'm very excited to start shooting this movie. I've attached some images from the script, but you'll have to go to the movie page for that, as it will be a bit too graphic for most readers. I'll be posting a trailer/trailer clip soon as well, but it doesn't really need one as I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about.  So without further ado, here's the movie trailer.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Love this movie. I loved it. The first time I watched it I was so depressed. I was like, "wow, this is horrible, I'm never going to like this." But then I rewatched it and it's so funny. I know the reviews were horrible. People were like, it's a terrible movie. But it's not. I think it's great. It's like the funniest movie I've ever seen. It is very dark and sad and sad. I just hope no one gets into a car crash.  And it's funny. It was so hard for me to find a good comedy that wasn't made by a writer who had a million ideas. [Laughs]  This movie has been out for eight years. What was it like to watch the movie you wrote for 8 years?  It was funny. What's weird is that the script I wrote is the same movie. It took a lot of work. I wrote it for four years and I had a lot to think about. I mean, I had two movies that were good but didn't have a lot going on.  the script that I wrote for eight year is still the same script that people who saw the film for eight-years said they liked. It just got better. So I'm really happy. It still does, actually. It does. ...  That was your last film? , and a lot happens. In one of the movies, I have a sex scene with one of my friends and it gets really dark. I don't want to reveal any more than that.  he wrote a couple of movies with his wife, but then he was going to leave her because he was having this relationship with a woman in the movie. They were trying to get rid of the guy so they could make more money. It worked, but they ended up making the movie with me.

It even has the music that was used in the film. One of the only things that I dislike in the movie is the fact that it is not made of actual clay, it is made of foam. I understand that the movie was shot on film, and there are problems with having clay, but there has to be a reason for the use of foam in the characters' faces and body movements.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie. It was good. There were a few things I had to do to get through it. I don't know how to describe it well. Like I said it was good, and you have to watch it on its own merit. The only reason it didn't get a five I gave it five was because there are still many parts that didn't do anything for me. The bad part is that there is no resolution to the mystery of what happened to the girls. The first few times I watched it I felt like I was wasting my time. I would have loved to have seen a sequel, but since this is the last part I didn't see any point in watching. I also don't like how they ended with the credits going out, but I don The only thing that would make this an all around good movie is if it was an all girl group.

The characters were very interesting, the film made you question why we kill our family pets. The story was very well done. The film also had a few funny bits to it. I did not understand why it was set on Christmas Day. Maybe we live in a backwards culture or we are all a bunch of christians. I do not know. One of the scenes where two animals talk about being in the middle of the forest for a winter and the other one talks about how he misses his cat made me laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ If you think this movie is the greatest thing to ever come out of the 80's, or even is the best 80's movie ever made, then you are right! I love this movie so much I had a hard time getting it off of my head the day I watched it! I'm always a fan of the 70's because of the amazing action, great plot, and memorable characters, and it's no surprise that I fell in love with this movie in the same way. Now, some of the best characters that the 70s had to offer were in this movie. Like most good action movies, the plot is somewhat simplistic and the characters seem to be very similar to their counterparts from the 80s. However, there are some interesting ideas that the movie introduces throughout the film that I found quite intriguing. Now I know that many of you will say that this is a rip-off of the "Back to the Future" movies, and that is a fair assessment, but the similarities between this film and the "Lonely Hearts" series doesn't detract too much from my love of the movie. For me, it is the unique characters, the awesome 80's action scenes, and the incredible song that makes the movie such an enjoyable watch. The movie was also directed by the talented John Landis, and his direction was outstanding as well, and I'm sure that the next two movies he directs will be just as good, if not better! A must watch for all fans of the 1980's. ____________________________ See my review of "Back To The Future Part III" - http://reviews.yahoo.com/w/101052489/reviews/1012052657/4?ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419110161&sr=8-1&keywords=joe+foster+part+iii+back+to_the_future+part_i&sort=d&t=l See my reviews of all of the sequels: http://www.imdb.com

When the "evil" vampire is introduced, I had to laugh at how the guy who had his leg bitten off by the vampire laughed as he was on the phone to his girlfriend. ******** The most ridiculous thing I did see in this was the vampire that was trying to use the old vampire blood to get pregnant. ************ I am sure this is the best movie I have ever seen and I have watched a lot of them in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My daughter saw this movie, and while I am glad she did, I was a little upset that she did not see it in the theater. This is a movie to watch on a long airplane flight, or with your kids when you are out in nature. If your only other option is a fast-paced action movie, try The Hunt for Red October instead. (I know I am boring you with the plot here.) I am sure the story and characters are excellent, and I am always entertained when my daughter watches a movie with me. However, it is my daughter's turn to see the movie, so I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to post a review of this film. I have watched the trailer a few times now, and am always blown away by the movie. It starts out slow, but the suspense is what keeps you in the seat, and even though I am not the biggest fan of long action/adventure movies, I did not want the movie to end. The cast is very good, and there is something for everyone here. It really is a great film to watch with your family. I am really looking forward to the sequel, but until then, I recommend this one. Also, I am going to give this a thumbs up because of how fun it is to see a group of soldiers in a real-life situation. _________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ "It's like this...I've lost a brother" (Lionel Richie, The Power of Love) Written by Robert Redford (who plays a struggling actor who's struggling with the loss of his wife) and directed by Tony Scott. I loved this movie, it was a really well acted and well written film, especially the way Redford portrays his brother Bobby. I really liked this movie because it didn't seem to make fun of its audience at all. In fact I found myself getting emotionally attached to the characters and their struggles. It also took a lot of risks with its subject matter which didn't feel forced or even like a typical story. It didn't try to make an 'aw shucks' movie, there were no bad guys or people trying to make us sympathize with them, rather it used the tragedy as a means to explore a few themes. __________________________________________________ "He was a great guy, he was one of the good guys" (Ethan Hawke, The Big Short) Written and directed By Ethan Hawke (writer/director of the Oscar-winning Milk) and starring Chris Rock. This movie does everything right. It's an amazing movie that uses the story of a struggling stockbroker to tell a very interesting story about greed, morality, and the need for redemption. The acting is top notch, the writing is excellent, the music is amazing, and I found the characters to be believable. The only thing that holds this back from being perfect is its limited distribution. _____________________________ "I hope she finds what she's looking for and it isn't a man who can't talk" (Meryl Streep, Steve Jobs) Written/directed by Steve Jobs and starring Meryl Streeps. This is a film that is filled with so much emotion and it's one of those films that makes you realize that Meryl has the ability to show us all of the great things about men and women. It portrays the struggle of being a woman in an almost unbelievable situation, but it's so well done it's almost impossible to watch and it gets into the head of every woman you know that was a teenage girl in the 80s. __________________ A man is getting divorced. He has to decide which of his children will live with him and which will stay with the mom, and after some debate and deliberation he has an interesting choice to make. Written by Nick Park.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am in love with the cast of "Gone Girl."  We have Amy Adams and Ben Affleck.  And of course, Nick (Matt Damon) and Amy's son, Mason.  I am so thrilled that Nick and Amy were able to make a movie without Amy's help.  If not for Amy's "advice," it seems the movie would have been far less fun to watch.  Amy had great suggestions but the actors did not give their performances her touch.  I enjoyed the movie from start to finish.   The fact that the movie doesn't end with the usual happy ending is a nice touch. I can imagine that Amy will be pleased with the ending.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight  is great  It is brutal  and it is entertaining.  If you like Tarantino then you will love this movie.  The Haughty: The cinematography is gorgeous and it is so well shot.  The acting is all great but the actors can all be better than what they were in Pulp Fiction.  It is a perfect mix between Tarantino and the Coen Brothers.  I would recommend this to everyone.   If you want a great Quentin Tarantino movie then watch this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If it was any other way I could have left my rating at one star! I love this movie but this is a case of too many stars!!! I have to say the action scene in the boat was great and I loved the scene between Billy Bob and the man in the hat. However the other action scenes I thought was a little over the top. I know it was a PG-13 but not every movie should be rated G-13. Also I felt that the movie was a lot more sentimental then the book. The ending seemed rushed too but I can't say that it wasn't necessary. I just wish they had left out the ending. That would have been better. Overall, great movie and a great story. Watch it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was not quite the movie I was hoping it would be. However, it is a great story and it was worth the price of admission. I would recommend watching it if you haven't already. It was a very good movie that had a happy ending. 4/5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Tower Heist" is a fast paced, fun, and exciting action comedy. It takes place in the year 2035 and follows the antics of a group of cops in the future trying to track down the perpetrators of a gang-robbery that left many dead and dozens injured. The movie was great and it had great characters and a great cast. The dialogue was spot on and the action was great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 10/10 is that it had a little too many action sequences. There was so much action, especially in the last 15-20 minutes, that it took me out of the film a bit. It also doesn't help that the end of the movie didn't seem as awesome as I had hoped it would. That being said, it is still a fun film and I'd definitely watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This is a great film. The script was superbly written, which is difficult because the actors seem to be in the wrong roles. They are playing themselves and they were good, they were all in the right places at the right times. The acting is solid, the cinematography is fine, the music is excellent and the special effects are good. This movie is really about the nature of man, and its not just about the characters, it has to do with all the issues that we can have in life and the people around us that shape our lives. It does not use the word "grief", but it is the central theme of the film and is well worth watching. I give it an 8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an underrated film. I think it has all the elements for a classic story, but it's lacking in a few places. It's set in an old fashioned western town, so we expect the scenery to be beautiful and well-crafted. But I feel like there was a lot of space spent just on making the town look good. There's a lot to say about this film: the main character and his wife get in a little fight, they talk a lot and then he decides to have an affair. It makes you realize that things are not always the way they appear. We get a lot more of a look into the personal lives of the characters.  The music is fantastic. If you've never heard a song in a western before, try "The Old Man of the Mountain" by Billy the Kid. It is so memorable. The acting is also really good. The director tries to tell a story in a way that is different than most other westerns. There are a lot less guns in this film than most westerns of the time, and you feel more alive with the people you see.  This is definitely worth watching.

It isn't the worst of the year (that would be The Descendants with the star power of Chris Pine and Jake Gyllenhaal), but it certainly isn't what I had hoped for. The plot is interesting and the acting is solid but there just isn't a whole lot of heart here. The acting is also the thing that most drives this movie home; it's all pretty wooden. There's a lot of character development, but there's nothing real that makes any difference to the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do yourself a favor and just go watch that movie. It's so good you won't be able to believe it. Even when the movie is bad, it still has that something to it. ___________ I'm going to admit it right off the bat: I watched this movie, not for the story, the characters, or the plot... but rather because of its catchy theme song. In the film, there is a group of friends who, while on a date, stumble across a small island inhabited by a very peculiar looking monster. The monster, while appearing human, is actually an alien and the friends are shocked by this. But, the friends soon realize that the island is inhabited by very powerful monsters and they also realize they have to fight against them if they are to survive. The music in this movie is also good. The theme song is catchy, simple and very enjoyable. It gets stuck in your head and makes you want to sing along. As an added bonus, the theme song was remade by the band the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2003 and was also included on their album "Dani California". ____________
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________  Review is for the movie "Gloria" (2002) written and directed by David Gordon Green, based on the novel by Virginia Hamilton: The story follows a woman named Gloria, who lives in New Orleans with her mother. She has a crush on a guy named David, but he rejects her. After her mother dies from cancer, Gloria is the sole remaining member of her family. She meets a former sailor called David, who is a member of the gang called the Furies. David has a friend who works for the Mafia, a guy called the Gambler, and a guy who helps run the docks. Their group has a lot of respect for Gloria's mother. The movie is the second attempt by director David Gordon to adapt the novel. He had a very good first attempt called "The Long Kiss Goodnight", but there is no suspense, no tension. This movie has none of those things, and it's a really good movie. It is a love story, which is a very nice touch. The screenplay and the direction are very well written. The direction and screenplay is great. The actor playing David is the actor who played David Gordon in "The Wire". The actress playing Gloria's daughter is very good, too. The cast is very well balanced and the actors can deliver each role. This film really has no plot holes and the script is tight. The actors really bring it. There are no weak links in this movie, and the acting is great throughout. Gloria's life is pretty tragic and you can see why she's so depressed and bitter towards David, and why she needs a way out of it. David brings in a lot to this movie. He's very funny. He makes the whole movie hilarious and the movie is very funny and very well directed. This is probably my favorite movie about a woman being crushed by a bad boyfriend I have ever seen. The ending of this movie is an absolutely perfect ending that brings it all to a close in such a satisfying way. This may be the best film ever made about a girl having a bad day. The acting in this film is great, and there is really nothing I can say that could be improved on. David Gordon really knows how to make a movie. Gloria is so depressed that she has lost all hope, and David can bring out the worst in her. The film has a story that is simple and straightforward. The script is very clear, but it has the potential to become very dense

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked the first installment, but I'd recommend it to a lot more people if I hadn't seen that other film.  That one wasn't as good as the second one, but it was pretty damn good.  The film has a fantastic cast and is based on a story by the great Douglas Adams, but if you're just trying to get out of a boring conversation about the state of our country you might miss a lot of the humor.  The ending was great, but what really sells the story is the way it tells the story.   I watched the first two movies to get a feel for the writing and I enjoyed both of them, but this one was definitely more fun.  - December 22, 2005Best 2 minutes of movie I've seen in a while What did you think about this film?  I enjoyed the film a lot.  It's definitely something different, so don't expect the same story. It does play off a great story from the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," and is probably my favorite film to see in a theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie.  Some funny stuff, some not so funny stuff.    The movie starts with a scene of some girls getting some sort of pleasure from a dude (who is in the audience at this one).  They are getting pleasure from him by making him orgasm by licking him.  Now what they want to do is to make him cum by sucking his dick. They start doing that by making his dick cum over and over.  So they finally get him to cum and they make him get on his hands and knees to get the last of his cum.  Well this is just too much fun to leave off the list.  This movie is the best of its type.  It has so many variations on it that you will always see something that is funny.  The guy in the scene was just a bit too short to be believable as the man he is in this movie (he is only 5'10).   I give it 3/5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ If you liked a movie with an "action movie" feel and you were expecting more, then you should not watch the last half of this film. The "action" that the first half of the movie presents consists of lots of people getting shot, killed, maimed, and even having their hearts ripped out. This movie is all about "doing the dirty deeds" for the movie's main character. He is a former cop and the only person left who can stop a guy who is killing people on a daily basis. The problem here is that the character isn't really well developed. It's hard to tell what he wants out of life. He kills people in the movie but he doesn't actually do anything. This isn't a bad thing though, the film does a good job of showing his mindset. He wants to be a cop like his father (but he never says much about it). His girlfriend seems to be more of an accomplice but she is a good girlfriend and doesn't have any feelings for him. The movie tries to portray this as a serious and evil thing. Yet it never actually goes this far. He has a small problem that he has to deal with but it doesn't escalate until the last 20 minutes of the film. There are no long conversations about his problems or his thoughts on life. The story does have some good moments but the movie also does a poor job with them. It is all short scenes of people being dead and lots of blood. The music is OK but the film itself is not. There were a few great action scenes and it was quite well acted but there were some really weird choices as well. ___________________________________________________ Summary: _________________________________________________________________________________ This movie has some good action and some really good acting, which makes up for the boring story. It was quite an entertaining watch, just not worth the time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is an interesting movie. There is some nudity but it is not so gratuitous as to be objectionable. I would have liked to see more of the action but it does not overwhelm the film. I have no problem with what the director has done. The acting is top notch. It is not too shabby. It does not try to be serious and it does a great job in keeping the humor in check. This is a nice watch and I look forward to seeing it again. I think this is a worthwhile film.

I bought the Blu-Ray and the movie looks great, the special features are decent. The pacing is perfect, the writing is perfect and the film's ending is perfect. My only complaint is that the film has very slow starts to it. As you go on, the speed picks up and the pacing gets much better. The special effects are great and the whole story and characters are perfect. In addition to that, the voice-acting is perfect as well and the action scenes are great. I really can't recommend this to anyone, even if you're not a fan of action flicks or even a fan that enjoys science fiction or fantasy movies, it's still very very good. If you enjoy the story, the characters, the art and the overall experience of this film, you'll enjoy it. *******************

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's funny, sad, and at times horrifying. There are a few moments of genuinely heartwarming dialogue, some great cinematography, and of course a huge number of characters with their own unique personalities.  The film has some very memorable scenes, including a very memorable, very intense one in a hospital that reminds me of the infamous hospital from the film  MASH. The ending is unexpected and has lasting consequences, but it's not really all that significant.  A man (played by John Goodman, who played the lead in the film) takes his girlfriend (played with amazing comedic skill by Vanessa Redgrave) to visit a girl he meets on the subway (played beautifully by Kate Winslet, who will be seen in The Artist ) at a point where it's impossible to know if the two are lovers or friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My boyfriend and I came to see this movie about 3 times between May, 2011 and August 2013. When I came back the second time and watched it again, I realized that there is a lot to the story. The cinematography in the movie is top notch and there are so many scenes that make you feel something and you just want to get to the end. There are a lot of "loveable" characters in this movie. I would say that the main character, T.J., is the only one who is really "bad" and that's why you care about him. When he and his best friend, John, have sex, it is one of the best scenes in the history of movies. The best part of the film, however, is the soundtrack. When this movie came out, I didn't even know that The Shins were a band, but I knew about their songs. The sound of their songs on this film is so perfect, especially the ending song "Songs From The Black Hole." The soundtrack and the movie itself, are two parts of the same film. The movie itself is really fun. It has a lot going on but not so much that you are bored. The film doesn't seem as serious as some films but the characters seem real. I think I had a lot more fun watching this movie than I did watching my friend's band's live show, so I recommend this movie for those who want to have a good time and are looking for a good story to be in. _______________________________________ A bit of an in depth review:  __________________________________________ The main theme in the story is: T. J.'s relationship with John. While the movie seems to get stuck in a dark hole at times, there are a few moments that you feel for the characters and feel sorry for them. T. Jay's character and his relationship with his father is very real and the end of the movie has a great ending. The music in the film is top shelf and while I didn`t know that the band was a real band, I knew the songs. Tommie Sunshine's song "All The Love I've Got Is For You" was probably one of my favorite songs in the whole movie and I hope that someone gets to play it at a Shins show sometime. This is not a film that I recommend that you watch for the first time. There is a bit of a story but it is very slow going and at

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lose Yourself To Dance was not only a good comedy, it was also a great romantic comedy, although I must say that I didn't love the movie. The reason why is that it had too many clichés: dancing with a hot girl, bad boyfriend, bad car accident, and the biggest one of all; bad ex. The movie starts with a bad guy who is an ex-girlfriend, and later on we learn that she is a stripper, and then later on he starts to go back to her. So this movie has everything in the world: dancing, ex, and a crazy boyfriend who is a big jerk. I like the fact that the characters are always there, but then the story does not seem to go anywhere. I mean, the ex starts to hang around the guy that was the main source of misery for the girl, and that's pretty much it. The main focus is not on the main couple, but on the exes that started with the main guy. 3.5 out of 5 Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good movie. I think it was very funny, and I liked the characters very much. The only thing that I don't really like about the movie is that the main man is just kind of a loser. He is an old guy who lives in his trailer, and he doesn't really know anything about anything. He can't cook, he doesn´t drive, and when he is having sex it's just boring. This guy has a hard time with a woman because he doesn`t know what he´s doing. He does things in a way that he cannot understand. Also, he has an ex girlfriend, and it was never mentioned how that ex died. My Rating: 3.5 of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One can never be too old for a good story"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never watched a movie quite like this. It's a fast, hilarious, well-acted, very emotional and well-written movie with some wonderful performances. It feels like a time capsule. And it is. The film opens with a shot of a woman with a black eye who says, "You don't have to put up with this. We know you've got better things to do." We then see a young black man in a hoodie standing at a liquor store talking to his mother about "that" day, the day he saw a police officer beat up a young white man. His mother replies, "That's exactly what happened, baby, that day." She's a victim of racial profiling and this young man is the victim of the police officer's brutality and racism.  It's then a montage of footage of black and white residents walking past a black man who looks like he's been beaten. The camera moves through a crowd to a convenience store, where a white customer is sitting in the corner, seemingly watching the beating with an amused smile. The film then continues to go back in time, and we see the young man and his mother talking on the telephone with a friend. In the corner of the shot, we see him getting ready to confront a police officers who are blocking his mother from going to the store.  The man confronts the police, who have a clear shot at the black man. As the police pull out their guns to shoot the young black boy, we are left in no doubt about who is the real victim.  As they fire their guns, the woman's husband appears, along with his police-mate. She tells him the story of the shooting in a calm voice. "You do that to a man like that," she tells him, "and I'll kick your a-- right out of my house."   And, in the next scene, she's telling her husband about how the police shot the man. She then asks, "Did you just say you'd kick his a-- out of your house?" He responds, "Yes. It was a good way to end the evening, sweetheart."    The police officer in question, Officer Harris, is played by the great Denzel Washington. He's played like a character straight out of the old West. A guy who's not a little racist and thinks it's a right to beat someone to death with a flashlight. And while the film

It is a fun, romantic story about a group of people who try to find a love while trying to stay underground. The story is told through a series of vignettes which help us get to know the characters better. However, this movie suffers a number of shortcomings which are too numerous to name. It suffers from poor acting, writing and direction. I know I didn't have much of a problem with the characters, but the plot was incredibly thin. It was very difficult to follow the main story. The scenes which were most effective are often left out or only alluded to. The acting was quite poor too. The performances were not that great in general. There are so many scenes where characters are doing just about anything that it is hard to take them seriously. This is especially true for the lead. While the lead does seem to be a well-meaning, kind man who is trying to do his best in life, he does end up doing things that do not seem to fit his personality at all. Even the acting suffers from this. I was especially annoyed with the actors who appeared as the supporting characters. Some of the roles seem to have no lines. The movie is often told through brief vignette scenes which are not very interesting to watch. The music score is not much better. I could have done without the annoying music and sound effects. All in all, this is a very flawed movie and a waste of money. The script was very hard to follow because the characters are constantly talking. It's hard to understand what is happening when they are so far apart in time and space. I don't think this movie has a future. There is little romance here. The main character just doesn't seem like he would have much chemistry with the other characters. If you want to see something romantic, don't go to Tunnel of Love. I think it is a waste for anyone who buys this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film is based on a true story of how a German man named Heinrich Zangwill, working as a translator for the British army, worked as a courier on the Northern front with his wife, Katrin, on a mission to get food and supplies to the Russian front lines. The couple met as students at the University of Vienna and after graduation, they moved to London where Heinrich was a police officer and Katrin was working as an art teacher at the local school. The story opens with the couple in the middle of a tense standoff on the outskirts of Warsaw. The Soviet Army was advancing and a tank shot their house and Katrine was hit. Heinrich had to rush her to the hospital and later to the home of their friend who took them to safety.  But Heinrich has no choice but to keep working for the Russians. The Soviets have no place to send him and the Germans have no places to send Katrin and her husband who has not spoken a word in English since their college days. Heinric is in charge of finding Katrin a new job for her which she gets only if she will go to Poland to pick up a packet of cigarettes. He also has to find a doctor who will help Katrin. Heinrick and Katrine have a romantic relationship. She is an art school teacher and he is a police Officer. Heinfried is very worried about the situation and so is his wife. But they try to look on the bright side. Their children are well educated and Katrina can speak English. When he sees Katrin talking to a young man, he tells her that her husband has been shot. Katrina and Heinric get very angry and then Katrin is so mad she throws a glass at her husband. Heinry tries to stop her but is knocked unconscious by the glass. Heinruh Zang will live another day. He has been wounded and Katry is not happy. Katrin has taken a bottle of wine and is driving down the road when a group of Russians pull up and approach the car. Heinr is then taken away. He will be buried in a secret cemetery in Warsaw. Later that night Katrin tells Heinrich that her and Heinrich will not see each other again. Heinrit Zang, as he is known now, is released after three months. She decides to go to the German Embassy to complain and Heinritz says that he will take Katrin back. Heinritz tells Katrin that the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great film about a group of college kids who live together in a town and try to get a job in their respective fields. The movie focuses on the young man who was raised a different way than his friends and is now being pushed away. The girl is the one who gets to learn how to live the life of an average teenager without the approval of her parents. It's one of those movies where the plot is not necessarily what the movie is about, but more about the characters and how they deal with the obstacles that they face. This movie had great acting, a great soundtrack and some great character development.   I gave this movie 5/5 stars because I found it quite enjoyable, and even though it was a teen drama, the characters were actually quite likable. The writing wasn't anything to write home about and I think it could have been much better, but for the price I paid for it, it was worth it and I am glad I gave it a chance. I would recommend this movie to the people who like teen dramas. I personally think it would have been better if the character development was better, so it would've been more believable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Django Unchained" is a fun, action packed, epic action-adventure-romance movie.  The story is great, but in my opinion, the only real reason to see the movie is to see Samuel L. Jackson as a badass plantation owner.     I don't think we really get much out of him in this movie.    The film was rated "R" by the MPAA, and the picture quality and editing was a bit choppy, but it was still a solid movie. The picture quality is a bit better in the home video version, but the video transfer of the film is pretty good and the sound quality is decent.

I have to admit it is not very good, but it's still pretty good. A little slow at the beginning, but when it gets going it is awesome. A must see for any fan of sci-fi action. This is a very well made movie that has a nice mix of action, character development, and humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good news, the new Star Wars film is awesome! It's got an awesome lead actor, the best action sequences ever in a sci-fi flick, and it's a very funny movie. But, it's also a very, very confusing movie. What's the deal with Chewie? Why does Luke say that he's going to use the Force to fly away from the Millennium Falcon? Who are the stormtroopers? Why are they so angry? Does it have to do with Yoda's prophecy? And is Han Solo's last name supposed to be "Jett? Is this a story from a parallel universe? The story begins with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) being captured on the planet Sullust by stormtrooper forces after being hit by a sand worm. He's taken to the planet's capital city and interrogated by the city's ruler. She knows that he is not a slave and doesn't know why he's in the city in the first place. He is freed from the interrogation room by his friend Lando Calrissian (Peter Mayhew), the smuggler who also happens to be in the room with Han. Lando offers to help Han escape Sullus and take him to another planet where Han can hide out. Han agrees and heads out to a cantina in the back of a spaceship. He finds Lando has set up a gambling house, which Han's already familiar with from when he was a smuggler. Han sees that Lando is about to win and bets with him that he won't. As Lando goes to place the bets, Han is thrown through the window of the ship, which crashes on to the street below. Han is badly injured and is taken to a hospital by a rescue droid (who later tells Han that he was supposed to take his helmet off in order to get a good look at his face). He also ends up getting a new helmet from a mechanic who is also there. Han returns home and is still badly injured. The droid informs Han that someone has come to visit him. He sees that it's his old friend Landy. It turns out that Landy was part of the Rebel Alliance when the Empire had seized control of the planet and they've now come back to Sullent, the home planet of the Alliance. Landy shows up with her family and they decide that Han has to go to their planet as well. Unfortunately, Han can't go on a mission with the Rebel

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" was a pretty cool movie. I've never seen a movie like this one, and it's always in my top ten movies that I watch with my son when he's little. The action was great, the science was a little bit hard to understand at times, but overall it's pretty cool.  It's based on the real story, and although it's not as good as the original it's still really fun to watch.  It's a nice idea that was executed well.  This movie will be a regular in my movie list, especially for the science and the action. I hope to see the sequel someday!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ The movie was awesome. I really liked the action scenes, the action was really fun and a little intense, and the characters were interesting and lovable. The movie would have been a lot better had it been made in 2001. The writing was okay, and I liked that there was a lot of humor in it. There's even a scene where a guy tries to shoot a woman in the face with a machine gun...in the face! I don't know how she doesn't die! It seems like this movie was made for the children, but I think that its a good message about the importance of learning your lessons, and respecting others. I would recommend this movie for ages 7-12 years old, and maybe for kids 8 and up, for a story that is good for all ages. It's also rated PG-13. If you want a real good action movie, try "The Last Boy Scout", that's also fun, and with a strong message.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a fun little film with fun twists and a lot of great characters and a very good story. I had high hopes for this film and was looking forward to seeing how it would end up but sadly it ended up not working out for a few reasons. First of all, I had hoped that the ending would work in such a way that the film would be able to get a little more love and attention. Unfortunately, the film just kept trying to go the direction of more sequels. So, I really have no problem with that. I also liked the way the film handled the whole love triangle. So long as it's not too over the top, I think it can be very fun and even a bit romantic. In fact, I like the idea of it much more than the film itself. I know I'm not the only one with this attitude. I'm sure there's a lot more people who have this attitude about it too. What's more, I feel that it would be kind of fun to see some more films made by the studio, since this isn't the first attempt that has come out. But again, this doesn't mean that I can't think about the other films that have come out before this one. But, I will probably stick to the more recent films from this studio like 'Dorothy' and 'The Magician' because I feel they are a better film. I'd also like to see the first installment of 'Dumbo' made again. I remember seeing that film a long time ago and I thought it was pretty good. So I hope they don't screw it up too much since that's one of my all time favorite films and I'd like to enjoy watching it again. Also, I'd be nice if the director could make it a little bit more original and not just go the same route of making it look like the film 'Alice in Wonderland'. It still looks very similar to it, and I do enjoy 'Alice' a lot so I hope he doesn't get rid of that. The movie's also not really as good as it used to be, which is kind of sad. I don't know what to say about it. I didn't like it, but I don in anyway hate it. The film still has a few things I liked, and it's still one of the good ones. I was hoping to see more and it doesn't feel like they will continue on with these other projects for
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is just what you'd hope, a movie that makes you laugh a lot and can be extremely well made. There are a number of plot points that you are never actually led to see, but I think they are great plot twists, especially if you're a fan of the original. It would also be hard to go wrong with the cast. If you're into watching a film that makes fun of Hollywood, then this is for you. You won't find many other movies that make you laugh quite as much as this. There were a couple of other movies I really enjoyed, including The Book of Eli and The Last Samurai. The Book Of Eli was more entertaining than the film, while the Last Samurai was the opposite. If it's a classic, then I'd say it's worth seeing.

Hannon My husband, a professional musician, was born on this day in 1952 in a hospital in the eastern United States.  His father worked as a doctor for over two decades in a small town near here.   When my husband was six years old, he lost his father.    It was a painful loss, and a part of him still carries it.  This loss of his father has stayed with my husband all his life.  He feels deeply for his father's absence, and he always thinks about what he might have been doing, where he might be now, if he had had a father to take him on trips, show him things, tell him jokes.  I don't know what my husband would be doing today, if my father hadn't died, but I know he would have been making music, playing and playing, playing violin, playing in a rock and roll band, singing, playing the guitar, playing a recorder, practicing, practicing some more, playing harmonica, playing fiddle, playing guitar, practicing on piano, playing organ, playing trumpet, singing and playing the piano, trying to play some sort of music that was both different from the things my father played and still had the feel of them.  I've always been a huge fan of the film The Long Gray Line.    I always wanted to write about that movie.  What did my husband know about that?  My husband wasn't a movie buff.  (Yes, he did watch The Great Escape, and yes, he watched a few other films like that).   He didn't want to watch a movie that was so slow paced and he felt the need to do something in a movie. He's an actor, not a movie expert.  At the time my husband asked me if I wanted to do a screenplay based on a short story by Robert Aickman, which he'd read when he was fourteen, and which was published in The New Yorker Magazine.  When he told me this, I was like, "I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a terrible movie. It is a very good movie with a very funny character. You will laugh at most of the time, but some of the jokes will go over your head, especially if you haven't seen many comedies. It has a pretty good cast of characters, including the ever funny Chris O'Donnell (Duke Nukem). The story is pretty simple. It follows the life of a woman who's husband and his father are trying to find her after she mysteriously disappears. When they find out the truth about her, they end up searching for her again, and a man who looks like Duke Nukemm starts talking to them. I thought the film would have some great music and great effects, but the best part was that it actually worked! It was a fun little movie.  I gave this a great recommendation to my friends, and they seemed to agree. It was only about $10 to get, and it was a very entertaining little movie I'd recommend to anyone who likes good movies and laugh a lot.

The movie is about a man who travels from his city in the US to Japan to study with a famous painter, only to discover that the man he is studying with, is a famous art thief who was also arrested on the same charge. While the main character, Ben, is trying to break into the painting studio, the painting is stolen by a mysterious man and the two have to find a way to stop him from getting away with the painting.The movie has a great cast of people from different walks of life, each with their own quirks. The cast are all very entertaining and the story seems to be very complex as well. It took me a while to get into it because it was really hard to understand the way the story was set up and the plot twists. After watching the movie again, I found that it was well made and the cinematography was wonderful, although I did not like the way they used the shadows in some scenes, because it looked artificial.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can think of one or two "good" movies, mostly from the 1980s or early 1990s that I've been unable to find a copy of (though this may be a result of their scarcity). In any event, this is a good one to look into, especially since it doesn't have a bad ending.  It's a good film from the early days of animation, and if you like anything from that period, you'll like this one.  The characters are adorable, especially the dog! It took a long time for this movie to come out, but I finally found it, a rare piece from the golden age of Japanese animation.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  was a classic film and if you're a fan of Sergio Leone's westerns or Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti westerns this one is a must see. The good: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly   is an incredible western that would be as good if not better if it had been made by a studio of the time. The cinematography is top notch and some of the set design was done by Alfred Hitchcock. Some of the action scenes are amazing. The sound effects are excellent and the music is amazing. One of the great things about this film is how it shows the dark sides of the American West, it's a realistic portrayal and the audience could empathize with all of the characters. The Bad: The film is a bit long at 2 hours and 20 minutes but for the most part the story is good. The film follows the story of a small boy named John McClane (Sean Connery) who is trying to find his father who has gone missing during a shoot out with the local lawman. Along the way he gets to know the locals who are not always friendly. A few of the scenes are repetitive, the other characters are flat and some characters are simply cardboard cut out characters. There are a few scenes where you will think to yourself " why are they talking like that?". There are only two other scenes where Connery and Conforty do something different, the rest of the film is basically the same. The Ugliness: The Uguesssssss! I've heard the film referred to as "The Good: The Bad & The Ugotssss". The Bad is a really good film that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to see a western or even a sci-fi western. This one is probably the weakest film that Connery has been in and yet, I've seen it three times and each time I'd like to see it more. The Good:  The Good. The Bad:

I was surprised it wasn't any better than some of the movies I saw in college. It was a movie that I wish I had seen before I left for college. When I finally saw it, I was very impressed with the movie and I would like to see it again. The script was written by Adam M. Goldstein, and the direction by Paul A. D'Amato, the film is a simple, yet wonderful movie. It is really funny at points and the dialogue is very well written. The story revolves around two teenage girls, which are best friends and are known to be very good friends, but they're always going to fight. At the beginning of the movie, they fight a huge monster that looks like a giant man, with a tail, that comes out from the water and chases them. As they go deeper and deeper into the swamp, the monster gets bigger and bigger, which leads them to their downfall. As soon as the girl gets scared of the monster, it scares her, and then the girl decides to fight it, but it's too late, as the monster is now on top of them. They try to get to safety, and are both frightened, but the girl manages to push off the water, and runs away from the monster. The girl ends up in a pool, and she drowns. As the girl is trying to get up, she sees a fish in the water. The fish swims away, and swims towards her. As she goes to grab it, she is sucked down into the water in a circle around the fish. She eventually ends up getting sucked in the fish, as they're moving towards her, until she's finally pulled under the water by the fish's tail. She's still clinging to the fish for a bit, but then the fish pulls away from her and goes deeper and depths in the swamp. The movie ends with a message about how much we all regret not watching the movie before leaving college."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________________ The movie starts with a man having a hard time with his kids (2 years old and 7 years old) He is so busy being with them, but when he finally gets some alone time with them and wants to start having sex with them he cannot get it up. This is a very difficult situation to watch. He does not know why he is so hard to get it in. So after a lot of thinking he realizes, "I'm probably just asexual and haven't evolved with my gender." The movie follows him as he tries to understand if that's the case and if it can be helped. The movie is not that interesting, but it's an interesting read that doesn't take itself too seriously. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ I gave the movie 4/5 stars out of 5 ___________________________________________________________________ I watched this movie in the theater and was a bit disappointed. I really wanted to like it. I feel like the movie had more potential, but the plot didn't flow as well as I had hoped. My one real complaint is that the movie felt too cheesy. It was funny at times, but was pretty cheesy. The last scene was especially cheesy. I liked the movie, but I would not recommend it to anyone. ________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Incendies"  is an interesting movie. It is based on the book "Incendia", which is about a boy who travels to Rome to fight in the Punic Wars. The young boy was in Rome at the time, but he never returned and was declared dead. The film is based off the book and shows how a group of boys find out he is still alive, and try to find him. As you can see in the video review below, there is some great action, great music and a story that I'm sure you will enjoy. I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie in the theaters. The only issue I have with this movie is that the sound track, which is the same as the one for "The Expendables 2", is very loud. This might be a plus for some people, but I found myself wanting to turn the volume way down, and the film would be a lot quieter.  In the end, I enjoyed the movie, and was glad it got the wide release it should have.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie! A very good action-comedy, I can't find the words to describe what I like, or how I like it. If I could, I would give the movie 5 stars!  The action-set piece was amazing.  The whole film was great and I hope that the writers don't come up with another movie in the future like this one.   Check out the trailer and read a review here:  There were only two things I didn't like.  The First:  I was very disappointed when I realized they were going to use the footage that was shot in Thailand for this movie, they never even showed the whole movie with the original footage.  Even though this movie would have been made in the 80s, in my opinion it doesn't belong with such films of that era.  That's the biggest problem with this movie.  They tried too hard to make it a part of 80s history, but it's not.  I think if they would of just kept the footage the way it was, it would have worked.  If they would've used all the footage in the original movie they would have created an amazing action-adventure movie with great performances and a cool soundtrack.  Instead, I feel it's just filler and the film lacks a real connection with reality.  This is a really nice movie, and I recommend it to any fans of action-comedies.  Thanks for watching!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ [LIMITED] The movie was amazing, so well done. I loved every minute of it. I will watch it again and again. The only real problem with the movie is the end. The ending was just plain confusing to me. There are a few scenes where someone has to die. Who's to say it's a mistake or not? So it's not a spoiler but just an issue with the film. That being said it's worth the watch. The acting is good. I love the little girl with the bad hair. I was really impressed with the music. It was so good.  __________________________________________  Review Summary: _____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ The world's last colony has a deadly secret, a war is being waged on the very edge of the solar system, and a boy named Daniel has been left to find out what it is.

It also has some great historical footage of the period, and is an effective thriller about the conflict between English settlers and the French on the border of Canada. _________________________________________________ "The Last" (1915) _________________________ It's a film about the Spanish-American War that is just as good as "The Alamo". _____________________________________ "M. Butterfly" (2004) _____________________________________________________________________________ A good time is had by all in the final film in this classic children's story series. The story is told from the perspective of a butterfly who becomes aware of his own death in the film's final scene. _____________________________________________________________________ The Wicker Man (1973) -------------------------- "Wicker Man" (1973, dir.

This film is a beautiful, haunting look at what happens when a man becomes obsessed with a woman (Greta Garbo). _______________________________________________________________________ "Citizen Kane" ( 1941, dir.: Orson Welles) _____ "Citizen" is not just one of the most influential films in the history of cinema, it is a work of art and inspiration in its own right. _____ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Funny Pictures and Funny Movies on The Internet These are some of the funniest funny pictures on the internet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There is a whole new kind of cinema to be found with The Fifth Element, and that's one in which everything comes alive." I will just stop with the spoilers, as there is nothing that would make me not love this film more. The Fifth Sphere is the perfect fusion of science fiction and fantasy in one film. The story is about a group of explorers trying to find a place called the Fifth Sphere on a journey that would see them be transported to the center of the universe. It has a fantastically original cast of characters with an array of roles ranging from villainous to heroic. I loved the film's use of visual effects and the effects were stunning at times. I found myself looking for more. It was a film filled with great characters and great acting. It wasn't quite a sci-fi film, it was much more in the realm of fantasy. The music was great and was accompanied by a wonderful score. "I loved this film from beginning to end. I loved its characters and I loved the fact that there were so many characters with so many different levels of emotional depth." The Fifth Sphere was directed by Luc Besson and was written by Paul Schrader, the writer of The Fly, Rushmore, and The American. This is one of my favorite Besson films. He created this wonderfully imaginative world. This is a film I would love to revisit, and I look forward to seeing more of this wonderful world. It will probably be out for a while so you'll want to look out for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  I was going to go to the theater to watch this and I came to the conclusion after a long weekend that it was a waste of time and money, a bunch of pretentious, boring, unimaginative crap, a "treat for the man in his 80's" if you will, a bit of fun, and nothing more than an attempt to rehash the most popular and widely beloved films of the 60's, the films that were, I have to say, quite enjoyable and entertaining. It seemed to me to be nothing more that the movie version of a story that could be found in an old Saturday morning cartoon, where a guy with a strange looking head and a big goofy grin sits in a giant robot, and talks to the audience.   I watched the first and second parts of this movie and they both reminded me of The Thing, in that they both have characters that are "humanoid" as opposed to "robot", so much so that the characters that they encounter in each of these parts of the film resemble a lot of the same people that they had already met in the film.   the second part of the movie was just a rehash of the first part with a couple of new characters and one that I didn't even recognize. It also seemed to have a lot more "hokey" music and animation as compared to the first act, which was more dramatic, and I didn;t enjoy either of the movies, just because they seemed to be just copies of one another, and all of the characters looked the same, even the same actor (with the exception of one), and I thought that the story was just not that good, and just a way to make a lot money out of selling a few hundred thousand copies of a bad film. I would be happy to get a refund if I had a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dude, this is a good comedy and a must watch, although I did have a few technical errors that were really only visible at certain angles. The writing is well written and funny, there's some good acting and the story is well done. This movie is really well put together and has some great characters to develop. I also liked this movie because I had not seen any other comedy films by these guys so I was able to see some of their comedy in action, which was fun to watch. If you haven't seen the movie, go see it now! I know it's a bit heavy on the swearing but it just makes for a better movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you were to go to see this film as a child, you would see how much fun it was and how much it had to say about childhood. You would see what was really going on in the lives of all the characters, but you would also be able to see the impact they were having on each other. You know they were all just like you. They were children, who went to school, had friends, and did their normal things, except for the fact that one had never lived before. One of the main characters has never done anything he/she didn't think would make her happy, but her father's death has made her realize that she is going to have to change in order to help her father out. The film is funny, sad, sadder, and more than a little scary. The characters are all so relatable to me. I was able to relate to all of them and I think that's why it worked so well. I also really like the musical numbers. I've always loved the songs that were in The Muppet Show. I think it's great how these characters are able to sing and dance in this film. It shows that they're not just puppets, they're also human beings and as such, have a great understanding of the value of life. I highly recommend this film to any Muppet fans. I'm not sure how this will make its way onto the VHS format, but it's definitely worth checking out. You can purchase this film at Amazon, here, or here. The Muppets (1932) Directed by Jim Henson Written by Jim Aparo Based on the hit Broadway musical of the same name Written by Bob and Kermit, who also wrote The Dark Crystal (1982) and The Music Man (1985) Jim Hensons Muppeteer is always so fun to watch. I find that the Muppety is often at the center of the comedy. Although he isn't as funny in this one as in the others, he is still able to take some pretty funny turns, and even more enjoyable than usual. Kermit's best friend, Miss Piggy, is back, and she has been given a new life as a young woman. She also has her first child, a daughter named Daisy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crazy Heart" was a great movie and it helped a little to revive my interest in the subject, although the fact that it was made by a very inexperienced director, in his native Japan, with very little financing, in English, has to make me even more sceptical of the rest of this film. If there is another movie out there on the subject and with the same premise, it would be in the same league as "The Last Samurai" (1999), and it would have been much better made.

It is also a more character-driven film than its predecessor, giving us more of a chance to see how some of the other characters develop. The supporting cast has more to offer this time around, too. It doesn't necessarily add to the overall entertainment value, but it certainly improves the quality of the film as a whole."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I really liked this movie. The story follows the life of James Mayfield, a carpenter in the South during the Civil War. Mayfield's wife is having an affair with his neighbor's son, and they soon break up and are divorced. Mayfeld, not willing to be separated from his family, decides to steal a Union soldier's horse and take him across the North. He is eventually caught and imprisoned in a Confederate jail, where he is placed in a cell with some of the worst criminals in the Union Army, including Robert E. Lee. After some time there, Mayfield is freed by the Confederates and gets his horse back. He has some fun with Lee, which results in a drunken brawl. The movie takes place in the 1860s, and it's really fun. If you like history, this is a great movie! _____________ Watch it on Netflix Watch it online ___________ I don't know why you would ask this question, but this movie was really terrible. I just finished watching it, and I just can't believe that this was such a terrible movie. It's just a horrible mess of bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad music. The most laughable thing about it is how many times they had to show Mayfield lying on the floor with his leg torn off and all over the floor and blood everywhere, only to have the camera pan over to him and not show the gore. Then, they had the movie's sole saving grace (aside from the terrible acting), which was the voice over where Mayfield talks like a big dumb guy. I mean, it's just the worst thing I've ever seen. _______________ Read what a friend of mine had to say about it: _______________ Watch it again: ________________ The movie follows Mayfield as he is a young carpenter who gets caught by the Confederate Army. He soon escapes the army and decides to cross the North after seeing a Union Soldier being hanged. He goes to Pennsylvania where he gets some help from some Union Soldiers who want to help him cross the border. He ends up in Kentucky where he meets up with some former Union Soldiers. This is the beginning of Mayfield becoming a legend to some people after helping some of their family members who had been captured and enslaved.

It's just that much better than a lot of movies of its genre. You want to be entertained, but this is a great little science-fiction film, and the acting is top notch, including the great Chris Evans as the scientist's human co-worker, Dr. Chris Evans, a very funny and very endearing character. And the rest of the cast...well, they're not great actors, but they all put in good performances, and there's a lot to like about this movie. The Man with Two Brained's script and ideas are good, but it really has nothing to say with them."

It's also a good thriller, with a killer ending. It has a strong message. An important message, in my opinion. It makes us think about our own behavior." "This movie will remind you of the great classics of Hollywood cinema. It will show you that the real heroes in the movie are the special effects artists. If you ever needed a reminder of that, look no further. This is one movie you will not soon forget." Director: David N. Schumacher, Screenplay: Jim Proudfoot, Based on the novel by Philip K Dick (Story by David N Schumach) Starring: William Hurt, Laurence Fishburne, Robert Loggia, James Marsden, Richard Armitage Plot: A science-fiction thriller in which a young man is abducted by aliens. His family tries to locate him and to bring him home. At the same time, the family's young daughter is being groomed by the aliens to become a sex slave.  Director/writer David N N Schuman has been responsible for some of the best science fiction films of recent years.  Here is his take on the genre: "We all know that when aliens invade Earth the end result is inevitable. The only question is: are we strong enough to survive the onslaught? In 'Star Wars', the answer to that question is 'yes.' The film that followed 'Star Trek IV' (1982) is regarded as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. But did it have anything to do with the alien invasion that takes place in this film? This is a film that follows the lives of two families: a small family on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and an alien family, a species of aliens that are much more technologically advanced than the humans. The families spend their days and nights trying to protect themselves from each other, and to learn what is out there in the black of space. They live on farms, on city blocks, on high school campuses, in apartment buildings, and even in an old farmhouse. They are not alone. Their aliens have visitors from other species, visiting them in their dreams. They also learn that their lives are intertwined with the lives and destiny of other races. But while there are many similarities between the humans and the aliens, there are also

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I have been watching this show for a long time now and I think it is my favourite one of the four. I watched this in syndication in the US and it made a great difference to me. My favourite episode to date is 'Razor-Sharp Wit', in which I really feel the warmth of the characters. I really enjoy the way they show all the different ways a character can react. And they never forget who the protagonist is. It is a nice way of showing how a character changes and grows in the story and how a person reacts when that happens. It really shows that people really are what they say they are, and we can be what we say we are. It also shows how good an actor is and how far a person can be pushed into a person and what he/she might become. I believe that this show is about showing that a person really can become someone who can achieve anything, and it also shows that it is okay to let your own mind loose on what your mind can do. You can become whoever you want to be. Even a demon! It is about being yourself. This show is not just for kids, it is for everyone. _____________ There are many reasons why this show needs to be watched again and again. It will make you laugh and cry and it will make your heart melt. The acting is amazing, the acting is really good and the writing and direction are top notch. My heart can feel it everytime I watch this show, and I feel like I am really seeing them play themselves in real life. This is one of those shows that can take you to another dimension. This isn't just a story, it's a documentary and this show doesn't hold back. It makes you see and feel the world through their eyes. I highly recommend this show! ________ There is nothing that would make me want to go out and watch something more than this show. It has everything I like. The comedy and the heart of it. The story and the characters are brilliant and it is a show that you watch over and over and always find something new to like. _______ This was my first time watching this series and it's not just because I just finished it, this is a fantastic story that is told by great actors. This was a great show to watch with my daughter, and the story of the way this all began and everything that has happened since then was just beautiful.  A
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If there is something bad about this movie it is it's length and the fact it does not feel like a film that had the time and thought to give a satisfying conclusion. This movie has so much to say and to say it does is just show the film's greatness.  There is much to learn and to appreciate from this movie but its length and length only make it feel more like a collection of scenes.  When I was told that I was going to be watching the remake of The Room  I was very excited.  I thought the first film was an amazing film and I was so glad that the remake was going into this universe of a movie.   I think it was around the end of 2009 when the first remake was made by Tommy Wiseau.  After that movie had become successful, the remake followed shortly after.  The movie did a lot to further the character of Tommy Wise as an actor, it had a lot of great acting from a lot.  To say the film did not do well at the box office is an understatement.  When it was released there was much debate regarding the remake, what the changes should be and the director's name.  At first, many of the critics were not too happy about Tommy Wise is as a director, his vision was just to be seen and to not care what happened to the characters.  This was not the case of Tommy himself.  Tommy Wise had a huge crush on the character and wanted to see him succeed.    He made some changes to the story but mostly made it a bit more enjoyable and more realistic than the original movie. In my opinion the movie did the right thing by keeping the characters and their personalities, they were the key to the whole story.  Even with this being said, I still have some issues with the film.  It does feel like it has been sped up, it is a bit confusing, it seems as though Tommy is not on the same level as he was in the first movie and that may have been for the better.   It was the characters, characters, and characters that make up this film.   The film's setting is a great setting for a film. The characters have a lot going on but the setting is just great.  In my mind there are some great scenes in this film, there is a lot that I would have liked to see in the film and that is definitely due to the setting.  And now for
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ So what's with this one? It's an adaptation of a graphic novel and is pretty good. So what? It does what adaptations should do. It takes a classic property, makes it better, and puts it in the hands of a talented team. And I think it is a very strong film. However, this is a hard film to review. There is so much that can be said about it, but there is also so much to say that will not make it into this review. So, here we go. The film opens on a beach with a bunch of old people. And then they all have to get on this boat called the "Ship of Fools". The Ship of Fists is a boat that is made out of wood. The people on the boat are all made of wood, but they have no boats. Then the crew of the Ship of Fool get trapped inside the Ship by a giant snake and they have to find the way out. They have to break into the ship to get back to civilization. They get to the ship, but their first attempt ends up with the ship sinking. A whole bunch of people die, and the boat is destroyed. So how does the ship of fools get repaired? What is in the boat of fools that gives them their strength? Are they wood or are they flesh? How is the ship in such good condition? What's in the ship? Why do the old people have a boat and do they get along? What happens to the poor, sickly sailor and his wife who gets trapped inside? Does anyone get off? And what's the deal with that creepy old man with the giant head and his dog? These are the types of questions that can get answered in this film. The production values are good. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is fantastic. There are a few things that get lost in translation between the graphic novel/screenplay and the film, but this is one of the better animated films that I have seen. The sound design is also very well done. There's no over-the-top music that makes you feel like you are on a boat. The music is a little more subdued and gives the film a nice vibe. The voice work is decent, but the one thing that does get lost on me is the over-saturated colors. The use of colors is a technique that's very popular in today's movies, and that's definitely not the case with this film as most of
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________________________________________________ The first half of the movie is amazing. The story goes a little something like this: A group of guys in a bar fight decide to go hunting. After a while one of the men has to leave. He's the last man standing. There's a long wait for the group, but eventually one of them does show up and they all set out in the same direction. After some fighting and lots of walking they reach a cave. At the entrance of the cave a huge spider is looking for its next meal. They walk in, the guy in the lead gets attacked, the rest of the guys have a rough time in getting him to the hospital. There he is and after some treatment he's back in the group. He has to go, but before he does they have to do a lot of running. They end up running to a town they've never heard of and end up seeing an old woman who can help them. The movie is kind of a mixture of the old west and a spy movie. The whole cast is so good. It's interesting how this movie has a similar feel to "A Few Good Men" with the same hero and the same feeling. It gets pretty good. _________________________________________________________________________ The movie ends when the group is standing in the middle of a town looking at a woman in a white dress. The man in the leading role is killed by a hunter. A few moments later the group has been spotted and the leader is shot dead. We see that a few hours after the movie ends. A young man in a black coat is standing at the same spot and it seems that he is not an enemy of the guy who killed the leader. The young man has a crossbow. He shoots the man and the guy dies in a pool of blood. The boy, with a crosshair on his chest, goes off in search of the man who did this to him. _______________________________________________________________ The plot isn't bad. The characters are interesting and the action scene is good. The only problem with this movie is the ending. It doesn't really work. It was probably written to be better than it is. The way the movie ended and the way it was edited really ruined it. The ending of the film was confusing at best and totally confusing at worst. __________ The rating is:

I have fond memories of this film. The characters are interesting and the plot was interesting enough for a small family film. I am not one to always see the bright side in a good film, but this one did it. I wish I could tell the director that it was a great script that did not go in the direction the directors intended. However, I do have to give credit where it is due. The director is a gifted writer, who has made a film that is entertaining and does a great job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Room" is a well made and entertaining film and is a great start to the series.  While "The Room"'s "The Audition" is its most notable (and funniest) entry, its story line is also incredibly simple and charmingly funny. _________________ As a man of few words I cannot even begin to describe the awesomeness of this movie. I don't even know how to put it on here, the story line alone is so damn addictive. I loved everything about this movie, the acting, the plot lines, the characters. It was just everything I hoped it would be, the perfect blend of humour and mystery that is only found in a few films. I also loved the opening scenes, so well done. I love how it takes place in a motel and how it gives the viewer a glimpse at what the town and the town's people are like. This movie has an all around brilliant plot line, one that has everything from the mundane (the hotel clerk is a pervert) to the absurd (there's no end to the mystery and no time limit for the whole mystery).  I mean this movie has that "mystery" in it, and I have never been more amazed with the mystery genre, it's genius is that it gets you to look for the answers even when the answer is right in front of your face.    "The Secret" (1998) "The Secret", the fourth installment of the "Ghostbusters" franchise, is another fun romp. There are some great moments here in a lot of different roles and some decent performances. While there is a decent storyline with a pretty decent ending (which is what I wanted to see), there are also some odd scenes that I would like to have seen played out a bit more and some minor pacing issues that I couldn't put my finger on. I guess the most enjoyable thing about this one was the acting though, everyone really brought their A game. It's just a fun, silly and fun movie that I think all Ghostbusters fans should watch at least once.  The final boss of "The Signal" (1995) "Signal" is the fourth in the "Signature" franchise and is also the last "Sign" movie to be released before the "Stand Alone" movies were released. It is another great movie in the series as it's a more serious and dark affair than the other two movies. It has
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're anything like me and you get excited when a film comes out with a good story and actors that are good, you're going to be very, very excited to see this film. The film takes place in the early 1900's in the fictional town of Red Oaks, Texas. The town is an all-American town and everyone has their own unique culture. As the story begins it's revealed that there's a terrible crime going on and the townspeople are all afraid that the killer or killers are out to get them. As a result the town goes into a state of panic and when that doesn't work, the FBI comes to the aid of the town. The characters that I will be talking about are the people who work for the FBI, the Sheriff, Jock, and Mrs. Wilson. As you can tell by my synopsis this film isn't just about the killers, it's about the people in Red Oaks. And if you've ever wondered what it would be like to be a member of the FBI it's going to get you pumped up. The FBI agents, Jocks, and Sheriff are all fantastic, you can easily tell who they are by the way they act and the way the film follows their story. These characters are fantastic, their stories are interesting and the acting is great. The main character is a man named Jack McPherson, he is a young police officer who lives in Red Oak and is a friend of Sheriff Sutter and Mrs Wilson. Jack is a very caring and compassionate man, he helps people in need, and he also helps the Sheriff and Mrs as he helps them out when they're having trouble. When we meet Jack we don't really see the person he will become, he acts out like a normal kid, and his only problem is that he is dealing with an extra large penis, not a huge one but it is pretty big, it gets more awkward when the characters get in trouble and it doesn't take long for him to start making things more awkward. In the end, Jack doesn't save the town, but he tries to do the right thing and try to help the people around him in any way he can. But this isn't the only character in this film we get to see. Mrs.Wilson is a woman that works in the town and is also quite the woman. She is a mother and has children, and she cares for them. She loves the children that she has, and

I know it sounds crazy and this may or may not be legit, but I went to see "Kiki's Delivery Service" this weekend. The only real problem was the weather, but that's not really a huge problem. I got to see the movie for free at a local theater. I was there with my wife and her friends and they all went to the theater. About 40 minutes before showtime, the theater lights went out and the doors to the auditorium closed. There was a long pause and then I hear a woman's voice saying: "the lights are back on." I had my camera out trying to take pictures of the empty auditorium but they were all shot out of focus. They showed a quick re-run of the trailer then went into the movie. I didn't mind the movie very much but I am very upset that we didn't have electricity at all. I have only ever seen "Jaws" on electricity and it is a lot of fun.

Iron Man is the victim of an attack by a spider, but Spiderman is there to save him. The hospital doesn't have anything to offer Iron Man, and Spider-man doesn't know how to heal an injured man. Iron man decides to teach Spider- man how to do so. Spider- Man doesn't take too kindly to this and he goes to the roof of the hospital. Iron- man tries to get Spider-mans attention, but unfortunately, Spiderman goes into hiding. When Spider- MAN's car crashes into a tree, Iron Man rescues him. Spiderman finds a medical book, but when he looks up it, it is broken. After trying to get a surgeon to fix it, he goes into the hospital and asks the doc to help him fix the book. They give him a screwdriver, and he screws the book back together. He is in awe of how well it worked. He shows the doc how it was made and then goes out for some shopping. He finds some items he doesn't recognize and gets a spider- suit. Spider Man thinks that he has found his destiny and decides to leave, and Iron Man stays behind, thinking that Spider-MAN must be working for him. After going to some shops and finding a new spider-suit, he takes it to his friend Tony Stark, who tells Spiderman that he is out of his league. Spider man is confused, but Tony says that this is the way it is. SpiderMan goes home and gets ready for school, but Iron Man shows up at the school. Iron men is angry because he believes that Spiderman was after his identity, and was using it to get revenge on him. It isn't a good start. SpiderMAN is being chased by Iron Man's men, and we see the other students of the school (in the class photo) being chased too. When we see them all in a line, the school erupts into pandemonium.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Movies like this one are what makes movies worth watching. I'm not an action movie kind of guy, but I do enjoy this kind of movie. The action set pieces are great, the story is interesting and well-developed, and the performances from the main cast are great. I think I may be addicted to this kind and of the ones that come out this year, especially the "Teen Titans" series, which will have a sequel this year. I will be watching this movie again and again, even though I will say that it is a bit light-hearted. The dialogue and scenes are very entertaining and the romance between Wonder Girl and Nightwing is one of the best I have seen in a while. So if you liked the first season of the animated series, this one is for you. If you are a fan of the DC universe, this is a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good thing to be alive. This movie was made so the whole country could watch the action from all angles and learn a little of the English language. The actors were superb, all the action was in the right places, and it did not drag on long enough to be boring. There were some great twists and one or two of the characters were not very well developed and I am sure that one or the other of the female characters were used, but the only negative thing about the movie was how long it took to get to the end. It could have been shorter and it is my favorite movie about the Spanish Civil War, because there were many of the real people to see and the language is very authentic and interesting. I enjoyed the film and if you liked the movie you should see it, it is worth watching.

It's a lot like some of the other films I've seen by the same guy, and in many ways, it reminds me of those. I don't mean to be a stickler, I just haven't gotten around to seeing many of his films. The acting is good, the story is good. But it's just not for me.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ My brother and I watched the movie together tonight (we have a lot of good friends who are into horror). It is a short, cute little movie that should not be missed by anyone, no matter how old you are. It is about a little girl and her dog, who meet up in a dark tunnel. As the little girl watches her dog climb down, the dog hears something and hides. This dog has a bad temper and gets very nervous when she hears strange noises. Her master is also very strict on discipline, and as she has shown no improvement in her behavior, he decides to bring her down. As he brings her down, she screams, and then runs to the other end of the tunnel. The dog follows her and eventually the two reach the other side. They run around the corner, and run inside a house. As they enter, the master sees her and tells her to get back. She refuses, so he shoots her dead. The little girl's name is Daisy, and the dog is named Max. We all went to see it with the kids and it was an absolute delight. The acting was so well done that we didn't notice the little dog until it started to crawl on the ground. It was such a cute, cute, adorable little girl. The only thing that makes me cringe a little bit is that it was all too real for a cartoon. The parents were good too, as they were nice and the kids had fun. Overall, a very cute little film that you should take a minute to see. I do not want to give anything away, so it is better to go on and see it yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a very cool ending.  I'm sure that all of you who have seen the film will be able to relate to what the ending is about.  "There's something inside you that's not right.  It's the power of imagination, the power to create, to bring something new out of nothing. You are not the only one.   There are thousands upon thousands of us.  We're all living in this same reality.  All of us, together, in one big place. " "It's just me and my dog."  I've read other reviews about this film which say that the script was very bad.  Here's why the script wasn't that bad. It's a very unique idea.  A great idea to explore something that hasn't been done before.  The movie is filled with great dialogue.  And the movie has a lot of great twists.  This movie is a must see!

I'm a big admirer of the British comedy, and have yet to be disappointed by it.   My review  of  Life of Brian  is  posted on  B-Movie-Mania.   The movie is pretty good.  And a good film about a bad movie. The latest attempt to make a movie about a comic book superhero with a British accent, this one starring a young Michael Caine.  The  New York Times  wrote a review of the film  back in December  that I loved.  In fact, the only negative review of this film was written by an American who doesn't know anything about comic books and had to be corrected by a Brit in order to see the movie.

I would highly recommend this film to any fan of the movies and it is worth a watch at least once, and then you should watch the next one too
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ If you're a sci-fi fan, this is definitely a must see for you. The story goes that on an asteroid the colonists were building an artificial sun, and the sun blew up. Everyone on the ship went on to other things, but one of the colonists was a psychic, and was able to see the destruction of his home and was then able to create a machine that could rebuild the sun and all the other things he wanted to do. But then a great evil came and the evil is not only evil but incredibly powerful. He turns every living creature into living dead. All of this happens in a couple of weeks. If you like sci-fiction, I promise that you won't be disappointed. The movie has lots of visual effects and some great performances. If they do do some CG effects, they are not too noticeable. But if they go with real people and real faces, then I can understand how people might be put off by it. There is a whole range of actors that work, which is a very good thing. The alien designs are very original, and I love it. As I have mentioned, it does have some CG elements, but I think they really pay off in the end. One minor issue is that it did have a couple more than expected, and some dialogue that is somewhat out of place. But all in all, this was a good sci- fi movie. Highly recommended. ____________________________________________________ If you are interested in seeing if you think this movie is worth seeing, here is a summary from the movie site: "In "War Games" (1984) (aka "WarGames"), Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in a highly influential action/comedy that is so far ahead of its time that it was only made in 1984. The film is about a group of government agents (led by an eccentric General who wears an eye patch and carries a pistol) who are sent to a remote and remote location to take on a new kind of threat. The location is a series of domes built into an asteroid that was once used for launching nuclear weapons. The domes are filled with what they think are alien invaders but they turn out to be peaceful beings who want the same thing as everyone else: to build a paradise planet. But the only way they can do that is if the dome above the planet is destroyed, so they send in a new generation of agents to destroy the dome. The new agents are not as competent or as intelligent as the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight is a movie that I've seen a bunch of times now, but I've always had trouble getting to the end. I think that the reason it's so hard to get to the point where I'm completely satisfied is because it doesn't end. It has this kind of "what if?" quality that is often at the heart of what's great about the kind of movies that Tarantino makes. And if you do get to that point, well, then you have the option of just skipping to the part where it gets better. So I thought that I'd just share the experience of watching The Hateful 8. I enjoyed the hell out of it! I hope that you do too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen the movie on TV and had heard nothing about it until I saw the movie myself. A movie about a child who is born in the womb and later moves around the world. The story about the child who has an older brother who is ill. I love this movie and I wish I had seen it earlier in my life. Why was the movie good?:  The movie has very nice performances by all the actors. It has lots of action with some great effects. The movie also has a very nice story. It also has an original setting of the place where the movie is based in (in South India). One of the best movies I have seen in the past few years:    This is one of the top movies of the past 5-6 years. The plot, performances and the setting all are very good. The film is set in India, but I was surprised to see how different it was from that country. I thought the storyline was interesting and the acting was all very good, from the characters to the camera angles. The only thing which I didn't like in the movie was the ending. I didn'st want to watch it again, and I hope that the ending isn't so abrupt. Recommendation:   Get this movie, it is an excellent movie. I was shocked to see it in South India and I think it is the best movie I have watched in that country so far.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I bought a ticket to see this movie last night. It's one of the few movies I've seen recently that made me actually care about the characters and their fates, rather than just enjoy the movie, because the movie made me care. And it's not like this is the first time I've been interested in the world of the show. It was a long time since I watched the show, and the last time I watched it, I never enjoyed the show enough to watch the show more than once. I'd say I'm about 80% into the show right now. However, I had a fun time watching this. The movie is, as the title suggests, based on the show and is pretty much like a fan-film with very few differences. The characters are all based off of the main cast. I found the characters to be much more developed and more complex than in the show itself. Also, the way the characters were written was different. Most of the fanservice and character development came directly from the series itself. I also really enjoyed the way it was adapted. It is very well acted. There are a few scenes that are better than the show's, and there were a few moments that made this enjoyable for me even though I wasn't particularly invested in the characters. And the ending was, I think, a much more poignant ending than the ending of the TV show. Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I didn't think that I enjoyed it as much as the show made me enjoy it. I think it's a fun movie for the fans of the series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've got a good feeling about this film.  This is an old fashioned Western that follows the exploits of a group of outlaws on their journey to California in search of gold.   The group consists of Charlie, who is played by Don Davis; Johnny, who seems to be some sort of traveling companion; Lonesome Rhodes, who has a gun that has a little red button on it; and Red Eyes, who's the most physically imposing of the group and appears to be one of the most cunning.  The crew spends the journey traveling from Mexico across the American Southwest and into California.  While the film is set in the early 1900's there are no guns or knives and there isn't any blood or gore.  Red Eyes' ability to make his enemies bleed is what keeps the film interesting.  I know that some may not like the Western because it's not all that violent, but I find that it's most effective when the story allows it to be, and Red is the only one who can bring it to life.  As far as the acting goes this is the strongest part of the film.   Don Davis is very good and I think he is a good choice to play the leader of the crew.  Davis is a veteran actor and he really fits the character perfectly.  John Wayne is a fine choice as the head of the outlaws and is a terrific actor, as is Sam Elliott as Red Eyes.  There are a few weaker performances throughout, particularly that of Jack O'Neil, but if the actors can hold the film together I think that most will be able to enjoy it.  My rating:   3/5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************* I think this is a very well made movie. It is based on a book called "The Best of Both Worlds". In the book, the Doctor (played by Sir Patrick Stewart) and the Master (played in the movie by David Warner) travel through time and space to their time periods of the other's era. The main theme in this movie is that the Doctor will stop at nothing to destroy the Master, and to bring an end to their fight. In the movie, the Master is played by Sir Ian McKellen, who has a rather dramatic style, but that suits the movie's mood. McKellen's acting isn't always the best, but it is well enough for the film. He plays the Master with a rather bitter disposition, but he makes up for it with a great deal of charisma. In contrast, the acting of the Doctor is very good, and he looks and acts as he would if he were really in the Time Lord's body. His voice, like that of the character in the series, has a very soothing quality to it, and the music also helps to give the movie a more peaceful feel. The action in the film is quite good. The Master's battles against the Doctor and the Torchwood Three is well choreographed and well designed. The climax, as well as the action sequences, are very well done, and they add a nice touch to the film, which really helps to make it more enjoyable. The movie is well worth watching, and you should check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ This is probably the best movie I've seen in a while. The movie is made from real interviews with people in the industry and it is pretty funny and very well done. The acting is very good, the direction is amazing, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is amazing and the story is very well told. There are no terrible plot holes in this movie. This is a great movie and the production is top notch. __________________________ A few months back I started watching the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation and it made a big impact on me. While the first one was better I have to say that The Next Gen 2 was just that good. So good that it turned me off of Sci-Fi, in general and of course to Star Trek. Not that I couldn't handle the new movies but they just didn't do it for me. There's a few things that still kept me from watching the Next Gen, but the main one is that the new Star Trek is basically the same as the old one. The crew of the Enterprise is very different from the original crew, but we're back to the same old story. I guess if you hate the Original series you'll like this new one. This isn't a bad movie, it's just not the same. I'm really glad I watched it. _______________ So, what did I do? I watched the entire series, including Deep Space Nine, which I haven't even finished, and I watched Star Trek III and I really like the first two seasons. I think the third season is better than the first, and the second season was better than any other season. The third is, in my opinion, the best Star Trek movie ever made. I can't say the same about the second, third or the fourth. I wish I could give it a 10 or 15 and I would. It's still pretty good, but there are a lot of problems that get in the way. The main one for me is that every single character in the third movie is exactly the same, no matter who you are. The Captain is William Riker, the Lieutenant is Geordi LaForge, the Ensign is Georay Yar, the Counselor is Julian Bashir, the Chief Engineer is Harry Mudd, the Doctor is Harry Kim, the helmsman is Wesley Crusher, the second engineer is Lieutenant Commander Data, the chief medical officer is Wesley.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought it was a really fun movie and fun for the whole family, which was good enough for me, as a father. It was definitely on my radar for awhile and had been recommended to me by a friend, but I'd never seen it. I watched the trailer twice and I think it does a great job of selling it. There is an actual story to the movie, which is not in any way a parody of anything. However, they are not going to pull it off unless they are a huge hit. The film starts off with a nice montage of people in this world, but the main character, Max, is a young boy from this world. Then there is a montage with him on an island. Max falls out and finds the main island. He tries to leave. The island falls apart and he gets picked up by a spaceship, but when he gets there, it's a space ship. There are some alien creatures with Max and they take him up to the top of the ship. At that point, the story begins to take on a life of its own. When the movie is over, I'm sure you will agree with me that it is a fun time with a fun story. I'm not saying it is the best movie, because it's not. It's more than that, though. It is just a fun movie. It doesn't have the power to blow you away like a Star Wars movie would. But I do hope that we get more films like this one as the story is an interesting one and will probably keep you interested for a few hours.  I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It was a fun movie. I like that it's a lot of different things and people do different things. It's like a fun game. I liked the action scenes. I thought the writing was well done. The characters were fun. It was also a good lesson to be a better writer. The movie isn't really that good. There is very little story and that's okay. The director just made a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Muppets Take Manhattan  is a fun, silly comedy that features some of my favorite characters in movie history. The Muppety crew is more fun than they're often given credit for, including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Piggy and more. The music is great and even though it's not the most complex musical ever made, it works well with the film's characters. 5 out of 5. Great Movie. I'm in love with the Muppity crew. They are my favorite Muppet of all time, and this is their first starring role in a major motion picture. The story is simple and is very enjoyable; Kermit, Miss Hopper, The Great Gonzo, Fozzie and Miss Piglet play a little carnival game in their home town. But the game is threatened when Piggy the Pig decides to compete against Gonzo for Miss Pig's heart. The plot is really simple, but the actors and characters are so enjoyable that the story never gets boring. This was the first in a series of Muppa movies, and the second one is very good, featuring Kermit as the new host of "The Muppet Show". It's easy to see why the first one, Muppi-mania, was so successful, and so is this sequel. The humor is more subtle here; Kerbie gets a new pet, a fish named Miss Pig, and Piggy is forced to make up her mind about Gonzo and their old rivalry. Another nice movie, The Muppet Movie  features many Muppet characters from the first film. The movie also features several new Muppet faces, such as Miss Pigsy (played by the great Shirley MacLaine) and Gonzo (played with his own unique voice by George Wendt). The story starts off funny, but quickly becomes very dark as the plot becomes more involved. There's a lot of violence in the movie, and it may not be for everyone. The movie has a very good soundtrack, and even if you're not a Muppet fan, you'll probably enjoy the movie. It's fun to watch and funny at times, but it is hard to put this in the list of great movies because it's just so much fun. A fun comedy about a bunch of muppets at the park, The Aristocats  was directed by Jim Henson (the same Jim Hennel who directed  M

It was a very emotional moment to watch my favorite characters, in one last scene together, have a nice, sweet conversation about life. That was awesome. Thank you for the story, the acting, and the wonderful songs that I hope I never forget. If you have not seen it, you must!  Review written by: J.G.S.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has a love of films of the classic Hollywood films of yesteryear. This is definitely a worthwhile movie to add to your collection. (Rated: 4.5/5)

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  All things considered, this film is pretty darn good. It has the same kind of energy and verve as the other films from the Saw franchise, with the added bonus of a young, energetic and fun heroine. The ending, although a bit of a twist, is well acted and nicely done, and the plot, while somewhat simplistic, does a good job of setting up the next film in the series. As I mentioned before, this is not an "easy" movie to watch, but it's very worth the effort and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The Best Worst Movie of 2016: The Best Best Worst of 2016 The Best: Worst: Worst Worst: __________________________________________________________________________________ #5 - The Dark Tower - 10/11/16 This film was not all that great. It had a decent premise, a very fun villain and a nice set of actors, and that's about it. The acting is very poor. There are too many actors in it that are trying to be funny and just sound off. There's a few funny moments but most of the time, they're not funny. I'm not saying that I wasn't entertained but I wasn, in fact, completely bored by it. It really seems to be a remake of the Stephen King novel that is in no way good. It didn't do anything for me. __________________________________________________________________________________________ #4 - X-Men: Apocalypse - 10.31.16 I can't say that I'm going to be impressed by the X-men movies. The last two have done better but I just wasn't very impressed. I didn't think they did any great things. They did a good job with the story but the rest of the movie was not very good. I was really looking forward to seeing the next X-mas movie but I think that I was waiting for the bad to kill the good. The X-maeler did a great job with this movie and was great with the visuals and action but the writing of the script is really horrible. I would say that this is probably the best X-movie ever but the way it was structured was terrible. The movie has too many fights and they're way over the top and not that creative. Overall, I would give it a 4.5 out of 10. #3 - The Conjuring 2 - 9.21.16 The Conjuror: I think I'm more interested in seeing the sequel than the original. The first was very fun and scary and I liked that it had a lot of scares. This sequel, however, just didn't have anything really cool about it or anything really original. It was a fun idea that just didn-t work. If you like haunted houses, don't go to see this movie. It has no ghosts at all and it's just more scary than anything else that was out last year. ____________________________________________________ #2 - Deadpool - 8.30.16 This was a pretty good movie. I really liked the idea of this and how Deadpool was able to

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A film that was very impressive with its style and ideas, this is a film that will definitely take some time to sink in. A strong story that is told in a very short time, the pacing is also really good and there is a lot of emotional depth. I am still learning how this film relates to the first movie and while there is not that many details in this second film, I am just so happy with it. My only gripe is that there wasn't much more to the story which felt a bit like filler. Overall, this will be a very good movie to watch once, but definitely worth watching more than once. I did not mind the plot very much, it was good and interesting and definitely not a typical horror movie. So if you like to watch something a bit different, you should really give it a look. I will definitely be back for more.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last year, I saw The Giver, the film adaptation of Lois Lowry's best-selling novel. While I enjoyed the movie, there were many things I didn't care for about it, which led me to wonder about what really made it work. First of all, it was hard to get the gist of what the book was about, and a bit hard to understand what was going on. The pacing is kind of off, so there's a lot of scenes of character sitting around, not doing much. The story takes place during a time when there's an arms race between different governments and corporations, where the Givers have created a system to spread their message across the world. There's a whole lot of bad stuff going on in the world, and there are a number of people who don't care about it. The film is set in 1970, in New York City. It's hard to really find much information about this town, except that it's filled with people who seem to really want to be good, even if they don't know why. It has this nice vibe that makes you want to go and do good things for people in the hope that it would lead to a better future. It is also interesting to see how the film changed since it was originally made, when the movie was released in 1999. There was a lot more swearing, sex, and violence that I thought were inappropriate for this kind of material. A lot of the scenes were done in the dark, or they used an unnatural looking light. The music in the film is actually quite good, but it has a bad habit of cutting away before something important is happening. Still, if you like The Givers book, you'll probably love this film.

Can someone tell me about the difference between "slightly insane" and "a little bit insane"? I am a "somewhat" insane person. I don't feel that it is a big deal at all. You would think that someone who is slightly insane would be very careful, but in this movie, the movie is the insanity. How can anyone be that crazy and think that it was ok? My wife and I were looking forward to this movie for awhile and thought it was going to be great. It turned out to be pretty boring. I do think this movie could have been so much better. I did enjoy the part where they are all in the car and the scene where they go to the diner to get their order. The acting is pretty much all actors. I think the best performance that I saw was in the opening scene. There is a scene when they are at the restaurant in the back seat. I thought the actors did a great job. I would give the acting in this film a 4 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grosse Point Blank is a great movie.  The story is very original, the acting is amazing, and the cinematography is superb.  What did I like?  The main character of Grosse Point is one of the most interesting main characters I have ever seen on film, the character design is wonderful, and there is a lot to take in.  The plot is very intriguing and is filled with some great twists and turns.    What didn't I like about it? The movie does start off at a slight disadvantage because it doesn't have many special effects, but it quickly starts to shine as it goes along.  I liked the little detail that the movie uses to give the audience a real sense of what it is like to be at a train station and the people on board.   I also enjoyed the dialogue, and particularly the exchanges with the main characters and the director.  It was refreshing to see that there are people who aren't afraid to stand up to a director, especially in this type of film.  For me, one of my favourite characters of the film is the little girl, but her role is limited to a brief scene early on in the film. Would I recommend it?  If you are a fan of the James Bond films or spy thrillers, or a James Bond fan who wants something a little different, you will like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One of the finest and bravest movies I've seen since 'Logan'." -  The Hollywood Reporter "A masterful performance from a great actor...an incredible story with great performances and a beautiful and moving ending." -  Deadline In the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), The Avengers is one of the most talked about and talked about movies of the summer. It has been compared to The Godfather Trilogy, with its intense plot, a cast of well-known characters, and one of The Avengers' biggest plot twists in recent memory. If you were a huge fan of Captain America: The First Avenger (2005), you will likely be excited to see this film as well. While the film is a new chapter for the Marvel Universe, it is much like any other MCU film. You get some familiar faces (The Vision, Black Widow, Hawkeye), some new faces (Captain Marvel, the Hulk, and Nick Fury), and some great villains (Nick Fury's brother Arnim Zola and Loki). If you are looking for a new MCU flick this summer, then The Avengers should be on your short list. As I mentioned in my review of the film, The Avengers gives you the complete package. Director Joss Whedon takes the entire film in a different direction than what we have been used to so far from the MCU. Instead of following Cap as he fights his way through Nazi-like henchmen (who I think are meant to be villains) with Cap's trusted partner Hawkeye, Whedon takes you to a far away land in order to meet up with the world's deadliest assassins, who are now on the run from The Avengers. It is as if the entire world has been turned against its own and The Avengers are the ones who need to find out who is responsible and stop them. This leads into the climax of the movie, where the main villain (I have a feeling it is The Mandarin) is revealed, and he immediately begins destroying the entire city of New York City. It was a nice change of pace for the MC U, and it did not feel out of place or weird.  It was just another story from Cap to fight another story with the same characters he already fought with in the first movie.  This is one movie where I do not know who is in the wrong and who is the right. There is a lot of action and lots of set pieces, but it was all done with a very

The theater was packed full of people. There was a big TV screen in the center. The sound was great. It was very dark and eerie and eerie.  The movie started at 7:00 in the morning. When the movie was over I could not figure out where it was. I started looking at the schedule at the front of the theater. The movie had started at 8:30 AM. I walked out. When I walked up to the counter at the ticket window, the lady said that the movie had been stopped early. I said "So? Who stopped it early?" She said "The police." I said, "Why are you telling me this? Do they want to arrest me?" She responded, "They don't want to tell you." I turned to leave. Then the lady came over to me and said, ""Well, we can't say anything until you leave." I took off running, just like a coward. I went down a side street, and then came across a cop car. There were four officers in the back seat. They were all armed with guns. As I got out of my car, I saw a big black police officer pointing his gun right at me. "Hey, you! What the hell are you doing here? Get out of here!" The cop said, "'Your car has been broken into. They're trying to get in your trunk.' I said 'Get in my car!" Then I got in the front seat and drove away. The officer looked at me and asked, "What are you going to do? Why are you driving here?" I replied, "I'm not going to say anything to you. I'm not a cop." Then I saw the cops go for the car and then they opened the trunk. They came running in and put the trunk open. The officers took the guy into the back of the police car. They had me in the passenger seat and they were all standing around the car. The cop officer said, '

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was great, a bit short at just over 3 hours and well worth it. I think a movie this short can be a little boring at times, but it doesn't need to. It does it it very well. As for the ending, it was well done and didn't ruin the movie in any way. If the plot had more time, this could have been a great movie. (view spoiler) The story is really well done as well. It's funny, touching and dramatic and all in all it was a great one. I hope the series gets more love, but I don't know if it's because I was disappointed with this. I just hope the movie is longer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Starfighter" is an interesting action-adventure movie with a good, action-packed story line that I found enjoyable to watch. It's a film that I can get a good laugh from without feeling like I'm being laughed at by the character's. The voice acting is top notch and I liked the cast, and the story line was fun to watch, with plenty of humor in it. The action sequences were well executed and, even though the movie isn't as interesting as some of the other action-comedy films, the action is very good. The film has a great cast of characters and it also has a good plot line that keeps it interesting. It just feels like something was lost in editing, as the film is longer than the synopsis indicates, but it's only 7 minutes long. I can't remember how the film ends, but I'm looking forward to watching it more in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I saw this about two weeks ago and it was a fun way to spend two hours on the couch, and I'm so glad that I did, it was very funny.  My Rating: 5 stars out of 5 stars.  The movie opens on a bus in an unnamed city. The bus driver gets lost and has to be helped by the only other person on the bus, a woman named Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) with no recollection of her own name. When the bus stops and everyone gets off the bus the bus driver says "Hey Sarah" and she looks up and then turns around and leaves the bus. She goes through a few streets and then we see her sitting in front of a gas station. She says "I think I may have lost my memory!" and then she's seen again, this time she's sitting in a diner. She asks the waitress who she is and she says "This is me!" The waitress smiles, points at her face and says "You look just like me, the same face as you have right here." The waitress points to her own face as well and says the same thing, it's a match. She has no memory of her past, of her parents or her home life. She lives on a very small farm and she grows potatoes, tomatoes, corn, and some other crops. The waitress tells her that she is making coffee for her and she leaves the diner and goes over to the coffee house and orders a cup of coffee. When she gets there she asks the barista who she looks like and the baristas says "Yes" and then they point at their own faces, they are a good match. Sarah drinks the coffee, it is made by the bar and she's happy, the waitress comes back with a cup for her, and they all sit down at the bar, they talk for a while and Sarah drinks some more coffee. Sarah is about to sit down again and the waitress says "That's good, don't you remember that I was married to the waitress?" and Sarah smiles. Sarah says "Not really, she was married for a long time and left me a child, but I remember that she was a very nice woman, and the most wonderful wife anyone could ask for" and the two sit there in silence. The barista says "So she's your wife now?" and she asks "Yes, she is my wife now. We married because we loved each other, and she is the

This is my second Netflix release in as many years, and I am glad I jumped at the opportunity to pick this one up. I would have had to wait longer to find it in theatres before, so it is great to be able to get it at home now. I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of those movies that you want to watch the whole way through just to savor each moment. It is the perfect blend of suspense, intrigue, and a bit of romance. The performances are great as well. It features James Spader as Lester Freamon, who's the head of the FBI Task Force. A great role from the guy who will be reprising it in another movie in 2017. I also really enjoyed the performance from Bob Odenkirk. He was phenomenal in this movie, and it's great to see him be able show off his talent in such a comedic role. The rest of the cast is also great. I thought it was great how the story was structured. I loved that it wasn't just one story. There were a few subplots going on. It kept you interested and it kept the story interesting. I'm also really excited to see where Robert Redford is going to take the character next. It was great that he got to play Lester Fears again after "Tropic Thunder." The acting and writing are top notch. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially if they like a bit more of a thriller than some of the other shows Netflix has put out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I saw this with my parents in their early twenties when I was doing my senior year of high school, and it is one of my favourite films ever. It has the perfect mix of humour and sadness (I don't think I've ever laughed so much in a movie) that made me feel nostalgic for the good ol' days of the 80's. The story takes place in the year 1986 and follows three friends who are in the band, The Stray Cats. They meet a group of students (with the intention of being the band's tour guide) who are looking for the band members, who have gone missing. They end up travelling around the world for a short while until one of the girls (played by Natalie Portman) has an accident and wakes up in a strange hospital. As the story progresses it develops further and further and is one hell of a good time. It's not the most beautiful movie ever, but it's a hell of an entertaining one, so don't let this fact put you off!
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!- I am an avid watcher of movies on Netflix. While watching this movie, I was in awe at how well it has been adapted and how much it captures the essence of the book. The dialogue between the two characters is quite good. I could really get into the scenes.  If you like this movie: watch it. I know I did!  The trailer made it seem a bit like a big Hollywood movie, but it is a very simple and direct adaptation. The book is set in the 19th century, and the film is set after it. It is a story of a woman and her friend, who travel to the British North American colonies, to find a cure for a rare disease, and to get married. Their journey is not without dangers, but they manage to survive all of them, with the help of some new friends, and new discoveries.  the book is a good one and worth reading. So many people talk about it, so I had high hopes that they would not disappoint.   Now, here is a short list of minor flaws:   1) there is a scene in the beginning of the movie that is just a blur of black and white. It happens at the beginning, and it is very distracting. This could have been better cut out.   the movie has one scene where a character mentions a "man who would be rich" and another where the man is mentioned as being rich. This scene is about a different character from the rest of the film. I feel the scene could have stayed more as one scene.  .   in general, a great movie, and a good adaptation!   2) The movie has some scenes that were just a little too long for me, especially in the first half. A lot of the scenes could have had the scene cut out, and I would have liked to see more of the characters.  :D
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix is a perfect example of the power of imagination to shape reality.  It isn't exactly a great story, but it is so well written, and the performances by Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves are great, and that is no mean feat.  2.       Inception (2010) This one goes back to when I was a kid.  At the time I was obsessed with the movie Inception, and it was a favorite of mine to watch at night when it was too dark or I was going through a rough patch.  I have seen this movie many times and have seen many versions of it, and every version is better than the last.  If you have never seen this one watch it now because it is absolutely worth it.  The story is really good and the plot is so intricate that I am just amazed at how the entire thing fits together.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen, and is a good film to watch with friends and family.  Just a little cautionary warning, this movie is a little bit creepy, but nothing too out of control.  3.   Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) This is my favorite movie of all time. I don't have a favorite.   This movie is great.   The plot is great, the characters are great and the action is great too.   I really believe that this is one movie that people should just try to see once.   If you see the movie the first time you will probably understand it a lot more than the second time you see it.   It is also very funny, and you should definitely see it with a crowd. 4.   Jaws (1975)  Another one I have not seen.   You should watch this movie.   Yes, it was cheesy, but I enjoyed it and have always been a fan of it.    There are many good reviews here on IMDB so you should go check it out.   5.   Jurassic Park (1993)   I really like this one, but is probably one of my least favorite movies in the bunch.  In the first Jurassic Park I remember thinking, "That is a really cool park.  What could happen?"  It wasn't until seeing the follow up Jurassic Park 3 that I really thought, "Oh yeah! I'm going to go there."  There are a lot of things wrong with the first one, especially the

They were told that she would be fine but she wasn't and the hospital had no room to take her so she died in a few days. He wakes up and finds himself in a hospital with a dead woman beside him and he can't make sense of what has happened. Now his only option is to figure out how he and his girlfriend are connected. He goes into the hospital and sees all the patients he saved and even the ones he killed as a boy. However, the one patient who isn't there is his dead girlfriend's brother and his story has a lot more twists and turns than the main story and it takes a while to find out what is really going on. The movie is just a lot of fun and a realistic thriller. It's also pretty short and can be watched in a couple of hours. It takes some time getting used to the story but once you get used to it the movie stays entertaining the whole time. Overall, this is a great movie and one that I recommend to anyone. There is plenty of twists and surprise but it's really all about the suspense and it just keeps you on the edge of your seat.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I know, I've already made the first five movies (all on this list) and I'm still going to do them and make up some new ones, but this is a special one for me because I got to be on set. I've always wanted to see what it would be like to be in a Spielberg film (I'm thinking of "E.T. and the King's Speech" and "Lincoln" or maybe "Logan" and some of the Spielberg movies), but I've never been in one before. This is amazing for me and I can't wait for everyone else to see it.   What is it? __________________________________  It's a documentary about "Wag the Dog," based on the John Steinbeck novel.   and how they filmed this film on location. The book is set in the early 1960's.  , so it was a lot of fun seeing the people who lived in those years and how it looked to the people that would be living in the 1970's. The only thing that is weird is that we see the movie in black and white and not color.  .   in the 1940's in rural Michigan a bunch of kids (John Steinbeck, Jr. and his friend, Steve McQueen ) discover a dead body in a secluded field. They go looking for it and find a beautiful young woman, who is found to be missing some fingers on her left hand. They find out that the woman's husband was a drug dealer, and that he was the one who shot the woman. The police search the field for the killer, but there is a very strange coincidence, it is a Friday the 13th and the dead body was found on the 13 th, but nobody knew it at the time.   the movie is about a group of kids in their last year of high school. As they are leaving their last day, they are given a Halloween party and they all go out and party hard. They drive around looking for the murderer of the young woman and when they finally find him, he is still around. There is only one thing that they can do and that is to kill him and their friend, but they have a problem. John Steinback, Jr., and Steve Mcqueen, are very much into heroin, but can't afford it. They are on the run and have nowhere to hide so they decide to stay and steal a car from a farmer. The farmer is not a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a good-looking movie.  It has a good plot, but it feels a bit rushed and not as deep as I had hoped, given the scope of the film.  The acting is good for the most part, but there's a couple of scenes that just don't do it for me." "It has a lot of heart, but you can't help but feel the pace and the characterisation of the leads were rushed.  There are some fantastic sequences, but the film falls short of its potential.  I hope the rest of the films takes what this film does and turns it into a film worth seeing." I did think it was pretty good. I think I liked it. I'm not one for long, epic sci-fi films, and I've never liked the "action" genre in the way that a lot other people seem to like it, but I still felt the characterisations were fairly deep, with all of the characters getting a chance to shine, and there were some nice moments. There was a bit of too much dialogue in there, as you can imagine, but otherwise the acting was generally good. The only criticism I have about the movie, which I think is an entirely valid one, is that it's rather, erm, slow. I don't want to spoil anything, but just as a general point, I'd say this is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. I can't remember a film that was as slow in pace as this one. It really can be said that there's no way this was the most ambitious of any of the movies, and it has a few of the "fast-paced" aspects of a movie like Star Trek Into Darkness, but they aren't really there. The story really doesn't go anywhere for a good chunk of it, and the story could be much bigger and more developed. I didn't like it at all, but that's not surprising considering it was another film that I didn't really like, especially on a first viewing, so I'm going to give it a little more time to convince me. 5.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Wouldn't mind having a few beers with this guy.  Played: 1 year and 1 month ago  Liked: 3 days  Described as: A simple comedy, about a group of friends that hang out at a local watering hole. As the movie starts out, they go on a date, and after a few drinks get involved in a petty fight. They end up getting a beer refund and decide to go out later. We get to see the guys at the bar, talking about their day, drinking, and talking with a girl. I would like to have seen more of them around the bar drinking, maybe talking to a girl, maybe even dancing. It all gets a little weird around the 1 hour mark, and pretty soon the guys decide to head home. They then decide to throw a party, and of course they need to drink more beer. Unfortunately they get a girl to throw one, which is all good and well, but by the time they realize they aren't going to finish they are about to blow through 3-4 kegs. One thing I really liked about this movie is that they didn't make a huge effort to get everyone involved. We saw a few different people, the only person that I thought was truly involved was the bartender. Also, a lot of times there was a lot going on in the background, not really paying attention to the character. Also some parts of the movie were kind of boring. A couple things that I liked about the movie, is the fact that there were no really bad acting, and it just really wasn't anything that caught me off guard. I didn't mind any of the actors, and they all had their moments in the movie. The movie was just good, I would have enjoyed it even more if it had just been two guys having a bad time at a bar.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ Review is from: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: A Comedy in 3 Acts (2004) Written and directed by Martin Scorsese and Tom Hanks, and starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Meryl Streep. The movie stars Mitty (Bridges) as the title character, a man who moves from Chicago to New York, but who has trouble adjusting to life on the other side of the fence. _________________________ The film opens on the streets of New York with a parade, and as Mitty enters the fray the crowd cheers. "I'm going home," says Mitty, "I don't belong here." The camera shows him and his wife driving around in their car, but she tells him that they'll be there in a few minutes, they are just "looking for a nice place to eat." A couple of minutes pass and Mitty's wife tells him about the hotel that is on the edge of the parade route, it's a nice hotel, it just opened. "You're coming," she says. Mitty turns to his wife and says, "We're just about there." Suddenly, he realizes that the hotel has "no bathtub," and a couple of other things that aren't pleasant. The crowd goes wild, the cars stop. M.C. goes to see his wife, and she tells M.c., "Just come inside, it'll be all right," they will soon be at their "nice little hotel." The crowds go still and silent, it looks like they're about to do something. Meryl then appears in front of the crowd and tells them, "Just stop it! No more cheers! No shouting, no cheering! Just stop it!" M.M. tells Meryl to leave them alone, but then he sees M.P. (who's a cop) yelling at them. The audience is stunned, the movie is over, and everybody is looking around for some reason as if to say, "Why are they doing this? Why are they laughing? Why is M.A. doing this?" M.G. says something to the crowd, and then the music starts playing and the crowd goes crazy. The film cuts to an apartment building. Mandy, M.V., and M.H. are there watching TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ Just a little something about the movie.... As a kid, I loved The Goonies and I remember seeing the movie when I was 6 years old. It wasn't really a "kid friendly" movie...but it was great and it really got my attention. I was actually quite shocked to hear it's still getting good reviews (I really thought that was over and done with) in 2013. I don't have a big cult following, but I am a very loyal and appreciative fan. So, when I heard there was a film about The Goonie, I decided to give it a try. It's still a pretty good film, but there are a couple of problems. First of all, there isn't a good villain...or a bad guy. There is just The Gooner (who is actually good). Also, the Goon is a pretty bland hero. There are a lot of scenes where he is being annoying...but he is actually the main character. There isn't really much in the movie to make me care for him, because the movie isn't very good. So I guess that's why The Goony isn't one of my favorites...but I still really enjoyed it. _______________________________________  Review written by the "Reverse Sidekicks" at - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565200/

Great use of 3D and some really well-done special effects, including the flying birds that fly by the plane with each shot. If this was the only feature of the movie, it would still be great, but it's the last feature that makes this one really special. The ending is one of the great ones, but the beginning is even better."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to see this movie to find out how far it really was and to see how good it really is.    It was so bad it was good, I don't know what's so strange, but the first hour of the film seemed so good and I thought that this movie would be at least moderately good.  It was not, in my opinion, and it had some amazing moments, but in the last hour, it got a little worse and worse, to the point where it was like the whole movie was going downhill, it was really sad.    It seems that they got stuck in their story and not allowed to change it, and that's why it's so bad, I thought it was going to be decent or good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a fan of the  The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly  series, and  the  The Apartment  was a great adaptation of one of my favorite stories.  The film was so faithful to the book, but the movie was also a very different movie.  The Good, Bad, and The Uglies.  In the beginning of the story, a detective named John  (Burt Lancaster)  (in the role of an older, wise and much wiser man) is working to solve the crime.  Then, out of nowhere, he receives a call from a mysterious woman named Maude (Mae West).  Maude tells him that she has been kidnapped and will be killed soon.   After the police and the FBI begin looking for Maude,  Burt Lancaster  is called in to help.   The plot is very simple and the movie is just about to get interesting.   After the first two hours of the movie, the audience is given a lot of insight into the characters and why they are doing what they are trying to do.   Burt  loses his wife (played by the great Lauren Bacall), but he can't get over the death of Maude.   In fact, he spends all of his money on a new suit and the next day, he is attacked by a gunman and dies at the hands of the assassin.   But his final words were, "I love you, Maude."   The Good Old West  has a great cast of characters, which are portrayed very well by the likes of James Stewart and Mae West.  The story is very well paced, and it builds nicely, especially when the story switches to Mexico in 1916, a time when the American war effort was going badly, and the Mexican military was being used to prop up the United States.   Burt Â Lancaster Â is one of the best actors ever, and when he dies, the film gets a great sendoff that will be a great memory for the audience.   If you enjoyed The Good (Bad, Ugly), you will love  The Ugliest Story Ever Told.    This is a film about the great cowboy, Wyatt Earp.   He is a man who can't stand to hear people call him anything other than a gunfighter, or a wise-ass,

It was very good, very funny. _______________________________ _________________________ ___________________________ My friend and i were just at the local cinema today and we were in for a treat when we came across the first of the two movies that I bought at the cinema last month. I was pretty happy with the movie overall and would recommend the movie to anyone.    I was just at a cinema last night for the first time in almost 6 months. I went with a friend of mine to see a movie, and was excited to see the new movie that was coming out.  I saw it a couple of times and it's one of those things where it's pretty good, but not something that really stands out from the others out there.  The movie that I had seen was called "Bridget Jones' Diary", and was based on the book "Bidder Girl" by Roald Dahl (which I read as a child).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been too many bad movies in the last couple of years. This is one of the better ones and is much more fun than most of the "toys to the wall" movies released the last few years. A great addition to the filmography of both Wes Anderson and Anderson's own films. It is probably the best Wes Anderson film in years. My wife and I watched this at a party on Sunday night and enjoyed it immensely. I can't say I am a Wes Anderson fanboy like I am many others, but I was entertained to some extent. I loved the humour, the characters, the setting and the direction. The cast all do their roles very well. I liked that some of the characters from the previous films were still around. Some of them (Hank) didn't play as much, but they all were still well done and I would have liked to see more of their part in the film. The main character, who I think is his only real character, is a much different character in this film than in the others. It gives it a different feel. I was impressed by how well the film handled the relationship between the main characters, their daughter and the dog. It was just another funny, touching and heartwarming moment that helped to keep the film from getting too heavy. It also gives the film a bit of a mystery element. There are a lot of twists and turns along the way. I have not seen any of the previous Wes Anderson movies and this one was great fun. I would definitely recommend this to a lot more people. 8.2/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movies are a dime a dozen and I'm pretty sure this was the fifth or sixth film by this director over the last twenty years, and this is by far the best one.  For me this is probably the best action film I have ever seen and I think that says it all, with a little more heft the film could have easily been a great hit at the box office.    The story is pretty simple and easy to follow and is a bit of a throwback to the early nineties in regards to the characters but the action scenes and choreography are just a lot of fun.       I also think that the film's use of music is pretty excellent.  So what do I think about the movie?  I think this is definitely one of the better action films of the last several years.  If you have a favorite action movie you have probably seen this one and it's probably very close to your heart.  I'd give this a solid 8 out of 10 and if you're into the genre then I think it's worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  The movie I watched was a remake of an old movie starring Charlton Heston and the two main characters are brothers named Peter (Heston) and Bobby (Bobby Van Beethoven). I liked this movie because the main character and the main plotline didn't revolve around a good or evil. He was just a man, who wants to become famous and help others. The movie was short so I had a short time to sit back and enjoy it.   The best part about this movie was the characters. The two brothers were played by Heston who is the most entertaining actor ever and Bobby Van Beechoven who just did what he was told to do in every scene. These two made this movie memorable.   the movie is so short that you can watch it and not worry about the plot line and not think you missed a lot of action. I think that this movie could have been an 80's/90's remake because it was so different than the 90's/00's action movies. This movie could even be a modern remake if you remove the bad acting.  .  #1 Movie Star
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This movie is very faithful to the books, and the performances by the actors were very strong. The film is a great horror movie that is worthy of all of the praise that is being shown to it." 1. Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead (2004) (4.5/5) Dead Snow 2  was released in theaters in 2004, and was based on the  Dead Snow comic. This movie was also a surprise box office hit, and is currently considered the best horror movie in North American cinema. The original story was first published in 1986, but the film was actually a remake of the sequel, Dead Snow.   The original movie was not much of a success in theaters, so  another adaptation was made.   This movie takes place in the same setting as the original, but is set in the future. This is an odd movie. I mean it's not horrible, it's a decent horror movie, but it's like I said before: strange. DeadSnow  is one of the best action movies of all time, but Dead Snow II  has been deemed a "bad film" by fans of the first movie.  I have to admit though, it is really bad. The movie is so bad that it makes me think, "Why didn't I think of making this?" The movie features the same characters, the same action, the only difference is that now the bad guy doesn't just turn up in the movie, he's an actual human being who turns into a zombie.  2. Saw V: The Final Chapter (2010) Saw V : The Final chapter  sounds really lame, but at the same time it's really well done.  It was directed by none other than  Peter Jackson,  and based on a best-selling series of books, the first of which was released in 1987.  The movie follows an unknown FBI agent and a police officer, both named "Jack," on a night of terror in Los Angeles. Jack is a veteran cop who has been hired to protect a wealthy billionaire, named George, during his vacation.  George has a number of beautiful young women, and Jack is set to protect them, but one of them escapes into the woods, and so he goes after her.  I'll say right now that the movie is absolutely incredible.  There are some great scenes throughout, like when Jack and his friends, after finding out

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ What the hell does that mean? Do you like it? Did you laugh? Do I care? Do people like the movie? That's all that matters. It may be a bad movie, but I'm not sure you're going to find a better one on the big screen, so let me explain to you, as simple as I can, why I enjoy it. As I've stated before, I don't see why we need to rehash the same old shit all over again. If a film is good, you can enjoy it, even if you didn't like it the first time, and if a movie is bad, you know how it is: if you liked it once, you'll probably like it again, so why can't you have it again? Not all bad movies are good, of course, but most of them are pretty good in their own right, and I think it's kind of anachronistic to make a habit out of rehashin' them all over the place. And there's nothing wrong with movies you like, but there's a reason people are interested in how and why they're made, and here's a small piece of that for you.   I would have liked to have seen more of this film, in fact I was hoping it would turn out to be one of the better examples of the film noir genre, but as it stands, it's not. Sure, the film may not have the best of visual effects, it may not be the most inventive story, and it may well have a few flaws here and there, but it is still an entertaining film with a good story and some pretty cool stuff happening.     The film is set in a New York City apartment building, and a few of the characters find themselves in the same situation. One of them is a former model for the agency that created his model, and one is a young, attractive woman in the business. The rest of the group find themselves trapped in an apartment that they can't get out of without getting caught. The place is owned by a man who is a known character, and there are plenty of clues around that point the viewers in that direction. The story is more than a little bit over the top at points, but the story still works for the most part. The ending is pretty good as well, but that's about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The Phantom is a fine film. I do find it a bit overlong at over 130 minutes, but I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The plot is straightforward enough - an American pilot, Alex, is assigned to fly a British fighter plane over the Soviet Union to retrieve a downed German fighter plane. He and his fellow pilot, Paul, arrive on the battlefield to find themselves fighting the Red Army. There is an interesting story here - the story of the war, and the story is told from two perspectives, from Alex and Paul. Paul is the veteran pilot who was on the ground that day, and who was there to help Alex and the others when they were attacked. Alex is a new pilot. He is a former mercenary and has a strong hatred of Communism and the Soviets. He has a good idea of what's happening, but can't understand the Russian's. He's lost. Alex's lack of understanding of how the situation works is the primary problem in the film. He also makes the mistake of thinking that the Soviets have superior firepower. In fact, their firepower is not superior, they are not being outnumbered. They have superior training and tactics, and their pilots have the highest level of skill. The Soviets have been bombing all over Germany for months, but have been running out of targets. Their planes are being destroyed left and right, and they are out-gunned. Paul has been on the front lines with Alex since they were both in the mercenary group. It was Paul who led Alex into battle, and now it's Alex who leads Paul into battle. The Phantom also does a good job of showing Alex's family, the people he is supposed to be helping, and his own personal issues. Alex and his girlfriend get involved with a German pilot and a Russian pilot. The romance is not that great, but it's not horrible either. I liked the scene where Alex and Alex's father have a conversation - the father tells Alex that there is a way he can leave, that there's a world out there for him, and that Alex should go out and live it. Alex just tells him that it won't be the same - the world's a bit worse off without him. Alex doesn't see what he's saying at first. He doesn't realize he's talking to his father, and he doesn't care that he's just going to have to let him go. That scene ends up showing Alex that this kind of talk is a lot more dangerous than he
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is great. The actors play very well together, and the story line is great, the only drawback is that the special effects are poor (except for some flying things that I can't see clearly) but the story and characters make up for it. I thought I would have to wait a long time for another science fiction film and I was right. This film really takes you into this world of outer space and it's life and death struggle, as a whole, as well as the relationships in both the space and on the ground. It's a good film, but I don't think there are any great sequels, so I wouldn't bother watching any of them. Watch it now!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers will be remembered as one of the all time greatest superhero movies. It is a masterpiece. The action is so epic, the chemistry between the cast is so intense, the set pieces are so spectacular and the villains are so diabolical. The movie has it all. It may take some time for audiences to truly appreciate the greatness of this film, but once they do, the movie will be one of a kind. It's a must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So you're at a party with your friends and you hear the music blasting in the background. As if you can't stop smiling, you start to dance. The girls and guys start to get up and down with the music. Then, one of your friends says something and someone else responds. And it's the last time you'll hear it, until the next day when you get the phone call saying that someone in your family has passed away. The last thing you hear on that song is someone calling you a f*cking moron.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man in the High Castle" is a great example of one of the things I love about science fiction: the ability of science fiction to explain some pretty basic ideas about human nature that are so obvious once you take the time to think about them. Yes, there is an alien invasion, but it's only one in a long line of conflicts with some strange new species, and the reason for this isn't really the aliens' actions - it's humans' own desire for control over the alien species, which causes both humans and aliens to behave like the worst kind of creatures. What I liked about the movie was how it did an effective job of laying out the "human behavior problem" in a clear and concise way, as if we're not all just a bunch of greedy idiots. This is a problem we have been facing for decades, and this film helps explain why that's happening. It's not enough to have some vaguely mystical powers - we have to actually see that there are real human beings that are going to use them to take over the world, and it looks like we're about to see the results of it. It may seem like an obvious thing to say, but I'm very glad this movie made it clear that humans are the real monsters here.  3 of 6 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Shepherd, or at least the first half, is a good film.  I'm not entirely sure why I saw it.    I saw the trailer online, saw it with some friends, then had lunch with them, and went to see the film.   I remember thinking, "This is a pretty good movie." I'm not sure how I got there.   The Good Samaritan  was, in all fairness, a movie about one person's encounter with a crime, but the people in it were a family of five people that needed help.  They lived a good life, but in order to get by, they had to do the dirty work that people who had no home would do.  The Good Shepherd tells a tale of how they try to stay strong, and try to help those who need it. They do.   The film focuses on how a young boy learns to take care of himself and his family, despite having to do something he is less suited for.  I don't think it's a perfect film, but I'll get to that later.   It starts off in a small town in the north.  Little Rock, Arkansas  The town of Little Rock is run down and decaying.  There is a bar, a restaurant, and a few local businesses.  Here, a man goes by the name of Johnny, and he's a farmer.  He grows beans for cash.  This is not a film about an individual's struggle to get up and out of the way.  What the film tries to convey is how people are going to be treated by others if they are born with problems that they can't fix.  Johnny can't do it.  The film then takes a turn for the dramatic.  First, Johnny is shot by a man trying to rob him.   His father walks out and takes the blame for the crime, and the young boy is left alone.   What follows is a series of flashbacks to a time before Johnny was a man.  His father had been an alcoholic, and his mother had been a drunkard.  Their home life is a mess, and they had many problems.    Old St. Francis Home, Arkansas There's a great deal of violence in this film. While Johnny is not shot, he is assaulted, and has to go to the hospital.  When he does, he meets his mother.  She tells him he's
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has an interesting plot. The main character is a male virgin and is given a chance to save his girlfriend by attending a sexual awakening seminar run by two young women. When he arrives the seminar is a disaster as the women there make it clear they want to teach men how to have sex. They then go on to tell the main character how to give them oral sex and to masturbate, and how they are having sex all over the place in front of him and their boyfriend's children. They also take away his penis and force him to have them perform sex acts on him on camera. This is a little on the extreme side but the movie does make you question why we allow this to happen when so many other things happen in our lives that should have prevented this situation. I wouldn't go out of my way to see this unless I was really into some sort of BDSM but then again who doesn't enjoy the idea of a woman in her late 30s having sex with a younger man who is in his early 20s?  3. Black Swan (2011) Director: Darren Aronofsky Synopsis: "Swan Lake meets The Blair Witch Project as a mysterious new film emerges with a cast of young female actors who are all struggling to survive the film's horrific shoot."  I think all of this stuff is good, and I'm not saying that I haven't done my share of movies where I've been disappointed (I don't like the Twilight series) and I think that when a director has the creative freedom to make whatever he wants, the quality usually is usually good. That said, I'm still disappointed in this movie and I don't think I've seen a better movie that Darren Arronofsky has made that has no connection to any of the other movies he has done.  This movie was not as successful as the other Aronoffks, and its failure is attributed in part to the fact that Darren decided to cast a female cast in the lead roles and not to make his movie more female focused. Darren has stated that he felt the female leads were more interesting and they needed to make the story more about them. This may be true, but I don?t think that the story needed to be more about women than it already was. All the stories we are hearing and seeing about "male" suicide, incest, and "male rape" are so rare in the media that I think it?s just about possible

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In the summer of 1972, a group of boys from the town of Redding, California, headed out to the Pacific Ocean, hoping to make some money out of a rare movie that had been released just a few weeks earlier.  Instead, they were swept off their feet and transformed into men who were lost in the Pacific. It wasn't just a bad movie, it was a nightmare.  a) The movie is so far beyond bad that it makes it seem like it was made by a group who didn't think that they had a film worth making. When the boys do get off the boat they have a lot of explaining to do, but by the time they have managed to get some supplies together for their journey, the movie has already taken a turn for the worse.   2/10   a) One of the men, Sam (the lead), has disappeared and is presumed to have fallen overboard. He does return at the end of the film, however, and is actually in the film briefly, but does not speak or appear until a year or so later. There is no explanation as to how or why he managed to reach the ocean and survive in the cold waters of the Pacific, although some believe that he may have been an experienced ocean swimmer.  ....   The crew of the raft is forced to take shelter from a cyclone in a deserted village. When a large cyclone starts to build up in the area, the crew are forced to move to the nearest structure, which is a church. It becomes apparent that something is wrong when the church begins to fall apart and then starts to shake. The only thing that seems to work, however is to use a "pumpkin" to make the church collapse in on itself and seal off the rest of the village, leaving only Sam.   The crew do not realize that they are no longer in the country, or that they may be dead.   I don't believe that I will ever see another such atrocious movie.

The plot is absolutely fantastic and I would watch this every week, not only because of the amazing plot, but also because of how interesting the characters were. It was almost like watching a sci-fi film about alien races fighting each other and aliens fighting humans with a dash of sci-fantasy. My only quibble is that I would have preferred to see it in its original Japanese, which is the same language as the first Star Trek. If it were in English, it would have been a very entertaining watch and I can't wait for more. If you want a fun sci- fi and space adventure, look no further.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you like to laugh at something? Do you have an unhealthy obsession with pop culture? Do movies have the power to make you laugh, cry, and think? If you answered 'yes' to any of the above, then then you're in luck! This movie is absolutely hilarious. It was so good that my sister came over and watched it with me! It has some great performances and one of my favorite lines ever: "I was a nerd when I was a kid. I just didn't have a choice." "Das Boot" is a German WWII drama that is part comedy, part drama, and part war movie. A group of POWs get rescued by Allied soldiers and it's up to them to get back to their own country. It's a fun, yet realistic film. As the POWs attempt to reunite and continue on their way, they find that their new friends are not quite what they seem. There are also some dark undertones to this film that makes it even more enjoyable. It takes a bit of a dark turn near the end, but it never turns into a terrible mess. It also has a great soundtrack by Michael Nyman. It is a must see for any fan of comedy and WWII movies.  The movie's main character, Klaus, a German POW, is captured by the Allies, and finds that he has a long way to go back to Germany, and back to being a normal boy. He begins to get some good news, and it is very nice. However, as time goes on, he also starts to have bad news. He is now in charge of a small group of other POWs, who must continue on on their mission of making their way back to the United States. The mission becomes more and more complex, as they have to travel across a very mountainous, mountainous country. The film doesn't really begin to get going until about 30 minutes in. The group is having a discussion about how best to get across the mountains. The one point where this is said is when, during a discussion, one POW asks the other "Why would anyone want to come back to England, when Germany is now their own? Why are they still fighting?" It's pretty simple, really, but when it is stated this way, it makes everything else make more sense. The film is very simple in plot and action, but also very well written and acted. It has a nice mix of comedic and drama scenes,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a very good horror movie. It features lots of gore, lots of action and suspense and some excellent creature and sound design. The Thing was made in 1982 and in it the director, James Cameron, had some of the best designs for the alien and the creatures. He's able to make a very scary and disturbing movie and that is all down to his outstanding work.

I won't say too much about the story as that would spoil the ending, but just know that the plot is very good. ------------------------ The characters and their relationships in Taken by Vincent and Veronica are very well done. Vincent is a loner, who lives in a small apartment, and Veronica is an introvert, who enjoys reading and hanging out with friends, and has a very strong crush on her friend, who is her girlfriend. ------------- Vin has some really strong qualities. He has a great imagination, loves to read, and likes to explore the world around him. ------------ Veronica, who happens to be the older, more mature one, loves books and wants to be a writer, and when she hears that Vincent is trying to write, she wants to make him successful by helping him. However, she is shy and tries to hide this side of her personality. When she meets Vincent, she quickly comes to his aid and, with her help, takes him out to meet Veronica's friend and boyfriend. -------------- When I was reading the book, I had a great time imagining the adventures that the two of them go on, and I had such a good time imagining them in their house, reading books, exploring the house, and spending time together. ----------------- I enjoyed the way that the characters were developed in this story, and loved how they were different and who they were. Vin was very loners, but with a very mysterious past and his mind filled with all kinds of fantasy and sci-fi adventures. He is kind and gentle, and always there to help a friend or even a stranger, especially if they are down. Veronica is the one that is always there for the two kids in her class, and she is very intelligent and very funny. ~~~~~~~~~~ The music was also great! It reminded me of a few of the scenes that were shown in the story, as the music was a mixture of different genres. I will give it four stars, because I really liked the music in this book! ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The Good: There are too many things to talk about in this film. The cinematography, acting, story, and the music are perfect, but most of all, the performance by Matthew McConaughey. He is one of my favorite actors of all time. He gets better each time I watch this film and each time that I have seen this film I have found myself thinking "wow, I wish I could have been that good". As mentioned above, his character in this movie is perfect and the relationship between him and his son is what makes this film great. The ending of this film is very emotional, although it doesn't have a real happy ending. It's almost like he has his family back. There is also a scene where they are playing baseball at the park and his character is on a break when he comes back to the clubhouse and sees his son with a girl and he starts crying. The movie has a lot of funny scenes, and all of the characters are very likable and endearing. Overall, if you want a good family movie, with a great script and excellent acting and cinematography then you should definitely check this out. The Bad: The movie is very long, so I can't talk much about it here, but I will say that the ending of the film is quite sad. And if you didn't like the ending to the movie, don't go in for this one.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first time watching this was about 3 years ago and I just re-watched it today after being so disappointed with the first movie.  This movie is a really good old fashioned adventure with a cast of memorable characters, good plot, interesting twists and the occasional bad guy or two thrown in for the fanservice. The movie gets some great performances out of a few actors in the cast and does a really nice job at not bogging down with the typical melodramatic stuff that most old school movies get. It has lots of great set pieces and a great action set piece between the bad guys and the hero(s). The animation is just a bit muddy and sometimes looks a bit cheap and a few of the characters look a bit silly or plain silly but these are minor complaints for a really interesting story with a great cast of characters that can be enjoyed for a fun adventure.  This movie is not for everyone, but if you like adventure movies then this is a good one to check out!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* (0/3) ***Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)*** A good old Star Wars ripoff, not quite as cheesy as the first film, but that never stopped this film from being a decent piece of action. The whole film is about Anakin being tricked into killing his uncle, who is actually a Sith Lord. Then after being tricked himself, Anakin is led to believe he is now part of the Empire and his parents have been captured. I really like the way this movie was made. The special effects are better than anything you'll find in most Star Wars films. It's like a mix between Jaws and Star Wars with the old man running across the desert and chasing after Anakin. The only problem is the movie was too short and I felt it should have been an entire film. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the first movie.  The Rating: 4 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ A film by Kevin MacLeod, the film "A Better Life" is a documentary on a woman who became a part of a cult known as the Family. This cult members believed in a supernatural force, and after the cult members died, a woman was left with the power to protect herself and others by using her sexuality to control these powerful spirits. She was also left with a secret which she shared with a close friend. This friend turned out to be the leader of the cult, and the two of them married after being separated for decades. The film covers the couple's history and life after the family, including the years that followed her divorce. I believe it's a film which could easily be shown on mainstream television, as it's not preachy, and shows how these individuals truly became family. The music is a good fit, and you can hear how the cult leader was a bit off, but I believe that the film can stand on its own without the music and still make a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is what they call a "family movie". It's not a serious drama (though, there is a tragedy at the center). It's just a silly movie with a ton of heart. Even though there's a lot of jokes and gags, you never feel like the kids are being forced to do anything. There are a lot jokes, and all of them are funny. There's a good amount of emotional depth to these characters, and you can tell that the director cared a great deal about them. It is a small, but poignant movie. There isn't really any character development, so this movie isn't exactly "deep", but it still is a very entertaining experience.  4/5 stars Did you like this review? Have you seen the movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dear  Jul 13, 2017 6:22 am  Copy Link  New   This post has been updated to correct the number of votes cast in the Democratic primary.  New York voters cast ballots in the state's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, with voters choosing a slate of nine candidates in the race for the party's nomination for president. The outcome was a foregone conclusion, with the same five candidates having been running for the nomination since April. : Democrats have been choosing their nominee for president since the 1920s. For a while, there were six — all male — candidates.Then, in 1972, the party added a woman to its ticket — the first woman to appear on a major party's national ticket since Theodore Roosevelt was elected president in 1912. In 1976, when Democrat Jimmy Carter was the nominee, the Democratic National Committee changed its rules to allow for a woman. But Hillary Clinton did not join the party until 1992 — eight years after the party first admitted a woman's potential to run for president — and she was not nominated until 2016.In the 2016 election, the number eight was seen as the symbol of both the Democratic and Republican parties — the number representing the Roman numeral eight. But as the party of Lincoln, it seemed like a good time for the Democratic Party to include a woman on their ticket. Clinton did run as a Democrat — it was her second run — but she was a former first lady and New York senator. She had not been a party member for a long time, but this was a change in strategy. And, to the delight of many, the Democrat who was picked for the job was one of the most well-liked candidates to ever run for the presidency."The choice of Hillary Clinton as our party's nominee for President is not only historic, but it is an indication of the great strides that we have all made together to bring our country together, and make our nation stronger," said Hillary for America chair John Podesta, who previously served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff and who had worked on her 2008 presidential campaign. "Hillary Clinton will be the first female president and the first Democratic woman elected president from a major political party. She is a tireless fighter for equality, and she is ready to fight for every American's chance at the American Dream."Clinton is expected to face off against the Republican nominee in the general election, and, if she sec
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My brother and I went out of town for New Year's, and we brought the family dog with us. The dog, a Jack Russell terrier, had been with us for 2 years and was a family pet. I had heard that he was deaf when he was a puppy and we had been thinking about getting a puppy with hearing loss (hearing dogs are expensive). In the car when we got to our hotel, the dog jumped up on my shoulder and barked! I thought it was funny because a dog would do that. The driver took the dog and said he'd take it to the pet store to check it out. When we got home, the pet shop had nothing to sell me (the dog was deaf). So I thought that he would be a great pet to try out if I lost my dog. The next morning I got up early and the dog got up to walk around. We were on the floor and he kept barking. I figured he was doing that so I opened the window and got the window open and he did not come out. After I got dressed, I looked out the window to see if he was in the apartment, and he was not! I called the pet supply store and they told me the owner was in that apartment and they had to call him back. I thought I would call back later that day, but I did not get a call back. The owner of the dog is also deaf and cannot hear me so I do not know what he might be barking about. The store would not help me and I think the owner of that dog is a jerk and wants to keep it out of sight. I want this dog to be happy so I will be taking him to another pet store but will not be back for him. This pet store is the worst pet store in town. The clerk was rude and condescending. I would not recommend this pet store.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When I got to see this movie, I was not disappointed in the least. I have to confess that I was never a huge fan of the original Star Trek television series, but this movie does an excellent job of recreating the show's style, and the production values are on par with most feature length movies from that time. It's a lot of fun, even if it's not as big a film as some of the other Trek movies." -David O, The Dao of the Dragon   "This is a great little film about the Original Series, that will keep you on the edge of your seat and entertained for at least 2 hours of your life. It is a very well done, well cast, well directed, and well acted movie. It will please the young fans of the series, the old school fans of this show, and anyone who loves the original series. It should also appeal to fans of science fiction in general, because there is a lot to it. But the best part of the movie is its simplicity and its focus. It takes the most popular idea of the 'T' from the 'E' and puts it on an epic scale. It was made for a family audience, a film for all people who like to watch a story unfold before them, and a movie for a generation that has grown up with science fiction." -J. M. " The movie is entertaining and a bit weird, not really sure what it is that it is trying to do with it, but it's still enjoyable. " -David, The Star Trek Fan " It has some very good production values, good story, good acting and, well, a lot that goes into making a "proper" Star Trek movie. " –Lloyd H, Fan-Caste.com "I didn't find this the best movie on the list, I thought it was a bit confusing and I feel like it wasn't made for the masses. I did see it, and I think I can get into it with a bit more understanding, but I don't think I will make the leap to see it again." –David, Tribute.com If you want to read more about The Wrath of Khan, be sure to check out: This Movie Does a Fantastic Job of Recreating the Original Original TV Series – Tribute Read More Reviews...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young boy is transported into a fantasy world, where he joins an army of elves, a wizard, and a princess, with the help of a strange talking horse. This is a story of a boy who must save a princess who is captured by the evil wizard. If you are a Disney fan, you will love this movie.  It's a little hard to find a Disney movie that isn't bad, but this one isn't the worst!  I really liked the voice cast!   Overall, this is a fun adventure.     The film itself is about a boy named Luke. He is a young boy that is stuck in a fantasy kingdom. He meets two other young boys, a young wizard named Owen and a talking horse named Rufio. This story is about Luke as he finds out the kingdom is going to be destroyed. He finds out that the reason for this is because someone stole a magic jewel from a princess. She is also his uncle and uncle's daughter. There is some back story to the princess and the jewel thief, but it isn't that important. The rest of the movie is about finding the jewel and getting it back.  And this is how the story starts...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My father gave me a copy of this film when I was about 14. He was a huge fan of the Star Trek franchise so it's no surprise that he enjoyed this. His dad had made some Star Trek toys. He wanted the film to be a special edition for the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek. The first scene I remember is Kirk and Spock having to use a shuttle. Spock looks around for a solution, the solution being a very large one. It's a very small piece of hardware, but with a giant piece of metal attached to it. Spock then turns the giant piece to reveal the Klingon Bird of Prey. Kirk looks shocked and asks if he knows how to operate the thing. Spock is just as surprised as Kirk, but he gets it in the end. The Klingon Bird takes off and Kirk is left behind to die, Spock manages to get a small piece away. He makes a big noise saying "Thank you, Mr. Spock", and then dies. Kirk and the other crew all look at Spock and I think he has lost his humanity and all his friends, but then Spock manages a very close call with death. The film ends with Kirk's "Thank You" to Spock. A film I am sure many people will enjoy. Star Trek (2009)  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: e-gulf

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grandmaster (2015)  ( IMDB - 5.0/10)  This was a very interesting and very well-produced action film about one man's attempt to train a prodigy. The director's style of mixing visual effects with dramatic and dramatic language is definitely an interesting and interesting direction to go in.  The story was pretty good but it was not very original.  A very strong directorial debut. A very strong and original directorial effort!  The Grandmaster is an exciting and visually impressive action-thriller which has a great premise and a great script.    This is one of the best films from the summer of 2015!  This film is a fantastic blend of martial arts action, martial arts history and martial arts fantasy.     The film has a complex storyline and a very high production value.   With such a high production values, the film is definitely worth seeing.  A must see film if you are a fan of martial art films!  
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I found this movie to be a little different from the rest. It's not really a horror movie because it takes place in a small town that's pretty peaceful. The main characters were all friendly, which made me wonder why this town would have so many bad people. But I don't think it was the main attraction. It is still a good thriller because it has all the elements that you'd expect from a good horror movie: suspense, gore, and a dark atmosphere.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   [This review was first published in 2008.] A film that combines the best elements of classic westerns, a good dose of "Law & Order" and a good kick in the pants to the heartstrings from a wonderful leading man, "Unforgiven" may be the single best western ever made.  "Unforgiving" is not a classic western like "The Magnificent Seven" or "Unchained"; it is not the best or most realistic film in the genre; and it does not live up to the standards set by the other "Law" films (which in general are pretty good).  But what it is is a masterpiece: a classic film that shows how a true film can take you on a roller-coaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, and a story that brings to mind the great westerns of John Ford, Sergio Leone, and John Sturges. 's Clint Eastwood is not your typical cowboy, though he may look like one (he has a big mouth and likes to say "I'm a gunfighter and a man of God") and he is not going to pull any punches when he wants to be, especially when he is on the receiving end of an unexpected kick. Eastwood has a way of coming across as the hero of this tale of revenge and redemption and in the end, he's not so much a hero as he is a great big, angry man who won't be stopped by anyone. The film is a big and impressive western epic that shows why Clint Eastway is considered by many to be one of the greatest living film directors. Spencer Tracy is one of those actors who will never truly be over (just like he was in the movie "Saving Private Ryan"). He has a real talent for conveying the intensity and danger of the action scenes without it seeming like his character is playing a joke. That was not the case in his early career (or in many of his later roles) because he was still making it up as he went along, but now that he has found his place in the acting game and has found a steady base in film, he has finally found his balance and is making his film career look like it belongs. I was really excited for the "Unbroken" film because I am a huge fan of Steve McQueen and I thought I would like to see what this brilliant actor was doing with a relatively small budget. It doesn't hurt that he also

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crazy Heart (1948) I'm glad this is my favorite movie! It has a story that has more meaning than most movies. It shows that if you want to make money and to be famous, you will have to be greedy, and be bold. It tells the truth about the way a woman will act when she really has it made. The film tells of the story of an Irish woman, Ruth (Marianne Duddy), who after a marriage to a wealthy man goes to a country cottage, to the land she has never seen, and she will be married for real.  Ruth decides to have an affair with the land agent, Mr. O'Brien, who is about to sell her the cottage, and he will let her see the cottage once she has it paid for. She will have the only person in the world who will give her a glimpse of the home, because there will be nothing else to see. The cottage is in a beautiful location and she is very happy. But, she decides to keep her secret and keep her lover's secret from him. But when Ruth realizes that her lover, her husband, does not love her, she tells O'Briens about it. He refuses to tell her that he loves her, and has no intentions of marrying her, because she is "no good." He believes that she is not "good enough" for him. Ruth has a secret plan, and does not want to tell O'Broen and his father, the landlady, about it, and not allow him to see the home of her dream. O.Brien is furious with Ruth, but she believes that, if they let her have the cottage and live there with her lover until they are married, she can be sure he will love her. So, she persuades her father to let her get the cottage. But she has not told him the reason that she has the cottage or that her husband will never marry her. And the family goes to visit O.Brien at his country cottage. He is very proud of his cottage, because of all the money it has brought him. He tells his mother that Ruth will be the envy of everyone who ever has visited it, because her home looks as if it was built for her. But his mother is so upset that she breaks up the family so they can all get together. They come back and tell their mother. Ruth is very angry and has a good reason
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't get much more authentic and real than this movie. The most important part of this film is the friendship between the characters. It's very relatable and I believe that the characters' love for each other is what really make this movie great. It is very refreshing to see the friendship that the two have and it really adds to the whole experience. This movie is also very emotional at some points which I really appreciated as the movie was very emotional in the beginning. This would be a perfect film to watch when you're feeling sad and are looking for a little good hearted to cheer you up.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** * The first half of the movie I thought this movie was a huge load of crap, but I found out that there was much more to the film than I thought. For one I really liked the characters that we have, and even more I liked how the movie told the story of the people that make this city what it is today. The movie did not just focus on the cops and the robbers that we get to know. It showed the everyday people that the cops deal with, and how they deal with criminals and criminals in general. The second half of this movie however I found to be the best. The final part of the film did a fantastic job in showing a more realistic look at what it's like to be a cop and the everyday life that the police have to go through. If you ever decide to give this movie a chance, you should watch it in it's entirety to really see what makes it great. * Don't be afraid to ask questions, some of the comments that people had about the movie were way too harsh, and you never really see where it came from, so don't take it so personally. The people that said the movie was boring to watch were also the ones that didn't watch the movie with an open mind. * I did like how the final battle between the good guys and the bad guys was done perfectly, and I think the end fight with the bad guy was one of the best battle scenes ever. If the movie did have a flaw it would be that there were a few times where the movie took a while to get going and you don't really know what was going on and there were some other minor nitpicks that I didn't find but that's just a personal thing that I found in the movie. * In my opinion this movie would be worth the time and money and I hope that the sequel doesn't disappoint. The action was well done, the characters and story were great, and the villains had a great ending. I just wish that the film didn't take so long to go from beginning to end and it did have more of an ending than the first movie had. I give this a 9 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of action and good characters. See it if you can.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Beauty  by Stéphane Audranel is a great film, a really well-made film and one that shows great filmmaking and great acting.   The story has a lot of drama, it's full of great scenes and one of the best ones is when you hear the man in the boat saying, "They've been lying to us!" This is the moment I will remember the most, I will always remember that he said it because it makes me think of the truth, you can't fool all the time but you can try.   In this film you will see a lot people falling into one of those things, it won't be all in your face, it will be in your ears, in your mind and your stomach. The film doesn't make you laugh or cry, it makes you think.   In fact, this film has a few scenes that are just so dark, so surreal, it is almost unreal but you will know that it's real because of the acting. It is a beautiful film and I recommend it.   If you're in need of a good film to watch before going to sleep, watch The Great Beauty, it will help you sleep better.   Enjoy! If you like my review please like and share it, also leave a comment about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- The film is quite funny, a bit cheesy but still good! The plot is well developed and the film has a great twist at the end. I also like the way they went about making the film a horror movie. The film has some decent gore, though not too much, and it is actually quite scary when it is needed. You see the monster and you wonder if you should take a shower or not, you are really in for a shock. The special effects are very well done, and there is a little action in the film. Overall, it is a good film, if only for the fact that there is something to be scared about.  Director: Peter Jackson | Stars: Sam Neill, Landon Liboiron, Toby Jones

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the tradition of The Magnificent Seven and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, this film is a wonderful mix of Western and Action set on a post-apocalyptic world.  It is an action film that features an interesting story about the fate of a group of Native Americans.  While it is more than a little cliché and predictable, it still provides a great, entertaining experience.  There are so many action sequences and some of them are really, really cool, such as the sequence where one of the characters is shot in the neck and it looks like he's already dead.  There are so, so many scenes that really give us an interesting perspective on the events and how the world was destroyed, and also how this group of people (the Lakota) are trying to preserve themselves from a very hostile world.  The film also takes some time to build up the characters and their relationships, which is both surprising and welcome in a world where action films seem to be the order of the day.  The movie also takes a lot of time to develop the world it's set in.  It's not a very wide-open world and the characters are very, very small.  But the setting is very compelling and it provides a lot to the story, which I think is mostly conveyed through its visual effects.   Overall, I have to give this film a 6.5/10.  I'm generally a sucker for Westerns and a little like this, so I gave it a solid rating.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ It's the year 2136, and it's Christmas in the year two-hundred and twenty-three. Santa Claus has died. In his place, it's a bunch of nerds at an aerospace firm who have taken over Santa's sleigh. The whole team (the director, the star, the producers, the editor, the animators) is working to get the last few pieces of Santa's reindeer to work again and the sleigh to fly. This is hard work. This also is hard. Santa has been stuck in an icebox, for nine hundred years, ever since a scientist (who was working on an ice machine) dropped some chemicals into a test tube with a piece of ice, which started to melt and spread. Santa's job was to deliver his reindeers every year to the North Pole. Now the sleight of his hand is getting him closer and closer to the ice, but a team of renegades (the head of security, the one who takes the biggest cut of the profits, the nerd who plays hockey, and the geek who can't read) is still trying to figure out what's going on and why. So far, Santa's only known problem is that the reindels keep trying to take over the world and kill everybody, which is why the government is building this fancy new reindel-deflector system to stop them, which will be finished before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the sleuthing sleuths have had a run-in with Santa's original sleigh, and they realize that it may have been damaged when it crashed in the Arctic. A new sleigh was built from a few reindlers, but one of the sleighters turned out to be a giant ice cube that has made a new home in Santa's new sleighter. In the middle of his investigation, the geek is killed while trying to find the giant ice Cube, so Santa has to decide what to do: get the sleuth back alive and bring the Cube to the sleighter, which he does by hacking into the Cube and getting it into the sleeker sleigh so it can fly on its own power, or get himself and the Cube back in the sleider (which is just as dangerous, but more difficult) and use the Cube in the re-indel to fly back to the Northern Hemisphere, where he can be with the rest of the world in the New Year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm really not a very good actor."  This is something that's said about almost everyone on the planet. I know this because I'm one of them.  But I'm trying to prove my case. I'm also trying to tell you why this movie was a masterpiece that is as close as we get to the science-fiction epic that J.J. Abrams was promising with the reboot. If you're a sci-fi fan, go watch this movie. It's one of the best films of all time.  The premise is incredible.  "I'm a guy who's lost his wife and children and he wants to go home to find out why."  I'll never forget watching this film for the first time. At the time, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  One thing I did know, was that it's a movie with one of my all time favorite scenes:   "I think there might be a wormhole out there."  The wormhole in question is one that appears to be in the direction of Earth in the film.  It's something that has been hinted at on and off for years in science fiction films, and it just kept on popping up.    So I'm sitting in the backseat of my car and the camera pans out and reveals a man with red eyes.  He's in his late twenties, but his features have aged terribly.  I see the same face that I see in my mind every time I think of him.   We drive down a hill and his eyes are glued on the horizon.  In his mind, he sees what looks like a worm hole opening up into the stars.  His thoughts turn to all his family who are dead, and all that he lost.  Before you know it, he's on the moon.  A beautiful woman comes up to him and he asks her for a ride.  She says she'll go with him, and that she wants to get the world to stop thinking about the moon as a burial ground.  We get a great opening scene where they meet up, and the scene is amazing.  That is until the woman says she's not leaving.  This scene has become known as "The Flight of the Conchords".  It will forever be in my favorite scenes, because it perfectly captures the spirit of the film at that particular time. "And you're not leaving?"    
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  A young boy named Jaxon has a huge appetite for candy. He is the youngest of five boys and his brothers are constantly playing a game. One day, the older boys get angry and tell him to go to their house because the younger boys have all the candy. They tell him they have their own house, but they need all the chocolate and gum. Jax has a good heart and decides to go play with his brothers instead of waiting for his mother. When he goes to his house, he finds that his mother is actually a witch who uses her magic to turn boys into girls. She transforms all the boys into young women who wear girls' clothes, make their hair like girls' hair, and have their period. This is the beginning of the legend that is known as the Jaws series. Jaxon lives with his older brothers in the family's big house and is raised with their strict mother, Mrs. Jones. After hearing of Mrs. Jaws' cruel and mysterious tricks, Jaxen goes to her house for candy, hoping that it will make him more like his sisters. While there, he meets his sisters, who were turned into women by her, but she didn't tell him where her house was. Jaxy and Jax, and a boy named Kibbie, were the only three boys who were not turned into girls, and they decide to make a living as men by taking jobs as fishermen. Jody, a friend of Jax's, is an expert fisherman who can spot the fish with his eyes closed. Jony, the youngest brother, is more reckless and wild. He likes to jump off a cliff and swim across the ocean. Jorgen, the second youngest brother has a very strong will. He wants to become a soldier when he grows up. Kibby and Jyoti, are the oldest sisters, but when Kib was turned into a woman they did not tell him because he did not seem like a good person. In time, Jody grows up to become the head of the family and Jorgens, as he calls himself, is turned into an animal. When his sister is turned a dog, Jyoni is not sure if she can keep her own family together. This movie shows how Jaws got its name.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ I'm going to be honest with you folks, I didn't expect to like this. I don't even remember the last time I saw a movie that wasn't completely incomprehensible. Well that being said, I do like this movie a lot and am glad that it was able to capture my attention. It took me a little while to get used to all the bizarre dialogue, but once I got the hang of it, it was very enjoyable. The story is very strange, but I'm guessing it was probably written from the point of view of someone in love with a dead woman. The strange thing is, you never really see her in the movie, but just from the sounds that the guy is making, you would assume that he's talking to his dead girlfriend. The first half of the movie was pretty dull. The plot of the story seems like a waste of time. It's the first thing that I heard, and then it's back to the beginning. I was hoping for something a little more interesting than that. The second half of it is more interesting but still just a waste. As you can see from the end of the first part, the characters were very static. The only time we're given any character development is the story is about a guy who thinks he's the victim of a terrible crime. I guess you'd call it a tragic romance, but that's really just an excuse to introduce some more characters. The ending is very sad and you're left feeling like you've seen this story before. But if you're really into weird stories like this, then I'd recommend checking it out. It wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be, but it's still worth checking out, especially if you enjoy the kind of stories that are told in this film.

"The action thriller The Hitman's Bodyguard, a new action movie from director J.J. Abrams, hits theaters on May 20th." I'm not 100% on that, but it looks like a good enough excuse.  Here is another one of the new posters. I really like the fact that there's no name on this one. I get that they're marketing the movie under the name "The Bodyguard", but we're in the middle of summer, and it doesn't have to be a big name to market a movie. It just seems like a simple, clean logo with a simple message.  in the press release, Abrams states, "I love the idea of the Bodyguard being the most personal movie I've ever done. I don't feel like I can be a Hollywood actor anymore and do these kinds of movies, so it's nice to have that sense of personal satisfaction and being a part of this little group of friends who are doing this thing." I get what he's getting at, but this is a little too vague.  it looks to me like the guys in the back row are a little off on this, but I'm sure this is intended to be the only poster that it'll be. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________________________________________________  Gladys: When the movie starts, we have to wait two minutes for the narrator to get started so that we can hear the "music." Then, a guy tells us who this is, and who we are watching (which we are told is "the last of the good guys"). He tells us that we are going to be at the end of the world, and to be prepared to fight for our lives. Then, he goes off on this long, rambling tale of his personal journey through life, the movie never once bothering to stop talking. You may as well read the book (it's about a man who finds himself living in the afterlife), and then come back to this. If you like cheesy, campy, Hollywood bad movies, and have read the last two movies, you may enjoy this as much as I did.

Don't get me wrong, it isn't an "A" movie, but it's a pretty good movie. It has a lot of good scenes and it has a nice plot. This movie has everything: It has the typical "couple-in-love" movie (with the usual "girl is really hot", "the girl is really nice", "I am a bad guy, I want to kill her", "we want our happily ever after", "she will go home if we kill each other") and also a couple of funny and sad scenes. What more could you ask for in an enjoyable movie? The music is perfect, and the acting is pretty good. I especially like the fact that the bad guy is a bit "bad", and that he does want to make the girl "pay" for "killing" him. That is the "darkest" character in the series. And the "baddest" villain (as he himself admits) is also really funny and kind of stupid, and a little scary as well. This is probably the only film from this series that is worth watching for the ending! It's worth mentioning that this is not a "romantic" movie. If you are expecting the "soul" of the character of the couple, this is probably not for you, but if you like to watch a nice and realistic "love" story, then this is definitely a good film to check out.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ Watch the first episode of the new movie, The Good Son! This is a film that is very well made and is filled with lots of great performances by a diverse cast. The movie is a great story about a family that is struggling and dealing with the death of their mother. I loved how this movie handled the tragedy in a way that was easy to relate to. The Good Daughter did a great job showing her mother's pain and how this led to a great character development. I was so surprised at how much this movie hit home and I feel like it will be a great film for young boys and girls that will leave them wanting more. I hope that it will give the makers of other similar films a good laugh as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I don't think I'll be watching the last three hours of this movie because I'm so bored, so I thought it'd be fun to give it a review in advance. I really liked the original film, and this movie is almost exactly the same. This movie is about the same type of characters, and we see some of the same events happen again. The only difference is that the story has changed and so has the protagonist. The two main characters are identical. The character development is the same, and so are the dialogues. The story is a bit different. It is mostly about a guy who decides to leave the island for a year and go to Europe. It begins with him in a bar, and then he walks down an alley, and sees the girl he loves with the guy who he is living with. They end up on the beach and then the next day he wakes up and goes to her house. He talks about how much they have become as people and it's like the same scenes that the first movie had, but in a different way. She is still the same person and he's the same guy. The movie is very short at only 4 or 5 hours. The dialogue is as boring as the first film, but there are some funny scenes. Overall, this was not a good film, it's very boring, has nothing to recommend it, and doesn't even need it. I don?t think I?d recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is fun, funny, well directed, with many jokes and a well written and executed story. The movie is well written, with the story line being told well from the beginning to the end. There's a good mix of both comedy and a few scenes that are truly memorable. The actors do an excellent job, as well, although it's not an easy job. The acting from Jeff Bridges and his character are the best of the lot. His performance as the drunken wise guy is truly a treat to watch, with a nice blend of arrogance and ignorance. He gives a performance that is simply superb, and you can see why he has been nominated for four Oscars. This, then, is a solid film that's not going to win any awards for acting, but will certainly be seen by many. Also, it's funny. I think a great big hit, and well worth watching for a laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It seems to be a trend in the 80's to have a good action movie with a female lead and that was a trend that never seemed to die out.  However, in the 90's there is a new trend in action movies with a more comedic tone and it is all thanks to an Asian actor. Â In 1995 Jackie Chan in Enter the Dragon was the first of these comedic action movies and that got people excited because it was the beginning of a new era for action movies. __________________________________________________________________________ Now that we have covered some of the best action movies made in the past, lets talk about some other ones that are a little less famous.  The Great Raid is an action movie in which Jackie Chan played a Chinese policeman who was ordered to hunt down a gang.   He finds the gang and he is given a gun and is given two options to make a fight go a lot more smoothly. The first is to shoot the gun but he doesn't have one, so he has to try to figure out a way to make it fly from the ground.  It is also a really funny movie and Jackie is the first actor to play a cop who is also played by Chan.  Now the second option is to just get a gun from the gang's dead bodies.  This movie wasn't quite as successful as Enter theDragon but I do think that Jackie Chan could have had a better career as a movie star than as a cop.

It begins with a conversation between two people who are, well, dating. But it turns out that they both have the same fetish, and the two of them are very much into it. The one they date is a former stripper. It doesn't go very well. She gets a tattoo and then she breaks up with him.  That's where the movie gets weird. As they argue about that and all the other things they want and are unable to have, one of them takes a bottle and breaks it over their heads. This causes the film to change its perspective, and it is so weird. When this happens, we see a flashback to when they met, and they were just two people trying to get laid. It becomes clear that these two are lovers, and now it's really creepy. , directed by Kornél Mundruczó, is also about two lovers and a bottle, but this time it's about the bottle. That's right, it is about two people's desire to get together but lack of a proper bottle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the first two minutes of this movie I was immediately excited. What is the deal? I thought. So far I really like all of the movies in this line, and I think they all have pretty decent stories. If they are good movies they will have me in to watch more. But I'm not feeling this movie. This movie is a complete disappointment. It's not a bad movie. I think I can tolerate it. I like a few of the characters and their quirks. They all interact well with each other. I love the idea behind the story and the whole idea behind being in a different place and time. What happens is that we follow our protagonist and her friends as they are caught up in a terrible situation. It has me hooked and can't wait to see what happens next. If the movie was a little more solid it could have been really good. I just don't think it is. I give this movie 4 out of 10.

But I'm glad that I watched it in the last ten years or so, and now I know why that is! I love it! It has a different tone than the original and it has a really fun character of C-3PO. In fact, I love the original so much that I was afraid to watch it again! This was a great movie that, once you find out what's going on, you'll love it too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What more can I say? I am in awe at the talent of this director, and his abilities to produce a quality film that is both exciting, entertaining, and even an excellent movie itself. It is such a pity that such talent has been wasted here, though, for I really wish the film had been in more of a theatrical release. It does a good job of introducing the cast and introducing the story in the right manner. There were a few pacing issues in the movie and a few missteps with the cinematography and it took a little bit of time to get going. I have no complaints as I think it works and I am glad it was made. I also recommend you check out some of the other reviews, especially the ones by Chris H., so that you can get a better idea of what to expect with this film. It was a solid movie that has a great cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (It's a bad movie but hey, it's a movie.)  Plot summary: A bunch of drunk jerks come to an old friend's house to celebrate the upcoming holiday, with the only person present being a sexy little old lady who lives on her own and hates all other humans. The old lady also looks kind of like the little old man. The little old woman is also a lesbian and likes to make herself cum by sucking and jerking on the old lady. Eventually the drunk jerking drunkards get too tipsy and the old girl gets a bit too old for them. So they decide to take their drunken bickering to bed and the little girl's dad shows up to try and cheer them up.  What it is about: A movie in which one woman's dad finds the pleasure of having sex with another woman's mom, and this is not a good or even a good enough reason for him to do so. As soon as he is done she's a lesbian. As bad as that may sound, the film is not really bad. There are no bad lines or terrible acting, and even the acting is pretty decent. It does suffer from the fact that the old woman looks just like a big old lady, and that the only interesting things she says are, "You're the best, you're the only one," and, "I love you so much that I can kiss my face." Also, the movie is not funny, which is a shame because it is a very well-made film. I guess that's the problem. The idea of the movie, at least the part of it that I saw, was really cool and I enjoyed it. The problem is that it's actually not that interesting. It's just a bunch of bickety drunk dudes who don't like each other, who go to a house party, and who don"t really have much to say about it. A lot of that could be blamed on the fact they were all drunk when the film was made, but it doesn't excuse the awful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Video The New Avengers: Age Of Ultron (Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack) The cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson, re-team to create Marvel's superhero team. (Photo: Marvel Studios)  The Avengers is now in theaters, but to get ready for the blockbuster sequel, Marvel Studios has revealed two cool new pieces of tech.  First, in the first of two trailers, the heroes of the Avengers (mostly played by Mark Rufflow, Chris Evans and Chris Hemstewart) come together to battle Ultron (voiced by James Spader), who threatens humanity with his creation, the sentient robot Ultronium. . The second trailer adds two new characters: the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. , aka Wanda Maximoff. 'Age Of Ultron' will have an even bigger budget than 'The Avengers,' which makes sense for the sequel to the highest grossing movie of all time, "The Avengers," which has earned over $1.5 billion at the box office. The Marvel Studios executive producer, Kevin Feige, revealed this on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on Thursday. I just read a few days ago, I think it was last week, that the studio wanted $250 million to make 'Age Of U...' That's $250,000 per character. And I'm not trying to be the one saying, 'Hey, that's a lot of money!' But, if you can tell me that you can make 'Thor' with $250 or 'Iron Man' with a fraction of the amount of money that you spent on 'Age of Ultron,' I'll buy it. This is a massive amount of dough for a studio to spend. And as Feige pointed out, the original "Age Of" was made with $40 million. So the Avengers franchise has become very profitable. And just for comparison, it was a huge hit, "Iron Man 3," which had a reported budget of $250-300 million. With a ton of sequels in the pipeline, will this keep up?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ It is the time of year when the kids are getting ready to go back to school. The Christmas decorations are all set, and the family is ready to welcome them home. Then, some jerk comes along and steals a box of presents. When a family is robbed, they come together to find the thief. This is the perfect Christmas movie to watch! It has everything you need to get into the holiday spirit. Everyone is in good spirits, and you see the spirit of the season. It's a perfect film for a winter break. The holiday atmosphere is amazing and there are no dull moments. I saw this at the Cinema Village on Christmas Eve. Everyone was happy to see each other, and even got a kick out of seeing the thief get the box. I will most definitely be watching this for Christmas this year.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* I have a hard time finding movies I don't enjoy; that's pretty much my thing. In fact, I might have a problem in that I find myself having a hard on for a movie all the time, but it's usually something really out there like, say, Alien: Covenant. So I'm quite happy with this film in my book. The film itself is an intense, terrifying, heart wrenching and absolutely beautiful take on what might happen in the future. It's not just the fact that it's a good film, it's how it's shot, the visual style, the direction by Neill Blomkamp and even the acting; Blomkammer is easily among the best of his generation (and I don.t care who his inspirations were). If you're looking for a sci-fi horror film, this one is for you. It might be a little slow, but this is no slacker, and it definitely goes out of its way to make sure you're aware of the dangers. It also does some interesting things that I wish were done a bit more with more films like this. The final battle with the alien is pretty great, and the way in which they bring it to life in some rather interesting ways is also very fun. It is hard to know where it will go, but the thing about The Counselor is that it wants to explore these themes as much as it can; and it succeeds. It just might not be the best Alien film, but what it does offer up is one hell of a film. I'd still recommend it to anyone, especially those who can look past the fact it's not as good as Prometheus.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The only way I could review this film would be to compare it to a well-made film, but, that would be too much like comparing apples and oranges. This movie is so much more." - Rob Dyrdek " This is the movie to watch before you see Star Wars: Episode VII. It's a solid, fun and well-acted film that will definitely take you back to when you were a kid and just wanted to watch a Star Wars movie. It might not have the depth and scale of the prequels, but it will still be a great time at the movies." - David S. Collins " It's the kind of movie that you see on television and say, 'Hey, that's Star Wars!'" - Dave Kehr The film is directed by Irvin Kershner, the man behind such great films as Armageddon (1998), The Stunt Man (1983) and Die Hard (1988). Kershner is the son of late legendary filmmaker George. He has since gone on to direct films such as The Fugitive (1996), and The Magnificent Seven (2014). For me, this is a great film. You'll be entertained by the funny and entertaining dialogue. The special effects are well done, and there's a decent amount of action. There's also some great music, such as "Sister Mary" by George Harrison and "Jedi Rocks" by The White Stripes. A great film to watch at a kid's birthday party, this one is definitely a great addition to the Star Wars collection. The only problem I have with this film is that I would have loved to have seen the prequel trilogy before this one. The prequel movies were much better than this, although Star Wars is no doubt a brilliant series that deserves to be enjoyed. A must have for every Star Wars fan. I think that the only downside I can see to this film (in addition to being more than 4 years old) is that it's a bit rough around the edges, especially when the characters are introduced. They're all kind of over the top and in a way kind of dumb. Some of the dialogue may also be a little cringe worthy. All in all, this film was a great fun time and a great way to see some of the classic characters from Star Wars. If you're a fan of the Star War films, this would be a must see! A really fun film that had some of my

She later takes the law into her own hands in a violent shootout with the police but then goes on to make some friends and become a hero for the small town that needs heroes and the only way to do that is to learn how to shoot a gun. I liked the story of this movie but it felt very forced to me. "Lily's Angel" does not have a lot going for it. The cinematography is average and the plot lacks anything else that I like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hilarious, funny, and incredibly engaging, It Follows is a heart wrenching look at a young girl's coming-of-age. The story follows Hannah (Mackenzie Foy), a girl who is just out of high school, when she is approached by a man who tells her she has been chosen to become a "torture woman" who will perform sexual acts on strangers. This is all part of the plan, as the men want to test Hannah's abilities and use her as a "bionic woman" to make money. This turns out to be a terrible plan as Hannah discovers she is not only attracted to men, but that she is actually in love with them. A story that is so moving, I can only hope that a director will make another such film. Watch It Followed now on Amazon Instant Video I think this film is very well-made, but it was a little hard to get into at times. The plot was rather convoluted at times, so I had a little trouble following along. I suppose that is a good thing as I felt like the film got more complex the more I read into it. I found the pacing of the film to be quite uneven as it kept picking up pace and backtracking a bit. This was not helped by the poor voice acting, with some parts, like the murder of the father, not being heard. Also, I found myself being confused a few times as to what the storyline was. I think that these two things would be very hard to deal with if they were to be addressed in any sort of way in the final product. Watch This Movie This is a short film directed by Adam O'Donnell. It is a documentary that explores the history of the life of the legendary rock band Kiss. The film includes interviews with band members, as well as footage from the band's career, which is extensive. The movie is very interesting in the way it documents the band and the era they live in. The production values of the movie are top notch. It features well-shot and well-edited scenes that show the band in their prime, as they are performing at stadiums, arenas and stadiums.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A masterpiece!" "The worst thing in the world! No matter what, it will stay in my memory, I can never forget. I want to tell that to my daughter. I can't tell her to not play it, because I wish she would be scared in her heart." - The film is definitely a disturbing piece of work.  I personally didn't understand it too well until I watched a short video explaining how it works.  The movie does give some insight into the film making process and the concept, which was the basis of the film.  However, I couldn't get into it and I didn't enjoy it as much as I was supposed to.  It would take much more effort than it is, to understand it, and I felt the story would end before it really began, which wasn't much of a film for me, even though the concept and story were very good.  So, I won't spoil anything, but I will say it was definitely not worth my time, in my opinion.  - "Haunting! A true horror film...a perfect example of a masterful piece!" I give the movie a 4.5, because it was entertaining enough, and a creepy movie, but nothing for me.  4 out of 5  I have read reviews stating that it was a "Horror/Spooky Film", and I guess that was right.  But this is not a horror film in the traditional sense, or a ghost story, or an anthology.  This is an un-explained film of some kind, and it is very different from the standard zombie/horror genre.  In this movie you are supposed to enjoy the mystery, because you don't know what is going to happen.  And of course, because there is not any answers... It is a film about a man who decides to take a trip on a small, old houseboat, when a huge storm hits... I don't like when people say that there are no horror films made now.  Many of the films that are popular today are sequels or remakes of popular films, and some of them are very similar to the old horror film. I am not a huge fan of zombie/monster movies, so I am glad that I didn�t like this. If you like horror films, I recommend that you keep an eye on "The Cabin in the Woods" movie.

However, it is a wonderful story that makes me think of the many good things that happened in the world in the last several years. The characters in this series are just fantastic. They are the perfect combination of the good and the bad. There is a slight change of tone in this story, but I do not find it to be that difficult to follow. I have a feeling that this may be the final season. I really would like to see more of the characters, but the time has come to close the series. It was wonderful to watch this series and I look forward to the last episode. As always, the plot was very interesting and well thought out. The music was excellent as well. I would give this series a 7/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am so happy to have gotten my hands on this one. It's the story of a couple who try to sell a mansion in a town overrun by the undead. The story is told through a series of vignettes, mostly one-scene vignette-esque scenes of the main character trying to sell the home. One of the things I like about the art is that most of the people and locations have a very strong style and even though it is not particularly unique, it does capture the feel of the setting and atmosphere of the plot. My only real gripe with the art are the way the ghosts move. In the first act they are shown to move at a more glacial pace. Later on they move at the pace of walking. Not all is as bad as this. Some of the ghosts have nice and creepy designs and they all move at just the right pace to have a sense of movement. But I can only find two scenes that really did it for me. I won't ruin the rest of the movie, it's not bad or anything like that. I guess I could say it was kinda forgettable and then I would have to add that it's a little slow for a zombie film. But that's just my opinion. The story is kinda forgetable but there are some decent characters and some really cool moments. If you like zombie movies, and even if you don't you should go watch this. It'll make you smile.

It has everything I love about the Star Wars universe: action, spectacle, characters, and a very touching ending.  It has a strong story, which gives it a real sense of hope, and there is no better action scene than when the First Order destroys the Death Star. This movie does not suffer from the usual mistakes that are found in most sequels, it manages to maintain the feeling of wonder, and I recommend that you experience this with an open mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What We Do In The Shadows" is a dark, disturbing and unsettling film that focuses on a group of homeless men who have been dumped into a house in New Orleans where a family of vampires resides. The family is completely unaware of the men's existence and they are eventually killed. In the morning, the father of one of the dead vampires is discovered and taken in for questioning. What follows is a brutal scene of torture and killing as the police and the police chief attempt to find the person responsible for the murders. It is disturbing in the extreme and very well made.  It is hard to not watch this film without thinking about how this film relates to the homeless men in New York City, New Orleans and even our own community.  It is always nice to see people working on something outside of the typical genre they are known for.    If you've never seen " What We Do " in New Yorkes or are a horror film aficionado then I highly recommend you give it a go.  It is definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The World's End was the most entertaining, heartfelt and heartfelt of the summer's big budget blockbusters. It's a heartwarming, beautiful, and uplifting story about two people who find a sense of purpose in life. It was a joy to watch and a delight to see Heath Ledger as the greatest movie star of our time, and Bill Murray as a great supporting actor."  –  Entertainment Weekly "We are living in a Golden Age of Sci-Fi."  –  The Guardian "There are no bad movie villains, only bad movie heroes." –  Roger Ebert "It's a wonderful blend of comedy, romance, music and a little bit of terror, set to a gorgeous score. It has an edge that will make you laugh and cry at the same time, as it reminds you of a lost summer." —   New York Daily News "Walking Dead director Greg Nicotero is at the helm of this tale of two lovers who have it all — money, a loving marriage, and two kids in tow. A movie about love and life, The World's Ended is a raucous, thrilling and funny love letter to summer." 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It is an awesome story about a small boy who has a strong sense of right from wrong. It is the most interesting thing I have read in a long time. Thank you so much. Read all my reviews to learn more about me and my writing. Thanks!  An interesting read: _____________________________________  "The boy who lived in a small room with no room for his body and a window for his face and a door for his heart was so different from the other boys who lived nearby, he felt as if his skin was different, his heart a different color, and his soul a different shape. He had no desire to get dirty, so when the other children played at being naughty, he sat quietly, watching and playing his own game." --B. D. Purdy, "The Boy Who Lived Alone, Alone," New Yorker Magazine, July 30, 1961, p. 75  You've got to hand it to Purdy--the boy who lives alone, alone, and plays his own games is actually quite a character. At the age of 14, B.D. Puddifoot finds himself living in a room with a little television. At 14. Who wouldn't? But something happens to the boy's self-image when he discovers he has a TV. Purdypoot is not just any boy--he's an alien who somehow got here with no human contact at all. What's even stranger, his very presence seems to change the little room where he lives--a little boy in a little room seems to have a lot of potential, and so do the other characters in this story.  Purdypoots' room is small and cluttered--so much so that one would imagine it would be a bit of a mess. But Purdy doesn't just have a room--he has an entire world of books, music, games, and toys for him and his toys to enjoy. There is even a TV for when he and his sister are bored or need to keep busy.  the boy who is alone is also an adult, although he only seems to be a kid at the beginning. His parents died when he was very young, leaving him on his own. He doesn't know how he got here, nor does he know the purpose of his arrival here--or why he has no family. Poodypoot doesn't even know he's an extraterrestrial, nor that he is a boy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lonely Island is a well made and well acted movie that is easy to watch.  The music, acting, and writing are all top notch. I have never laughed as hard as I did the first time I saw this movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I have never been a big fan of the cult classic The Shawshank Redemption, but I enjoyed the movie. So why did I not give this a higher rating? Well, I think the main reason is that I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that it was going to be a crime drama, but the main character didn't sound like anyone I was familiar with.  I had a hard time getting a handle on this guy, but once I did I found the story was good.  I think I liked that this movie didn't take place in prison, but more like the local prison.   It was still a good film.                      - Rating:  - Movie:   4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________ I loved this movie. I got it on VOD and it only cost $9.99. It came out in 2010 and its still a good one. It is the story of an African American family living in a small town. They are a good family, they love and care for each other, they know they are going to die one day. It's a heartwarming movie about love and heartbreak and a father raising a son in a harsh world. _____________ ____________ _________________ It is a beautiful movie, with a very sad ending. This is one of those films that you can watch for a while without it ever getting old. It does not have the same shock value as something like "The Hunger Games" but it is very emotionally raw and a good way to spend a day. __________________ _______________ ___________________ It's the third in the "Django" trilogy. I saw the first two in theaters. I loved them but the third one just made me cry. I think it's a great movie. It shows a family that is close but can be very distant with each other. They do have a love that cannot be expressed in words but it manifests itself in the way they carry on. They love each other and they know it. _________________________________________ ______________________ I love the music of this movie so much. It reminds me a lot of the classic movies from the 60's that I used to love. It gets better with each viewing. It can be a little difficult to sit through for the first time but the more I do it, the better it gets. The best part is that there's music all the time and you can just go along for the ride. ______________________________ ____________________ ______________ "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" is a great film but it doesn't really qualify as a horror. Yes, there's blood and there's nudity and there are people screaming but they're not gory. They have the right atmosphere but I don't feel a "killer in a suit" vibe. The film could probably be considered a western but the story is not about killing the good guys. It takes place over a few days in New Mexico and they're the good guy. I would have liked to see some more blood in this film. ____ | _____________________ _______________________ It's another "The Godfather" type movie. A couple of cro

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg. As you know, he made an amazing movie called E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which is a sci-fi comedy about an alien who comes to earth and stays. I am not a sci fi fan at all, I am more into the paranormal and that kind of thing. However, I did watch that movie, and it had an amazing plot and great characters. I loved watching the movie because the alien would say something every now and again. For example, when the alien sees his girlfriend who is sitting in the front of his car, he says "Hey, I'm home!" The alien has never seen a girl before, but he was able to tell she was pretty, and a girl who knows he is an alien! Afterward, he would go to see a movie with his alien friends and it was hilarious. I thought the alien was a very good role. If you are a fan of Spielberg, you would enjoy this movie. _________ I loved Steven Spielberg's E. T. The Extra-terrestrial! It's an amazing sci- fi comedy. The alien is pretty good and is able to say some really great lines! I love that this is a funny movie and I am always looking forward to the new sci- fis! The characters were great. __________________ I love Steven Spielberg! I thought that E.t was a cool movie, but my favorite part was when the aliens see the alien's girlfriend! I always like a good "dinner with friends" movie. E. The extra-terrestrials is a cool science fiction comedy. I enjoyed it. ___________________________ It was a lot of fun to watch this movie and a very funny movie to watch. I would definitely recommend it. I will definitely watch the sequel. I didn't think that the aliens were all that good, but other then that, I thought it was a fun movie. I recommend it to Steven Spielberg fans. I found it to be a good sci- fiction comedy, but not a great one. I did like it. This movie does a great job of being funny! This is a very fast paced movie, with a good plot. I like the characters, although not all are well developed. I wish that the movie was longer, but it would have to be one of the best movies of the year.  I found this movie to be funny, but the aliens didn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Hair' is a fun, fast paced thriller.  It's definitely the best part of the movie.   Although it's pretty much a police procedural from beginning to end, it's a little more than that.  The movie is a little dark at times but there's a nice mix of funny and sad moments.  I highly recommend 'Hair'.    'Dance with Me' is about a young man named Sam (Riley Keough) who has recently met a girl named Liza (Tina Fey) at the local dance hall.  Sam and Liza get to talking and they start dancing and bonding.  When Sam goes to his new house, he and Lissa (Jessica Walter) decide to go down to the basement for some alone time.  It's a very dark movie with a very cool soundtrack.  I highly recommend it.  (7.5/10)

If you are looking for a family movie to bring the kids to watch you must see this one!

The action was pretty good, but it wasn't that great. The characters are very good, except for Judge Dredd. He has the worst acting of all the judges and some of them are kind of stupid. There is no bad parts in the movie, but there are some good parts, but some of the parts aren't that funny or clever.  I give Dredd 3.5 out of 5 stars.

My wife and I watched it at the same time and we had to watch it together. We were laughing hard through most of the film.I was pretty impressed by the acting. Many of the characters in this film are likeable and you can't help but like them. There was one little actor that was very annoying, but I will not mention his name. The only thing I dislike about this film is the ending. It did not come out as expected. However, as I watched the movie, the ending was better than what I expected. It really is what I would call a twist ending, but it was really worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really a good, old-fashioned, western movie! There were just so many laughs and good dialogue between the two heroes. Even though the movie was set in the early 1930's, it still has the old-style of the movies like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood.      I really enjoyed the story of these two young men as they tried to do good for the people they were helping and also for themselves.   The first half of the movie is the good guys trying to get rid of their enemy. We also get to see a good guy (Henry) and bad guys in this battle. I think that one of my favorite parts of the story was when Henry finally gets rid of the bad guys, and they all run away (they are all good guys)! That's when the movie starts to pick up again with Henry trying to find the good guy.  Finally, we get to meet John Wayne, so I'm sure people who enjoy John Wayne movies will enjoy this movie!   " The Gunfight at the OK Corral" is one of those classic western movies and is also a good watch. It is really hard to find a bad thing about this movie. It's just a good old fashioned western that I loved and watched over and over again!   
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ My Review of "Mister Nice Guy" by Mark Kermode, Movieguide (The Movie Guide Book of Horror and Suspense) "MISTER NICE GUY" (1973) by Mark Smith  There's a good bit of psychological realism in "M.N.G." The main character, Mark (Kermode), is an English gentleman with a mild imagination who finds himself living alone with his cat. While his cat (named Mister Friendly) is certainly friendly, he is also, in his own way, a bit odd. The story deals with the problems of living together when the owner is a bit off the grid and tends to make a beeline for the bathroom when Mark is around. It is a short, sweet and fun movie that is worth seeing.  Movieguide describes the film as follows:   This is a simple but effective tale about two people who, in the midst of a very bad breakup, have a friendly chat that eventually turns to sex.   The story is told from the perspective of Mister Nice Guy, who is a retired newspaperman in his 50s who has recently moved into a small house in a quiet suburban neighbourhood. One night he and his wife, Mimi, go out to a local pub and a man enters who claims to be a detective. He asks if they can spare a pint of ale. Mister Nice guy offers to get some of his wife's favourite beer, but it's so cold and the beer tastes funny he can't drink it and goes back inside. While sitting on the sofa he is hit over the head with an axe by a woman with whom he has no relationship. The woman and her brother steal the axe, take Mister Niceguy's keys and hide him under a bed in the spare bedroom. The man who has hit Mister NiceGuy comes back into the pub and, in an extremely awkward, almost indecent fashion, asks Mimi if she can lend him the key to their house. It isn't long before the two discover that the man is the detective, Tom, and they soon fall in love. However, the police are determined to catch the woman who has stolen the axe. Mimi tries to make the most of the situation and offers to keep Mister Niceguys cat as a pet. The cat soon becomes the focus of their relationship, with Mimi and Mister Nice guys trying to get her to change her ways. Eventually, Micky gets him a pet and,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I don't think there are any movies that make me cry like this one does. This movie has some amazing moments, and I honestly do not know how to describe them. It makes me feel such sadness in the first few minutes. It then becomes a movie that makes me laugh at how messed up everything is. And it's not even just the main character. This entire movie is a testament to the power of friendship and how a group of people can do almost anything to help one another. I cannot wait for the next movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ I watched this for the first time last night at 11:00pm at the local cinema (a new IMAX), a nice movie about a little girl who has to go to a special class where there are three of them to learn about how to talk to people. That's all it is. What's interesting is that it has this theme about how we are all different and that we can make new friends. I know, I know… it's just an animated cartoon, but it's still really good.  Trent:  My mom likes this one, because it is really cute, and also because of the three girls. I didn't like it when I was younger, and I still don't. However, I have seen it a few times now, and it does get better with time. I think that the film is great to watch with your kid. If you have a young child, you might want to give this one a try because it's really cute. I'm sure the first two scenes I saw were the worst I have ever seen in any film, but at the end of the film, there's a little something about the whole film. This film has a good theme and there are some good characters.  and  The two I most enjoyed were the girl (the only girl I could relate to) who is shy and has to learn how to be more outgoing, and the little boy who is very shy and wants to change himself. Overall, the film was okay, I just didn't find it that interesting, and my daughter was probably just bored with it because she was trying to do something with her friends. There are better films that are much better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Review: I'm not an expert by any means, but I'd call this a solid action movie with some strong character development. As a long time fan of the original movie, I was glad to see this take on it. In fact, the original has a few things in common with this one, but in a different way. This is a movie that tries to have fun and has a sense of humor, but also tries to portray a serious and realistic setting. And like the original, the main character is a mercenary, and he is a pretty good one! I think if you like this sort of thing, you'll probably like this, although not to the same degree as the original. I'd rate it a solid 8 out of 10!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It is a good film, but the way it is presented, there are no elements that make it a truly great film. _________ This film does not have the depth that could have been added to it by adding the more popular elements, like the relationship between the leads. They both were wonderful, but I'm not sure that they were able to have more of the same. _________________ I'm going to leave this review as is, because it's so bad, that it is good. __________________________ I know that a lot of people don't like horror, but it is one of my favorite genres.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  1) The Exorcist - Robert Englund's performance as the demonic possession is beyond anything else I've seen.  2) The Sixth Sense - John Barry's performance was so good that it left the viewer wanting more. , 2/28/96  I am so grateful that I have the privilege to read your reviews! I am a regular reader of a lot of your reviews. I always find them very interesting, and often insightful. I was particularly excited to read that one of your top five movies was 'The Exorcism' which was released in 1986. I thought it was so exciting to find out that my favorite movie was made in the same year as one of my favorites movies. It made me even more excited when I discovered that it was in the "Top Five." I found it amazing and inspiring. I am very lucky that I can watch this movie on a regular basis. I have always been in the habit of going to the local video store to watch a movie on the big screen on week nights, which is why I came to read a review of this movie. This movie is so different from anything else that I've ever seen. I love that it is not so much a story about a haunted house as it is a story that a young man has a dream of a house in which he meets a beautiful young woman. The film begins with the young man's nightmare in which his family is tormented by a demonic spirit that has the ability to appear as a little girl. The scene that stands out to me is when the young woman appears and disappears, and then reappears as a different version of herself. She tells the young couple that she has been trying to take him and get him to come with her for some reason, but they don't take her seriously. I also really like the idea that the house that the young boy enters into is not a haunted place at all. It is just a home where a young couple lives. The idea that a home can be so much more than it first seems is a beautiful concept that can be explored in any number of ways. I think that the story of "The Exocet" was a perfect story to introduce audiences to a genre that was very new to most people's minds, and to also introduce the concept of a "ghost" to those people who were very skeptical of the existence of the supernatural. The script itself was quite a piece of work, and the performance

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I sat in a theater to watch "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" in New Orleans' Cajundome on January 8, 2015. We've been to other places and I've seen some movies. I was nervous to sit through this, not because of the acting or direction, but because of my general opinion of the American "big" film industry. I've always thought that the American film industry needs to get out of their comfort zone and start producing some good movies that are not based on comic books or video games. My husband and his family really enjoyed the movie. What I liked: The acting. I love a good spy movie, and it seems like the Spy Kids are all about spies. The kids are the spies. My only qualm was the "babysitter" character (although it didn't really matter). This is a great movie with all the right things to make me want to sit down and watch it again. The plot. They go to a house with a secret hideout and find the Spy Kid. They then discover he has a bomb. They try to blow up the whole place, but it does not work, and the Spy kid gets to live. The spy kids meet back up with their parents (except the spy kid's parents are the Spykid's father and mother), who send the spy kids on a mission to get the bomb from a scientist. They meet the doctor, who is a little creep. However, there is also the girl who likes to wear high heels. Her name is Charlotte. Overall, I thought this was a great spy film. It had the right amount of humor for a kids movie, but at the same time, the kid characters had some good moments. I thought it was a good thriller and the ending was perfect. I would give it an 8/10. Read full review: "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy!" The Spy Kids play hide and seek with the Doctor. "That was great," I said to my husband. He was not as enthusiastic. This was the second movie he had seen about the Spy kids. Well, it's not really their first. They have a number of older films they've done. They did a movie called "The Spy Who Dumped Me," and a movie with the name "The Kids in the Hall" about a bunch of kids who are spies. We

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. __________. _______________________. The story in which a woman is forced to stay inside with her dead husband's body, the story is told in flashbacks that depict how the wife is going to have to live without her husband, with the aid of the help of two of her sisters-in-law who try to convince her that living without her spouse is her only chance of living happily and the only reason why she remains alive-as well as the man she was with before her husband's death. A tragic movie that never reveals the reason why the woman has to be inside with the body of her husband. What we know is that the wife doesn't want to have sex with her husband and that's why she's inside. There is an interesting point where the wife has a dream that her husband is alive and she tells her sisters. The sister who has been doing her job in the house tells the wife that her brother is in the hospital and the wife leaves the house with her sisters, who all try to force the wife to go back to her husband because she is dead inside. They want her to get back in the bed with her husb (as you see, a person is not a body). The next morning, the wife wakes up alone in the room of the husband's dead body and she looks around and thinks what have I done to be alive. The wife decides to stay at her brother's hospital and then she has a bad dream where she sees her husband alive and they kiss and have sex, but there's something wrong with her. It's like she sees an evil presence that prevents them from having sex and then the woman goes into her sleep. The next day, she wakes up and when she wakes the husband is dead. The sisters start to find out who killed her husband but they never figured it out till the end of the movie. I can't say that this is a good romantic movie. It was a very tragic movie which shows the women's pain and their need for help but at the same time it also shows the need for love and affection. I am not sure if this is the right movie for everyone, but if you're looking for a movie to watch, give this one a shot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let me tell you about my day with this movie.   I got up at like 8 am in order to watch it and it was already 2:30-3:00 in the afternoon.  It was really cold out and it really didn't help that it rained for the most part during this movie so I was pretty upset.  We watched this movie about 4 times in a row because it was so well done.  I really liked it because it's just funny and has a lot of humor in it.  The story is really simple.  In this movie a guy named George is driving a truck when he runs over a baby.  Then he goes to the hospital and tries to get a hospital card and has to deal with this whole weird situation and all of the people there.  He ends up getting the card and goes to a bar and has the best night of his life.  But the best thing about the movie is the art direction.  They make it look like a very cool bar and when we see people in the background they look like they are really there. I think you should try out the sequel, the guy in the tank top is a really good friend!

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- **LITTLE RED BALL** (2001) **Release Date** October 8th, 2001 (UK) The Red Ball is a great flick about the rise and fall of a small gang of Russian-Canadian drug dealers. It's a really good movie and, at a few different points, I would have happily given it 5 stars. However, I was given it 1 star for an obvious reason. I felt it didn't need more than 5 stars, because I'm not sure why it was given 3 stars in the first place. If I was forced to give it a 1 star because I think it's a good flick, I wouldn't have been all that upset. I mean, I get that it was made for less than $6 million. I also get that they didn't have much money to spare and that they had to make a couple of cuts for budget reasons. That doesn't take away from it, however. The Red ball is a nice film, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good film about the drug world. It makes a few changes to the source material, but they're minor and the movie keeps the basic story intact. I think the problem with the film is the acting, though. At times, it's quite great. Like in the beginning when the gang are driving to get a supply of heroin, or the scenes when they're in their car discussing the plans for the upcoming operation. At other times, though, there is some pretty bad acting. It also, somewhat ironically, is the movie's weakest element. There is little to no action, which is probably for the best. It would have been a real waste of money for the gang to have to travel in a convoy. The gang's plan is good, but the ending is pretty terrible. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. It just means you may want to wait until the Blu-ray, which will come out next year, to get your fix. The ending is disappointing but entertaining, though I know that will probably not be everyone's cup of tea. It is, however, worth a watch.  Rated: Rated PG for some violent and disturbing images. I recommend this for the mature viewers only.  The Redball is a crime movie directed by Aleksandr Bazhenov, starring Alexander Ivanov, Andrei Kulagin, and Aleksander Khloponin. It stars a group of street-smart Russian gangsters who

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** The Movie ******** It's a pretty cool movie and it's one of those movies you watch just because of the name of the person who made it. I'm still thinking about the way I felt when I was first going to see it. It's not the kind of movie that you'd think would have a lot of staying power, and it is so different from the other movies in the series. It has the whole "babysitting" part, which I wasn't sure about at first. I mean, I was already in love with the characters, but I always thought that "kidnapping" would get old really fast and it would get a bit repetitive. But this movie makes it work. It is so strange and has an unusual tone. It reminds me a lot more of a cult movie from the 90s or 00s. There are a lot similarities to the "Amaranthe" series and it doesn't get old at all. I had to re-watch this one more than once because of that. The acting was great all around. The characters were really well written and there were a lot on screen. Even though it was kind of a long time since I'd seen the previous movie, I thought I got more out of it. Now it's back on my favorites list. I can't wait for "Eternal Blue." It's kind of like the "Kidnapping of Ed Wood" with an older female lead. It'll be a fun one to watch. It takes the "Et tu Brute?" line and makes it a great line. I think that's kind a brilliant thing to do. It took the concept and the tone of the first movie and made it even better. I'll have to wait for the Blu Ray to really see what it's all about. I love this movie and I'm so glad I watched it, even though it is over ten years old now. The only thing is, I have to rewatch it twice to really get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a great movie, but it is not terrible either. The plot is not original, but the execution is. It has the typical action sequences, but at the same time it has some interesting twists and turns. The characters are not original either, but their characterizations are believable. And the soundtrack is good. The film does have a few issues, and it is more a problem with the camera. There are a lot of cutaways. And sometimes it can seem like the camera isn't even filming. The acting is not great, either, as the characters are very two-dimensional, with no real depth. It would be a good effort, however, to make the actors seem more like real people and less like stereotypes. Overall, though, the film is a decent effort, and if you enjoy action and not too much drama, it might appeal to you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The story of Howl was a little different than other horror movies on this list, in that the film's story is largely left as an afterthought in the story, with its themes of self-reliance, personal growth, and personal responsibility all appearing much more prominently in subsequent parts of the film. This allows the movie to continue its exploration of themes of friendship, family, self-sacrifice, and moral philosophy without being bogged down by the necessity of focusing so much on the story. Howl is a fantastic horror movie, in my opinion, and easily deserves every penny it's got in this category.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The best, and worst, movie I have ever seen is "Lets Have A Crawl". What is so good about it is the performances. I am a huge fan of David Carradine. I have seen him in almost every horror movie he has appeared in, and "Lies" is no exception. David Carrigan is fantastic and delivers a performance that is equal parts comedic, and dramatic. Carradene's character is one that is constantly trying to gain control over the situation that he finds himself in. From the start of the movie, we can see he has a very hard on for his fiance and will do anything for her. The scene where the fiance is trying to break the news of his death to her family is very moving, and makes for a great scene to watch. The other main character who we follow is the daughter of the girl Carradin broke up with. We also see the mother in her daughter's room as the daughter tries to get her to stop crying and come down off the drug. What is really scary is that this movie takes place in the beginning of the year and as the story goes, things are starting to get pretty bleak. It's amazing that this film, which is about a man trying to deal with the death of his fiance, is at all frightening. The ending of the film, in which Carradines character takes a shot, is a bit too perfect for a movie that starts off so dark. But, you should give it a go, because you should never judge a book by its cover!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     My mom is my best friend. I'm not sure what her favorite movie is. She can tell you exactly when the next movie is, she loves it when I watch her watch it. She has also been a very helpful sounding board on my opinions of movies.   A man tries to find out where he is and who his parents are. He has no idea. A friend of his wife is at the hospital and they are talking about his father. A man is trying to figure out what his family was up to on his birthday. A father has a secret and someone is trying and trying but can't find it out.   "My dad is the man that got me in trouble for playing in the snow." A father is angry that his mother doesn't love him anymore.   the movie is very good. The movie is all about the dads and their life. The main character is a boy named John who is the son of a widowed woman that lived her life with her daughters, she raised her three sons in the same manner. It seems that she was not happy until her youngest son was born. Now she is raising her new son John to be the man she never had. John is very young and his mom is not sure if she has what it takes to love him. She wants to take him to the movies with her but can not afford it. I think this is a very well done movie. John seems like the type of person that would get in trouble if he was a teenager so I thought it would be nice to see him at such a young age. I liked the way the father tries to figure things out as he looks at the family life that he has grown up in. It was a nice touch to have it all set up and explained so well. A good little movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know it's not a very good movie, but I enjoyed the way it was made. The main character was just an average guy who had a bad day, and a good day ended with him getting a gun from his father. It was very realistic and it wasn't like it was just a typical gun battle film. I liked it because of how realistic it was. Also, it had a nice little twist at the end and a happy ending. I would have liked to see more of that twist.  One last thing to add: I didn't like the way the final scene ended. It felt very cheap and made me feel cheated. Not because of the twist, because I was already in the dark. But because of what the movie was about. The ending just felt too rushed and didn't really add anything new to the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wolverine:  "I believe he will get the job done." -- A group of kids, watching the news, come upon a news segment with Wolverine being tortured in prison for a crime he didn't commit. The kids go to help him but end up running into a madman. Wolverine is being attacked by a demon which is trying to feed off of him. The demon attacks Wolverine, and the other kids. This happens until the other teens, knowing that the demon was attacking Wolverine and the children, decided to help Wolverine. The kids all help Wolverine kill the demon, and Wolverine is then able to kill the madman who attacked him.   The next day the other children all thank Wolverine for helping them. Wolverine then meets up with the rest of the X-Men. Wolverine has to face off against some of the greatest villains in the world. This includes Magneto, Professor X and Cyclops. Wolverine defeats most of them with ease, but a little boy who had been trapped in a dark dimension. The boy was able to escape after seeing Wolverine face off with his demons, so Wolverine was happy for the boy. This also had the same effect on the demon. Wolverine also defeats a very angry Magneto. Afterward, Wolverine meets with the other X-men for the first time, since the school is being closed. He tells them that he will be taking a vacation from the team, so they will be his team to take when he gets back from his vacation. The next day, Wolverine finds a little girl, who has been attacked by the demons in the school. He takes her to the hospital to be treated. After the girl is healed, she has a dream. In the dream, she wakes up and goes back to her life at school. Wolverine tells the other boy that he had a good dream, but that he needs to go to his next destination. The little boy tells Wolverine that the destination is not where he was going when he had his dream, and that Wolverine has not been there in a long time. Wolverine replies that he has always been there, and now he is going there, but it is not always the place he was expecting. He then leaves and starts his vacation with the team.  In the movie Wolverine is always shown fighting with a weapon. There are many weapons that he uses in the movie, including a sword, mace, shotgun and even a machine gun. In this movie, Wolverine uses a k

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is not a good film at all, not even close. This film is a mess and I hate every second of it. I will tell you the story, which it is not worth knowing. This movie is about a bunch of people who are going to the beach and the girls that are going along for the ride. The film begins with the girls in their bathing suits on the beach, laughing and enjoying themselves. But the man and his friends who have been waiting for them all day arrive to steal the beach. The beach is being stolen because it contains an ancient artifact that is worth much more money than what it was taken for. These guys are all super bad and the best part of this movie is the group of kids who are always chasing them down and trying to steal what they are stealing. The girls are not very interested in any of this and when they get their swimsuits off it seems like they are going out of their way to look pretty so that they can be good looking to their man. The man is very good looking and the movie gives us plenty of opportunities to see him looking pretty in his swimming costume. The movie never explains who these people are and the only reason why the girls are even at the beach is to see the guys. They only get in trouble because of what they see the group doing to the artifacts and why they are doing it is never explained. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open throughout the entire film. At one point it actually became a little too dark. There are other things that didn't work out as well. The music is really bad and all of the characters that we get to see are not in the best of situations. There was just too much going on with the story for me to really enjoy it. This was a waste of time and I hated this movie. It is sad that it is actually released, but I will not be watching this one.

The village is being razed to the ground because of a nuclear power plant. While her husband is away, the villagers are all murdered by the plant. So, she goes back to save him and he's not coming back either. I thought this was the most interesting and well-written movie I've seen all year. There were a few plot holes, but I didn't care about them since they were obvious. I liked it, I hope they don't do it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen the last of the movie "Taken". It has been released in the U.S. several times and will be released in Europe. This is the second time I have watched this movie and it remains one of the best films I have ever seen. I have no idea how the makers of the film could not have known that the director of this film, Michael Mann would become famous for his other films. The film is based on the story of two men who attempt to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy man but they end up getting caught in a vicious car chase that involves the cops and the mob. Michael Mann is the director. He is no longer working on "Takes" and now is working on the much better film "Heat" (1995). As always, I am not a fan of the thriller genre. It does have a certain charm but I have never been able to take my eyes off the screen during the entire film. I will have to give a positive report about this movie just in case someone was wondering what the movie was like.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Times  is a really interesting film and an interesting tale of the history of war.  It also has some great action sequences that are actually quite enjoyable.  I don't know if the title is accurate or not.   While this film focuses more on the time period during the WWI, it is quite interesting to watch it also discuss the later times and war in general.   It is also interesting to see the relationship between two soldiers, both of whom are friends.   The film is not without faults though.  The acting is very inconsistent.  One of the best parts of the film was the relationship of these two soldiers.  I thought their dialogue was very realistic.   The ending also has an odd ending to it, which may have been the result of the editing.   However the film has plenty of action and a great plot.  My only real problem with the film is that it was made in the 1970's and it is really dated in some parts.  There are some scenes in the film that are not too much of a stretch from today, but others are so dated that it would be hard to watch the film today.  Overall the film should be watched by anyone interested in WWI era history.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Dear Ms. Tannenbaum I saw this movie last week for the first time. It really struck me as "a really good movie", i.e. it has good story, characters and acting. The action scene is actually quite good. As I said, I am not a big action movie fan, and this movie was something very fresh. In fact it seems that this movie is something of a new genre, and since I saw it I can't see a genre in it that I haven't seen before. The dialogue is just the same as the movie "Batman" but in a much better movie and much more effective. The story is really very good too. There are some really interesting characters, and the dialogue is very clever. I did not find it all that easy to follow all the events in the movie, but after you do get to the end, you will realize how good the film is. I think that this is a really good action movie. I wish that I had known this before the movie came out. But I also hope that there will be a movie in the future, that will use the same story, but better, for the next generation. Thank you.

[ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up! - Anime Review By: daniel_m - Date: July 27, 2011 Rating: Date: June 23, 2011 June 23: 53.00  The only review I could find of this anime, and it was from someone who had watched it back when it was on television.    It was a fun little slice-of-life anime that I enjoyed. The story is a little silly at times but that isn't what the anime was about. It is about a bunch of friends who have just started playing a game called "pick up" and are trying to get their friend Takashi to join. However, after Takashi joins and all their friends get sucked into the game as well, the anime turns into a weird, strange story about what happens to people as they grow up as individuals as well as their relationships.   The artwork, I don't think anyone will mind, was good. The character designs were simple enough but they weren't bland and they didn't look out of place or have any bland designs.   a little on the old side in terms of animation, but I wasn't complaining. The soundtrack was a good amount of music that fit the characters and the story.  ....  This anime is kind of a "fun-if-you-like-being-crazy" anime. It has a lot going on and it will either get you laughing or having a few episodes of your head spinning, but it never feels too deep.  , I can't imagine what the story was like when it first aired. It doesn't feel as fun as it did when I was young and it has some issues to work through, but the characters are fun to watch and there is more to the story than it may seem at first.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  This is a good little thriller with a simple premise. This is the story of John A. (played by the great David Keith) a retired military man who goes to the remote town of Oak Tree in search of the man who murdered his brother. John, a well spoken man, knows he is going to the wrong place. He has a friend, Bill (played with great charisma by the late Robert Culp), who goes out there with him. Both are convinced that they are going to find the real killer. So when the two start to walk along the shoreline they are caught in a storm. When the storm subsides, the two are not seen for several hours. Finally, John sees them, but is unable to locate them. A search is launched. A fisherman is discovered alive, but still missing his crew. John and Bill go back to the town with the aid of an FBI agent, who is able to find John at the beach. When Bill is questioned John says he does not know Bill, and Bill says he cannot remember. John is brought in to speak to the Sheriff who tells him he believes he knows who killed Bill. John says they must get back to town, and it is a deal. The sheriff hands him a gun and tells him not to harm Bill. They drive off to the woods. When they arrive at the house John sees the house. It is deserted, and is obviously a vacation home. They check out the yard and find a dead deer in the garage. John goes to a nearby shed and finds the key to the garage, the same one Bill had been in, and the key for the house is missing. The Sheriff tells him they think someone went into the house and took the house key and the gun, and took off. Bill says it must have been someone the family knew. Later, John goes back and finds a note from the Sheriff which says there has been a break-in. A burglar had taken out the bed and bedding, and removed all the paintings. The burglar left a note. The note read, "Sorry I got caught. I'm in a bad mood. It's not that I was mean or anything, I was just upset. You guys are dead." John goes outside the house to get the note. Inside the house he sees the dead body of a woman, and a dead body in the kitchen. He goes over to find a note on the kitchen table reading, "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars" is a great franchise. There is no better villain than Darth Vader. He is, without question, the best, most villainous of all the characters in the Star Wars universe. Darth Vader is the ultimate antihero: he is cruel, he is selfish, and he is evil. However, he's a hero to the good people of the galaxy, because he knows that the Jedi are corrupt. He's a true villain, who is so unlike any of his fellow villains that I can't even begin to name them all. The Emperor is an equally evil character. His "evil" is so complete that it's almost beyond belief. If I could go on and on about the myriad ways this film was flawed, the script was bad, the music was bad. Just a lot of bad things. However - and this is something I didn't realize at the time - this is one of the greatest films of all time. If you are looking for a great movie and want to see the best Star Wars movie ever made, "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" is the best film that has ever been made. "Star wars" was the first great space adventure and the first film that would change the way movies were made for many years to come. I will still be watching it as long as I live. The original release of "Star war" was a commercial flop, but when it was released on VHS, the film went into the Guinness Book of World Records as the most successful video rental. If "Star War" is not a masterpiece, I don't know what is. "The Phantom Menas" is probably the most disappointing "Star WAR" film out there, but I still rate it a great 7/10. If this film is your favorite movie, it will probably change your life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* There is something about watching a movie with a huge cast that doesn't have to work together for 90 minutes that is very satisfying. There is one part in this movie that really stands out for me. As the bad guys go about their business, there is a small moment where you see a girl getting ready to put on some makeup before she goes into the room to see what the movie is all about. It's just a very cute and funny scene that does a great job of bringing the movie to life. As for the rest of the movie, it is a classic film from a very great director. There are a few things that are a bit more obscure that the other parts, but the general idea of the plot can be seen through the movie itself. The acting is very strong as they try to get a good mix of action and comedy as much as they can, with a few really great performances by the characters. It is the one movie that I am still amazed at all of the actors in the movie. The musical score was a bit slow at times, but it is nothing to be concerned with. The editing and special effects are not always perfect, but they're usually very good and work well with the story. I can't really say anything bad about this movie as it is very well made and funny. **************************** *** Review by Tom Gannon *** I was really surprised when I saw this movie. I was expecting it to be a total flop. So what I think they're trying to do is get the audience to laugh and cheer along the way. They give the audience some pretty hard action scenes, and they have some really great one-liners as the bad guy has to do more than he should to get his way, but that's just what the script is asking for. The whole movie plays off of the tension of the two characters trying to find a way out of the situation they're in. The funny bit in the beginning is what gets me and I have found it to work even though the audience doesn't quite know what is going on. It feels like a classic comedy where there is an overbearing, over-protective father and a young girl who just wants to live in a world that is different from what her mother and father expects. It does feel a little bit cliche in the way that they do it, but I was able to laugh as they do and the audience was a lot less worried about the movie than I expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one has no faults to be honest, but I have a really hard time with its direction and acting and the story is a bit of a mess. I think it was really important to give the audience some real character depth in this film, so there were quite a few of them. There is one character that really comes off as a real human being in this one, and it's a lot of fun to watch him interact with the people around him. It also features some really interesting animation for its time, and there are a lot more shots like that in this movie than in any of the other animated films that were made at the time. In a nutshell, this is the best animated movie I have ever seen in my life, which is not too surprising, given that it was directed by an animator who went on to direct the very good Little Shop of Horrors (and who is still in charge of the art and animation in the show today). I'm not really sure what the problem with The Incredibles is, but if you like this one then check out Little Shop to end all Little Shop's.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The first half of the film follows a young boy named Michael (J.K. Simmons) who spends his days playing a video game (called, I kid you not, "Star Trek: TNG"). After a while, however, Michael gets a phone call. He answers it and finds that his mother, Elizabeth (Rachel Weisz), is suffering from the same ailment as his father, Michael. Elizabeth is told that she will die within a matter of days. She goes into the hospital for the last time, with Michael in tow. While at the hospital, she sees the young woman Michael's mother is going to marry. This man is, unfortunately, a total douchebag. He tells Elizabeth that he is leaving and that she has to leave with him. After this, Michael is forced to return to his computer game, with his mother. It is the end of the movie; Michael is a man now, and so is his mother (with the exception of the first 10 minutes of the last act).   As a Star Trek movie, the plot is kind of interesting. Michael, after all, is one of the original crew members from "Star Wars" and a couple of episodes into his video game career, he has become a captain. The film presents him as a cool guy, a bit cocky. He uses the video game to get ahead in life and to feel good about himself. He makes a few friends who help him with his computer gaming exploits. It's not until he gets his first promotion that he starts to really think of himself as one of Star Trek's heroes. Michael is the kind of guy who would not leave the game unless someone else was in his place. This may seem a little out of character, but it works for me.   After this, we see Michael's life begin to change and he is faced with a problem. After a brief, but enjoyable trip through the game (which is, of course, the movie), Michael finds a missing tape in his house and discovers that Elizabeth has been killed. She is being eaten by some aliens called the Kree and Michael must find a way to save her (and maybe himself). This is a really cool part of the story and it is executed well. The movie shows the aliens that have taken Elizabeth from her home, eating her alive. We know they are real and Michael is just a pawn in their plans. While Michael is on his quest for Elizabeth,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this one, you see a man getting off a motorcycle when he bumps into a homeless man. He tells him he can't help, and the guy tells him to look behind him as he's running out of gas. Then the next time the man is in the same place, he gets up and kicks him. I found it amusing how the guy didn't think twice about it the first time, only to turn around and kick him the second time. This film is a little more adult than the first one, and a little less amusing. It's interesting that this one was directed by a woman, and it's interesting to see more films by women. It seems like some of the best films that I can remember are from women. I also found it interesting that some people thought that the film was going to be bad because it was from Canada and was made by a Canadian. I believe that a lot of films from Canada have been bad and have just gotten less noticed. I really enjoyed this one and think it was a lot better than the second one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! Star Trek The Motion Picture (1982) was a film that would have been great in any decade. The screenplay by Gene Roddenberry and the casting of William Shatner (Captain Kirk) and Leonard Nimoy (The Doctor) had everything to be an instant classic. The special effects were top-notch (for the time) and the dialogue was very funny and insightful. Unfortunately, it was overshadowed by the "space western" style that dominated the box office and eventually would become a box office bomb. However, this is a movie with a strong cult following and should be seen by every Trekkie. If you are a fan of the original Star Trek then this movie is a must watch. It is not perfect and has some great moments but that is what makes it a classic. Read Full Review  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. It has great acting and a wonderful script. This is one of the best films to come out in 2013 and it had some strong performances. You have Will Sasso as a real nice guy who is in love with the girl he loves and who has the right amount of attitude. It was a fun, action packed movie, good comedy. There were a lot of good character changes in this film. It is a good time.  My rating: 3/5 I saw this movie last week and it was one of those movie where I just couldn't put it down. It had action packed moments and I was in love. It also had great acting with many great performances. The movie has a great theme and great action scenes. The script is well written and well done.  The acting was very good with some really good actors. I can see why they wanted to make this a sequel.  A great time with great acting, I just could not put it DOWN!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a young couple, and how they come to love the people and situations that surround them. It's a very moving movie and is a very strong statement on family. (7/10) The characters are just so well defined. I'm just glad that there are no real characters that I have to look up or even be interested in. I would love to see a few more of them, they just do so many great and heart wrenching things throughout the whole movie. I really liked all of them. I also like how they have such strong chemistry between them and their son. His mother is the only one who is really interesting, not sure what that means. He has this innocent looking smile and you want to see more of it. The movie starts out with a shot of the couple sitting in bed with the young boy in his arms. He is the child of the girl. They are sitting by the fire, with the boy's mother standing in front of it, and they are kissing each other. The father then comes into the room and kisses his son and they kiss. We then see the mother and the father getting ready to go to sleep. The mom gets her things and they make a very sexy dinner while they enjoy the night. The camera then focuses on the man in the middle who is talking to his mother, with no one else present. She is smiling and loving the night, and it's great to see that she was able to enjoy the moment with her husband. As the man is talking with his wife, he is talking about the great man he sees her with. She has this young man who is also her lover. The man is also thinking about what he is going to say to her. They have a wonderful conversation, and then after talking for a while, he gets up, turns on the light and walks out. In the next scene we see the man with his mother. He's about to go out on the town when he sees the woman he loved with before. She turns around and he walks into the bedroom. They kiss and it is all over as the camera focuses on a new scene. This movie isn't perfect, the acting could be better, and some of the plot line is a bit confusing. It just goes so fast, and sometimes it can get a bit hard to follow along. However, it is an amazing film and I enjoyed it so much. If you like a good love story

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The action movie starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg is a big disappointment, a little of the same old, and a little more. The plot was predictable, the characters generic, the jokes all over the place. It doesn't even have the grace to avoid being stupid, especially in Ferrell's role as a wannabe rock star with no real skills to speak of. Wahlburg is the better actor, but he's mostly just a pretty face. The worst part is that the film, which could have been so much more, is so overstuffed with badness that it never goes away. It's also worth noting that this isn't Ferrell at his worst, he still has a good sense of comedy, and has enough of his goofy, goofy side that this may work better if the actors were a little better than they are.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gravity is an intense film that requires you to watch it in 3D.  While not for everyone, this is the perfect movie to show off your 3D glasses if you don't have them.   The movie is full of thrills and action.  The film is based on a book by Arthur C. Clarke, in which astronauts are stranded on an alien planet and they must find a way to leave their doomed world.  An alien named Georgi (George Clooney) was in a race against time and is unable to leave.  He is aided by an alien named Rhea (Jodie Foster), who has an intense relationship with her dog, Koba (Richard Dreyfuss), who is a giant pug.  Rhea will help you escape, as she is the only one who can get you back to Earth.  If you think you don.  I loved the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ You know what? I had forgotten just how damn good these guys were.  They were always so darned good.   This movie was no different, if you're a film buff like me (and even if you aren't), you will be so blown away by this movie.  The story isn't particularly original (like most of the classics) but that doesn't detract from the incredible performances by all the main characters, especially Don Johnson.  Just look at that guy, I'm seriously having a hard time believing it.  Don Johnson is always a welcome sight in any movie, he gives you a sense of warmth and humor, but the way he's given a chance to actually act is something else entirely.  While I think his character is an important one to this film, I would like to point out that Don is also the best thing about this film.  His chemistry with Gene Hackman is a thing of beauty and the story is just as good, but I have to say that the film is really about Don Johnson's performance and this movie is a good testament to that.  To add to that, you also have the amazing work of Michael J. Fox as the young Don's father and his interactions with the older Don.  Michael J, like Don is one of the nicest guys you can ask for and it is refreshing to see someone like him on screen.  It is interesting to note that Michael J did not return to the lead of the next two films (he only worked with Hackman once) but he was a great addition and I wish I could've seen him in the later ones.  As good as the movie is, the supporting cast is equally as strong and it has a few big names to go with it, such as Sam Neill, Edward James Olmos, George Kennedy and even Dennis Hopper.  I have very mixed feelings about the ending of the film but it is a wonderful way to close a movie that is about a young man's journey into the world of crime.  If you enjoyed this movie, then I recommend you watch any of the previous two films.  After watching all of them, I am so happy that I watched this movie and if you've seen the previous films then you'll also have a fun time with this one.  Now onto the rating!    3/5 Stars

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The last time I saw a comedy that wasn't the last stand-up, I was at a very awkward dinner with a couple I hadn't met yet and my family. They had just come from a movie and had spent most of the night sitting at the bar, waiting for their turn. Their friends had finished the movie, and they had to settle for a bottle of wine. But the best part was that when they finally did get their turn, it was to be the only act that I could see. As the story went, my cousin had a terrible day at school. She didn't want to go back to class, and she didn't feel like taking the test. So she went to the bar and started talking to a guy. The guy listened, gave a smile, and told her to keep it together. I don't remember anything that happened, but my cousin ended up drinking with him. He gave her a bottle and said, "I'll be back next Friday." I couldn't believe it. My cousin had just been through so much. She just needed to be supported. She was only a few months shy of her 17th birthday, and this guy who had just taken her back home was showing her that she was better off than she had been the day before. I'd love to go see that movie again. So there I was, at my sister's house, trying to figure out a plan for my own wedding. We had a wedding rehearsal, but I had no idea what to wear. And I'd never really had to do it. The day before, I had a good friend of mine ask if he could dress me. I figured I would show up with my mom or something, because it seemed to me that everyone else was there because of their significant other. But when I got there, there was only me, my mother, and my two best friends. And they looked like shit. It wasn't very nice. It was a little more professional, but still not so good. I wanted to throw up, but figured I had time, so I went home. When I got home, I looked at the clothes in my closet. I needed something to wear for my big day, but nothing that wasn,t too big, or I would have to spend the whole night at a wedding that no one wanted to be a part of. I was in the shower when I saw something in the mirror. I knew what I had to

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The final battle between Captain America and the Falcon is one of the more fun, well thought out, and satisfying scenes of the film.  I was quite impressed at how well the film kept the story of Captain America: Civil War focused. Not once did I feel like this movie got lost in a sea of character development. Every aspect of the movie felt connected to the previous one, and everything felt like a necessary part of the overall story. The Russo Brothers were able to find some wonderful moments that worked perfectly with the story. One such example was when they revealed that Steve Rogers is a computer and his mind and emotions are stored as programs on a computer, and the program is called the "cog." The film then went back to Steve's story from Captain America #1 and showed how his personal programming created the events of Civil War. The story itself is pretty simple, but it is pretty awesome to see.

It ends so abruptly that I don't understand what happened between this girl and her boyfriend. I had hoped that she would go out with him, but I don a sense that was impossible. If you look closely, you can see that the girlfriend is holding on to him very tightly, but the boyfriend is also holding her tightly. I don' t think either was in the right frame of mind to make such a big commitment. Also, the girlfriend's reaction to the death of her mother is very abrupt. It's hard to accept when you know that her mother had been her best friend. This is a film that I thought was very well written, especially the writing. It didn't have as many happy endings as it could have, but that is something I am not complaining about. It was a really good movie. I recommend it to anyone."

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Apr 9, 2017 9:46 AM  10. It's a miracle (2004)   This is a little bit of trivia: It's actually the sixth installment of the original "Twin Peaks." (It's been on the air since 1992.)  You might have seen the first two series on ABC-TV, and the show didn't receive quite the critical praise it deserved: Some fans felt the first season was a bit too wan. But the following three seasons were, for better or worse, a bit more ambitious, and some critics came to regard them as masterpieces.  The show's creators, Mark Frost and David Lynch, weren't satisfied with the last two seasons: They wanted to make the show bigger and bigger, with larger stakes, more dark and sinister themes and even more sex.  the third season was set up to be the last of the show, but then David Lynch announced he would be taking a break from the show. The show has been in limbo ever since, but this episode shows that the show still has life in it, and it's one of the most entertaining and creepy episodes of the entire series.  (It also happens to be one of David Lynch's best.) The final scene shows a small group of FBI agents standing around the FBI office in Twin Peaks, waiting for Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn). Audrey's been dead a long time, and they have no idea what she was doing in the Black Lodge. It seems she didn't leave any fingerprints behind, either, but she wasn't gone for long.  in a final scene set at the Black Hotel in a hotel room, a woman calls out for Audrey. She's been there for hours and hours. She even wears the same outfit as Audrey. One of the agents is convinced that she's still alive, while the other two think she's dead. And they don't think she was in the hotel for any of those hours. But there are some very unusual facts in this scene. First, when someone is called "a woman," they usually mean "dead." (I could argue the meaning of "whore" here, but you get the point.) Second, the woman in the room is dressed in a woman's suit with a bustle. It turns out that Audrey was killed after her body was found in the same

The concept is one of a man who becomes a "God" after having a heart transplant, which he is very happy about. However, as time goes on, he is haunted by strange visions and his life is slowly coming to an end.  One day, he has a dream where he is talking to his son and the son is talking about the "ghosts" that live in their house, and he is scared to death. Â After that, the "God", is sent to the house of his wife and two sons, and the two sons are now going through the same stuff that he is.  The movie did well in my eyes. It did what it wanted to do, it had a pretty good story and characters, I was not too crazy about the final fight, but it wasn't that bad, overall.   This movie is pretty good in general, it is not really a good horror film, but I do think it was a nice enough way to go on the list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I did watch the movie, and it was great! A beautiful romance. I was not a fan of the movie's first act, though. I loved the movie so much it ruined me and I thought the first half was really dull and boring. However, it didn't take away from the romance at all, so I guess it's ok for you to be turned off by it. I guess you might have been hoping for a more "adult" or "adult-like" movie, but they have done a very good job of creating a beautiful, magical story, with an interesting plot. I do think the ending could be better, but the movie is really fun. I am really glad I watched it, even though I think the first hour and a half was a bit tedious. I think you could also take away some lessons from the first film. The first film was a little boring, too. I also don't know how they are going to continue the story and they will have to come up with something more interesting. It was nice to see a "kid-friendly" movie. But, like the first movie, it's also nice to have some action in a romantic movie. The music was awesome, too, by the way. So, there you go. A very well made romantic movie, full of great characters, lots of romance, a good ending, and beautiful music.  Reviewed by: AussieMama on 8/13/2015  No Was this review helpful to you? Yes  What happened to the kids? _____________ This is another Disney movie with some very young characters. There are two kids (the kids in this one) who are kidnapped by a vampire who is a very angry vampire. He says he is in search of "the boy" so he can drink his blood. He has a very pretty, young girl who looks like a younger version of Disney's Rapunzel. He makes them fight and drink their blood to get his own blood and make him immortal. They say a lot of things to each other, some good, some bad, but their little group is always fighting and arguing. It's very silly, but it's always entertaining. The movie has a funny love story (between the vampire and the girl) between two very different characters. The last third of the film takes a dark turn for the worst, but that was probably inevitable with these kids and the vampire. The vampire is in fact

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dawn of the Dead is an impressive zombie movie, a smart one.  It has an ending that is quite satisfying, but I would've liked to see more of the zombies.    The acting is terrific as well, especially from the cast.    Zombies!  Dawn is the sequel to the 1984 cult classic Dawn of the Living Dead, which spawned two sequels and one TV mini series.  The zombie apocalypse is upon us. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of  G.I. Joe: Retaliation, but I had heard nothing but good things. This movie stars the incredible and amazing actor-he plays one of the main characters called Jack O'Neill, and he does a great job in the movie. The movie tells the story of the G.i. Joe team (which is comprised of O'Neal, and two other main characters) as they take on a number of different bad guys to destroy the super-computer called Cobra. As G.P.O.R. (The Protector of the Realm) it is his job to monitor all the satellites around the globe and find the bad guys who are plotting against the human race. So the plot is pretty simple, O'Neil goes off to stop some of the baddies, but as it turns out he is getting into some serious trouble as his father is captured, but luckily his friend is there to save him. There is also a young boy named Moya who is O' Neal's brother and he has been in a pretty bad condition since the end of the movie so it makes for some pretty great scenes. I really liked this movie because it was a pretty fun movie to watch with a lot of action. There are a couple of other characters that you can meet but the movie mainly focuses on O'neill and O'Neals other team mates and his father. The film does an amazing job in making it seem like Jack O's team just goes into an abandoned factory in California and they get to the top, but I don't really think that is really true. The reason they are able to get all of the way to the computer is because of a scientist named Professor MacNeil, who has built a super-weapon called an XM-20 Megagun, which basically is an extremely powerful ray gun. So when O'Oll's team takes down this enemy, they do so by using the Megaguns to blow up the bad guy's satellites. I am a fan of this movie, and the characters are great. If you haven't seen it yet, I would really recommend it. It's pretty good, it's not the best action movie ever made, but it does its job well and has great characters that are well designed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********   As much as I loved this movie, it has a lot of flaws. I don't like movies that are boring or too long or that have no action. I also think that a story can't just be told without any suspense or tension. I felt that this movie was kind of dull and too short, especially when you compare it to the entire movie of 'The Bourne Identity'. This movie does have its moments though, which were some very well done scenes that really showed some depth to the characters and their relationship.   I'm not a fan of action movies, especially ones that have a long run time, and I had to pause this movie quite a few times to catch my breath and stop watching so I could have my drink or something to eat. The action was so fast paced and the fighting so flashy that I couldn't see where everything was going to happen or how they were going to survive. The ending was also very anticlimactic.   and the ending... well, that's the only way I can describe it without giving away too much of the story. It seemed a bit pointless and out of place in the movie but maybe that's just my personal taste in movies.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Giver is one of those great films, so many times that I can't believe it.  And when I think that I haven't seen it in so long, I think this might be one of the most memorable films of the past 15 years.  I just love that the film was written as it was, as a love story.  It's a film that is filled with love and passion, and that is what makes it so perfect.  The Giver will leave you teary-eyed, but you won't be left feeling guilty.  If there is a downside to the film, it's that it is incredibly short, but that's what makes the film so great.  Plus, the cast all comes together really well, and the acting is top-notch.  There is so much heart in this film, and it will leave an impact on you, no matter what the genre is.  I give The Givers an A.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pitch Perfect  was a very fun movie that was very funny. I recommend it if you are a fan of comedy. It also won the comedy award at the 2012 South by Southwest Film Festival. The movie was well-acted by Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Hailee Steinfeld and their characters were all very fun and very likable. If you haven't seen the movie you should! It is a movie that has made it's way to my Top 10 list of the greatest films of all time. It is funny, well-written, and even better, I think, than the original. I really enjoyed this movie. It was a funny movie that had the right ingredients for a great movie. This is definitely one that I would suggest watching again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I loved it. I don't usually like Sci Fi movies but this one is really good. The acting is great. The story is interesting. The plot twists are exciting. I liked that it kept on changing the story line and didn't end the movie with the story being the same. I would recommend this to anyone who is a sci fi fan. It is a great way to end the summer. If you have never heard of this one and you are a fan of Sci Fi this is the movie for you. I will be watching it again. Great job on making a Sci Fi Movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What to say... ___________ A superbly constructed tale, this film offers not just a classic horror story, but a tale that will make you gasp in terror, laugh out loud and shake with laughter at the same time. As if a pair of filmmakers with a love of horror and a love for making movies were having a love affair. You'll see blood and gore that will give you chills; you'll see some good acting and some great acting that will also give you a good laugh. _________ What didn't work for me... _____________________ A couple of things didn't quite work for my stomach or my psyche - the film was a lot too long at times, especially when it was showing the monster in the background; and I think the opening of the film, with that creepy lady in a white dress - it looked a bit too much like the opening scene of Bride of Frankenstein. _________________ Overall... _____________________________________________ My rating for the film - ____________ 8/10 (out of 10) The Horror of Frankenstein (1931) is the tale of a beautiful young woman, Mary Shelley, who is possessed by an ancient, evil spirit and is forced to do horrific acts of unspeakable horror. The film was directed by Victor Sjöström who, despite being born in 1906 in Sweden, has a very old-fashioned way of making movies - with a lot of traditional, hand-painted effects - and that is very cool and very beautiful to watch. But I do wish that he had been able to put a little more thought into the film; the idea of Mary and the ghost are pretty intriguing and it's hard to get too involved with them. However, I still give this a 8/5 because the film has a lot going for it, even though it may lack some of the pizzazz of some of its contemporaries. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and you won't want to put it down!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this case, I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. The story has a real emotional pull to it, with one character's struggle to see a doctor because her mother is dying and the other's struggles to move forward in life as a widow after losing her husband to war. I really liked the story. I liked the acting. I was entertained and moved. It made me feel something. A lot of people don't like this movie and say it's too dark and depressing. That's all I'm going to say about that, for the most part. If you can handle a darker movie with a lot of sadness in it and if you enjoy watching movies with a good story, then go watch this one. It's a good film. If the characters aren't your thing, then you probably won't like it. I enjoyed it, but I also understand people's feeling on that matter.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a very small number of films which I like to go back and see over and over again, and that would be a good example of one of these films.  My friends and I are watching this one on an iPad, and I can assure you that this is a film I want to see again, preferably on a big screen.  This film is a fascinating look at the lives of a large number of people who have the misfortune to come to America during the early years of the 20th century.  The movie is an homage to all the classic Hollywood melodramas, with an emphasis on the melodrama, and an emphasis very little on the acting.     The acting is top notch, but that isn't the point.  This film is about a group of people trying to survive, with the help of others, and with the aid of nature, as well.  They're trying to find a way to survive in the vast unknown.  There are plenty of scenes where one or the other of the characters has to take action or stop, which makes for interesting viewing.  You'll want to go with your friends to this one, just to relive those days of the American Wild West.  I highly recommend it. So that is it for now, I hope you've enjoyed it, and are going to give this a watch when you have some time to kill.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie was very well made with great actors and a terrific script. The movie is not for everyone. If you like movies with a story that you will have to read to get, this is for you. For those who want to see some action, there is a little but with great fight scenes. A little short, but it will be very worth it when it is over. I am still not sure how the movie would have been better if the ending had not been ruined by the fact that all the girls are now married. I think that was a big mistake. ___________ I watched the movie on DVD and I love it. My only problem is that the DVD is so poor that the picture has faded so badly, it almost looks like it was filmed on 8mm. I wonder if it was because it was a Christmas special or maybe they did not care about the quality on DVD. I like the movie even less now than I did when I watched it when I was a kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Don't hate me for liking a movie you hate. And it's not for the faint of heart or brain, it is the same as what a horror movie is: a horror. And if you hate horror movies you shouldn't watch horror movies. Not that I like horror movies and would be in the audience for the next one. But it's the same reason why I'm not going to go to the next world war movies: I'm a pacifist. What kind of horror does this? A horror movie about the horror of being alive. So I'm gonna hate it, but don't be shocked if you feel the same way, because it's just like when you are alive. And then you feel like what is the worst part about this? That this is just like life? I mean, what's worse: living or dying? That's what life is. And that's just how it is. If you don't like it, that's your problem. Don't watch it. It's for real, like the movie's name: ____________________ A movie's a movie. That's all it is: an imitation of some event in life. So if you like a movie, don't let it affect you. Don't judge. Don' t judge how it's made. Just watch the movie. You don't have to like it. Don t judge the people who made it. They didn't make it just for you. And just don't judge the movie, either. Don don't just watch it for enjoyment. Watch it for the story, the acting, and the music. And don't watch other movies just because you are afraid of them: They're just movies too. You can watch them and watch them.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This is an old one, but it still holds up. This is a movie about a young boy who, while playing at a playground, accidentally sets fire to an ice cream cone, and the ensuing fire destroys the neighborhood and almost destroys him. In an attempt to help him, his father takes him to a church, where he learns that the church itself is cursed. The priest at the church has a spell on him that will make him invisible until the curse is lifted. After learning this, the boy must go through a series of trials, before finally being able to go home. The boy learns to become invisible, but he also learns to use the same technique to his advantage, as he has a sister who has been left blind and deaf by the curse. The curse is cast upon the boy's father because his daughter had been left behind by her father, and he had neglected to marry her off to the church, causing the curse to be placed on him. The plot is pretty much what you'd expect from the time period it is set in, except that the father and daughter are in their late 20s in the 50s. There are plenty of comedy parts, as the father, played by Ray Milland, and his wife, played in the movie by Shirley MacLaine, are not only old married couple, but are the parents to the boy and the daughter. The best bit of humor comes from the father trying to make up to his daughter for abandoning him. There is also a scene that involves some magic tricks, and I would love to see it, but the plot isn't too interesting. But this movie is still worth watching, especially if you're a fan of macabre humor and/or you're fond of the movie Ghostbusters. The ending is pretty ridiculous, and this movie has a lot of potential, but is a little overrated.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ஜ۩்குமோலை ூத௟௛ேரெனி అక్ముది ____హాలె ____ ౪థోీ ____.  I am a fan of horror films. I had the pleasure of seeing several films at Bollywood. I have to say that all the films that were released last year were very good. I will leave it at that and go onto the next one. ,,,, A good movie is a good place to hang your hat and enjoy watching something so fun. This is exactly what is offered by the latest film in the series 'The House of Pies', which is based on a story by Hrishikesh Hirway. The story revolves around the life of a retired police officer, who returns to his hometown in India from the United States, and begins investigating a strange incident that happened on his last day in India.   The story is one that I would like to read. It is a thriller, which takes a humorous turn. There is something about the characters and story that makes you feel good, because they are so fun to watch.  - As usual, the story is based in the life on the street and the characters who walk the same streets and have been on the same corner for decades.  ,, The plot itself is simple. It revolves around one man, a retired senior police officer who returns home to his home in India after a long stay in the US. While in India he has to find the truth behind a weird incident that took place on his final day in his home town. In the mean time he has no choice but to look after his young son and daughter. - The acting is stellar. The roles are well chosen and the actors are always funny and energetic. This film is a joy to watch as well as listen to.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A beautiful, dark and powerful story about a family, two boys and a little girl. It has a beautiful ending" "It was very well done and made me laugh, cry and feel deeply sad. This film should be shown all over the world. It's a very good movie. I think it's a wonderful, powerful story, that shows us the true meaning of being an human being, in our own way, and in the way our parents expect us to." "A very beautiful story about two families and their dreams, their faith, their love, and the ways in which they go about living that dream. This is a good film." You have not watched this film, because you have not found it interesting enough.  The characters are two children who don't fit in anywhere: a middle aged white woman (Dakota Fanning), and a black boy (Ameer Abdullah), a shy boy who has a fear of spiders (I'm not making that up, seriously), but they are in love and in search for love and peace in a world that doesn't seem to understand, and is more afraid of what they are, than of what is going on inside of them.  (I do like that they are both girls, but I'm not too sure that that's important, either...)  This is not a movie for the easily offended, and I think this film is more for people who enjoy good, thought provoking stories with an underlying message.  It is a story about our desire for happiness, and how the things we care about are often very different from what we think they are.

They did a good job of creating all of the suspense and emotion for a film that can't get much more suspenseful and emotional than this. I'm so glad I finally saw this because I've been so eager to see the whole movie because it's just so beautifully crafted and well acted. My favorite part about this is the performance by Tom Hanks.

You feel like it's a perfect story. You can really imagine Tom Hulce as the mad scientist with such perfect timing and facial expressions. It's a movie that is full of passion, romance, and love for music and theater. And it's also just a very fun movie. But in a way, it's like one of those movies that I feel guilty for loving.  We all know that the best films are all those that take chances and break new ground. And the thing about "The Greatest" that I just feel guilty about is the fact that it's an absolute mess. In fact, it could be the worst movie of all time. There's almost nothing to recommend it. It doesn't have anything to say. It could be one of the worst movies ever made. ....  * * * *  Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ "It's a miracle that the audience at the Paramount Theater in Philadelphia got out of their seats after that film was over and stayed through the credits," says The Hollywood Reporter's Peter Debruge. He praises the work of a writer/director who does everything in his power to make his characters human. A lot of people might think the only way a movie like this could happen in America would be for the studio to be so confident in its film that it has to spend millions of dollars to keep the lights on. But that's not what happened here. Director Andrew Bujalski's "The Descendants" does have a lot of Hollywood money behind it. Its budget was $3.5 million. So if you want a film like this with the kind of special effects and set-pieces that make big budget pictures look like a kid's birthday party, you'll have to be willing to shell out. Bujal's script is good and the acting is good, but "The Consumables" just isn't quite there. (Kudos to Bujalo for not pulling any punches.) It's no wonder that the film has been compared to "The Big Lebowski," but "Consumables," the director's version, is just as bizarre as that film. The movie stars two high school students who are going to the local diner to order a hamburger and fries and a soda. When the cashier asks which one has which chili, the kid with the black hair says, "Don't ask that kind of question in a restaurant!" The kid who's got blonde hair and glasses takes out a knife, but a girl who looks like a college professor intervenes and calls the cops. It's up to the two students, who just happen to be playing the game "Cops and Robbers," to solve the crime, and a few more people show up, including a cop and a couple of teenagers playing "T-ball." In the end, the only one who seems to be guilty is the kid who got the chili. (It would be better if the cop had killed him, but you know the film is not about that.) The movie is filled with so many plot twists, it's hard to keep track. I was very pleased to find the ending, which leaves the characters in their cars after the cop car passes and the movie ends with "We've got no place to go, no-one to blame but ourselves."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" (1988) is one of the greatest movies of all time. The humor is original, the characters are believable and the script is smart, clever and well-executed. The story is funny, the movie is funny and everyone in the movie can actually be counted on. Even the ending has some genius. All you need to know about the film is that it is really, really, hilarious. I've seen "The Big Bang Theory" about three times this year and "The Dude" once. I never understand how some people can only like one of these shows. But both of them, I think, are pretty great. I also really enjoyed the new "The Hangover Part III." And "Deadpool" is a pretty awesome movie, by the way. But "The Lebkowski" has to be my favorite. The movie is about a character named Leb, who is an idiot. He is a bad guy in a bad movie and he is played by the hilarious Steve Buscemi. In the middle of the movie he is walking down a street with his girlfriend (Kristen Wiig) when a car full of men pulls up behind him. When they start talking to Leb about why he is being so rude to women, Leb starts making this very dumb "fart noises" that you know are coming from a guy who has recently had an anal sex accident. When this happens to Steve, he just shrugs his shoulders and walks away. But he gets to talking to the next guy who gets Leb fired up. This guy says something like, "What, you think we're the dumbest ones out there?" And now Steve, the guy he has just insulted, says, "Yeah, let's prove it." And he has this really cool plan that will totally blow Leb away. It has to do with "Lebowski Fart Slams." I have no idea what "Lepowski Farts Slams" are and I can't tell you how great they are. But Steve uses them to make a very funny joke out of what is normally just a pretty annoying, pointless character joke. I am really impressed that this scene happened because it is something you don't see every day. I love how the filmmakers went above and beyond to keep the movie from getting boring. It is very fun and I don't think I will ever forget the movie for the rest of my life. The acting
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film opens on the grounds of a hotel, where a man (John Malkovich) is having a meal of roast beef and fried potatoes with his wife (Jennifer Grey). However, the next morning, after having been hit with an electric shock, Malkovich wakes up with an erection. It seems as though the couple has been having an affair with each other all this time, and she is very uncomfortable with it. Malkovich, having no choice but to leave, asks his wife how she felt about the affair. He states that she didn't do anything, so he leaves. On his way out, he sees a beautiful young girl (Holly Hunter) playing basketball with a group of girls. He stops her and asks her if she would like to come over. She says yes, and he takes her to their bedroom, where she sees the young man with her friend. She asks him why he is there, he tells her it's only to help her sleep. He then goes back to his room and, despite her requests, does not have sex with her, which causes her to cry. The next morning Malkovich comes to see his wife again, but, when he arrives, he finds out that she had been in the gym, working out. She tells him that she felt as though he had had an affair. She then tells him to leave. Later that night, the couple go to the hotel bar where Malkovich asks his old friend who is in charge of security if he has seen Malkovich. He says he has. He tells Malkovich that there are only two men with her who could be his accomplices, one is in the lobby, the other in a waiting room. He doesn't say what he means by "one". Malkovich then asks about the hotel security guard, but he tells him he has been in another elevator. He also tells Malk to stay away from the two men. At night, Malkavitch and the hotel guard go to a secluded area. They start talking and then the guard asks Malkovich if he's planning on doing anything with his girlfriend. He replies yes, the guard then gives him his personal number, then Malkovich gives the number back. The two are then seen talking in the elevator. The guard tells Malkovitch he's going to be a very busy man the next two days, before he leaves Malkavovich alone with the guard. After the elevator ride, Malk
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Did I love this movie? Yes, I loved this movie. I'm a big fan of movies about the military, and this is my favorite movie about the U.S. military. The acting is excellent, the plot twists are interesting, and it's pretty much a story about an elite group of people that is tasked with stopping a group of terrorists from killing innocent civilians. I really enjoyed it. My only gripe is the ending, which is kind of unsatisfying and a little anticlimactic. It's not the movie's fault, but I just wish that it ended in a more satisfying fashion.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ This movie doesn't have that much to do with the book. I loved the book, but this was a far better movie. The cast of characters were all different and had their own personalities, especially the bad guy. I like this movie more than the book in almost every way. The action is really well done, the special effects are very good, and the acting is just as good, if not better. There are also several little things that make this movie stand out. The characters are all likable. The special effects could be better, but it was very good. The story was okay. I liked how it was set in the future, but I couldn't connect with anyone. My brother even thought it was too much like a movie to him. I think the only reason it is this good is because it is based on the book that has the best action. I am definitely going to try to get the book and see how it is like. _____________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was my very first experience with American Horror Story. And I must admit that I was a bit worried about my first impression of it, because I didn't expect anything from it, and because it doesn't exactly make a lot of sense. I remember sitting in the theater, and just listening to the voiceover explaining what would happen when each of the murders were going to happen. So it felt like a movie that was meant to be a straight-forward mystery story, which I would like to say was a nice change of pace from a typical horror movie. It was also very funny, and had just enough horror to keep my attention for a little while, but not so much that I could tell it was a scary movie.  But it was fun, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a little mystery, and maybe some good acting.   There was also a couple of other interesting tidbits about the murders that I didn´t know before.  I have watched the show, and this is still my favorite.

It is a nice little short film, but it would have been nice to have more of a payoff at the end and maybe a second part where they visit the Goonies' house and do it from their perspective. I think that would be a better short film than the two parts that we get here.

This was a great movie to me, as I think I have a pretty good understanding of the subject matter of World War 2. I was not expecting that this movie would be as great as it was, as well as not expecting the kind of action I was given.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Good: The plot is very well-paced, the script is clear, the characters are well-developed and likable, and it's a joy to watch. The ending is satisfying as well, though if you're one of those people who really didn't like it because it ends, there's not much I can say about it that will make you like it any less. The Bad: The animation isn't very good and it definitely needs to improve in the future. Other than that, it's just a very good movie. _______________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is better than the previous one. I would like to see more of this. About the only things I didn't like about this movie: 1) I did not see the movie, but it would seem that he was not too keen on having a big action sequence in a small screen. 2) It was very strange how the guys just kept running for about 5 or 6 minutes without talking to each other. 3) When I saw it I thought this was a very entertaining movie. I liked the characters, the actors, and the style. But this is still a little short, and there were some things I would change if I were making a sequel to it. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It had some good characters, and good actors. If you like science fiction movies, check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ The film The Social Network was one of those movies that came out and changed my entire worldview. The film took the world of social networking (a new technology at that time) and turned it on its head. It showed that there is so much more than meets the eye when it comes to relationships. What was also amazing was the way the movie portrayed the people involved and the way that people used these new social tools to create their online identity. It was a movie that showed the way a "Social Network" should be. The main character, Mark Zuckerberg, showed how people are not just in it for the money. What he shows is that we can use these new tools to find meaning, create value for our lives and ourselves. The Social networking movie also showed how social networking could change the way we interact with the world around us. It shows how the power of these new devices will have a profound effect on the future of our society. If you can look past the fact that the main character is a rich guy and the main problem that he has is with women, then you will find a movie with a message that will resonate with you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I was really disappointed in this movie. I have seen a few similar movies, but this was the worst. A story about a child and her father being abducted and murdered is presented in a poorly conceived, uninspired, and unengaging way. A bad man in an ill fitting outfit comes for her, and the movie never lets her escape. She is raped, murdered, and her family kidnapped. The film tries to keep us thinking she has some kind of magical powers, but by the end of the film, it becomes very obvious she is just a poor, unfortunate child who has been betrayed by her father. Her father is a bad man who is only looking for some quick cash. When the bad man shows up and threatens her family, she lets out a scream of rage and tears, only for him to respond by kicking her in the face and choking her, before dragging her across the room. At this point, I just wanted to throw my computer across the house. At the end, she is finally let go and she and her dad are picked up by the good man and taken to an orphanage. I thought this was an extremely depressing way to end the film. I was shocked that the film had not been made in the 70's when they had the most horrifying abduction stories. So, if you want to watch a depressing movie about child molestation and death, please do yourself a favor and just stick with "The Wicker Man". - November 9, 2009Another boring, uninspiring film  Reviewer: TheSaints - favorite favorite favorite - May 17, 2009  Subject: Very sad I think this film was made because of the death of his son. I would've rather watched a more uplifting story about his son that didn't involve him being kidnapped and murdered, but I know there's no way the author's son could go through that kind of pain and have a happy ending. Very sad movie, although I suppose I'd rather watch something with more plot and actual emotion. - May the 11th, 2009Very sad  Rating: Not Recommended This movie is depressing and very unpleasant. It shows a poor father who is in love with his daughter, but after she marries another man and starts having children of her own he finds out that she is actually pregnant and she is murdered. I just don't understand why anyone would write a movie like this. I didn't like it and my mother wouldn't allow me to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________Just a couple of years ago, I found myself in an abandoned building, in a very remote area of Utah, where it was really cold, and I decided to get out and try to walk across the snow to the nearest town. I got to the building and found the only person living there, a woman who had no idea that I had wandered into her house. She told me a bit about herself, but I already knew the basics. I told her I was just passing through and I wanted to get back to town, and she said she would be happy to wait for me. I had a small bag with me so I wasn't too worried about being caught. She said to go to her house, put my stuff in her basement, and wait until the morning, and if I didn't show, she would come back and get it. We sat on the couch for a while and talked, and then she said there was a door in the back of the basement, so we opened it and went into the room. There was a man lying on his back on the floor, with a black eye, and a bloody bandage. The woman was sitting in front of him, holding his arm, and they were both drunk. She asked me if I needed anything, and it was clear to me that she wasn't going to help me, but she said to watch out for a few days, so I did. The next night, I walked across the room and looked down at him, and he seemed to be trying to get up, so of course I grabbed his arm and held it. I thought it was funny for a little while, then he seemed confused at first, and seemed to lose consciousness. I asked if he was okay, but he said he had passed out and I should go get the man. I started to get my things out, and as I was leaving, I said, "This is the last one," and she just looked at me and said, in disbelief, "Yes, it is." I went to a different room and I checked on the other man, but nobody was in the room that I was in. After the third man, the woman looked at the guy that was lying on the bed and said it looked like he was going to wake up, and started to worry that he would die on me, so she tried to grab him to get him off. I didn the man on my arm and she didn't try to pull

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "In The Name Of The Father" is a well-made and entertaining short that is well-paced. It tells a fairly standard story of a mother trying to get justice for her son who was tortured by his father and who commits suicide. However, the writing makes it seem more real and realistic by emphasizing the emotional toll that the events have had on the family, showing the gradual disintegration of relationships and making you believe that even a little bit of justice can have a great impact on a person's life. There is a bit of violence in this movie that is not exactly necessary for it to work, but it gives the movie a slightly grimy look that works well for this movie, and it is a nice touch that shows that the family is still hurting after their child's death. It is important to remember that this movie is a short, and the ending could have been stronger, but the movie itself is pretty good and well-written. _______________________________________ The second, and better, short "Stories of a Murderer" is more of a classic with the classic "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" sub-theme. It's a short and simple tale that has no real plot or big dramatic moments, but is told well with a simple narrative that never really goes off the rails. The characterisation in this film is very good, with the narrator being a very interesting character and it shows how the audience's thoughts and feelings affect the story. He talks to us about how he believes the man in the picture to be innocent, as he says he has no hard feelings towards him. The ending is a little cheesy, as the murderer admits that it was an accident and his confession was coerced, but I guess that this story is just about innocence. __________________________ The third short, "The Man Who Killed Tom Cruise" is about a man who is accused of murdering the star of the popular movie "Tom Cruise is an Angel." The man confesses to this crime in this short, as it shows that his guilt or innocence is the only thing that matters to him and that he is not willing to admit his guilt. He's quite a likable guy in this one and the end of the story is surprisingly tragic. ______________________ The fourth short, 'Sickness and Mercy' is a simple tale about a young girl who is diagnosed with leprosy. She has to move from her town to a hospital, but her

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** I had an excellent time watching The Haunting of Hill House. I am not a horror film fan (I prefer the older horror films like Carrie, The Omen, The Conjuring), but I loved the book and enjoyed the movie. The movie is a faithful adaptation of the book with very few changes. It is scary and quite scary. I enjoyed the characters in this movie the most. My favorite was Ellen. I liked how the movie kept her a bit mysterious while introducing her to us. I also liked the role that the actress, Jodie Foster, played. She portrayed a bit of an old soul and seemed like a fun lady to be around. There are not that many horror films in the late-eighties that are good enough to be considered as a solid horror film. This is one of them. I did not like the ending of the movie, but I am a bit puzzled. The ending of this movie seemed to leave the audience with more questions than answers. I would love to see a sequel that would answer those questions, and I would watch it again. **************************
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cats" is a hilarious movie, but it would probably be more of a success if it's a little more subtle.  As you may recall, two cats decide to hang out with a couple of homeless cats in a park.  The two cats are a big part of the movie, and I enjoyed the interaction they had with each other, but I wasn't sure if the movie would play a little smoother if it was a more comedic movie.  It kind of feels like the movie is trying to be a little too serious at times, but is just missing a bit of humor.  Still, the movie was very funny, and if you like cute animals then you will probably like this movie.

I don.t think the film is just a horror movie, instead it is a great movie and I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What I thought was a very well-written script, with a few moments that would be annoying in a regular drama series. The problem is, they took it to a whole new level. When I watched this series for the first time, I thought it would be one of those "the hero has no idea what he is doing" type of shows, and it wasn't. There were so many times where I felt like I was watching a scripted version of a movie; from the first episode to the final episode, there were too many times when the show did a complete 180, and became a totally different story. Now I'm not one to like a show for having a 180 degree turn in terms of quality, but when a show has the ability to change so drastically, it is a little disheartening. There are parts of this series that are very impressive and I really liked how the characters were written. It was a little disappointing to find out that this series doesn't really have a direction, other than to show a hero with no concept of how to fight, and someone else who is the perfect person to help him figure out how to do this. I think a good direction would have been the way they dealt with all the crazy characters that would appear. All the characters would have had their own personality, with some sort of purpose to the entire story. In the end, I would say that this show is enjoyable to watch for the action scenes, and the characters are all enjoyable to be around, but there are far too many scenes that make the show turn into a complete mess.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Incredible Hulk is one of those rare instances where it's not about the Hulk himself, or the world that he inhabits, but about the man who is, at his core, an average guy. He may have extraordinary abilities and a vast store of power at his disposal, but underneath he's just an ordinary guy who happens to have these amazing powers. He's a guy who's been knocked up by another guy and is struggling to find a stable role as a parent, but in the course of this he's become a bit of a legend, and his wife is now pregnant. It's his third child and he's about to have his fourth child with the love of his life, and it doesn't look like any of them will be very happy. That's the basis for the plot of this film, the relationship between Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) and Bruce Banner Jr., played by Samuel L. Jackson. These two are not just two guys on opposite sides of the street that happen to have very different skillsets and a mutual attraction. Bruce Banner's personality is a bit more out of control than normal, and as a result he tends to act out, and he has this thing where he's not happy with the people around him. He doesn't like to be told what to do, he doesn't respect authority, and that leads to a lot of misbehaviour. What he does like is being part of a team of people who help him get things done. He knows that he needs someone to stand up for him, and to be that voice of authority. And his son is the perfect person to give that voice to. Bruce is played by Mark Rylance, who's got a pretty good, if unassuming, career as an actor. He did quite a lot in film, including the great The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also did a lot as a teacher in school, most recently for the film The Perks of Being a Wallflower. His other notable film was a relatively minor part in the film that won him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, the 2011 film The Artist. He got this part in an almost purely coincidental way, while working on a small film, and I guess that's just how life works. Mark Rylances has a pretty solid, if not understated, performance as Bruce. His dialogue is a little stiff at times, but it's certainly more refined than you'd expect. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ [Plot] The film follows a detective who returns to an apartment he used to live in to find the body of a woman who was murdered over ten years earlier. He investigates the case and finds it to be the work of a serial killer. _____________________________________________________________ [Plot Summary] The story revolves around a detective whose wife was murdered by a serial murderer. He goes back to the apartment to find that the body has been moved and is now at the scene of the murder. The body is that of a pregnant woman who is found in the apartment. The detective tracks down the serial killer, a young man with a fascination with dead women and the crime scene, who seems to have moved in with his mother. It's implied that he knows the identity of the pregnant woman as well as the identity and the motive of the serial murderer, the mother of the killer. However, the detective doesn't realize that the killer is, in fact, the serial murder victim's mother, who in turn was the mother to the serial Killer. The woman has never given birth to a child and when the detective finds her in a coma after being raped by the serial Killers, she reveals she was pregnant with the serial killers son. It is presumed that this has always been true, since no child has ever been born to the woman and the mother has a history of childlessness. This sets off a series of events that forces the detective to question the motives of the woman's killer. He soon finds out that he is working on the case of a former serial killer himself. [Dialogue] This is the most enjoyable part of this film for the sake of the dialogues. The dialogue is often very witty and very humorous, but is also very violent and often bloody. The film also has a very unique way of showing a woman going into labor, which is very graphic and horrifying. The dialogues are a great way to show the character of the Detective, but they also play a large part in the characters personalities. [Cast] The cast was very good in this film. Many of the actors could have been in other movies. However the roles they play here are very different from their roles in other films. Many are comedic and it's hard to keep track of who's who. In general, the cast is very different, and that's one of the most good things about this film: it keeps the cast completely different and provides a lot of diversity. Overall, this film had a good

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Outdoors" is a great family movie that everyone should see. This is the kind of movie that gets a big smile from children and parents alike. The story follows a girl named Charlotte (Greta Gerwig) and her sister who live near a small lake in Michigan. Charlotte has an imaginary friend called a "Holly" who helps her go on many adventures. They run from bears, ride through the forest, and visit the ocean. The film is well shot and has many humorous scenes. The children have fun and enjoy the characters. All in all, a great fun movie that kids and adults will enjoy. 4.8 out of 5 "The great outdoors" is about a group of young girls that visit a small fishing pond. One of the boys accidentally breaks a fishing rod and his mother has to go fetch it for him. Charlotte's sister (Tiffany Haddish) is a budding actress in town and is looking for a job. Charlotte and her friends are able to help the girls look for jobs and make some money. Hannah Lecesne, Charlotte Leclesne and Tiffany Haddisha in "The great outside" The story takes us back to 1950's and 1960's where there is a lot of discrimination against women. Charlotte is looking to find a job and to pay her way through college. When Charlotte meets a young girl named Tina (Kristen Wiig), they start to date and become friends. Charlotte wants to move in with her but Tina is having a hard time and needs help to pay the rent. The girls decide to help Tina out and it turns out that she is a runaway from a family of rich farmers. Tina has never been to a school, has no friends and is constantly bullied.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ I like to think that all of my reviews have been on the funny/creepy side, but this one, which stars Christopher Lloyd, was really weird, and really creepy. This movie makes me feel really sad... I just wish it had been longer, though. I love the characters and their voices. I just didn't enjoy this one much. The pacing is very strange, the story is just not there... and the effects, while they are not terrible, are so... poor. I didn't really like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just saw "Jurassic World" last night. I just watched "JURASSIC WORLD" last tonight.  And I can say it without hesitation, this was a great movie. It was an awesome action flick from start to finish. It is, for my money, one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time. A great plot, an awesomely realized cast, an action-packed, exciting story...everything went perfectly into place. If you're into action movies, you've got to see this movie. If not, then...well...maybe you'll have to wait a little longer. The other thing that I liked was the great performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. The character of Claire Dearing is one I'd had a few doubts about, but she turned in a fantastic performance.  As for the movie, it is a great mix of action and adventure. It doesn't break the mold or feel out of place in any way. Everything felt fresh and new, even in the first act of the movie when the movie doesn't really start up until the middle of the action sequence. There are a few interesting moments throughout the movie that I'll get to, but in all fairness, the rest of it feels like it was made with the same kind of love that John Williams brought to the score. The music was really, really great, and I'm not saying that because of the film. If I could, I would have gotten more compliments about the score and the direction of the picture. Speaking of direction, the film is filled with a great sense of pacing. It's an amazing amount of time spent on the story, and there are some really interesting characters that you'll be able to identify with. Some of them you'll love, some you won't, and you'll still find your own way to relate. The movie also goes out of its way to show how much of a dinosaur enthusiast Owen is, even as he is battling a pack of the biggest and most terrifying creatures ever seen on a movie screen. I'm not gonna lie, the action scenes in this movie were pretty awesome. This is one of those movies that I would see on a Thursday night, just to be able watch the action again. This isn't because I was worried about any of the effects being rusty, I really didn't think that they were. I thought they were great, every one of them. The action scenes were all pretty

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie like this one is a hard thing to get done right.   But that doesn't mean the production should have been less than stellar.  It is one of the very few times that I actually liked watching this film, and it's really a shame that this one wasn't much better.   It's a story of an Irishman who decides to follow his heart instead of his conscience.   So he decides to head up to Canada, which is currently plagued by political unrest, and settle down there.  The movie is set in the late 1940s, so you get a good look at a modern-day Ireland which is still in the midst of the Great War.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ' The 'Eggers' (1994) is a wry and funny take on the traditional tale of the Eggers, from the very first minute. It's a story about the rise of a family of duck hunters in rural Maine. As they get older, the Egger family gets further and further from being a family with their own duck and chicken. ' The Eggers aren't just a bunch of good-natured, good-looking, hard-working farmers. Their family, which has been together for generations, is broken up by death and tragedy.  The main character is a duck hunter's daughter, played by Sally Field.  ' The comedy is mostly grounded in the Eggert family's struggle to adapt to their new life in the 21st century.  They're a little weird, a little mean, a lot of trouble, but they are a family and a love story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The Matrix is the best action movie ever made. So many people are saying that this is "too hard" but it is a fun movie that is just about man vs machine, nothing else. It shows the effects of a mind controlling computer with no human input. Also, its just a great, high energy, action movie. If you are a big action movie lover, or a fan of the James Bond movies, you will like this movie. This movie is so fun, I loved watching it and I wish I had a bigger screen so I could watch it over and over. My two little kids loved this too, they were having a blast in the movie. I think the best parts of the movie are, where the people in the Matrix fight off the machines and we get to see Neo's mind play out in the last fight. The ending where he turns his back and the machines just go through him with no response. It is also one of my favorite movies. I know there are many people who liked it too but it's just not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The first time I saw the film I couldn't help but think that "Jurassic Park" was just a few short years ago. Not many people know this, but Jurassic Park was originally planned to be made as a $40 million, three-hour feature-length feature (just like this film), but Universal Pictures decided to make it for $20 million and then cut the film down to $20.5 million. That's a lot of money, but it's still way too much money for a low-budget film (let alone a blockbuster film), and Universal pulled the film from theaters and the production was never again seen again. However, it was made and distributed and made many millions, and that is the most amazing part. The film's budget and the fact that it was turned into a feature-sized movie helped it survive on the big screen. I have a theory that the reason the film had a limited theatrical run (but did very well on home video) is because the production budget wasn't big enough to make the film "a $40+ million blockbuster". In the years that followed, Universal and the movie were on the verge of bankruptcy and then Universal went bankrupt again. The studio's fortunes changed and they were saved by Steven Spielberg and the deal they got with Fox meant that they would make their films for only $20-25 million (which is about what the production and marketing costs are for a feature film). As a result, Spielberg's studio was able to make a lot more money (and it became known as the "Spielberg effect"). This is where things get even more interesting. When it came time to make "Jungle Book" the "Jury" (aka the film's producers, Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg) felt it was too expensive, and wanted it made for a much smaller budget. Universal refused to do it and Fox offered to let them make the movie for $40-45 million. To make matters worse, Zemeldis decided he wanted the film to have a less ambitious budget, and even cut some of the animals in order to have the budget he wanted. At this point, Universal got angry. If the budget was too low, the movie would not have a certain "movie star" status. However the fact was that Universal made the film at a much higher budget, which was almost a hundred million dollars, which allowed for the studio to have its star-studded cast,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhere in that list of good movies, there has to be a movie I didn't like or enjoy.  It's possible I'm the only one who did, and that I have the "cinematic equivalent of a hangover."  But that's what's wrong with a movie, right?  We all have to do it sometime, no matter how hard we try to not.  This film is one of the best films I've seen in some time.    It's not quite in the same league as "Manhattan" (it has fewer laughs), but it has a great story, great acting, and a great cast.  It is the sort of movie that could only have been made if the director didn't understand why audiences were so mad at him and instead of making another comedy, made another drama.  This could be a very good film.  And for the record, I had no problem with the movie.  I had a great time. The best way to describe the plot of this movie is the best way I can put it, and it really is that simple.  In "Man of the House," I found myself very interested in the lives of two families.  They were both very similar, although not at all the same.  While the Wills were very wealthy, very much in the limelight, they had one difference, which would keep their marriage interesting for years to come.  The difference was that the Wilsons lived in the back of the house, not the front of it.  When the house was moved, the families had to move with it.   In the case of the Wiltons, they lived in an old Victorian house in the suburbs, which they loved very much.  But the house didn't have any windows that faced out on the street.  That meant they could see every part of the city as they moved.  Which meant the neighbors, with a few exceptions, had no reason to like them.  So for years, they were constantly being teased, and were sometimes afraid to come to the house because they would be teased for not being on the front porch.  Even though the Wiles were on the ground floor, they constantly felt like their house was on the outside of the world, and they didn't belong there.  Their new house had windows facing out on a side street that didn't appear on the map, so the neighbors who

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ It was the best way I could have possibly imagined getting rid of this one. After watching it, I was just like, "Oh, man. I'm done with all this torture." I think I had been in the dark about this series for about a year or so before this film even came out. It's the most ridiculous of the 'cursed' series, in that it's about a guy who loses his mind after eating a huge pile of poop and goes on a crazy, demented, drug fueled rampage, destroying a very large building in the process. It has some amazing set pieces, and is absolutely hilarious.  See more ▼ See less ▲  The Nightmare Before Christmas 4 (2018) I was not a huge fan of The Nightmare Before Halloween but I did enjoy the holiday themed episode. This one, however, did not really do it for me. It felt so forced and the movie did not have the most original concept at all. I didn't like the storyline at all either but that is just my opinion. The acting, by the way, is pretty bad at times. I think the character actors did a pretty good job at it though. The special effects are pretty much the same as the Halloween episode. It is the same boring, campy feel but I think it's pretty much perfect.  the Nightmare before christmas 4: The Nightmare before Christmas (2018), also known as the Christmas horror, was released in December 2012 to mixed reviews. It was directed by Mike Flanagan and written by David Koepp. I did not like it. The story was just too derivative, with too many obvious similarities to the classic Disney film. The animation was also very simplistic and not very entertaining. It did have some pretty good special effects though. . I loved the Christmas special, but I hated the rest of this special. The only other thing I did like is how it made fun of the Christmas specials with the Christmas tree and Santa Claus. I don't think they really meant it, but it worked very well..  . The other episodes of The Nightmares Before Christmas are also terrible. This special was a terrible film that was bad for the holidays, but if you are a big fan of the Halloween specials and Christmas movies then you'll probably still watch it. If you are not a big Halloween fan, then I would not recommend this one either. I would recommend going into it with your expectations low since this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You've seen them, you've heard them, they are in the movies! If you haven't seen the movie "Dancing on the Edge," then it's time for you to do so. A group of girls get to the end of a cliff edge in order to reach a rock climb. One by one they go down, and the last girl, Anna, comes to a sudden stop... and in a split second her whole body goes limp and she falls. The film's storyline begins and ends with her. A film that I could not be happier with and I was very excited about seeing it on opening weekend.   One of the best parts of this film is the amazing dancing! From the first scene, we see a group of young girls doing the same type of moves, and doing them perfectly. In the second and third scenes we see their choreography from different angles and at different times. These moves are done so perfectly and perfectly, that they are a lot of fun to watch.   The film takes place in the 1980's and the young girls are all wearing mini skirts, which adds to the fantasy of the film, especially since they are going to the cliff edge. The choreography of this movie is amazing!   I could watch this movie over and over.   This movie is very fun and very addictive!   If you have seen this movie, then you have to check out the dance scene that follows.   Enjoy!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Force Awakens"  is an exciting movie, one that will bring together all the Star Wars fans around the world. I have to say that this movie is very interesting, because it features a new villain called Kylo Ren, who is the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, and is now a general in the Empire. In the first movie, the main protagonist was Luke Skywalker. However, in this movie, we get to meet the youngest son of Darth Vader, Kylo, who has a different origin story. He has to go through a lot of training in order to become the leader of the new Knights of Ren. This young boy has much potential, which is why I highly recommend the movie to everyone, because of its interesting storyline. It is a nice adventure, which brings back to the classics, like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Return of the Jedi". I can see this movie being really popular among all Star Wars lovers, as it has a lot to offer.  I am an avid fan of Star Wars, and I enjoyed the new movie "The Force Awakens". The movie had a good plot with interesting characters. I like the characters, especially Luke, who was a good friend of Han. He is always fighting for the underdog and to be strong. I enjoyed Kylo too, who I think is the most interesting character in the movie. He was like a father figure for Kylo. I think he has a bright future ahead of him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate  is a fantastic example of a movie based on the best-selling novel, and is filled with many memorable scenes. It is highly effective in that it uses its source material to tell an interesting, suspenseful story in a highly effective way. It follows the story of James Mason, a man with a history of mental problems who is placed under the custody of the United States Government. The CIA sends him off to learn about the Soviet Union and to discover a way to assassinate the Soviets' new leader, Nikita Khrushchev. At first, he is reluctant to comply with the orders, even going as far as to call the U.S. "a bunch of Nazis." Unfortunately, Mason soon discovers that his "test" is more torture than learning. But after he learns a "secret" of torture that he will never learn in the CIA, he begins to love the CIA's methods, even if he wants to kill Nikita. One of the best elements of the film is that Mason's mental problems are real, and he has no idea of what he's doing. The government's mental control of him is so complete that Mason is not aware of his own physical condition. He does not realize that he is being treated as a robot, nor does he believe it himself. The way Mason is treated is one of the most effective psychological tools the film uses to make the point that Mason has no control over his own actions. The story has its twists and turns, but none are more powerful than when Mason meets his wife, Jane. The relationship between Mason and Jane is very interesting, and the film shows them living together while Mason tries to avoid being sent to the USSR, to which Jane refuses. Their relationship is based on Mason's attraction to her, and Jane's desire to see Mason go back to the U S. so she can have him back. Their story shows that love can survive torture, and that in most cases it will work. It makes one wonder if Jane would be better off without Mason. The ending, which follows the way in which Mason becomes increasingly disillusioned with the CIA as he learns more about the nature of the U C's mental manipulation, and how their actions hurt innocent people, is a powerful reminder that even with perfect intentions, the government can use violence to control the citizens.

The movie revolves around two characters who find a mysterious island in the Pacific Ocean, named 'Tiradent'. On this island they meet a tribe called the Tainos, a people who have long and dark histories that they hope to change. The movie centers around the relationship between the two characters. Although their relationship is never shown on screen, it seems to be a very loving and happy relationship, which is perfect for a romantic comedy. 'Tropical Thunder' was directed by Michael R. Roskam who is one of the most accomplished filmmakers in American cinema. It's an instant classic, and a must see for any fans of Michael Bay's 'Transformers'. The cast is fantastic, from the beautiful Taino actress Lili Simmons to the ruggedly handsome James Coburn. There is a great mix of comedy, adventure and drama in this movie, which will have people laughing and crying for hours after viewing.  It's one of those movies that will not disappoint you and is certainly worth every penny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ The "Cannonball Run" series of films has been a hit and miss affair from its inception and continues to find its way into mainstream audiences. In the 1980s, the genre, which had previously been popular with independent filmmakers, was given a huge boost when director John McTiernan's Cannonball Run, a western inspired by the "Giant Movie" comic, was released. The film, directed by McTiernnan and based on the novel The Cannonball Book by Charles Portis, took some viewers by surprise by making them feel like they were watching a fast-paced, high-stakes action film. The big attraction here was the star-studded cast, which featured John Wayne, Steve McQueen, and James Coburn as two ranchers, both with a past in the Western world, who become the most famous gunfighters in the West. The movie went on to make over $75 million at the box office. John McQuarrie's script was so inspired, he called it his "Giants movie." Unfortunately, McQuarin's film failed to gain traction with viewers at the time, and the franchise was dropped. That would change for good, however, as in 1989, another Cannonball series, The Outlaw (also directed by John McValarrie), was released and hit big in theaters. It took a while to get the hang of the gunfights and the plot, but The Outlaws proved to be a great follow up for the Cannonball Series. It was followed by The Stunt Man (another McQuary film), which also bombed. But that didn't stop Cannonball from coming back to the big screen. In 1995, The Last Ride was released, which was also directed by Johnny McQuarry and starring Steve McManus and David McCallum. This time, the franchise went on a huge run, making more than $100 million at theaters. The Outliers, which starred Billy Dee Williams and Michael Biehn and also starred Tom Sizemore, was also released in 1995. It opened to $15 million, but the film wasn't able to become a hit like the others. It would go on to be critically panned and was released in 1997. It grossed over $90 million at box offices, but was a financial disaster at the domestic box office as well. A few years later, The Cannon Ball Killer was released as a direct-to-video film in 1996

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Good: I think I'll just go ahead and say it, but I loved this movie. The cinematography is top notch. The music is excellent. And the acting is good, especially from everyone involved. Even the villains are good. The bad: The main thing I found to be the negative was the ending. It just seemed rushed. I'm not sure why it ended like that. The second half was good, but not great. I did have a couple good moments. But that's my opinion. Overall, I thought it was a good time. I liked it a lot. ___________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say that this is a good film with some great scenes. My only real problem is that I think the last act should have been left out. The main story is not bad and there are some great acting scenes. But I would have liked to see more of the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Passionate movie made in true French style. If you want to see beautiful French-made movies, this is a must watch.  If you like French movies, and if you love French film-makers, you will love this film.  French film is like art - it is a passion of the director and writer. There are some scenes in the film that are quite funny, but most of the time it is about a love story that is very intimate.  If you are French, then this movie will make you very happy. It will make French fans happy, as the cast and the cinematography of this film are just incredible.  This is the true French movie that is made in a traditional French style, not Hollywood style.  I am not French but I would say that French style of cinema is very French - it isn't Hollywood style, like you can expect from American movies.  It is very unique and French movies are really special.  The film was shot in three days - it's like a movie made for you by a French director who loved French movies. The French people love French movies - it gives you a feeling of French hospitality that we just can't describe.  This movie is a film that is about love, and it has its heart in the heart.  And the actors, actors - all the cast - you are so in love with the actors.  For me, the actor is the most important part of a movie. The love story is a big theme in the movie and it's one of the reasons why I loved the movie so much.  There is also a love-story between the three women in the story, who are all important.  So it's a great love-soul movie. We all know that French cinema is about great French artists and great French cinema.  In a country where there is such a large culture and many people who are born in a foreign country, you have French cinema that has very great stories, such as the movie that was made with French directors and actors. I think it's interesting to note that this movie is made with only French actors and directors - it has a French flavor, and its French style - its a kind of French film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The first time I saw this movie, I didn't care for it at all. As I read other reviews, I saw some really good things about this movie. It seems to me that, in order to make an honest movie, it is necessary to do three things: 1) Show a little human story; 2) Show some good characters; 3) Show strong character drama. With the first two points, it does a great job of doing those things, especially in this story line, with the little stories. However, when it comes to the characters, I felt that there was no chemistry or real relationship between the characters. So much so that the story line seems forced, and I thought the movie was boring because of this. However it does have a bit of a twist, and a good payoff, but the movie never really reaches that much. The story line and characters, when they get in the way of the film, are so bad, I think it detracts from the story and the movie itself. But it isn't all bad. There are some great moments in this movie where you really get to see the power of a mother, how much she loves her daughter, and she really does show some growth in her character. So many movies fail to reach that growth point because it is always about the mother. In the end, The Devil's Candy isn't a bad movie. The bad parts of the movie, when put together, have a bad ending. The movie is a bit boring, but I would recommend the movie if you love a good mother/daughter story, or a mother/son story.

It is a very good film with some great moments. It has a decent cast, and the actors do a good job. The story is good and fun.  This is probably the best horror film I have seen this year.  4.5 out of 5
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!! I watched this movie with my husband and it was one of those rare times where my husband actually liked the movie, as opposed to saying "Why did you make that so bad?" It was very well shot and was fun to watch as we laughed and wept, especially at the end. The music was very good and the movie was very touching. This movie will probably be remembered by my daughter's friends as one of the best times she had with her parents, not the time her parents made her watch a movie that they did not like. I watched it over and over again and I had to tell my husband that I actually liked it, I mean that's what I tell my kids, to take something that you think is bad and go see it and then tell me why you thought it was bad and why you liked it. This was a pretty good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Book of Life  is the first film from acclaimed director, Michael Haneke (Amour, There Will Be Blood, Silence), and in this film you will be able to experience, in no uncertain terms, what it's like to be on the losing side of history. The novel tells the story of an English professor named Alan Turing (played by Mathieu Amalric) who develops a method for breaking the German Enigma Code in World War II. I loved it! This is one of the first movies that was made in 2007-2008, and I think it has some real character development going on. Alan is a genius programmer, but his life is in shambles when his sister is killed. His father (played with heart and soul by Ben Kingsley) gets him an apprenticeship as a cryptographer and Alan ends up becoming a spy. This is a good film for all ages and I liked the story as well as the casting. The acting is good, even the villains. The one thing that I really like is that, like in the book, there is a lot of nudity. The women who are in this movie all have very similar characteristics, which really helps make them all unique and interesting characters. This movie is a real action-thriller and it's great. It's not the best one, but it's a good one and it gets better as it goes along. It may not be the best movie of the year, but I think that it's still a good enough movie to watch. I give The Book of Light  a very high recommendation! I got two things for you today. First, a review of a movie that I actually saw and liked, The Book Of Life. And second, a message from my friend Joe about what to do with your last days on earth. Today I want to talk about The Book and Light    (2007, directed by Michael H. Haneck, screenplay by Michael C. Hayes). This film is a true cinematic masterpiece. It has that "real" feeling of a true story and it was made by one of my favorite directors and I must admit that I did not think that a film about a man named Alan and his sister, Annie (played well by Natalie Portman) would be one of his best. I was wrong! This film was about a couple on the verge of giving up on life and dying and I just couldn't get enough of it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dance with the Devil" is a good horror movie. The movie starts with a good opening shot of the main character standing in front of a small building and looking over the lake. It doesn't get much more dramatic from there, but it's better than anything else they had in that vein. The story of the movie is very simple. It follows the character, "Mr. Nodal" (played by John Dehner) and his friend, "The Lassie" (Candy Hundley), and the three of them go into the woods to "dance" with a giant redneck demon. This is pretty much the story of every horror movie ever made, and it's good, it's a good film, it was a good flick, and you know what, it works.  This movie is good.   The acting is solid. The lead's characters are all very well written. The music, the story, everything works.  The only problem is that the movie, like "The Purge", is pretty ridiculous.  It's ridiculous because it doesn't take itself seriously, but also because it's absurd. It's not the story's fault; it's just that it has no real context and it plays off of itself.  You would think that a goofy movie about dancing with demons would be a very good idea, but "Dance With the Devil", more than just a goofy comedy, is actually pretty silly. It would work as a comedy if the writing was better and more interesting.  But, like a lot of the movies on this list, "Dancing with the Demons" isn't really about the horror, it just is. There's not much horror. The main characters and the plot are ridiculous. There isn't anything happening, the monsters are silly and silly, and the acting is ridiculous. "DANCING WITH THE DEMONS" is actually not the most funny movie ever. It has a few funny moments, but the movie just falls flat on its face.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Did not see this one a lot. Was told by a friend to do it when I was going through my 30s and wanted to revisit one of my favorite films. Got the feeling I had seen this a million times, and was surprised it had the same charm I remember. This film has always been a part of my film collection, though I know I'm not a big action-adventure fan, so it is not my favorite. What a great reminder of what good action films are, from the classic (I know you're probably thinking, The Great Escape), to the timeless (The Last Samurai, The Expendables). In a time when everyone is obsessed with the newest blockbusters, and so many are so fake and contrived, it is refreshing to get something genuine. It also had a great ending and a lot of heart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Carry on, boys! We're off to explore some very far off places!  In the world of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, a young hobbit named Bilbo Baggins must venture out into Middle-earth for a mission that is far from simple.  It involves him meeting strange creatures and meeting new friends, and there's also a chance that he might meet up with his long-lost brother, Frodo."  Read the review and tell me what you think.  If you like it, tell your friends! If you don't like it...well, you get the idea.  I think I'm getting a bit sick and tired of movies where there are some bad guys and some good guys and everyone is on both sides, and it's a movie where everybody looks like a total asshole, but there's a decent amount of humor going on, and the dialog is decent.  In The Hobbit, I can't complain much about the special effects.  The dwarves did look like hobbits, and they were pretty darn impressive (one of the elves is a real hunk!), and the dwarves themselves were not very intimidating.  This would be enough for a decent movie.   However, there is something missing from this movie.  First, the film is not a faithful adaptation.  Tolkien's books have very little dialogue, and this film only talks about half a page of dialogue.  There is a lot of unnecessary, and downright stupid dialogue. There's one scene where the dwarves are discussing what to do with the goblin king.  (The goblin king, I will not name, and I won't even try to say why he is a goblin king.)  His name is "Ruffnut".  He is the only goblin king in Middle-Earth.  He has lived for centuries.  When he was born he was about the same age as Frodo.  His mother was a witch and he was brought up by the goblins.  What is a wizard to do when he wants to go to a goblin town and there is no witch for a mother?   You could have asked him to leave his mother, which would have been reasonable, but instead he has to be brought up on his own by the goblin kids.   That's just stupid.  Second, there was an unnecessary cameo by the Lord of the Rings actor, Orlando Bloom.  It was not a particularly good cameo, but it was not an insult
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bourne Supremacy is a very well done Bourne movie. It's a solid action movie that is very entertaining for a few hours. I would have liked to have seen Bourne get a little more screen time, however, and I would like to see more from Pierce Brosnan as a character.  The plot is good and it's interesting.  It's a good Bourne film. The only complaint I have is that the villain is a little too over the top.  Bourne has the right idea about the importance of technology, however the idea that he will use it against us as well is somewhat illogical.  Another small complaint is that I wish they would have allowed Bourne to take down a better villain like the Soviet General Tarkov, who was one of the greatest villains of the 70's.  What are your thoughts about Bourne Suprmacy? I love Bourne! I really hope that Bourne gets some more screen-time and that Pierce Brosnnan starts to show some more emotions.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I saw this on a Wednesday afternoon while in my parents basement. I knew this was an older film, and while I expected it to be bad, I wasn't prepared for what I saw. I have not seen many of John Frankenheimer's works, but this movie had me in tears. I was expecting a generic Hollywood flick that I could throw some action in, but I was shocked. The film is so amazing, that even as an American I found it to have great French/European cultural references. I would love to see this made into an entire TV series. I do not know if this will get released on DVD, but if it does I will buy it right now. Thank you, John Frankenheim! (5/5)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a kid in the 80's, when you'd catch some of the films on TV, they used to show the story of this hero saving his sister from a bully. So I always wanted to see that movie. I had a lot of problems with it (it was not very good, the violence was way out of control, and the ending was completely stupid), but I always kept thinking "This would be awesome, if he had a sister!" And that's what we get. This is the story about two brothers who play pranks on each other. One of them wants to play the role of the big bad bully, and wants to beat the shit out of his little brother. The other guy is the good brother, and is always trying to defend his little sister from the bully. They have this battle of wits, but in the end the big bully beats up the little bully, the bad brother is left heartbroken. The film was based on a true story, but I found it very interesting to see how it changed. When I was little I remember watching this on television, and I thought "Man I wish this movie was real." I was also in a movie called "I've Been in Love Before" about two sisters and their lives together. The movie was based off a real story, and it was great. This was a little different from the two sisters, as these were more like sisters and they grew up. I never got a chance to see it, so I don't know how well it's turned out, but it was a really cool movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  is the second installment of the excellent series by Stieg Larsson, with the title Dragon Tattoos having nothing to do with the movie. This sequel picks up in 2000 and follows the life of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a girl with extraordinary psychic abilities who, with her brother Mikael (Alexander Skarsgård), become part of a very shady underground organization which deals in the illegal trade in stolen and valuable artifacts and which has its own mercenary organization. The film begins with the duo breaking into an ancient Viking tomb, where they discover a massive golden statue which they believe to be the real deal. The pair are then framed for a murder committed by a rival organization for which they are then captured by a corrupt cop named Mikael's boss. After escaping, they are attacked by several men in the street, where the two are captured again and Mikael is injured. The two escape to a house owned by a man named Sven (Christian Bale) who has been in and out of prison for a number of years. The man is a kind of drug dealer, and sells drugs to various clients and friends, but does not sell any drugs directly to Lisbets. He also gives them a few hours to get in the car with his daughter Anna (a wonderful Cara Delevingne). The first half of the film shows the two moving in a very clean house with a beautiful blonde girl in the house. The second half has a strange man in the basement who has a child's room and has not changed since Anna was a small child. This man has never seen the outside world, or any of his family, in a long time. He is then killed by one of the men in a gang attack. He then takes Lisbety to another mysterious man in a blue suit who lives in a mysterious tower on the opposite side of the city. The new man turns out to be a kind old man named Daniel Radner (Benedict Cumberbatch), who tells the duo to get to work, explaining that the dragon is an ancient artifact of great power and has a long history which they need to understand. The duo eventually learn about the dragon's origins and how the dragon was destroyed in the battle against Horus and the Pharaohs, but they are unable to find anyone to talk to who was there at the time. In the meantime, Lisbeter has an encounter with a man who is suffering from a fatal

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another story of people who are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, and how some of those goals include killing each other. I found this movie to be one of the more depressing movies of the year. In it the two main characters are on a mission to kill a target of theirs in order to save a friend who is in danger. They are also after a mysterious object with the power to send someone's body back in time to the time they were born. They use a gun to kill people one at a time, one at time, to stop a time bomb that is going to send every person they know and love to an unknown future where everything is changed and changed again. In the end, they are forced to take a risk that will change their life forever, because it seems that some day they will be reunited with their love. As for the movie itself, there is not much to say about it, except that it does not matter much. It is really just a bunch of people trying to do their best in order for something to happen, but they are not given any help by the time travelers, and the result is just as you expect: They will always fail in everything they try. This movie is available on DVD from The DVD Factory, if you want to watch it on your own. There is also a DVD release available on Amazon. If you are looking for a good horror movie to watch, then I would recommend this one. It has a good story, good character actors, and a great soundtrack (in case you are one of those people who hate musicals). It is also available on streaming services and DVD, so be sure to grab one of each.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Martian  is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. If you don't know what's going on, the story is about a lonely astronaut (Matt Damon) on the International Space Station (ISS) who receives an unknown package from his wife (Cate Blanchett) on Mars. The package contains something that's extremely valuable, which is why NASA sends two astronauts (a human and a robot) to Mars to retrieve it for him. The story is clever and well-paced, and Damon and Blanche are really wonderful. The main reason why I've given the movie a 5 is because the pacing is quite slow, it's very well-done, and there are a few scenes that are a bit cheesy, but otherwise it's well-made. A good movie doesn't have to have all the tricks in the book:   When the story starts, we're introduced to Matt Damon's character and the first scene shows him having some awkward discussions with the robot (Catherine Deneuve), and a couple of scenes with an old lady (Ingrid Bergman) who's trying to sell him some paintings. And that's it! I didn't care much about these characters, and at the time I had no idea what they were all about. They were just there to act. But the plot is pretty ingenious and, as you can probably tell, it has to be, because the whole thing is set in a futuristic city called Mars City, which has to have the best science fiction in the world, right? I'm not sure if it does or not, but I'm pretty sure that it does. And it's certainly a lot better than any other sci-fi film I've ever seen, and it's quite an achievement to make it look so good. It's an interesting story, but the writing is too long for a 2-hour movie. In fact, I think it's one of those movies that I really don't think you should watch in a rush, because you're going to want to re-watch it at least a couple more times. I do recommend it though. "I hate myself because I don't have enough time":   I have to say that I did not like the film's music. It was pretty bad. It seems that it was composed by a young singer named Robert Plant, who's also the guitar player for Led Zeppelin. But Plant was really bad in this film. He sounded more

The Last Boy Scout   is more the exception to the rule, which, with all the high-brow movies that are out there, is pretty surprising.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You have seen this movie. I had. This is the movie that started me on the film journey that would lead me to become a martial arts film fan. When I saw this movie, I was 12, I didn't know anything about martial arts and the only reason that I remember this movie is because of the amazing fight choreography and the way that martial arts has been represented in movies.  Crouched Tiger, hidden dragon is a movie that I have watched multiple times and I was not disappointed by this movie in any way. If you are a martial artists and you have seen Crouching tiger, hidden dragons then I'm pretty sure that you will like this movie as well. The film begins in a small rural village in China. The village has a small cemetery and the villagers there are gathered around a tombstone to mourn the death of the village chief. Suddenly a tiger appears from the ground and the village folk are all shocked. The villagers then run from the tombstone and hide in the bushes as they watch the tiger approach them. It moves closer and closer and the people begin to panic and run. This goes on for what seems like hours but to the villagers it feels like an eternity.  The villagers eventually decide that they must run out into the open and make for safety. The people are so terrified by the tiger and the fear and anxiety that they are feeling that they start to forget about their dead and begin to pray for them. Then the tiger turns around, picks up a farmer and throws him against the side of the temple where he falls to his death. The tiger continues to follow the villagers and the rest of the villagers hide in another temple. The tigers eyes are fixed on one of the people but he cannot see his face so he cannot tell if he is a good man or a bad man. He stops moving and as the villagers panic and try to escape the tiger continues walking. As the villagers make for the safety of the second temple, they find that their home has been ransacked and they see that the owner of the house was beaten and thrown out the door. As they are running towards the temple, the tiger comes out of the bushes again and they begin to get scared. The woman that they were praying for falls out of her chair as the tiger walks out of sight, but before they can run any further the tiger grabs the woman and pulls her into the bushes, but she does
Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ರೃ  Rating: 2.4/5  The director is the one who gets the credit as the mastermind behind the movie. It's obvious that he had a great eye for a film. The actors were good. The director had some really well thought out choices to make. The script was great.  This is definitely not a movie that will please everyone. If you like horror then this one will likely put a smile on your face. The reason for this is the fact that it's one of those movies that you'll either love or hate. That being said it's still a pretty good horror movie. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My wife and I had just gotten back from watching a very good movie and wanted to re-watch it together. While I enjoyed the movie it's pretty short so I watched it as a way to pass the time, I loved the movie. I love a good horror movie that gives me goose bumps (just as I did when I saw it with my family). This is definitely one of those. I liked the story, the acting and the suspense of the plot. The characters were pretty believable, no doubt about it. I loved how suspenseful it was. And the ending was really awesome. This movie was just what I wanted a horror movie to be. I had a little trouble getting into it, the pacing was a little slow, but the movie was good. I recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ A good movie, as I've said, and I really enjoyed the book (the main characters are similar, and the book is better-written, although I find the movie much better). I think that one of the main reasons I liked the movie so much was that it was one of a few that tried to do the kind of thing the movie does (make a good sci-fi movie with lots of action and good dialog), and it worked. And the film had a lot of fun doing it (the action scenes were particularly well done), although it did have its share of problems (in particular it was badly shot, the cinematography sometimes looked like a cheap movie, the actors were inconsistent in their performances and sometimes completely uninteresting, and sometimes the dialogue was too corny and unnecessary). Still, a good first movie (or as good as the first movie could possibly be), and the best of the three.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom is a beautifully crafted comedy. You know when you see something you really like and when you are so completely in love with it that you can't stop laughing? That's what Moonrise kingdom is like. It's a perfect combination of comedy and drama. And it's absolutely brilliant. The film follows four characters and a couple of animals who live on an isolated island. They each have their own interests and their own ways of doing things. The story revolves around a very strange and mysterious moon. It is always out at night, and when the moon is full, it always appears at nightfall, but when it is not, it appears at all times of the day. I have never seen anything like this before in movies, and I couldn't stop gushing about it the whole time I watched it. I love everything about this film, and it has really changed how I view the world. I can't wait for you to see this movie, it will be like a love letter to the moon that will give you a whole new perspective on the world of entertainment. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson films like Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Fantastic Mr. Fox, you will absolutely love Moonrise. So what did you think of WesAnderson's Moon Rise Kingdom?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What to expect: _______ * This movie does NOT contain any sex scenes, which was a relief since some movies in this genre don't give us a chance to see our favorite actresses naked. It does contain some of those things you'll expect from a film such as a romance, but it's very well put together and doesn't drag on. * For all the talk of how sexy this movie is, I have to agree that I didn't find anything to be sexy in this film. It has some fun action scenes, but there are so many scenes where we're supposed to be thinking about what our characters are thinking, but nothing of that nature comes off of the screen. * The music is not very memorable, so I have no choice but to give it a zero out of 10. _________ Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Awesome movie! May 21, 2012 Reviewer: jayne from florida The only negative thing I would have is that there's no real story line to it. Most of the movie was just them talking. I know there's a twist but I never found out what it was or what it meant. I'd have to give the movie a very low rating if it had a story line.  However, if you like comedy and the story lines are good this is a fun movie to watch. Was this helpful to the reviewer? [ report Abuse ]

In the late '30s, a 12-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield (J.D.) is taken away from his father and placed in the care of his emotionally distant, alcoholic and unsupportive mother, Ruth (Rose Byrne). Holden is soon befriended by a boy named Joey (Josh Gad). Holden begins to explore a world that seems to revolve around him and his new friends and begins to develop feelings for one of them. The problem, as is often the case in the genre, is that the plot is completely one-sided: Holden is the focus and Joey is the sidekick. This, coupled with the film's intentionally low budget, makes the story hard to get behind, despite the undeniable charm of J.G. Ballard and the strong acting from the likes of Ben Kingsley and John Slattery. This is because what comes across is more than a little melodramatic. There is little to no depth to the plot, the characters are lifeless and the dialogue is filled with clichéd expressions. This film makes no real attempt to explore what makes the characters tick. They're just there for you to get to know them and the fact that there are three characters and one cat in the mix is hardly a surprise. What is surprising is that it feels more like the plot of a children's book than a movie.  On the plus side,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My wife bought this movie for me a while ago. I thought it was a fantastic watch that had a decent story, which was told in a manner that made the viewer interested in the events unfolding. The acting was superb and the plot was fun to follow, not being too heavy on the religious stuff, and having a few funny moments as well. The characters were very relatable and the storyline was interesting. I'm not a huge fan of religious movies, I'm really more of an atheist. But I really enjoyed this movie and found myself wanting to learn more about the characters and the world, just like most people do. I can't say much more, except that I will probably see the sequel."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* The first time I saw this movie, I was not impressed. There is a certain quality that I had always assumed is a common trait among the horror genres, that the filmmakers want you to feel like your life is in danger, so much so that they make the danger so real that you will not sleep at night, or even feel safe at home alone, but at the same time, you feel as though nothing can really be done to stop it. That isn't the case in this movie. This is the first time where you really get to feel fear. At times, it is terrifying, and sometimes even sad. There are moments where it feels like the horror is being created by the movie itself, and yet it never feels that way. It is just scary, and for that, I give it a 9/10. **************************** A little film that doesn't suck: ************ In the first minute, this movie is very suspenseful. It starts with you feeling dread, and the second you begin to think that you can stop it, a little smile comes across your face and you feel like you're doing something right. In the beginning, the story is not that interesting. It seems like a random plot that is trying to make us feel fear, but when it's about to make you feel so scared that it makes you want to run from your home, then all of a sudden it's all about you, and not something random in your world. Then, all of the sudden you realize that your actions affect the rest of the film, and that you may have a better chance of surviving the end of the world than most other characters. The whole ending of the movie was really cool. It makes you feel how one person can really make a difference in the world. The film is well done, it doesn't make me hate all the people who are living in the building, it just makes you wonder about the world you are living. It's the kind of thing that you need to see, and then maybe you will never forget it. *************
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little bird told me a movie is about a man who's not happy.  So that's about the level of fun I had with this movie.  The story is pretty straightforward and it's a quick one.  I have to give the director a lot of credit here because she made a great movie.   It's not a really good film and it isn't as good as she thought it would be.  But it's very entertaining and has a lot to recommend it.  Overall I'd recommend this movie to someone who liked the old time movies like 'The Lady of the Camellias'.  But if you're looking for a more recent classic, I'd suggest another one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  Sign Up for the Newsletter  The ULTIMATE "HONEST" GUIDE TO MOVIE MOMENTUM  Written by Brian Reed  Every once in a while there is a film that captures the zeitgeist of the times just as it is beginning to die down for good. The first of these to come to mind is the 1998 cult classic THE WEIRD WORLD OF H. R. Giger, and its sequel THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. Both films are a perfect representation of what a good film should be, and that is about as far away from the typical formulaic, cookie-cutter "mash-up" of movies we often get now as it can get. Both Giger's and Giger Sr's movies are as unique and strange as their creator and represent a new way of creating cinema, as both movies are set in a very weird and surreal fantasy universe, and both are inspired by the world of the occult. With this in mind, it is no surprise that many of the most popular and influential authors of the last century are mentioned in the credits of both films, including writers, filmmakers and artists such as Stanislaw Lem, Giger and the entire Kavinsky family, writers and artists from the 80's such as James Joyce, and of course H. P. Lovecraft, who is referenced in THE WEIRDWORDS. A quick summary of both the films:  In THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD, a world full of the supernatural, Gierke was inspired by stories of The Count of Monte Cristo, and The Black Church by Saki. In the opening scene, a woman is being chased by a demon and the camera slowly moves along the screen to show the demon in action and eventually it manages to catch the woman's foot. A shot of a man being chased and killed by a flying man-demon is followed by a shot of the man's family, one of whom is dressed as a nun. This shot gives the viewers the impression that the demon is a sort of nun with wings or some sort of spirit being. The woman, who has been trying to flee, is shot in the back and falls into a well. Later the man who shot the woman is revealed to be a vampire. Later on the demon kills a man dressed as an old man who is walking his dog. The old man gets a tattoo on his chest that reads "V

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** * SIN CITY (2005) ***** * Rated G ** *** ******* * The first in a series of movies that make it clear that Martin Scorsese has a special talent for making good films, he has created something that makes a compelling film about a troubled time in American history seem a simple affair. SIN City begins with a man named James Connolly who makes the acquaintance of a beautiful prostitute named Joanna, who seems to be a bit like a younger, more vulnerable Meryl Streep in the role. The movie, written by ScorsESE, takes place in the spring of 1932, in New York City. The opening scene, where Connolly meets Joanna for the first time, shows a young man looking at his future, with a beautiful woman in his life that he's getting to know a bit better. This is a young boy whose life is growing and learning, he's learning to live in a world that doesn't look too kindly on a black man, and it looks like he might have to change himself to become the man that his mother wants him to become. As it turns out, his mother had the same problems as his father. James's mother was killed during World War II, his father died young and his father's job as a boxer made him unable to support himself. James grew up with an aunt that was a nurse, who would later be his mother's employer. At a young age, James was raised by the people who raised him, he was taught to be hard and to keep his eyes on the prize. He was also raised on the streets, in a tough neighborhood. He had to learn to survive, he learned to fight, to go without and to do the things that made him a man. Eventually he met Joanna through a job that she did as a prostitute and he became her boss. James had an alcoholic, alcoholic mother and he was often abandoned by his father, whom he had to take care of. He grew to take after his mother, he grew up without a father, but he had a mother that loved him and who loved him for who he was. James has become a man and he is a tough man, with an eye for a good fight, and a heart that is capable of true love, if given the chance. When James Connally is appointed Governor of New York by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, he becomes the most powerful man in the United States. He is a man

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fantastic film that showed an extremely different side of the American West to most that have seen it.  I found myself enjoying it much more than I thought I would.  A movie about a man who tries to be a decent person in a world where he is a good person just for the sake of being a decent man.    This movie was a great mix of action and humor that I really enjoyed seeing.  I especially loved the ending.  One of the best things about this film is that it did a great job portraying what it feels like to be the "good guy".   It shows the hardships of going after your dreams.  You have to work hard at it and you need the people around you to support you.  This film had great characters and was full of great dialog.  There was some really funny moments as well.  If you are looking for a film with great plot lines and amazing action this is a great movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ Starring: Kevin Costner, Kate Bosworth, Peter Sarsgaard. Running Time: 93 min. Rated PG. Written by Rob Cohen. Directed by Rob Schneider. ______________________________________________________ A group of people are taking a trip up in a little ski lift and it goes wrong. ______________________________________________________________________________________ We get a really strange look into what is going on with this guy, and I really don't think he has a place in this story at all. He is just some guy that keeps coming and going and seems to be having a lot of fun but doesn't seem to have a reason for being in the story.   The ending is rather strange, the final shot of this film is of this crazy guy in the car driving away from the ski lift, which makes me think that something happened to him, and we don't really know what it was, so there is a possibility that he may be dead and this is some kind of dream that he was in.  Another strange idea is that there is something wrong with this man, he has to have an illness or something and I don't understand why his parents would let him have a ski lift ride, and then let him leave without telling anyone where he was going.  I think this whole story is ridiculous, but I guess I just really don`t understand what is really going on. Overall, not very good and has a lot going on in it but I think I have to agree with others who have said that this movie is not that good, the ending is weird, the script is strange, there are a lot too many weird ideas in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Watch the video __________  I think "Eddie's Wedding" is pretty much the first film I watched that introduced me to what I consider to be the essential genre of science fiction and fantasy movies, the sci-fi romance. It is a movie about a guy who is in love with a girl, and they live together as a couple in the future. Eddie is kind of a guy, very smart and well-educated, who wants to be a journalist like his hero William Gibson, in this case, writer Edward James. He's married to an attractive young woman, Julia, with whom he has two kids, but he also gets a lot of attention for being the best writer on earth. He has many ideas about the future, but is afraid to express his opinions in public. When he and Julia meet on a blind date, their relationship becomes much more complicated, and it quickly evolves into a serious relationship.  The movie begins with a flashback that illustrates how Eddie was raised. Edward James is working for a company called OmniCorp (they specialize in space exploration) when he is involved in an accident that leaves him with amnesia. Eddie's memories are only his own, and because of this he has no recollection of what it's like to live as a single person before the accident. So he lives with Julia and her two children in their house on the outskirts of town, and the main purpose of their existence is to keep Eddie happy. "Eddy's Wedding," then, is essentially the story of Eddie and Julia finding their way in the new world, both physically and emotionally. Eddie has to learn to live without having a memory of his past life, but Julia has to make it in a world where most people have no memories at all.  I would classify Eddie's Wedding as an 80s-90s period piece, but the idea of a future in which people have only memories of their past lives is still pretty much new to science fiction. It's not necessarily science fiction, though. The story isn't that great, as the movie is written very poorly, and has some bad effects, but it's a fairly typical romantic comedy, and most of the jokes that it contains are fairly original, and are still funny 30 years later. , starring Eddie Murphy, Elizabeth Berkley, and Dolph Lundgren.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've been wanting a good vampire movie ever since I first saw Dawn of the Dead, and I think I have a great one in The Lost Boys. If you like a good old fashioned "bad movie" with tons of action and explosions, you're gonna love this. It's more of an action movie then a horror movie, but it has a good story as well and a solid cast. The main characters are all likeable, and there is a great supporting cast as well. I was really excited to see the movie as soon as it was released. The action sequences were really awesome. The opening scene when the boys and vampires clash on the subway is really cool, and the movie is packed with action scenes, tons of explosions, and a really cool story. I have to say that I really liked the script, which was written by James Gunn, and directed by Brian De Palma. The story is a simple one, and it doesn't over complicate things. It isn't an action or horror movie like many other movies from this period of time, but if you're looking for an action packed, fun vampire movie, this is it!

Well, let me just say that Batman and Superman...are the same thing. They are two sides of the same coin. The only difference is that Superman is a man of peace, while Batman is the wild west of crime. Both heroes have their problems, but in the end they have to come together as a team because they are the only ones who can help each other. So please, everyone, enjoy the ride.

The other things I liked are the characters. They are likeable and the romance is very well done. I thought the ending was amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The film has been criticized in the media as an anti-Semitic hate crime propaganda which has been inspired by the recent attack in Berlin and has used many anti-Jewish slogans, the main one of "Germany is the Third Reich" in the main credits sequence. However, the film itself was actually made in 1984 by two Polish filmmakers, Janusz Kamiński and Piotr Wąsowicz, who had no connection to the Holocaust and were not political.  The film's main theme is that it is not possible to stop evil.  However, when the main antagonist of the film, The Butcher, is revealed to be a Holocaust-denier, it's clear that what he does is very wrong.  There is some tension in the film which might have been used as an allegory for a Jewish community living in fear.  While I think the tension was mostly used to develop a conflict between the main characters, I thought it was not very strong.  Although it doesn't give much of a background about why the film is named as it, I felt that the ending was a bit of a letdown because it left the impression that everything will be okay if the main character dies.  I also felt that it would be better to add another character, and maybe it would have added more tension and made the end a little more satisfying. As much as the film might have the feeling of a hate crime, I still believe that this is a good film.  It shows a very strong and realistic representation of a ghetto, and also uses symbolism to show the different social classes that inhabit the ghetto.  Though the story is a bit simplistic in the beginning, the characters and their reactions to the horrors they witness is very believable.  My main complaint is that the characters could have been more developed and some of the tension would have been better solved by other means. Overall, I really liked this film.

I am so proud of all the actors and actresses who participated. They did a great job. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am one of those people that hates to watch movies that don't deserve to be called movies.  I don't think the people that make them are capable of creating something that stands out from the crowd.    I was hoping that if a sequel came out, that it would be better than the first.  One thing I do enjoy is the occasional sci-fi movie, and I had to wait almost a month and a half to see this one.  We start off with a typical "alien" attack, and there are two teams that are sent into a nearby canyon to try and stop the aliens.  But what we see is a group of people being held captive by a group called the Chippewas.  This group was formed because the Chippy people think that the tribe that they have been living off of is now a "subspecies" of a different type of tribe.  They think that if they can "breed" a new, better type of Indian, and start a tribe where they can live as they choose.  These people have been enslaved and have been forced to work for the Chippers for the past 5 or 6 years, and the Chipper leadership sees the Chipping tribe as a threat to their way of life.  The Chippers are a ruthless bunch, and they kill off any of the Chipmies that get in their way.  After a while, one of the members of the tribe starts to question how the Chips even thought they could live off of a tribe that has been on the brink of starvation for years.  He starts to wonder about the tribal history and the history of the place where the tribe has lived, and it gets him questioning his own heritage.  As we watch the Chipped tribe's lives slowly deteriorate, it is really hard to sympathize with them.  It is really upsetting when you look back on tribal history, and you realize how many horrible things were done to the tribe, and how brutal and short-sighted these people were.  However, as you watch the story unfold and the actions of the characters you begin to realize that they are not bad people, and that in many ways the Chppies were the only people in the world that had any hope of getting back to where they were before the Chiper invasion.  There were only 2 Chippies who did not die during the invasion, and when the other Chipper leader died

I can't wait for his next movie, "Midnight In Paris". It's an intense movie with some very talented actors and a compelling story. I enjoyed this movie. ********************** I was a little disappointed to see that "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" didn't make it to a wide release. I didn't like it as much as I would have liked but it wasn't bad at all. The film is good enough for a movie and I enjoyed it, it was a very good movie. "Swing Shift" is not one of my favorite Woody Allen films but it is another great one from his directorial career. **************  Rated 4 out of 5 by JT from Great comedy Great movie for the money. It is a great comedy for a wide audience. The plot is a little convoluted, but the characters and the movie are well acted and funny.  Reviewed by Chris W. from One of my Top Movies Ever! The Best Man is one of the funniest films of all time. This movie was directed by one of our great comedians, Woody Allen, and stars two of our favorite comedians, Tom Hanks and Woody Allen. It's a nice change of pace from Woody Allen's "Midnite Vultures" and the two actors in this movie are great. The storyline is hilarious and funny and the film is very entertaining. Woody Allen doesn't always have that much funny material in his films, but his comedy is always great. One of the best comedy films I have ever seen. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry.  a great movie, i loved it. great acting and great funny. i had fun and was entertained all the way through. it is an enjoyable movie to watch. enjoy it  Hollywood Reporter - "An interesting, witty, and poignant look at the personal and professional triumphs of Woody Allen in this wryly satirical, witty family comedy." - Richard Roeper  New York Post - "One of the most talented filmmakers working today, Woody is at his most engaging, assured and in his element." - Roger Ebert  Time Out New York - "A funny, funny movie" - Tom Jonez  Movieguide.com - "The perfect antidote to 'Midnight in Paris' and one of Allen

If they had not made that one better, the movie would not have the same ending. I like this movie but I hope the second one is better. The only problem is that I wanted to see a big action like a lot more of them. I had to wait until it is out in the cinema! I want to see how good this second movie is and if it is also good.  Helpful for a good story but not amazing by far.I liked the movie, it wasn't what I expected but it was still good. But there are problems that will keep me from being able to recommend it to a whole new group.1. There is no good villain in this movie. Not only is he boring but he is also just as useless as every other one in the movie. The other bad guy I thought was great. I was in awe of his fighting skills. And even when he isn't fighting, he shows the best acting performance of all the bad guys.2. The way the bad guy uses the sword in this action is not like any sword fight I have ever seen before. In this fight I didn't even care how the baddie used the sword because I couldn't tell the difference between the sword and his fingers. 3. The plot is good, but it takes far too long to get to the ending.4. It is not very well-constructed and has a lot of problems that kept me from caring about the main character in the beginning of the movie but once the story got moving, it turned into an incredible fight!I did not give this a high rating because of the other problems listed above but because I really enjoyed it. I thought it was good, maybe even great. It just wasn't great enough to be a great action movie, but still, it was better than most of the action movies I have seen in the past. The bad guy was fun, the fighting scenes were epic and the movie was filled with awesome visuals that you don't see every day!I think you guys will like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Movie "A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas" is a great Christmas comedy. The film itself takes place in the Christmas spirit, even though it's December, and I found the plot amusing. The story revolves around three friends: Harold, Kumar and B-Lo, who want to be famous when their parents give them their first big break. After an accident causes them to miss Christmas, they decide to go around the world to find a new holiday to celebrate. Once they make it to Japan, they learn that it is a holiday of yule, the Celtic Christmas festival, and they learn the Japanese kanji meaning "tree." So they decide the only way to go to Christmas is on a Christmas tree, and to celebrate they are going to make an enormous tree with lights in it! They get in the car and have an extremely exciting car ride around the city, but the tree doesn't stay up, and by the time they find it, it's gone. The next day they look for it, but no one will buy the tree. They decide to try again a few hours later, and make it around Tokyo to find it. Once again the tree goes up, but when they get back to Tokyo, the city has already gotten a snow storm. So they go to the nearest tree, a small tree on the side of a hill, and are greeted by a large tree which is also covered with lights. When the tree comes down, it falls right in front of Harold & B-lo! Now, the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at first. Who left it up, because the whole movie revolves around the trees? They are the only ones to see it, and when they are alone, and the light from the tree is gone, they are all shocked. When they get home, they discover the tree, with the lights still up, still snow covered, the tree still in the park, and it's a huge tree in front. It's Christmas! The next morning, they go out looking for it again, but in the morning it's been completely destroyed. The tree seems to be the only thing left in the whole park. Then they find a box in the back and inside is a very big, red, very red, Christmas tree. It looks just like the tree they saw the night before. And that's all there is to it, you see. ___________________________________ It's an all around good Christmas movie. The
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The King's Speech " is a superb film that uses an extraordinary cast and outstanding writing to bring together three characters who are caught in the middle of a bitter political and social battle that plays out within a London borough. The cast and the script are so good, you may forget that they're actors. A great film that is packed with great lines. - February 14, 2004  a good film The King's speech has it all and more. The King George III speech in Parliament was perhaps the most famous and celebrated one, but we often think of that as the most brilliant of them all.  In fact the King's and Queen's Speech are really great films. It is important to note though that they are very different in that their characters are at times very similar (one being a monarch and one a president).  What these films have in common is a great ensemble cast, great dialogue and great actors.  Here are some great quotes from the King George speech: " The King has a dream." "I will say, therefore, that in the next century, liberty will be the watchword of mankind" "I do not care what this or that man may say." " If he has a bad character he will go to hell" "When I see the sun going down over a mountainside, I remember that I am not a king, but a commoner" "To give a man a rope and he will hang himself" "If any one should be willing to sacrifice everything for his country, I think he deserves your wholehearted and unshakable affection" "We all hope for the best and prepare for the worst." "It is a matter of common knowledge that our country can never be well governed if the people do not trust in government"

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I had high hopes for this one, but this film was not that good. Not in the way that this is the worst movie ever made. There is something in this movie that is just off. The acting in this is just terrible, there is nothing wrong with the film's acting but there are just so many instances where the camera cuts or cuts away from a scene and the character(s) are standing still with their mouth open. The movie takes place in the '70s, and there were all these cameras shooting in the same way. This was just ridiculous. The music was a big part of this movie. There were some very annoying songs in this that I just could not get over. I mean they have to make a joke about the guitar, they have got to make jokes about the drums, they do not have to throw in some cheesy song about a girl dying in the desert and that's the end of it. So for all of those reasons, it's just bad. I do not see the point of the movie, other then for a cheap laugh and the '80s era of music. It really was a waste of time. I would suggest anyone who likes to see some stupid music videos to skip this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What an amazing movie and great performances. This movie was not like a horror movie but more like a fantasy film but it was very scary as well. The movie is really good, so watch it. :)    Loved the movie, but... (6/10) I didn't think the movie was a masterpiece at first, but it started to grow on me, and in the end, it was a really amazing movie! I don't think it would have been better without the amazing soundtrack, but for the soundtrack it is worth it. The main character is a real villain and makes an awesome villain character, and the movie is very violent, and very bloody. The characters are all really well drawn and very good to look at, but there were times when I thought that it might have been harder to make it through a day of shooting without killing someone. It's a good film and a well done one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Praise is often reserved for bad movies but in this case, I'm happy it's good: I'd always wanted to see this movie. I knew I'd get something fun out of it but I never knew what it would be like. I have to admit though, I didn't realize how good this was until I watched it twice in a row and realized I was watching it the whole time. The action scenes were fun, the humor was fun, and the music was fun. The acting was excellent, especially Paul Reubens who has a very different, yet very believable, take on Reubenesque humor and personality. I think he does it better than most. Also, it took me a while to realize the "wink wink, nudge nudge" plot device the director used is soooo good: in the beginning, the girl and the boy are making out and then they get caught by the older neighbor who then makes them get into bed and he's like "I was gonna get us out of here but, I'll have to be honest, I got a boner so much so I made you give it a little." It's funny but it's also just soooo well written and executed. The rest of the movie is the same but it also has one of the best endings ever and I think if you ever have this in your head when you watch something and it reminds you of that movie, you'd be doing yourself a favor. A great movie that's a must watch for people that are fans of comedy and good movie making: I'm pretty sure there were no movies made like this in the late 80's and early 90's and they're still underrated. It's a great satire on the Reagan Era and the Reagan era is pretty much what is going on in the world today and it's very funny and good. I can see why this movie is still so good. It does get a little preachy at the end but I think that just makes it funnier. Also the soundtrack is amazing and a must for any fans of John Hughes:

The Alpha's, the Engineers, live in peaceful harmony with the Omega's, a race of hyper-intelligent reptiles. The Omega's have built the most advanced and efficient ship ever known to man: The Odyssey. However, the ship is in an unstoppable orbit around a star called Beta Capricorn. An enemy vessel, the Omega Drifter, is lurking at the edge of Beta Caprica, a barren desert world. With the ship seemingly un-stopped in space and the entire planet in the Omega Doctor's grasp, the question remains: Who will save them? The Odyssey's computer is programmed to self-destruct if the ship's warp core is damaged, and the Drifter's primary targeting systems, the Nova Pulse, are unable to lock on to the Odyssey, which has a hyperdrive and a small ship's crew. The Drifter has a personal enforcer, the Wraith, and it's the Wraith's job to guard and protect the Odyssey until the Omega crew can be recovered and the ship returned to Alpha Centauri. But the Drifters are only human, and, just like all humans, they have a secret: They are also a race called the Wraith. It's been a long time since humans have been on their home planet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight  is the most enjoyable film I've seen this year. The best way to put it is to say that I was blown away. I've already watched the film at least 5 times and I'm going to keep watching and writing about it. I would have enjoyed this film even more if I was able to see the ending. However, even in this film's ending, we see the story in a new light and we learn things that are left out of the movie. I'm actually starting to think that the movie could have ended in a completely different way, but that's the movie, and that's what it's about, so I'm glad I've had a chance to see it. The movie is a masterful piece of storytelling, and it shows it's skill throughout. I loved every moment of this film.  If you're a fan of westerns, if you enjoy a well directed story, if westerns are your thing, then this film is a must see.  This movie was just awesome! I would highly recommend this film to all those people out there who enjoy Westerns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I just watched "The Girl on the Train" for the first time today. The first thing I did was tell my girlfriend I was gonna watch it for her. I was wrong, she didn't want to watch it. Well, that was fine because I did enjoy it. This movie is the kind of film where you just want to get on with it. The plot involves two women trying to get a date while they travel around the world. You can get your own ideas of the plot but it is so good you have to watch this movie just so you know what is happening. I will just say this, when they start discussing whether or not they would prefer a long or short version of their lives, they chose short. It seems silly but I am not exaggerating. When they get off the train in Germany it was quite cold out, which seemed a little strange. It took about 45 minutes for this movie to warm up so I decided to take my coat off while the movie was going on. If you are in the mood for an hour long romantic comedy with great performances, then you should definitely watch this. I would give this 5 stars out of 5 but I don't believe I could do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Ralph Fiennes - The King's Speech (2002)   I've seen two of his recent films, the other being The King Lives.   The first film starred Emma Thompson as a grieving widow who becomes enamored of a widower played by Fiennes. The film was based on a novel by Hilary Mantel and was written in a simple, restrained style by Mantel. It's a fairly straightforward story about the death of an English aristocrat, although it has a great deal of mystery and suspense that the film lacks. Fiennes does not have much to do, but there are some fun moments as well. His character is not as interesting as in other Mantel novels, but that may be due to the fact that it is a short film. I was expecting a much more exciting and engaging performance by Fi, and that's not to say that the other actors are bad, but Fiennes comes across as a good actor and a good guy. He is not great, but he is not bad, either. He isn't even that good in the role, and I did like him enough to see him twice in his career, so there is something to be said for that.   of the other one, The King of Kings, is about a man who is a king in his mind, and his attempts to become a man like other men in his life. He tries to understand how men are similar to him and how he can make a difference, and even though it is not a great story, it's a fun one, and Fiennes was fun to watch. His performance is very natural and fluid, and he has the good fortune to be cast in the lead role. The character of King George is a pretty simple and uninteresting one, but it's still a fun little story, and the acting was good enough that I don't mind that it's not really a great film. There is one scene, about halfway through the film, where Fiennes is a bit too serious and it makes the movie a bit boring.    The King's speech was an important and powerful movie, and my favourite movie of this year. I loved Fiennes' performance and it's great to see another film based on the book that he did so well. He had a fantastic performance and I would not be surprised if the fans liked it as much as I did. The book is an interesting one, which is what makes it such a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother and I went to see the movie tonight. We both thought it was good. The ending was better than the beginning. A good movie to watch. A woman walks into a diner, and sits down in the only empty seat. She has been looking around for something to eat, but it is too late to go home and she is hungry. She puts some papers down next to her and begins to write a letter, and begins writing, "The whole world, every last person on it, is my friend. Everyone deserves to be loved. I want to have a friend. So, I write to say... I love everyone."  The clerk, as always, takes the letter and reads it. "What's the matter?" he asks, "How can you love all those people?" She writes, "I love everyone. I'm a monster. I am a monster."  She sits back, and looks at the clerk again. She writes a few more times, and then sits back.  She continues writing, and says, "If you are a monster, then all the monsters in the world must be your friends. If you are not a monster then they can't be your friend either. All of us are just like you and I and everyone else. It's how we treat each other." She sits in silence as the clerk continues to write down what she says. Finally she writes, as she closes her eyes, "There is only one person in this whole world who I am not a friend to. It is you. I love you. Your name is John." She lays her head on her hands, and waits. The clerk continues writing on the paper as the other customers come in. They are laughing, talking, and they are all the same. It looks as if there will be no new faces in the diner for a few days. She sits with her head down, feeling the emptiness and emptiness.  The diner is empty when she wakes up the next morning, and she looks around, and starts to look for John, but she can't find him anywhere. She goes through her stuff, and finds a small black and white photo of a smiling John. She looks at it.  Then she sees a black and dark brown box, with a small box tied to it. She opens it up, and inside she finds a book. She takes it out, and reads the title. "A Christmas Carol" It has a quote from John

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************" I think that the movie is great and it's worth watching. It's very similar to the movie "Dawn of the Dead" (2010) and it looks very similar. It really reminded me of "Dirty Harry" (1971). It was very funny, it's got quite good characters and it was a great ending. I don't like the ending and I thought the ending was a bit cheap. But I'll watch the rest. I also liked the soundtrack. It was like the music that was played during the opening scenes of "Alien" (1979) but it was different. Posted by Michael J. Dennen at 11:55 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are so many ways this movie could have played out. A lot of these sequences are pretty good. I loved the bit where you see the old man on the phone and then the old woman's daughter coming up to him and telling him to "have some respect", and he gives it to her without hesitation. The ending scene is one I had hoped for. I really liked how all the characters (particularly the old guy and old lady) showed their humanity in their interactions with the people they knew. It was nice to see the characters just talking to each other in a very genuine manner. The story is really a short film that could have been much longer, but for me, it was a good way to end the year." Read the full review "The whole film is so beautiful, it's almost like a sculpture of the spirit of the 20th Century. I think it's the same reason why we love so many of these great films from the '70s and '80s, because they captured the feeling of being young and free in a time when those were the only times we really knew. The people that inhabit this movie, though they may have aged a bit by now, still seem youthful and hopeful. It is that feeling that drives these characters on, and it's that feeling, along with the music, that made me fall in love with this movie in the first place." Read more...

(Nick Jonas/AP)  'Rogue One: a Star Wars story,' " 'Rogue One': A Star War Story, is a prequel that takes place before the events of "A New Hope" in 1977. It will feature several original characters from the classic trilogy.  It is directed by Gareth Edwards ("Godzilla" and "Godzilla: King of the Monsters").  The movie is the first in the "Star Wars" franchise that was not produced by Lucasfilm. The previous movie was "Star Trek" and the next one is scheduled for December 2017.  I have always loved the original "Star wars" trilogy, so this film will be very welcome. . 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix  (1999)  - Not a great movie but the Matrix trilogy is still a good flick and one of the better "intellectual thrillers" ever.  1 - Avatar (2009) Avatar was one of my favorite movies of all time.  I enjoyed it, not everyone will enjoy it.    But to some people, it is one of our favorite movies ever.  In the words of James Cameron, "This movie is my spiritual successor to The Matrix.  But my spiritual predecessor is not a good-looking guy in a rubber-suit who's making a big bad red guy look good."  And he isn't.  He is a balding, paunchy, middle aged scientist who, during a trip into a cave, sees a beautiful white woman.  His first reaction is to follow her, but when his crew spots him following her, he stops and realizes it's not a white woman but a beautiful female alien.  This leads to a lot of interesting questions.  What do all these intelligent aliens know about human sex?  How can this guy not notice them?  Why does he look like he was just walking into a bar?  Where did the woman go?  What does she want?  My favorite is when a bunch of humans come back and decide to join the crew, and he just stares at them like they are weirdos.  And then there's the one time he thinks she's a real lady who he is able to talk to.  A really interesting movie.  I'm glad I watched it as an adult.  2 - Jaws (1975) I'm not going to lie, Jaws was a horrible movie.    - Not a bad movie, but it does have a few problems.  First off, we have to realize that we are not supposed to be scared of sharks.  There are no pictures of a shark swimming next to a boat.  We are supposed to look away from the boat.   When the shark attacks and attacks and bites our hero and his buddies, we're not supposed not to look at it and get scared.  So even though the shark is scary, it isn't scary.             - The characters do lack character, they are not believable and we can't relate to them.  They were made fun of a lot in the media, but I doubt a lot people have had to go through what

You want to get to the next scene so bad."  He says it's like that in real life, too.  It's no secret that many artists have struggled with mental health problems throughout their careers, but in the case of the Hollywood A-list, the problems usually surface after they've finished their best work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ You will never know what you are missing by watching a bad movie. If a movie has good music and is well acted and directed, it can be a good story or even a great movie. The bad movies are usually terrible and the best movies are really good and can touch your heart. The best movies make you think about the world you live in and can change you forever. If you want a good laugh or an enjoyable story that will stay with you forever, this is the place to go. This is a movie that can get you excited for the new year.  The Movie: "Ghost in the Shell" The Story:  In the year 2029, the cyber-terrorism known as the "Gray Death" has reached Tokyo. The death toll is as high as 40,000 but it is believed that all of the victims have been reanimated by a mysterious disease. It is up to the elite task force known as Section 9 to find the source of the gray death. When they discover that the source is the mysterious and technologically advanced but evil cyborg corporation "MOSAIC", it's a race against the clock to discover the origin of the Gray Death. However, when Section 9's lead officer, Motoko Kusanagi, is kidnapped from a high-rise skyscraper, their investigation takes a turn for the worse as a hostile new cyber-terrorist known as a "ghost" emerges. Motoko's best friend Batou will have to find a way to stop the ghost, or face the consequences of betraying the team to save the city. The Story  For those who don't know, this movie is directed by Mamoru Oshii, the same director who is responsible for the great anime of the 90's. Ghost in the shell is the second movie based on a manga written by Masamune Shirow. It was released in 1998 and it's one of the most beloved movies of the nineties. I've seen it many times and every time, I felt the same way I felt when I was a kid – I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi action film and I love the characters from the manga. I love that they use their imagination to create a futuristic Tokyo that will keep you on your toes. The movie is made up of different sections. There are some good action scenes here and there, but it's mostly the story and how they depict it that I enjoy the most. The story is mostly told

And all of them are very funny and likable. It's great to see that not all comedies are forced into one type of comedy style. ______________________ I really enjoyed this movie. It did not take place over the course of the day as I anticipated, but a few days of traveling across the country. I enjoyed how the movie kept the humor throughout the whole film. I really like that this film is completely true to the book. This movie will probably be a favorite of people who like a great story told with humor and characters. I have not seen the movie, so I can't say any more about it, other than to say that it is definitely worth watching if you enjoy this type of story told through film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ A great time for all the family to enjoy a fun family film. The story line was a bit slow with a bit of an anticlimactic ending but I can't really complain that much. They didn't get any character development which is a little disappointing, but if they had some they would have been even better! A little more action but that is understandable with the limited budget, as long as it still has a decent story line, they will work. Great family film that will be enjoyed by anyone, but be prepared for a slow start.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  "Citizen Kane" is one of the greatest films of all time. It is a film that has many themes that are discussed to this day. One such theme is the difference between what we see as the "real world" and what we think is the real world. We think it is real but the film shows that is not the case. When a character thinks that they are in the "Real World" everything changes and they think that they can live a normal life and have normal expectations. But as soon as that person enters an "unreal" world, their lives and expectations change for the worse. The film goes into great depth explaining how these worlds and their rules change and why people think they are real.  In "Citizen Kabuki", "Citadel" and "The Dark Knight" we have the same thing happening, the characters start to think that the world around them is the same as the real one and they can achieve things they can only dream about. That is what causes them to go down the path of crime. This is what "CITIZEN KABUKI" was all about. When we saw the first teaser, we thought that it is going to be about a group of criminals. We thought that they would all be wearing dark clothes, fighting each other and doing all the same things we all do when we play games. But when we went in and sat down for the first time we realized that these characters are not criminals at all. They are just like us. We are all just trying to have a normal everyday life and the world they live in is a lot like our normal world. I feel that this is a great film because it shows the "illusion" that life is real. It shows how people see the world and they are mistaken about how it is. The movie explains how our minds work and what really happens in the real life. -Rudy Geller

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The first time I saw the trailer for The Expendables 2 I had to watch it again. I knew something was different from the first movie, but I couldn't put my finger on it. This movie is great. It's fast-paced and full of action and spectacle. I also love that they didn't take out any of the best characters like the one's with the most charisma. It gives you the opportunity to see some of the less known characters like Mr. Nobody, the guy with a broken leg, the one who is constantly in the middle of the action, the little kid who is a little clumsy but will end up saving the day. I love that we get to know the rest of the Expendables through the eyes of the people we do not see. It makes me want to see the movie more than anything. I'm going to buy this movie on Blu-ray. I would give it a perfect 10/10. I have not seen The Expendable 2 yet, but this movie already has gotten me ready. I just hope there's not another sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* "The King of Kong" is another fantastic film for the King of Hollywood, and yet another great film from a director who knows his way around a big Hollywood picture and can really pull out his best work from the film. This film was shot in 2 weeks on a shoestring, in New Orleans, and was shot by the legendary Robert Wise and the cinematographer of the film, George Roy Hill. The film was released in theaters in 1964. This is a film you should watch if you like big, bad monster movies, and if you don't, you will be missing out. "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) was a wonderful film. It was an entertaining and well produced picture that was a hit at the box office. "Kong" is a very similar picture to that of "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ". The difference is that "Kongo" has a little bit of extra drama and some extra action than in the picture of "Oz". If you are a fan of giant monsters, and want to see what the King's Kong is all about, "The Sorcerer of Oz: The Return of the King" (2003) is a must see. There are many people who believe that the original movie is better than the remake. I would agree, but if you look at the special effects, there is a big difference. "Sorcerer of Oz, or The Wizard of K-O?" (1993) is probably my favorite film, and the best one from director Stuart Rosenberg, who made it as a direct-to-video movie, and has not been available since, but that was another time and another movie. "King Kong: Skull Island" (2017) is one of the great films that I have seen in a while, and I loved it. It is a great adventure film with a lot of action and it will definitely leave you with your jaw on the floor.  …

I wouldn't recommend the movie if you were looking for a story, just watch it and see what it was all about.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ Starring: Sean Connery, Sean Penn, Christopher Lee, Anthony Zerbe, Harry Dean Stanton, Christopher Plummer, Christopher Walken, Bill Paxton, Robert Blake, David Niven, Michael Caine, and others. A film that I have no idea where it came from, and I have spent many a night trying to figure out where it's going to end up. The story of the film is fairly simple. A young man is kidnapped by two men with guns who have him tied to the back of a truck and leave him to die. After a couple of days of being in the desert, the kidnapper decides to leave the kid in the car and come back, telling his wife that he'll return in a couple weeks. A little later on, he returns and he has an exchange with the boy on his cell phone. One of the kidnappers tells the boy to say that he's been kidnapped by 'them' and the other says 'they' are going to kill him, and so on, until he's talking about the people who killed his father. When he finishes talking about them, the boy gets out of the truck and kills both kidnappers. After that, the story is a mystery, but it's a well-written one. The acting was pretty decent and the story of what happened to the boy is pretty much believable. The only problem with this film, from what I remember, was that the story was a little confusing, and it was difficult to get into. ______________________________________________________ The Big Chill (1973) This is one of my all-time favorite films. I've seen it a few times over the years, and every time, it has a special quality to it. It's very slow-paced, and you don't get to see much, but you know that there is a lot going on. The film is set in the 1950s, but at the same time, there's not a lot of action in this film. The characters in this movie were all very well-developed, and they are each different from one another. At the same moment, it's kind of a quiet and sad film, and at the end, it feels like you're walking down the street, watching the people you know passing by, and thinking of them all the time. There is something about the setting of this film that just keeps you hooked from beginning to end, and the actors in this one all give a good performance

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid comedy in the mold of Home Alone and The Goonies. Plot : The story follows a kid (Darryl Hannah) who goes to his step-uncle (Joey Kern) for help in finding a missing treasure chest. He goes to a creepy house (the Haunted House of the Dead) which is a lot of fun to watch. It is the typical movie where all kids play "fun" with things in their house while the adults play "bad" and "sad" and have a lot to do with it. They get their money's worth but end up in a lot trouble. I loved the kids and their reactions to the situation. They were great and it was great to see them act like kids, being silly and silly. I think the only thing I didn't like was that the film did an awful job with the ghost's ghost, but that may be because I was sick. A funny movie with great characterizations. If you're a fan of any of the films, watch it!  Grade : A+ Overall:  A movie that is fun and has a lot going for it. It doesn't have the depth of the film The Goon (which is another great movie), but it is fun for a few hours and is entertaining enough. I can't wait to see the next film because it looks to be a sequel.  A little bit about the film: This is a sequel to The Haunted House: Blood on the Dance Floor, which was released in 1990.  It is directed by Danny Elfman (who did Elfman's score in the movie) and the movie stars Darryl Hanson, Joey Kern, Don Murray, David Spade, Michael Richards and Dolph Lundgren.  The cast is really good in this film. Dolph is great as the new kid and Joey Kern is great. It was really funny and well acted and I think it is a bit better than the first movie.  This is probably one of the funnier kids movies ever made.  I loved how it is set in a house where the parents are always in a bad mood, because the kids are always making trouble and they get a new toy every time. I love this movie. Watch this if you like kids movies, family movies and horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One day we were having a nice morning of fishing and I asked the man who had just caught his fish for some tips on the way home. He pointed to a huge, round, metal can that had been pulled out of the water in front of his house. His brother-in-law went over to investigate and found a huge wooden trunk in the river about ten feet below the surface. The guy said to go to the bank and he would take care of everything. After he disappeared, his brother- in-law found the trunk in midstream and carefully removed the can. When he opened the lid, the inside contained an amazing array of strange artifacts.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ Thank you, John Hughes! I have watched all three of his films with pleasure and I was very happy with this one. It will be hard for me to rate the film higher than 3.5, as I haven't seen it. I will rate it with the three good movies and with the two bad movies that I've seen, and give it a little bit of a boost. I don't usually do that, but I feel that this movie does deserve a little more than the usual three points I give the better films. I'd like to see it for myself. I'm sure many others will too, but this is one of those movies you have to see to believe it. A lot of good was done here, but a lot of things, bad and good were done too. It was an intense movie from beginning to end, with plenty of suspense, suspense, and more suspense, in fact, the best part of the film was the suspense. I loved watching it, I loved it, and I loved the characters. I was sad when the movie was over, as some of my favorites got their comeuppance. If you have a little time, and you're a fan of John Hughes, you'll love this one too. Just don't try to take it too seriously, because the story is a little too silly for that. - August 10, 2005John Hughes - A good movie for a good time

To all the people who have been to India, this is my experience to you. :)  Shyamji  I had an interesting experience recently, and I wanted to share it with you! I went to watch Jism 2 in IMAX theatre (Mumbai) at Rajamangala Mall, on the 6th of December, as usual. , and the movie started. We were seated right next to each other, so we started the movie as a "team" to eachother. But when the movie was over, I found myself walking out of the theatre, because all I could think was that the director had a good point about the character (in this case, Jism).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a pretty good movie and it is pretty much the first film of its kind. I think it is a great action film with awesome special effects.  It's a movie about the good guys and bad guys. It is interesting and interesting to see who fights and who runs for cover and who are the brave and who die. The film is pretty short and it ends pretty quickly. I guess it's good to be back at the movies as well. I recommend this film for young ones. The story is quite simple but the story is not over yet. There are some interesting things about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is great.  The plot, the characters, and the dialog are all well-written.    If you're a sci fi fan, and you like good action scenes, the cast of actors in this movie is pretty top notch.  The art is fantastic too.  If this is a little too heavy for you, then this one is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ The only negative thing about the movie is the slow pacing. The movie starts with the main character waking up in the middle of the night because of a dream, and the film does not let up for the entire first act. He wakes up because he has a dream of being in a dark room. He goes to the bathroom, turns on the light, and walks into a dark and dingy hallway. The lighting is so dim, he can only see the wall in front of him. As soon as he steps out, he goes through the door. Then it goes from dark to light and he walks through the hall. There is no explanation as to why this happened. Then he hears the footsteps of a man on the other side of the door, and a little girl in a red hood runs toward him. The child is crying, and she runs into the bathroom to get away from the dark hallway. She finds a light switch on the wall and switches on the bathroom light. He hears footsteps in the hallway. Then a car drives up the road, and when it stops, he hears another voice saying "come in". As he comes out of the bathroom and is trying to get back into his bed, the dark house lights are on. He is in the dark room, and looks around. There are no lights on in the house. He walks toward the bed and sees a girl in red standing in the door with her hand over her mouth. The girl is sobbing, and it sounds like she is holding her chest. The character looks at the girl, and sees she is an only child. Then she walks toward him and reaches out a hand. He touches her hand. Then the movie abruptly ends. The rest of the movie has little continuity. The characters meet in the same locations. There were numerous scenes with the same location, but each time it is dark and quiet. The opening, ending, and all the scenes have no continuity. I did not find the main characters to be memorable. The whole time I thought that the characters would interact, but the movie was all one long scene. And there was nothing memorable. ____________________________________________________________________________________ I gave it a 4 because I felt like it was an average movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch this movie. It is only one of the three movies from the TV show. The other two are: "Jurassic Park" and "Back to the Future". _____________________________________________________________________________________________ A

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Serenity.  I've been waiting to see this one for a long time and it wasn't until it came out that I was finally able to finally see it.    I have seen many movies in my life but Serenity has been my all time favorite so far.  It's a great movie and a movie with lots of action, lots of fighting and good characters.  The main character is Mal and he is a former pilot of the Alliance fleet and now he is an engineer on the Ark.  He was once a great pilot but he fell from grace when he killed a few people in a brawl.  Mal then decides to become an Ark engineer because of the opportunity.  His boss tells him he needs to be in a place that's free from violence.  However, Mal doesn't see the conflict and he just wants to be a good person, so he goes to work and does his job as a good engineer.  Then one day he finds out that his sister has been taken from him and his parents are dead.  When he gets to the station, he is surprised to see his parents alive but the station is taken over and the crew is being held captive by a group of humans that look like a mix between humans and elves.  This group, called the Guild, wants to harvest the power from the station and create an army.  Unfortunately, they kill off the crew and Mal's only hope is to join the crew of the Ark and take them to the Guild's headquarters.  The problem is that Mal is a very bad pilot and doesn't know how to fly. He's also very much into violence and killing so he decides to join a crew of bad pilots led by Zarek who also has violent tendencies.  I loved watching Mal be a bad pilot.    He's a bad character but at the same time he is very sympathetic.  There is a lot of conflict in this movie because it is a sci fi adventure and there is a moral dilemma.  And Mal is definitely one of the bad characters. He hates being evil and does what is necessary. He is one of those characters you hate to see but love to see at the end of the movie because he is so heroic. It's kind of like if Luke Skywalker had been a bad guy in the prequel trilogy, except Mal is less like a bad Jedi.  One thing I really loved about this movie is how well the action sequences

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Book Thief is a well directed and well acted film with some great performances and a script that manages to pull off the impossible. A well paced thriller and a film that has plenty of laughs. It has the feel of a classic British detective story and is set in the early 20th century. The film is great fun and does a great job of capturing a lost art form that is the book thief. If you are looking for something a bit different or something to get you in the mood for a classic film, look no further.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** It is a great movie in the whole sense of the word. It is based on the true story of Captain James Cook and his voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in 1769. The movie is set in the years before the American Revolution. There are a lot of British people who are living there in the early 18th century. The people are mostly poor with the majority of the population being farmers. The only people with any real wealth are the Royal Family. Cook and the crew have to live off the land in order to survive the harsh weather and harsh seas. As well as dealing with pirates and disease. The crew is pretty much average in terms of personality, but it is obvious they are a really close knit group. One of the highlights of the movie is Cook's wife Mary. Cook, who is a very good sailor, has a wife who is intelligent and strong willed. She has a lot to teach Cook in terms the English language and even the concept of a ship and crew. The ship itself is pretty impressive. The captain, James Cook, is extremely brave and skilled. She is the only person he allows to stay in the ship and she will learn a lot from him. There is an old woman in the movie who is an expert navigator and has a beautiful singing voice. She sings about England and about how it is the land of hope, but unfortunately this is untrue. The film also shows some of the beautiful things about England. The Royal Family is portrayed well. Queen Elizabeth is depicted as a very loving and compassionate mother of a country. The children are very bright, intelligent, and well behaved. The actors portray the various members of the crew very well. The plot isn't too complex and it's pretty easy to follow. The ending of the film is one of the most amazing scenes in any movie. The scenes between Mary and Cook are really sweet. You will cry when they say good night. The story is just great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought the film had an excellent balance of drama and comedy, with each component working well in tandem. The film took a more light-hearted approach to the "man-against-man" style of competition, rather than the dark story of the comic book. It's interesting to note that the film's writer/director, Paul Giamatti, also played a villain in the film, as the mysterious and ruthless "Naked Snake" did not make much of a cameo in the actual film, but rather in an alternate version of the screenplay. A fun, comedic, and engaging film, and one of my top choices for the month of August.    8.  The Man from Earth (2010)      My review:    This is another movie that I have enjoyed a great deal since it came out on DVD. I've enjoyed the look and feel of this movie, as well as the acting of its stars. I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. Its a very well acted movie, with good dialogue and a great cast, which makes it easy to follow along with. I'd recommend this one to anyone that likes action movies or horror, because it has a good blend of both. I also enjoyed the music and score throughout the movie, and it was great to have such an all-around great movie. The ending was a little bit abrupt, but it made up for it with the film moving along at a fast pace. I really enjoyed this movie.       9. Crimson Tide (2011)       My review (this one is longer):        I liked this movie a great amount. I think the director, David Gordon Green, really brought his A game to it. The script was tight, and the film was entertaining, even when it didn't seem to be. The story of this film wasn't new, but the director's direction really brought it to life. The only problem I had with the story was the end. It felt a bit abrupt. I'm not sure if it was to keep it more within the film or to leave the audience a little more unsure, but either way, it didn,t make sense, and that's what I don't like about this movie too much. I do like the movie's acting though. The cast really pulled their weight, and there were some very good moments throughout the film.    10. JFK (

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am absolutely delighted that a movie so dark as The Devil's Advocate has become such a success.  The movie is a masterpiece and its ending is wonderful.  A few thoughts, thoughts I'd like to offer... the movie has a fantastic cast, especially for a film of this magnitude.   The story is the story of a man whose love for his family drives him to do anything to protect them, from going to court to stand his ground in a fight against those who would hurt them.  It was an absolutely fantastic way to spend a day, and I can only hope that the film does not suffer from any sort of sequelitis, because that'd be a shame.  And, of course, it was a film that took a lot of my heart away, especially after what happened to my good friend's wife the other day.  In fact, I think that a lot has been taken away from this film since that day.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ The trailer for this was a big let down. It did not give off any hype or even give off that "Oh, this is fun. It's an action movie". It was boring and made no sense. It was so dull and I don't care what anyone says about it. This is the most poorly made action movie I've ever seen. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that we get to see the cast again. I don�t want to see them on this film. I'd rather see them in another movie that isn't this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of the two films. The film follows the story of the great boxer, Henry Cooper, who is called up to fight in the boxing world.  As a result of his refusal to fight, Henry is banned from boxing for five years.    He is instead trained as an electrician, and must become the best that he can be in order to be allowed to return to fighting.   I am so glad that this movie was made.  For me, it is the best of two worlds.  The art is beautiful and is worth the price of admission alone.  There is a beautiful and realistic portrayal of life, and the boxing and life of the world in general.  It makes me a very proud American. I know there is a sequel in the works, but I don't think it will ever be released on DVD.  5 Stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I could recommend only one movie, it would be  The Grand Budapest Hotel. I can't imagine this movie being a huge hit. I have to wonder how many people are actually going to see this movie because it's been in many critics' top ten lists. It's a beautifully done comedy with a lovely cast and a unique and original storyline. This is a film for people who love a good old fashioned story told in a stylish manner. It is not very exciting, but I did enjoy the fact that it made me laugh. It also has a nice ending, although you should probably think twice before watching it again. This movie is a little on the silly side but it's also surprisingly dark. The story is also told in an odd way. There is a very important character called M. Gustave H, who I have a hard time pronouncing because he has a very funny and quirky voice. He is a brilliant man, who is quite a bad influence on a number of people. M. H is a genius, but his love of women causes him to put everyone in danger. It appears to me that M. Jakes is the one who causes all the problems. The film itself isn't a very interesting story, but that is hardly a bad thing. The film is set in the 1930's and it focuses on a group of people who live in the most beautiful place in the world. In this town, people can have sex or not, they can go to the movies or not and they can do whatever they want to do. It sounds like a nice, idyllic society, doesn't it? It's not really, however. All these rules and rules of behaviour are put in place by a man called Dr. Gustav Johannson. Dr. Johannson is the head of a sanatorium, which is in the town of Breslau. He has been in charge of the place since its creation, so it's not very surprising that he is such a control freak. There are rules to everything in Bresleau, and the sanatorium follows these rules strictly. The women are made to wear white, because white is the colour that everyone should wear. The men are told to wear blue, because blue is the favourite colour of the people in the sanitarium. The colour of both the women and men is a big secret, but the other women also have a huge secret. In Bresli, the men are allowed to

If you've not yet seen this one yet, I can recommend it to you as one of the best Superman movies. As is often the case with films with a lot of action, it's a tad long for a short film, but the action is fantastic and it's filled with great visual effects and a great score by Hans Zimmer. This film also does not make any special claims to being good, as this is a very solid movie that has great action, excellent special effects and is just plain fun to watch.

Our 2 year old daughter said, "I want to go inside the forest again," and she did! I thought it was very funny! I do wish we got to see all the other attractions! But, we are going back!! We will be back soon!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by jake1 from I will return for more! My wife and I went to this attraction on a summer day. It was packed when we first arrived and there were only 2 other attractions open when we arrived. We parked in the front and walked up the path to the castle. It is a nice looking building with large windows to see the wildlife. We had a wonderful time here, the animals are very friendly. We saw the giraffes and donkeys and also saw a monkey at a different level. We were all very pleased with our visit!  Our family has a passion for animals and were excited to visit this attraction. I recommend the monkey as the most fascinating attraction. The monkey was very intelligent and very nice to have around. He was also a very good mimicker. I enjoyed the "giraffe" in the grass. We loved the many animals, the variety of grass and grassy places. We took our dog to this area to meet some of the other animals as well. This area was a beautiful display of animals. This was our second visit, I wish we had stayed longer.  Visited with my family on a Friday evening. The place was packed. We walked in and were promptly greeted and escorted to the viewing areas. All 3 of our children had a great time, and enjoyed looking at all the animals! We also saw several other families and children. There were plenty of spots available in the trees and grass and we went around them and took lots of pictures. We also spent quite some time watching the giraffe and the monkey. This is definitely an animal park for the ages. I highly recommend this attraction!  I went on a beautiful weekend with my kids and took them all to this place. We went early so that they could get to their seats first. They were all so happy and having a good time watching and taking pictures of all the cute animals and playing with them. I think that this place is very well planned out and very well put together and they did a great job. All of the animals were very friendly and you could see they were very well trained
Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------I love this movie and I just want to thank you for this awesome movie! It's a very fun, funny, exciting and exciting film! It will have you laughing and crying. It also has a very good story. It's an old western movie that tells the story of two men who go to the wrong place. They want to shoot a bad man who has killed their brother. They find themselves in a place that they don't recognize and find a dead man on the ground. They go to get some help but they are attacked by some people and one of the guys, a young man named William (Tom Hiddleston) kills one of them. The second guy (Joel Edgerton) has also joined them. He has a gun that is pointed at Joel's head and he has to shoot him. Now William and Joel have a gun pointed at each other's heads. Will they kill the other before they kill themselves? The movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who wrote this movie, and was also in it. His name was not in the title because he was injured during shooting of the movie. It is a great movie and it was very enjoyable to watch. I'm sure you will enjoy it as well. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ When you have a character like Bruce Wayne, and his first big story, he has to go in a big building, to a huge mansion, to the top, to this big huge city. There is just tons of exposition for the first act, and it is all very boring. You do feel like, this is the first time that he's ever been in this kind of a situation, and he's going to figure out a way out. It's just very boring and it has no suspense. However, Bruce Wayne is still a really cool character. There's a lot of stuff that's very interesting about him. He's got a heart. He actually has a heart of gold, which is very exciting in the context of what Bruce Wayne does, so it's not just him being an arrogant ass. He also has a weakness, and that weakness is a fear of losing his parents, which makes for very interesting story. It is still very bland, but there's also some really nice touches. Bruce Wayne has this whole secret identity that he has that he keeps from his father, and this is interesting to play with the idea of Bruce Wayne as a hero and a hero at heart. And there's some nice little touches with this whole idea of his father. There are some very nice little nods and little Easter Eggs that you get. I'm a huge comic book fan. That's why I like this movie so much. I really liked the whole idea, I thought it was so interesting. So in conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises is a very good movie. There were things that I didn't like about it, and there were things about the movie that I thought were very good, and one of the things that was very good was the way that the film was made. There aren't a lot more films like that. This is one of a few films, maybe the only one, that I can remember where the whole movie was shot on digital video. I know that most films, that are actually done on film, or at least have some analog to it, the camera has been moving the entire time, and sometimes it's been set on fire, and all the equipment has been thrown around.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   Last year, I was a little skeptical of the fact that there was a film, a science fiction film by a man named Martin McDonagh. I mean, after seeing "Trainspotting" and "Catch 22," I was fairly certain he was some sort of wacky-ass writer who'd written a bunch of weird science fiction novels. But...   Anyway, the story is about a man who is abducted from a bar and left stranded on an alien planet. He ends up in the company of a guy named Harry who helps him out and eventually gets him home.   The film is a little slow, a little clunky, but I found it quite intriguing. The writing and production quality is quite good, and the dialogue (which is pretty good, really) adds some much-needed depth.   The only problem I found is that the final act seems to be a little rushed, and I didn't really understand all that happened.   the ending didn't seem really conclusive, but it's still a decent film. I really didn't see how they could have gotten the final confrontation and fight between the humans and the aliens all the way down to the final 15-20 seconds of the film.  , and that's pretty much what I had expected from McDonaughagh. The film has an interesting setting, a great cast, a story that I would call pretty much the exact opposite of Trainspotters, and even a few cool effects to boot. I was rather skeptical when I first watched the film, but the more I thought about it, the more interested I got, and it became one of my most-anticipated films of the year. I also had to be careful how I reviewed it because I know I'm in the minority with this opinion, but. The movie is actually quite good. I never thought the aliens would actually come down to Earth and take over the world, but that's precisely what happens. The ending is a bit rushed and not so conclusive, and a few things I didn''t understand all the time, but overall, I thought it was pretty cool. A big-budget science fiction adventure that really shows the possibilities of alien abduction. Also, McDonogh did a really interesting job of casting, with Gary Oldman and Mark Strong being two of the better-known stars. I'm not sure if you'll like the plot, but you shouldn't have any problem at all. Also notable
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tristan "Logan" Farrell is a man of faith. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but found Jesus Christ in his mid-teens. He's devoted to the Christian church as much as he can be, even when it's hard. When he's not working, he's playing a good old-fashioned video game. When he is working, Logan is the most badass of all of our heroes. He works for a man named Logan, and he's a man's man. Logan is a master of his craft, one who can take out anyone he needs to take out with his hand cannon. And he doesn't need any help from his buddies.        Lobster Johnson (James Purefoy) is Logan's new partner, and they've made a pact to make sure their jobs are done on their own terms. Lobster is a great character; he doesn.t care what the world thinks of him. It doesn't matter if he has to kill to get things done. Lob is a real life, do-anything kind of guy.  When the rest of the men start turning on him, it's a big part of why Logan has a heart attack. And that's when Lobster shows up, to save Logan's life.  Logan is a big fan of guns, and to him, nothing is better than a good gun. He also happens to be a real estate developer, and Lobster can only find so many real estate guys who like guns.  So they team up to kill a big-ass dragon that was threatening to ruin all their fun.  This is a really enjoyable movie. The plot is just a little light, but that's about what we can expect. If you like a good action film with a lot of humor and likable guys, you should probably watch this. And I'm glad I did. Grade: B This movie's review was written by Christopher Kendrick of  The Review Boards.

The people that created it have decided it is the next big thing and are holding a competition where the winner gets the suit and the prize money. You are given a choice: 1. Take the suit 2. Take a chance and let yourself get killed 3. Take whatever the winner chooses and go home. You have 2 minutes to decide. You take the suit. (A loud banging noise can be heard but you aren't scared) You are now the newest super soldier and can do whatever you want to do, even killing people. As you are walking down the street, you see a guy running towards you. He tries to get into your hair to pull you towards him but as you move away he pulls a knife and cuts your hair. He then runs after you, pulling you behind a car. You try to fight but he kicks you in the stomach and pushes you to the ground. He holds you in one hand and the knife in the other. Suddenly there is a scream as the knife is pulled out of his hand. It hits you in your eye and you can't move it. The guy turns and grabs your throat and pulls hard. You can't breathe and the guy pulls you to your knees with his other hand around your neck. You look around to see if there is anyone that can help but you know you'll die.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* The best movie in the franchise. The film takes place around the same time as the last 3 and the plot line is just as good if not better. This is the first part in a four-part story arc and it continues from where it left off. I'm hoping to see more and more of the cast and of course the great cast of characters we all know and love. ********** I saw the first one when it came out and thought I was going to cry while watching it. I was so sad and so happy. It wasn't until I saw it again and read up on the series that I knew I had to watch it. This film is a must see if you like the show. It's like a real life sequel. It has all of the feel of the first movie and of the original show. This one is definitely a must watch. I really like the music and it seems like they have made it an ocassion. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Recommend watching this film when you get a chance ~~~~~~~~~  More

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some movies that are so bad, that the best they can do is to make you cringe in your seat while looking down at your feet. There are others, that are just downright bad! I'm going to list off a few of the best "cringe worthy" movies that I've seen this year, the movies that have made me want to quit this profession of film making for good.  BONUS VIDEO:   WOW! Watch the scene with the kids at the carnival!  (Yes, there are a few things that I hate about my job, but the kids in this movie are truly "cringey!") 4. MIRROR (2014) I feel I need to do an extensive article about the story of the last few minutes of this movie, so I'll keep it short. Basically, after the cops have been chasing the guys, one of them gets shot and is bleeding on the ground, the other one has a gun pointed at him and shoots him in the leg, which he then proceeds to use as a makeshift tourniquet and then proceeds on running down the street. The cops chase him and when they get to a stop at the next intersection, they see that the guy is a little bit ahead of them. At that moment, a cop pulls a gun on him and begins to fire at him, but they miss. The police have run the man over and he collapses to the ground. The remaining cop comes up from behind and shoots the guy in the chest, which causes the cop to stumble and fall, where he dies. The other guy just stands up and walks off... and now we're talking... "crying"... There are several other plot points in this, but you've probably seen the rest of them, so don't go into it if you don't want to know anything! 5. WALK TO LONDON (2014)- I know this is an old movie, but I have no choice but to include it here. The story goes like this: A girl is out in her car when a drunk driver throws her off the road and causes her to hit a tree. Now the girl is in a coma, but then a nurse shows up and gives her a pep talk. She wakes up and it turns out that the truck was driven by a guy named "Fisher" and he wanted to find out what would happen if he hit the girl the same

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great film. It was made so brilliantly, the film is filled with so many different styles of storytelling and they all come together to make the movie an excellent experience. It's one of those films that can not be enjoyed by anyone who is completely ignorant of cinema. It may not make any sense to anyone who has never been to the movie theater, and it certainly doesn't make any more sense to the average person. But it's a good story, a good film. The ending isn't that exciting or exciting. It is just one of the many things that makes this film so very special, because there is so much going on that it doesn't even seem like a story. It seems like a work of art, and that's one thing that I love about it, it's like a beautiful painting that you don't really know where to begin to enjoy it.  If you are an expert on films, you might love this movie.  This is one of my favourite films of 2016, as it managed to make me enjoy all sorts of different styles while still keeping true to the style of filmmaking. The story is simple and it's clear what the ending is. If you can overlook the flaws and don't try to interpret the story for yourself, this will be a great movie. It will keep you guessing and you will enjoy the process of watching this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ It's been a while since I've done a review on an independent film but this one has something for me. The story was the only problem that I found. The idea of a man having a dream about the death of his wife and son in an earthquake is pretty awesome to me. However, the writing and direction leave a lot to be desired and I found the characterisation to be a little underdeveloped and underdeveloped. I was a little upset when I found out that there were no explosions and gore throughout the film. There is enough of the "B-movie" type stuff in this film to give it the shock factor but nothing too crazy. There are no scenes of people exploding. There were some good laughs. This is a good fun movie for the whole family to see at the weekend. This should be a winner for all those who like a good B-movie. _______________________________________________ WATCH IT: ____________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ A well-made thriller that has an amazing villain that you'd hate to kill, who turns into a very compelling character and a very funny villain, who can be funny or evil depending on the movie. An all-star cast all play the lead roles and it was really hard for me to choose which is best. But to tell you the truth, I just couldn't choose between these two guys... The second half of the film is quite good, but it feels like a very long film with the first part, which I can't deny is better, but I loved the ending so much. In a way it almost gave me a rush as the whole thing was so intense and suspenseful. I mean, what's a few extra minutes? This movie has the whole film mapped out to a tee, and even if you've seen it before, you will definitely enjoy it as long as you don't mind the ending... I really did. It was just incredible. Definitely my favorite thriller film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot. It is based on an older and better novel, and is actually very faithful to the book. As I read it, I thought the ending was pretty good. It reminded me a little of The Lord of the Rings, with a similar sort of thing going on with the dragon that was being raised in the forest, and his wife. The dragon has some very interesting things to say (and does), and it was pretty cool to see how they came to work together and how the story progressed. My only real criticism is that I didn't understand the character of King Tommen Baratheon. I think he was kind of a jerk at times, and I would have liked to see him grow up.  I enjoyed this film very much. The acting is top-notch, and the story was very well done.   What does all this mean?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Revenant" is a masterful film that is a tribute to the old school of American filmmaking, where filmmakers would not have to be afraid of taking risks and going in any direction in order to create the most memorable and engaging pictures.  It has a lot going for it, including excellent performances, and a terrific score by Hans Zimmer that has the audience immersed in the movie.    The movie takes place in the American West where a wolf-hunter who is also a trapper meets a grizzly-bear that has escaped and must be recaptured.  "The Wolf of Wall Street." This is a great, low budget movie that delivers some wonderful performances.  And with the great performances there is some great scenery.  One of the best performances is the young, white Christian Bale as the white knight, Revenant.  His performance is like an American Pie in the sense that his character is both the wolf and the bear.  He is an emotional beast as he finds redemption in becoming a grizzled wolf, while his grizzled, white character seeks to protect the bear's cub.  Also, the bear is played by the fabulous Jake Gyllenhaal as a badass grizzly bear who is the one that will make his prey pay for the sins they've committed.  There are a few of the film's more memorable and entertaining scenes that will keep you watching the movie long after you've seen the movie, including: a chase scene involving a bear in a bear suit that is played perfectly by Jake, who's in some really great scenes that you will forget about once you've finished watching the film.  When the bear escapes he is pursued by an Apache Apache warrior who's played by a young, black actor named Leonardo DiCaprio who's part of the cast as a character named the Wolfman.  The Apache Apache's are one of the more exciting aspects of the movie as they are a more primitive people that have the warrior-nature of the Apache, and DiCaprios is a very good performance as a wolf man that comes off as fierce and intimidating.    There is a lot of other good stuff that happens in the film that you have to see in order for the movie to make the rounds for the rest of the year.  If you have not seen "The Revenant" but you are a fan of the American west then you should give the film a shot, and watch it with your friends

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a young American girl who moves to London with her parents to attend university. In her first day in London she meets a young man who seems to have a lot in common with her father. In fact, she doesn't know this until he has taken her to a London nightclub where she is introduced to his friends, and the two start falling for each other. What makes the movie so enjoyable is that the relationship between the two characters is never sexual, but has a much deeper relationship which is explored in depth throughout the movie.   Although it is not a romantic comedy, I felt the two main characters had a great chemistry together, so that was very nice.  The most enjoyable part of the movie was when they were hanging out with the club's "secret admirers" at one point.  They get along so well!   It is not just the "admirers" that are involved, but the "secret" admirers are there as well! I don't know about you, but when a film has a group of these "secret admires", I really like it.  When the movie ends, I couldn't stop thinking about the main character's mother and her life in the US. It's a good thing that the film is a comedy since it takes a good amount of fun out of this.  Overall, I think this was an interesting and enjoyable movie which was full of laughs and emotion.

As it is, Bill is simply not in the mood for the conversation. It's just too much for him, but I liked that. I liked how Peter was a bit lost and confused. He couldn't make out what the hell Bill was talking about, and it wasn't until later on in the film that he realised that Bill's story is very important to him. He had no idea. And Bill is so strong and confident that he's just as sure that Peter is just the fool. Peter is really just a small-time con man, and the two men end up being a good team. Bill has his own little world in the back of his mind, which is reflected in the scenes with Peter and the doctor. When I was reading the book, I wondered what the big mystery was, and what Bill is looking for in Peter. So far, I think the answers have been kept a bit of a mystery. I'm looking forward to seeing where Peter and his team go with this whole thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________   Fantastic Movie  Reviewed by: Mark W. from CA on 09/29/2017 This is a very enjoyable movie. There are many scenes that are not for everyone, and you will not want to turn it off. I had no idea that I was in for such a ride until the ending. The first 40 minutes or so are quite boring. The action is quite poor, but the movie is a nice break from the mindless violence and gore-fest we often see on film. It's fun seeing all the different weapons that the gang uses. And I will say that it is a good idea to watch this movie on a screen that is not too bright (it was dark and grainy). Overall, I enjoyed this film immensely. It was not a very well-written screenplay, but it's good. I highly recommend this movie to all the fans of action/sci-fi. I have had my doubts about the ending, but I enjoyed it. I think the ending is a bit confusing. This movie has been on my list for a while and I have finally picked it up.

It's Miles From Nowheresville, a movie about the first manned spacewalk, performed by the U.S. Navy's first man in space, John Glenn. It is also a science fiction movie about a man who is so nervous and anxious to perform the spacewalking that he forgets about the rest of his day. This is the beginning of a series of films that was inspired by Glenn's flight, but later turned into a series with other astronauts. It did not get much praise at the time, but now it is considered a classic. I liked it quite a bit. The movie does have a few problems, especially with the script. But you also get what you expect from an adventure movie, such as the use of space flight in the story, the use and the effects of the "magic" objects that are found in this movie. The main problem with the movie, which
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would rather take my chances with the old movie "The Man from Earth" by George Cukor, but that's an entirely different matter. It's not that this is terrible, but it has a completely artificial plot and a terrible ending. So for that reason alone, it's worth watching. The main character, who can't stop talking and constantly keeps popping in and out of the story, is a man who has been trapped in the bodies of the bodies he made his body (from two different women). He is obsessed with the idea that by creating another body, he can continue the life that the other one is in, but is frustrated and disgusted by the idea. He gets increasingly agitated that he's never being allowed out of his house, but he's given a choice. He could go into the closet and sleep until he wakes up, in which case he wouldn't have a body to go home to, or he could go to his mother. He chooses his mother and is then told that this body is his only chance to be reunited with his real body, and then he's trapped in it until the day he dies. There are also several other men in the house who are being experimented on by the doctor, and one man (who is a bit annoying) is in constant pain from the "treatment". And the doctor is constantly trying to make the others think that they're in his body, because it will help them. There is also an odd scene where a character asks a man to take out his penis, then the man walks into a window. It then cuts to the other character, with the man, naked and bleeding out. This is obviously a metaphor for a person taking their life when they feel their situation is hopeless, and the doctor does the same. But to some extent, I think that is not what we see here. He makes a choice to take it out of him. He tells the man that he is going to die, and we then see him walking into a room with a lighted chandelier, sitting down in a chair and looking over at the man who is lying in a bed next to him. But that is it. There's no plot that drives this scene. There isn't even a sense of how the story would play out. There just is. This film is full of symbolism and ideas that, while very appealing in their own right, can just as easily be read in a very similar way in any other movie
Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ಡ  This movie, though, made me hate humans so much! I'm not just saying that because it's the year of the zombie but I was actually very upset about it because it made me so mad. But the movie made me sad and that is all that really matters. The movie was not even funny but it made you cry and that's enough for me! A human is a human but if it makes me cry it makes my day! I want to know what happens to these zombies that they keep on coming back to the same city again and again and I don't understand! But the best thing about this movie is the music! It's a really dark and sad song but at the same time it's got a lot of fun to it. The soundtrack is very good and the only bad thing I can say about this is that it takes a very long time to go through the entire movie. But then that's normal for zombie movies so I guess that's ok! The most fun part of this movie for me was when the little girl wakes up from her coma and we all have a laugh at it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ [A] (7/10) - An average movie that, despite the ending, is well worth watching. - The ending is very good. - A good and memorable villain, who makes the villain in the movie better (and you'll be glad to see that as the ending has a villain as good as him). _________________________________________ [A+] (8/10): This was another sequel that did well in the ratings for the first movie. The story is interesting again, although the action is quite different. In this movie, you find yourself in a post apocalyptic world where the humans are in the process of killing the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs have a chance to fight back against the humans because the humans, despite being the smartest species in the world, are not good at fighting. You don't find yourself very sad after watching this movie. It's another good movie that is worth watching if you liked the first one. #9 _________(9.7/18): This is a movie that you can see in many movies lists and movie rankings, but it's a very interesting one. The movie is about the battle between two aliens and their human allies. The aliens are trying to conquer the Earth, and they are the most evil beings in the Universe. The human allies are trying desperately to stop them from conquering the Earth by any means necessary, so that Earth will be left for another race to grow in peace. The film also introduces a new race (a race that were made to destroy the aliens and are really dangerous), the Quetzalcoatlans. This is the second movie in the franchise, and I really enjoyed it. I really like the alien race in this movie because they have a special power and some special abilities that make them more dangerous than the previous aliens. I was surprised that the Quetzy was so smart, and it has been a long time since I saw a Quetzel on-screen, and this was a nice change from the typical Quetchy I've seen. One thing I would have done differently is that I think it's necessary for the movie to have a stronger female character, but I guess that's what the movie needed. _______________________________________________________________________________ [A-] (9/10)* - If you liked Aliens then you will love this. It has all the classic elements from the franchise. It is well directed, and also is fun to watch. The action is good, and the CGI
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________   For a movie set in the future, you'd be forgiven for believing that the plot involves a "precursor to Star Trek II". It may be a stretch, but it's not unreasonable to assume that this story could have served as inspiration for the Enterprise's first voyage. It was in fact, in fact Star Trek. It is set in a world where human-level civilization is impossible. A scientist named Doctor P.T. Fletcher (played by Richard Dreyfuss) is the first to discover the "magic pill". P.A.W.F., as he is called, is able to cure almost any disease, or a disease in its very earliest stages. This will be very important later in the movie as P.J. (played, hilariously enough, by Christopher Lloyd) develops a serum that turns people into "Super P.S."s (i.e. Super People with Magic Wands). And the best thing about it, he never has to pay a dime.   The "Magic P.C."s are, of course, based on the magical "P.S.'s" of the time. The only difference is that these P.Cs. are able to heal any disease from the very first moment it is diagnosed. It's easy to imagine that this would have greatly increased the efficiency of treatment. But, of all the super people in the film, P.E.T.'s (also named P.Ts.) (played here by Susan Backlinie) are the only ones who actually end up using the P.P.s. Their healing abilities seem almost magical in their simplicity, and they appear to be the only people who don't have to pay for their services.   the P-C. is also an amazing invention. It can do almost anything that an ordinary doctor can do, but only for a limited time. And it's pretty safe to assume this was just some very clever marketing for a product that the company already had in production.   The only time the PC. really really gets into trouble is when he is caught smuggling a P.L.A., a P-I.G. (i'm not a scientist) called the "Super Life Support". These are basically life-preserving potions that will revive a dead person in seconds, but are not available on the market until the day after death. The problem is that the PLC is also a drug that
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" was a fun comedy in which Will and Jason did their best impression of the parents in "Hannah and Her Sisters" with a younger, more naive, "Duck Dynasty" star, played by Andy Samberg. Will's comedy skills came out when he played the role of the child of the Samberg character who was more childish than the real thing.  We will all remember the scene that made us cry. Jason was showing the kids a video of them playing the guitar with one of the boys, played the part of Will's dad, played his part of the younger brother, played a younger version of Will, played Jason's dad and, like the real parents, played all the roles in the house.  in which Andy Samber as the father and Will Ferrell as the boy, played as the kid, and Jason Sudeikis as the mother, played her daughter, played their dad, and played their little sister, played Will's brother, "Honey." Will's "Daddy" was played by Samberg and his son, played "Willy," was played as "Daddy Will" by Ferrell. /  /

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film had no other purpose than to remind us of the greatness of the great director John Milius (the one that directed the first Star Wars, if you think about it).  He's still around and we're lucky enough to be able to watch his films over and over again.  It's only a shame that it was never in theaters, that we had to buy the DVD and watch it over and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ A young man is driving a car through an abandoned area of the forest when he comes across a large and ancient temple, it is said that the temple is dedicated to the goddess Amaterasu. The young man starts to explore the temple but suddenly something happens to his car and the temple begins to collapse around him. The temple collapses around him, but he manages to jump over the cliff and survives. He then finds the mysterious white cat who is known as the "White Cat of Amaterasu", he introduces himself as Yomi. The "White cat" tells the young man that the power of the goddess and his wish, to be a human once more. He says "We are the same, you and I, we are the ones who are different. In our own way we must make a wish together and find what we are looking for. Together we can achieve what neither of us could do by ourselves, we will try our best to fulfill our wish, and we will find what makes us human". After that the two go on a journey of searching, the two meet a man named Kureha who has been lost in the forest for quite some time. She tells them of the fate of the gods, the curse of the evil gods, and the evil god Amaterasu, and how her son Yomi will be the only one who can seal the evil from being able to harm humans and animals. As the story of the "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" starts out, it starts off very strong, and it seems that the movie is not going to stop until we find out the fate and destiny of everyone on this world. ********************** Summary: *********** ***************** - Good Animation - Good Sound - Excellent Story - Nice Characters - Great Scenes in the Movie. ******** The Characters - First off, I love the character design in this movie. They are all very cute and cute looking. The character designs really remind me of what my friend's younger brother has said when we are talking about the character designs in an anime, when the character is just cute and not too attractive. The movie starts off with the character named Toho, he is a strong and intelligent guy, and I'm sure that he will do the best he can to get everyone he knows to help him. His friend from when he was a child, Kure-chan, I thought was kind of annoying but she is still the one I can still remember her from,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd seen this for the first time last night. It's a good film with some good action sequences and a good plot. But the characterizations aren't very good. The hero of the film is a nice enough guy with some quirks. But I found him to be a very irritating character. He was over-the-top in a lot of places. He's so over-exaggerated that you could not possibly find one aspect of his character that was believable. But you have to love the action sequences! I have seen much worse action films and I still loved them. The film has a few plot holes that need to be addressed but I guess they will be addressed as it goes on. This was a decent film but it didn't stand out. I'd say if you are going to watch a movie and don't like the hero it may not be the best choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My rating:    I am so glad that I stumbled on this film. This was a really, really, good film. Not perfect, but pretty good. I had a lot of fun with this film, and I would recommend this to anyone. It has a little bit of everything: romance, suspense, comedy, drama, and a good dose of humor. The characters are well done and well made. The film was directed by a good director, and the cinematography and music were very good. The performances were all very good (including that of the lead). I can't say enough good things about this film - it was a good experience, even though it was made on a low budget. I'm not one of those people who enjoys films on a small budget, so I was impressed that this was made this way. It also was made by someone who knew how to make a good film, so if you have any interest in making films, I can only recommend this.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, A little movie I enjoyed, it was entertaining and easy to follow. But that's all I wanted from a sci fi movie. The ending made me angry that they didn't do more with the alien.  A movie you didn't see: ______________________________________, This is a pretty long movie and I got the feeling that this was an idea I had to work my way through, but it was really a wasted opportunity as nothing is going on at all. Also the ending felt rushed and was a bit pointless. B-movie movie: ______, So what? This was just an excuse to see what aliens could look like, not much else. Sci Fi movie:______, So why didn't you like it? I would have preferred that they did not try to make aliens aliens and more aliens. The movie ended: _____________________, I liked this movie more than the original Alien and thought they could have done a lot more with it. And that's it, now go watch Alien (1979)  I have a few other comments about this movie, but I think that's the sum up. Alien (1977) is a good sequel to Alien (1976). The main problem with Alien (1975) was that they tried to have everything and then just end up going to space with nothing going on. Here they focus on the little character development in the first movie, which is good, and the monster is not the most scary thing in the world. Posted by Brian Balogh at 8:28 AM  The sequel is terrible!  Posted at 8/29/2003 05:40:09 AM by Bill O'Reilly in response to  Alien, The sequel is even worse. I thought it was the same story as the original, but then it becomes more of a comedy than anything else, and at the end we have a cheesy-sounding ending, which makes me angry and makes me wish they'd just stick to what they did with the first film.  and the sequel to "Alien" is bad too. If you are looking for a good Alien movie this is it. if you don't like comedy then don't watch it. If the fans of the original are still out there that wants to see some more, well the sequel does not offer much except some more aliens and a story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ I really love this movie. The story is good and the acting is top notch. This movie was good, but not a classic like The Usual Suspects. This is a good film that is worth checking out if you have never seen it or seen it a few times and want to see a fun crime thriller. I found it to be fun, easy going, funny and has a good story. The movie has a lot of action, and although not very realistic (there was no gunplay or body shots), it is still a lot fun to watch. The cinematography in the movie is top quality and the performances were excellent, and if you like the movies The Usalrutps or The Exorcist, you should enjoy this movie as well. I give this movie a 9/10.

When I say we watched it, I mean we spent the entire movie laughing about how stupid the characters were. So there you have it. A couple of my friends and I were so into the movie, that we didn't even realize it was an anti-war movie until we were in the car going home.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My only criticism for this movie is that it was made for a PG-13 rating, and the violence and language are pretty tame. ___________ I don't know about you, but I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a huge fan of the original Star Trek series, and when Paramount finally licensed the film rights to the show I was very excited.  The new Star Trek, while a pretty good film, is no Star Trek 2.  I was excited for this new show and the new crew to have some fun and hopefully this film could be more of a fun romp than the original series.   The new series was released in the early 1970's, so the first two films were quite different and different in tone.  As a Trekkie, I had a soft spot for the first film and still do, but the tone of the second film was a bit different.  In order to get the tone right the crew of the Enterprise had to get rid of their old uniforms and change to the new uniforms.  Now, the uniforms on the original show were quite colorful and quite cool looking and the crew had fun with them.  This film changed this look.  After a few moments the costumes came down, so now the crew looked more "ordinary" to me.  To get the same look and feel of the first series, the first movie had to make the uniforms completely green.  Even in their green outfits they were very different from the original uniforms.   However, I think this film did a very good job of changing up the tone. The crew of Enterprise is very goofy and humorous, but they never seem to get out of hand.  There are plenty of goofy sequences, but most of the comedy comes from Kirk's antics and Spock's mind games.  When Kirk and Spock have a bit of fun and are forced to do what they think is funny, it's very entertaining.  And, the Enterprise crew is a very diverse group.  While there are some characters you know, and some you don't, the crew in general are a colorful bunch.  It's hard not to like the original cast.  These new cast members, even though they are a little more serious and have less fun, are still entertaining and fun.  Overall, this is another fun Trek movie. I really like the characters and they all have fun and make for some very entertaining scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ A well-crafted script that, like the film it's based on, is about someone who was brought up to be a killer, who does it for a thrill and because he needs money. He does a good job of portraying his dark side, but then again, so does his character, so it all works. __________________________________________ I really enjoy this movie, I have a couple of problems with it however. First of all, I'd be very interested in hearing from someone who knows the details of what it was like to be there during that time period to try to put in their opinion on what it must have been like. The second problem is the ending, it seems as if the writer's goal was to finish off the film. He didn't seem to care if it was a good ending, he just wanted to finish the film and I didn't understand why. ____________________ Another good movie. It has that killer killer thing going on. The script by Timur Bekmambetov is well written and there is something about it that is creepy to me. ____________ Another well-written film. _____________________________ __________________ Check out my other reviews, I've got more to say on this film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhere I read a quote where the narrator says "Don't judge a book by its cover".  Well I saw this movie at the cinema (where a film was shown in an ordinary black and white).  I was a little bit hesitant since I wasn't a fan of the series.  The trailer was ok but I think it didn't do it justice.  This movie is soo cool.  I will rewatch this one in the future.  For those of you that don't know, here are a couple of videos I think are great for viewing the film. Review of this movie: What a great movie.  For those of us that didn't know about the series it was a real delight to watch.  So cool and interesting to watch the character in a different light.  As you would expect, the ending was really cool. I didn't mind the whole story because it was awesome.  But I did think it was weird that the main character of the story would become a girl... but that is ok.  As I said before, this film is very unique in it's use of the camera.  You can't even tell where the film is shot because the camera angles were crazy... This movie will keep you coming back to it... so watch it! Movie: 4.5/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ I'll admit that the trailers for this movie were a little misleading. I was really expecting a movie about a group of super heroes with super powers that go around saving people. But this movie actually tells the story of a group called the 'Minion Gang'. The original idea for the film was to give a group that had the same powers as superheroes. So it's not exactly like The Avengers, but it still has some similarities. The original team is the Minion Gang and they have a group leader and a second in command who has a special ability. But they never get together and the leader is the only one who has the power to control others. One day their leader suddenly gets kidnapped by aliens that were looking for his head. The leader's head is in a spaceship and they are forced to fight a battle against a bunch of aliens in order to get back the head and find out who is responsible. The aliens, led by the villain called 'The Alien' get away and one of the aliens who they have been fighting all along is killed. Their leader gets their head back and in the final scene when they have their heads back they are all fighting together to kill The Alien and save the day. I'm going to talk more about the movie after I get to the reviews. The first thing I noticed is that there were no CGI effects in the movie, no special effects. The effects are pretty much the same in the film. The only thing that was a little different is the aliens that they fight were actually made of rubber. But it looks really cool. The action scene is just a really cool thing in this movie. It looks really good and it's great how this movie is about super heroes. The film has a lot of action scenes and the action was done really well. Some of the action is great but it wasn't too much and it doesn't get too over the top. The villains in the end are pretty cool as well. I like how they were played by two actors and I'm glad that they both were able to make the character of The Alien feel very different from the other villains. The movie was a great mix of action, comedy, drama, and mystery. The mystery is what really made this film great, there was just so much going on in the story that it was hard to figure out. The plot is a really good thing about this movie as well, it's just a great mystery. It's hard to tell how this story will
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Days of Disco"  is about a disco dance club that is closing in New York City. It has the atmosphere of a comedy, but I couldn't laugh out loud at all. I guess it's because the story didn't do anything for me and I can't imagine any comedy would. It could have been funny, but it just was not funny at all for me. I don't know what's wrong with this movie. You know what would have been really funny? That it was about the end of disco as we know it in America. And this is one of the first movies I have seen that says "We're not really doing anything" about the Disco era. I've read this movie a few times since I watched it and I always have to think, "Was there really a Disco movie?" If there was, then I can still see it as an action movie, or even a romantic comedy or romantic drama. It had a bit more than just the story of the dance club closing. But I think it would have done better had it been more like "The Last Waltz" or "Pulp Fiction," where you know how the characters are going to end up and how things end up. I can only say I liked it a lot better than "Punch Drunk Love," which I think is the worst of the three, but still a good comedy. It was more "Saturday Night Fever" than "Moulin Rouge," but it was a good flick at the same time. I'll get to my other two picks on the blog (they were not reviewed this week) tomorrow, but first, here are some reviews of other movies I liked this week. First up, I watched "The Big Short". It's a movie that some people are claiming is one hell of a Hollywood blockbuster. For a movie made at the end (or the beginning, depending on how you want to look at it) of 2015, it's pretty much an Oscar winner, and it has a ton of Academy Award nominations to show for it. I wasn't blown away by it, but the movie had good performances from all over the board and there was a really good performance by Christian Bale in it. It also had a lot of interesting plot points and some great action scenes. It's definitely worth a look for anyone who is a big fan of Wall Street or the movies that are based on it. But if you like action movies, or you

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Grand Budapest Hotel"  is a fun and very funny romantic comedy set in a surreal world of gothic architecture, with some wonderful visual and aural flourishes. I don't see any reason not to take the time to view it if you are a romantic movie fan and/or a movie lover, but the movie is very short and I don't have much to say about it. The main thing to do is to go see it.  It's in a really good theater in San Francisco. A note on nudity and a note on the cast I think the director could have chosen a less graphic and vulgar way to tell the story of the character I played and the way she gets caught. It was, however, an amusingly realistic portrayal of the way that the sex industry is portrayed in this country, as portrayed by the woman we played, and I thought it was a fun way to go.  I didn't know I was going to be naked in my role.  It's not that I wanted to get naked, but that it was in the script and, having just seen the movie, I thought that it made sense.  I wasn't uncomfortable with what I was doing, and to my knowledge, none of the other actresses were either.  Of course, this is a movie that is a celebration of sex, and sex in a world that is full of shame. We are seeing more and more stories like this in which women are being seen to have some kind of sexual need to be seen naked, which is obviously sexist. I don 't know how we got here, but I am glad that people are willing to discuss what has been happening in society, including the ways in which sexism and racism are intertwined and have been at work for centuries.  There are people that are willing and ready to discuss this, and if people were willing to talk about it more, perhaps it would get less "taboo" and more acceptable to discuss such things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a good horror movie by any means, but it does have it's moments of terror, which I can understand, because this movie is not exactly known for its scares, not at least when it comes to horror.  I didn't enjoy it, not by a long shot. The movie starts out with a bit of a bang. We meet a strange man in a suit who seems to have lost his mind. He has lost his daughter to a murderer who used the murder weapon on her. He can't believe that someone would want to kill his daughter because she has done nothing to him. He is obsessed with his daughter and his desire to avenge her death is so strong that he has come to the local police station, just to get the killer to confess to his crimes. We also see a man named Tom (Chris Cooper) who has some connections to the killer. This is a very dark movie. It's a bit violent and not something I'm into. It can be watched without a problem but I can see how it may make some people feel uncomfortable. The script, like I said, is rather well written. The acting is average, but the music really adds to the movie. I like the music, and I really enjoyed the movie, but I feel that it was only there for the music and not for the actual plot, even though it is the main reason that I am watching the movie today. A definite keeper.

I can't really say much about this movie other than the fact that it was a fun watch and that it's a very original movie.

It had a good story, but some parts felt a bit too familiar to be completely original. I hope that it gets a DVD release soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ So I didn't have much of an expectation going into this film, especially since my expectations were probably pretty low. I knew there was a chance that this might not be as good as they were trying to make it, but I also knew I would probably be enjoying myself regardless of the quality. This film had been out for a while by the time I saw it, and so it was kind of fresh in my memory. If you look up any reviews of this film you'll notice that most of them mention a scene where the actors are supposed to be playing a game, but they are actually acting in real life. They did this for about 6 hours straight, which I think is a bit excessive. It was pretty hilarious, and probably a great way to get the audience to laugh a lot throughout the film. The comedy wasn't the best, but it was funny enough to keep me entertained while the story progressed. The ending wasn't overly dramatic, but was still pretty sad, so I think that was the intended effect. The acting in this film is pretty good, although I did notice a few actors not getting the most out of their scenes. I did also think that they went a bit too far with the joke of their 'game' being that they were not acting on the day of the shooting, since it seemed pretty obvious they were doing the 'game'. Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I think I'll be going out and watching it again in the future. It's a shame that the main character is such a big jerk, but there was something refreshing about the way that the writers portrayed this. They also managed to make the film very emotional, but not in a way that makes it seem like it was really a comedy film. I really don't know if it really was the best they could do with the plot, but as a fan of the director's work I liked this film a lot.

We just learned the game "Let the Simulator Choose All" in which the player, who plays as a computer, can choose the game's storyline, characters and ending. All of this will be determined by the player.  It may seem like an interesting concept, but I thought it would be a little too easy to manipulate the game into a specific scenario. I really wanted to believe that the computer's decisions would be an act of free will, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to. The plot seemed to start with the character having a "love affair" with another man. It is only when he realizes his feelings for his computer partner that the plot kicks in. After that, the programmer takes a page out of the Terminator movie, where the villain uses his own software to try and destroy the world. I can't say too much because this is a spoiler, but you get the point. : I will admit, I expected this game to be at least moderately interesting, but the "let the simulator decide all" concept turned out to be more than a little confusing. The computer's behavior is obviously programmed into the game, but if you are expecting the computer to be your friend, you're going to be disappointed. I suppose you could see this as a way to simulate the behavior of artificial intelligence, but this would certainly lead to some interesting challenges. I did find myself annoyed with the computer character whenever he began an argument with his friends, especially when there was no solution to his problems (that seemed to be a pretty frequent occurrence). I found myself more inclined to want to help his friends by shooting his enemies instead. Unfortunately, I did not find any ways to actually kill the computer, which meant that my attempts at helping the others were always doomed to failure. I ended up just watching them fight to the death, like they were little kids. ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie with interesting plot. In many scenes, you will feel that these two actors are very talented, but they have a problem with the dialogue and with the execution of the story. The problem here is that there is a lack of continuity and the characters often repeat themselves in dialogues, even if they are meant to be different from one another. They are a little bit repetitive, sometimes even with their dialogue. As usual, they are also not so good in acting. The two-dimensional characters don't develop. Even if the story is well written, and even though there is some romance in the movie, it was too short to be meaningful. Also, in one part, a character says that they are going to be able to see their family, while some other character has already made that statement before and he says it again. Finally, the movie is very sad and a bit overrated.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I was really hoping to love this movie. I don't remember what the last one was about. I do remember it being about a child-soldier and his mother's attempt to protect him from a war-ravaged country. They meet, and he goes with her, but she takes a step that causes him to go on the run with his mother (which may or may not have been the same mother as in this movie, though I doubt it). The two of them, together, try to get back to their village in order to protect themselves. As you may have guessed from the trailer, the war has changed things in this country, so they're trying to get out. I found myself a little put off by the premise, because it seemed a little on the nose to me. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me. There were a lot of good lines in the movie, but the whole thing just seemed a bit contrived. There are a few nice action scenes. The one with the army soldiers chasing them around a small town, shooting at them, etc. was really good. There was a scene with the kid and his parents, and it was well done. I thought it was a pretty decent movie. The characters were all good, and I like that there is a child soldier at the center of it all. It's a very good movie. It has good action, and the characters are well done (at least, they were for me). It just doesn't seem all that fresh, to me, to be honest. It doesn't feel as fresh or novel as the other movies in this trilogy. I just don't think it was all that different, for that matter, compared to the other two. It does feel like it could have been very good, if only it had been different enough, but I think it's still very good as is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a fun action packed flick! A bit corny and it's a bit boring but it's all the same with this one. You get a great look at two of our favorite heros in action and just a cool flick. It is a bit short and not as interesting as some other stuff that is going on in this movie and the ending is a little cheesy. But it's still a fun flick!
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Starring: Robert De Niro, James Gandolfini, James Woods  Director: John Hillcoat  Cast: Robert de Niro (De Niro), James Woods (Woods)  Producer: Scott Rudin  Release Date: 11/20/95  Runtime: 94 minutes  The Good: If you enjoy De NIRO's performances, you will not be disappointed in this movie. He is great in every way. He shines here because he plays a man who is the ultimate sadist, but in all honesty, I found his behavior to be far too mild. De NIGO does not play the character of a bad guy; he plays it as a man trying to get off the hook for his own personal problems. It is this same tendency of De NINOY that causes some viewers to feel his character is a little too tame. On the other hand, his character, while a complete failure as a serial killer, is a brilliant work of comedy, and there are some funny moments throughout. It was really funny how the detectives were looking for the right killer, but their attempts at a match with De NIO were so wrong. Some of the characters seem to get lost in the character's back story, and others seem to be completely oblivious to the killer. It seems the screenplay may have been written by an English teacher, and some of the dialogue sounds like it is in between a grade school classroom. This movie has some great performances, and I recommend watching it if you enjoyed De NAIRO's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I liked this movie! I did not know much about the subject, but that doesn't matter, it's good! I'm glad I found this movie after reading several reviews and looking for a good old-fashioned scary movie. It is very effective at this. The story is simple, but the scares are very effective and well made. There are some parts of the movie that seem unnecessary, like the woman in the car. But all in all, this is a good film that is worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was really good. I've seen a lot of horror movies this year. Most of the time, I am not that impressed with horror movies. They always come off as cheesy and cheap. Well, not with this one. It was a creepy, scary, and bloody ride. The movie follows a young man who is stuck in a creepy mansion and finds out a little about the ghost that is haunting him. He makes a bargain with the ghost so he will make it stay in his room for one night. The ghost does this by killing all the guests and taking the man's camera and camera flash. After that night, the young man is dead. Then the ghost is back to haunt him. But this time, he does not have his camera. There was a great soundtrack. There were a lot different ghostly sounds. I found myself wondering what was going on. One thing I really liked was how there were times when the camera would turn off and the sound would not stop. And it never had an end. It made you wonder what was happening. But the main thing that made this a great movie for me was the acting. The best acting of the movie was by Michael Gough, who was very creepy as the young guy that was stuck in the mansion. He had a great voice and a good personality to him. A lot of other actors made up the other characters in the movie. Some of them were really scary. The ending was also really creepy. A little while after you are told the good news that your character died, the screen goes black, and the credits start rolling. I didn't really like that. It got a little boring. The rest of the cast did their jobs, but it just seemed like a boring ending. If you have a creepy movie on your mind, check out this one and see if you like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do You Know What You're Worth? GET A FREE PAY REPORT  5. The Godfather  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola  Starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Michael Corleone, Richard Conte, Robert Shaw, Vincent Pastore  Year: 1972  This is the most underrated and misunderstood film of the century. It doesn't hold a candle to Godfather Part II in terms of pure cinema.  The film is set in the Prohibition era, and follows the dealings of a corrupt mobster, Vito Corleoni, to find out what happened to the family fortune he inherited from his father. When he starts to investigate, Corleonica learns the truth about the family's past, as well as who he's really working for. It's an absolute masterpiece that perfectly captures the power of the mob and the way people use and manipulate money. , but for some reason it only really became popular as an Italian-made film after it came out in the U.S. The movie is so controversial that even now, when you go to the movies, the only time you'll hear someone scream "Godfather" is during the opening credits and the infamous "Amen."  4. The Princess Bride  Director: Rob Reiner  Cast: Robin Wright, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Billy Bob Thornton, John Larroquette, Kelly Preston, Christopher Lloyd, Christopher Lee  Years: 1987  Synopsis: A young nobleman, Buttercup, is kidnapped by the evil Prince Humperdinck, who promises to marry her in exchange for her father's life debt. Humperdink is actually the former King of an entire kingdom named Farquaad, and he has a plan to become the ruler of all of them. But first, he wants Buttercup to marry him, and she agrees! Now, the Prince has to find a way to save the princess from her destiny!  While the film itself is not groundbreaking, it has become a very influential classic, and one that many people can point to as an influence on the later Disney Princess films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The best way to describe my feelings about this movie is this; I felt that it was so funny. I mean, in a way, I actually laughed. A lot. This is not a film that will be for everyone. I understand that many people like this kind of humor and I can see that in a lot of films. But for some reason, I can't watch it. I don't get it. So this review is going to focus mostly on comedy. The comedy in this film is definitely more than a little crude. It is not funny in the way that the first "Ride" was funny. This was an actual slapstick comedy. It was like a low budget version of "Hoosiers." The scenes where they are trying to get the boys to do things like ride a horse were a blast to watch. The scenes that they try to teach the boys the proper use of sex toys were the best scenes in the film. There were times when I actually forgot that it wasn't a film aimed for little boys. That is not to say that it isn't a really well done film. The acting was just as good as in the first film. It all worked. I would give this film a solid 8 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched a couple of episodes of this show and after watching the first episode, I knew I had to see more. This show is like a "fooling around" comedy. If you're looking for a comedy, this ain't it, but you might like the characters. This series is like it was shot at a school, with no actual school in it, except for an isolated desert location.   The main characters are kids who live in this desert locale. They have no idea what to do with the time they have and the teachers aren't too helpful. The only adults that are around are the parents of one of the kids and the two teachers who are both in their 20's. All the characters seem to be in high school. The kids in question are: Reed, his friend Max, and their teacher. There's a kid in this town that has his own little problem.  He's been living in this place for years and he has a crush on a girl, that is. He also has a pet bear named Marge. Reed is the only boy and the only person who can get close to her.   The show is pretty short and the humor is pretty stupid.  But it is a funny show.    I could watch this all day.  The show was only 6 episodes.  All I can say is, if you like the idea of a comedy where a group of children in high-school try to fix the problem with the town of Tuscumbia, then this is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film with great acting and good effects. It was great to see a movie with such excellent production value. It has a great mix of characters and was great fun to watch. It's also worth noting that while the film is in black and white and has a dark setting, the effects are actually better than I expected. The film is good but it needs to be put in perspective. It is a well acted film with some great action, and a wonderful soundtrack with a good amount of good melodies.  3 out of 5 Happily Ever After is the first movie by director Don Coscarelli and writer Peter Bart. I didn't think Don Cosgrocelli was going to be a great director, especially when I saw the first film, so I was a little surprised to see such a great first movie with his name on it.  Cosgrocelli and Bart did an amazing job with the first installment and then got even better with Happily Ever.  5 out of 10 Peter Bart did a great job with this movie, making it look like it was shot in color. I really enjoyed the first two films. There's a great blend of humor and action, both good and bad. The main character of the first is a guy named Joe who has to go back to the past to prevent something bad from happening. When Joe goes back in time, he meets a woman, who then takes him to a world that is more than she could ever be in. This world has a way of making everyone happy, but there are also a lot of evil people who don't seem to get it.  The film takes place in a dark world with a lot going on, and it is filled with some fantastic sets and props. I was surprised with the film's ending, which is a little bit of a surprise because it doesn't follow the story line of the film, but it's a nice ending.   When the film starts, the main character is asleep and his wife tells him that they have to go on an adventure. At first, the wife tries to stop Joe from going back to their world, but Joe just seems to be happy all the time. This is not the usual Joe that we have met in previous movies, but the film really shines when you find out who Joe is and how he came to be.  There's really not a whole lot to say about this movie. It just has a good mix

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ If you like ________ then you'll love __________  A great film.  I can understand why it is not as well known as the other "Titanic" movies. But it deserves to be known.  is a great movie. It was written by William Goldman, the same writer of "The Godfather", and it is based on a short story he wrote in the 1930s. In his book, he describes a very interesting story about a ship which is in the final stages of construction. The captain, a wealthy businessman who had been in the ocean for thirty years, wants to sail it to Italy. As it turns out, the ship has been carrying a cargo of gold which is supposed to bring it up to the grade of safety to sail the open sea. The wealthy businessman is so desperate for the ship to reach the Italian coast that he sells the captain a large part of his fortune to finance the trip.   The captain, of course, is not entirely convinced about the quality of the gold. He believes the ship is not only not safe, but it is also likely to sink and that it will not be recovered. He tells the man who is in charge of the ship that he cannot carry out his decision without the blessing of the Catholic Church and without his father, who is also his boss.   the captain becomes obsessed with the idea of being married to a Catholic girl and finally dies in his dream. He then wakes up in the afterlife and finds that he has become a god, and the ship, the vessel that would bring him to Italy, has been converted into a huge church, complete with golden bells. His old ship has come back to life and it begins to carry people to heaven and to hell. He soon learns that the passengers aboard are destined for hell by having the same sins that he had committed, such as drunkenness and greed, but the more he sees this, the angrier he becomes and the more the ship sinks into the depths of Hell.  , which is the second in the series, was more successful than the first. It won an Academy Award and a Grammy Award, and is regarded as a masterpiece. The film is set in the 1960s, but takes place in the 1850s, when the ship in question was still in the planning stages. The movie also features the voices of the likes of David Carradine, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Cruise, and James Cromwell. It tells the story

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   I'm not sure if I'd call the ending of this movie good or bad; I'm honestly torn. I like the ending, it's actually pretty awesome and I really liked how the movie followed the story so well. The movie was great, the acting was pretty great and I felt like I had a good time watching this movie. But the ending seemed kinda rushed. And I've seen some other movies with this ending; I felt that this ending was probably rushed too. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't call it very good. The fact that it was rushed is because the story was going to come to a quick end. I really enjoyed the movie, but the ending kind of feels rushed and I wish it had a better ending. And now, on with the review.   What's The Point?   For a movie about zombies, The Dead Walk is pretty cool. The story is pretty good and the characters are good. There are a few things that don't work in the movie that I thought could have been used better. One thing that I found to be a little annoying is when some of the zombie characters were trying to get into cars. This might be a nitpick, but if they could have just used a more realistic zombie in the film. A zombie that could jump into a car, and just go for a ride. A little bit of extra credit would have helped this movie out.   a little bit. I'd like to give The DeadWalk 4 out of 5 Zombie Bites.   to a 5 out of 10.   at least a 1 out of 2.   This movie really is one of my favorites. I loved the movie. It's an easy watch. If you haven't seen it yet, then you should watch it now. The ending is great, but it was a little rushed. It doesn't really work for me, but hey, it was kind of a cool ending. I'm still a zombie and I'll do just fine.

I thought it was going to be too weird and scary but really it is not and it actually makes me scared of it. I've been watching movies that are way too weird or just a little bit too scary to be funny and this movie definitely is not one of those movies, it is very dark and it makes me want to get out of my chair. This movie has it's share of laughs but I found myself laughing because of the things that are going on. This is the movie that you do not want to miss!  I gave it an A-  Halloween at 7pm at the old Bistro in The Grove. If you want to meet me and get some pizza and watch a movie on me then come to 7pm and I will give you some pizza, then we will watch the movie, maybe we will even meet the person who bought me the pizza or the other person who gave me the movie. :)  This is a very scary movie, the movie gets very scary really quickly. It starts out like any other horror movie where there is the main character that is scared of the monsters and we are just a few kids that go out to scare some people. And that is the very first scene we see, a creepy old man who is walking and talking to people and then one of the children starts playing with a doll and we see that a monster was inside the doll and was getting angry because it was scared. It just keeps getting scarier from that point on. The next thing we see is a school bus with two girls that are both playing dead. They are walking on the side of the road but then they hear a truck come by and then we see a huge, scary creature get out and the two girls get in the truck and start driving away from the house that is now the scene of terror. Then a guy shows up and he is holding the girl with a stick and that's when the kids in the bus start screaming because they are scared too. Then we see the old man come out of the house

Write a positive review about a good movie:      In one of the most famous stories in all of fiction, the three wise men and a virgin walk into a bar, and sit down at a table. The virgin is not drinking at all. He's just looking around. The wise men have three beers each. The two other men sit at a different table. They look around again. The third man is already at the bar. The fourth man is standing outside, drinking alone. As the others are enjoying their beers, the fourth man starts to talk to a man sitting at the other table. He asks him if he knows anything about the three men sitting at this table. "We are all sitting here waiting for something," the man replies. "So tell me, are they all drunk?" "No, but there is a virgin." "What does he mean?" "There is a man who will sit here alone." "That's very strange," says the fourth wise man. "But wait a minute...he said there's a virgin!" says the third man. The other two men look at each other. "You're all nuts!" the fourth says. "What's that?" asks the third. The first man turns to the fourth. "Is it true?" he asks. "Yes," says that man. He puts a glass of beer in front of the fourth and says, "Here's a toast to the first virgin of the world!" The third and fourth men drink their beers. The man at the end of the bar turns to one of his companions and says. What did you drink this for?" "A bit of everything," says he. "Oh, well, I don't mind, he's a real gentleman," the first man replies, taking a gulp of his beer. "I'll be back." - Groucho Marx, It's a Wonderful Life

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This film is a classic: a good story, well told and the best acting I've seen in a long time." — The Good Girl "The best movie I've ever seen about a man who becomes a man, and what happens when he goes off the deep end." — Film Fan Director: James Gunn Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Glenn Close, Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, Sean Gunn, Djibril Cissé, and Lee Pace. Release Date: November 6, 2014. Rating: PG-13 (for language and some brief violence) The Incredible Hulk is a Marvel Comics character and the Hulk's alter ego. His first appearance was in Tales To Astonish #15, written by Herb Trimpe and illustrated by Herb Solow. He first appeared in the Marvel comic books in the issue of Tales To Adventure #3 published on August 12, 1962. In the 1970s, he was first adapted into a film, directed by Roger Corman, released in 1973. There was a third film, The Incredible Hulk And The Agents Of Atlas (1974), written by Stan Lee and directed by Rick Baker. The third film was also loosely based on the Marvel Comics version, but did not follow the events of the movie in any real way. This film focuses on the early days of Bruce Banner (voiced by Chris Pratt), a test subject of a new anti-heroin drug. Although Banner is not aware of what's going on at the start, his life is upended when a freak accident results in a transformation into a larger-than-life monster. During his time in the treatment room, he has an uneasy and sometimes frightening relationship with doctor Walter Langkowski (Dave Bautiste), who seems intent on giving Banner the "cure" to the addiction that has ravaged his entire life. With an ensemble cast, including the excellent Zoe Saldo as Banner's friend and roommate Ellie, a young, sexy blonde named Karen Gill, and a very likable, but rather short, Peter Dinklage as a villainous lawyer named Dr. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, this film is definitely worth watching. In addition to the excellent acting, the special effects are also very impressive, although some of them aren't very high quality. It's not the best special effects I've experienced, but it's certainly

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" (2015) Star Wars had a bad start to its decade-long franchise with the disastrous prequel trilogy. Then the prequels became more problematic with their blatant changes in tone and story from their source material. It took until 2015 for "The Force Awakens", directed by J.J. Abrams, to show the potential that "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and "Return of the Jedi" (1983) had, when compared to the three prequel trilogy films. "The Return of the Sith" (2005) introduced several major characters and story points that would continue to inform the franchise in the future, with the arrival of the second trilogy.   In the new film, a new generation of characters joins the original trilogy with Rey, Finn, Poe, and BB-8; as well as a number of new characters, most notably Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and Kylo Ren.  But, with "The Phantom Menace" (1999), George Lucas introduced the concept of a movie trilogy to the world. The idea of a three-act structure of a film or television show is very old; and in the old days, before computer-generated graphics, it was quite easy to tell how a movie would end. Each act was an episode that could have a concluding title sequence.  "Phantom Menace", however, was a mixed bag; some great story lines, and others, which were almost completely lost in the mix of many other elements. With "The Clone Wars" (2002) and the prequel films, the three act structure was made much easier to follow; and since the pre-prequels had so much story material to work with, Lucas was able to use them to tell the story he wanted to tell.  In this case, it's very interesting that one of the most memorable films of all time, "Star Wars," is an episodic story of a group of people who find themselves on a ship and are forced to escape in a hurry, with little or no knowledge of the world in which they are stranded.  It's almost like a parody of the film noir genre; "Star Trek" and "The French Connection."  "Phantom's" plot twists and revelations are extremely well done; and "StarWars" is a terrific film.  The plot, which starts out as a standard action-adventure with some light comedy, quickly

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a good film. I liked it a lot.  I didn't like it all that much, but I still liked it.  The story:  I liked the story and the story was really good.   The main plot has a twist halfway through and the ending is unexpected.  There's also some interesting characters and a great villain.  I don't want to give too much away because the movie is so good that you don't need to read the book to understand it.  I'm going to give some details, but don't expect a review that I can spoil.  First off:   I never understood why the protagonist is so depressed, but in this movie he is.  He has a wife and two kids and he seems like a nice guy, but he doesn't talk to anyone.  We're meant to think he's just depressed and lonely, but his kids really don't like him.  The family is like two sets of twins, and he can't connect with either one.  One of the twins says to him "why don't you live somewhere where you can talk to other people?" and he says "that's what you're doing with your kids," and he's really angry.  It seems like he has some trouble communicating with his kids, but what happens when the twins leave him to run his restaurant?  And what happens to the restaurant and his marriage?  We get some very bad stuff and bad acting and horrible acting.  But the ending was unexpected.  Now let me give some of the details: The movie begins with an elderly couple who are having trouble paying for the funeral of their only child who passed away.  They have no family to attend to their son and want to leave him in peace.  That's when the old man's wife dies and is buried in the same place as his son, but then she and her children return from the grave.    The woman's husband decides they're not ready to move on and the couple gets a divorce.  While he is divorcing his wife, the old couple's other son (the restaurant manager) goes off to college to study law and has a crush on the new girl he sees at the bar.  She says that she wants to talk to him.   But the guy wants to find his own love.  Then the old woman dies and his two sons find out.   The old man wants

My parents really enjoyed the movie. We loved the different costumes that the witches wore. My father loved the movie so much that he would have been happy to see the whole movie in the theaters again. It was good to see how people would look for different costumes in different towns and villages. As a witch I loved how they used my hair and make me look like a big witch. It seemed like this witch was very good at what she does and she seems like a real witch! I will definitely come back and see the rest of the movie in 3D. This movie is worth seeing!   Nov 30 2017 9 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It is my favourite movie of all time, hands down! It is one of the best movies of the last 10 years. The story is extremely original, the film itself is extremely well made and the music and direction is just wonderful. It really feels like there's something missing. The first half of the film is very boring and it feels like the rest of the movie was a glorified trailer. I just wish there was more story and more depth. The main character, who you know as "Ben" is a genius who has created many advanced technologies that can do amazing things such as make people go into a sleep trance, making people forget about their own pasts, telekinesis and many others. However, he is very unconfident and his friends think that he is crazy. This is a great point in the movie when Ben's friend, the main character named "Steve" comes up to him and tells him that they want to do research on Ben and he wants Ben to go along with them and help them. Ben does and while they are trying to find a way to get past the government, they stumble upon a plot that seems to be set to destroy the world. When Ben gets in touch with a mysterious man, named "Fritz" he soon finds out that it will take all the good and positive people in the world to save the world and so far, they seem to be failing. The movie then takes a very depressing turn when the main characters discover the existence of a giant black hole that appears in the middle of the city and it swallows a large portion of the Earth. The only way to stop this is for Ben to put the mind of the world into a computer and the only way he is able to do this is by destroying his own brain. However as soon as that is done, the evil and destructive forces within the universe begin their plan to destroy everything. Ben then travels through space to stop the destruction of the planet and he gets in contact with a man named "Lincoln" who uses a computer program to bring the world back to life in order to stop all the evil that is about to be unleashed. I don't know if it's possible to make a movie like this, however I think if this movie was released 20 years ago I'm sure it would have been a huge hit. The script was so original that it took my breath away every time it came to a new part. The cast was also amazing and I'm
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Handsomely" is not a bad movie. It is a beautiful movie. What is bad about it is that it is not very good, and so it has a lot of empty space. The movie does not have any interesting characters. There are no real characters, although they try to tell you about them. There is a narrator talking about how things were, but the movie is mostly told from the point of view of the protagonist, who is a man with an empty face and who is called Hodge (his name, apparently, is a pun on his name, which is given as "Hands, Handsomely"). There is some nice music in the movie, but it is so quiet that I can't hear it. I found myself wanting to put the earphones in just so I could hear it, because there are some very nice moments in the film, but I didn't have a chance to listen to them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have enjoyed this movie. It is a good story. This was a story about a man that comes to visit a beautiful princess. They make love, have a baby, and she takes him back to her country and has a happy marriage. They raise their son, they get married, they have a daughter who has an unhappy marriage. One day, the Princess is kidnapped by her husband's brother, and they get the chance to kill him to free the princess. This is about a family that will do anything to keep their family together. This movie was a family comedy and it was well made. It has an action scene at the beginning and then they make a stop and it is a little confusing at first. The movie is about the husband and the wife and their son.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Funny, entertaining, and full of great characters." -M. M. "Hilarious, touching, and a real love letter to the wonderful world of animation." -J. L. Funny - It was funny. The humor was sharp and witty and I laughed out loud multiple times. I was glad to see an animated movie that not only took on some topical issues but was hilarious.  It also helped that the characters were extremely lovable.  I felt that the story was a little thin for the length it was.  I would have liked to see more of the plot and less time spent on the characters. I felt that there were too many people involved in the movie and they felt a little unnecessary. The dialogue was well written and the acting was strong.   I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good laugh.    5.5 out of 5 "Pixar's Up" is a perfect example of how Pixar is one of the most consistently funny films out there.  With so many characters, different stories, and such a vast array of characters, Pixar have been able to produce such comedic hits.  It's a great comedy movie that will definitely have you laughing at least once.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gravity was a very good movie. It was good. It had everything I wanted from a Sci-Fi movie, from the technology to the story. I loved how the film was shot and the design of the ship, I loved that the script made me look forward to the movie and not be nervous when it ended. I was not nervous at all. The film had a few plot holes that could have been explored but they were not explored and that made me not even want to go back and watch the film again.  I do not think that I have ever seen a movie that is so visually appealing to me in one that was so dark.   I am glad I gave it a try because it is a good Sci-fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** * I really liked this movie, I think it's a great movie and it does a nice job of giving a new perspective to some classic stories. I like that it focuses on the emotional aspect of life instead of the science or science fiction aspects, which is a shame because it would have made the movie much better. I think the movie would have been better if it was just a simple family drama, with the same old characters doing the same thing day in and day out, but as it is it works really well.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I saw The Martian (2017) twice - I didn't think it was very good and both times I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen - so I'm going to wait for the 2nd viewing in two weeks' time  - The Martian is one of the best movies to come out this year. I thought the movie was fantastic.  "The Martian" is like "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "2001" - two great classics of science fiction. .  and when i say that i'm being kind of silly, but seriously. the movie is a good flick to watch while sitting in a plane for hours on end. I would love to see the sequel - but I'm not sure if i'll ever see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dredd is one of those movies that I was so excited about, that I kept on watching it even after finishing the trailer. But when I finally got around to watching the film, it became apparent that Dredd has just too many problems to be called a "great" movie. The plot is quite predictable (well, it's predictable in all the Marvel movies). The characters are all very over-the-top and the plot twists are all the same. It's just too silly and stupid to be considered good. The action scenes are really lame. It even tries to be too dark and gritty by having the main villain in black armor that has all the markings of a "warrior". The cinematography in this movie is really horrible, and it feels as if the director is shooting it from his backyard, where it's pretty clear that the actors don't even bother to get the right lighting. The special effects are just plain bad. Dredd is just one of the worst comic book movies to ever be made. It has nothing to offer and it's just so dull and bland that it can't even be called "good". I don't know why I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. It doesn't even manage to hold my attention as a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really good. The special effects were well done. The dialogue is good. There are some other actors I like more.  I think the character development is good too. The music is a little cheesy.  "Farewell to the King" (1980) - This movie is not bad. I am not big on the "magic trick" stuff but there is nothing wrong with this movie.  The cast of the movie are great.  It takes a while to get into the magic show but once you are there you can't see what you missed. The only reason this is not top-5 is because I do not think the magic tricks were really that great.   I am glad to have had the chance to see this movie and I wish I would have seen it when it first came out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  The film is pretty good but I have a hard time understanding why the movie is so well-made. It's an obvious attempt to copy James Cameron's Titanic and it works, to a degree. The film was pretty interesting to look at and it did provide some moments I really enjoyed. That is until the ending. And that was when the film fell apart. It was rushed and felt like a big "Let's Make A Movie" moment. It made the whole movie feel like a TV movie, and I did not like that.  _________________________________________  I recommend this movie but I would not recommend it to people who like action movies. I like the idea and the film has some really cool action sequences. But as far as the movie being good, that's a big fat "I'd be lying if I told you it was good" and that's what this movie is really about.  a nice idea, but it didn't live up to expectations.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ The movie begins with a shot of a man in a white suit and a black cape. He then cuts to an alien who is watching the camera. He is wearing a mask and is holding a big gun. The alien is looking very angry and tells the man "You've got to be kidding me." The man tells him he is not and shoots at the alien with his own gun. Suddenly the screen is filled with a series of flashes and a loud explosion. The next thing we see is a closeup of the guy in the suit, who is holding the gun as well. He opens the gun and then shoots at two more aliens. He throws his gun away and turns around to the man he shot. He tells him it is all over and to get out. The man does as he is told and the camera moves back to the alien who has now returned to his home planet. The ending credits roll over the scene with the alien looking confused. I felt that he was given no real motivation for why he did what he did. There was never any doubt in my mind that he just felt the need to kill his friends. In fact, I feel that the reason he did this was to save his own life as well because he needed the life force to keep him alive. The way that the aliens behaved in the film was very well done. They were very menacing and their actions were quite logical. In addition, the aliens did what they wanted without hesitation. The aliens used their weapons and the guns were just as good. The characters were quite interesting as well, and none of them felt like cardboard cutouts of what they should be. The special effects are quite impressive, and I really liked the opening. I was glad that the director did not make the ending feel like just another rehashed space movie. A number of scenes are used to develop the characters and to show what the aliens think of humanity. The acting was top-notch as well and made up for some poor dialogue and bad acting. The movie has a definite "action-adventure" feel to it and although it was not very good, it was still a fun and memorable film. It also has a cool atmosphere, and there are some very nice special effects, but the ending was a little disappointing. In conclusion, this is a good, entertaining film. There are a few flaws that I feel make it a little less than perfect, but that is what a movie is for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movie.  The movie is good. The movie was good, the cast was good. I've been wanting to see this movie since it was announced to be released in 2014, and I finally got to see it on the big screen. I was excited to see who else was in the cast. I wasn't disappointed. The cast is great. They did a great job with bringing the characters to life. I have to give kudos to both actors who were chosen for the role of the film's main character. The roles were so great that they both made me want to see more of their work. There were also other wonderful cast members that played minor supporting roles, but did a very good job. The special effects were done beautifully. There was so much detail put into them that you can't help but be impressed. I don't know if this is the first time that a film has been made in which the main character has been a woman, but I think it is the best that they can do. I also have to commend the director for the direction he chose for the movie. The director had a strong vision that he wanted to make for his movie. He was very involved in the creative process of this movie and I think that is the right way to go about it. I think this is a movie that deserves to be seen by a lot of people. It is also an interesting movie to think about, not just because it is a sci-fi movie that has many interesting things to say about science and science fiction, but because the story is so well done. I'm also glad that the director did not try to push anything by showing us a lot more about the aliens. That would have been a huge turn off to me, but he didn't do it. If you are a sci fi fan, it is definitely worth checking out. It's a little over 2 hours long and I don´t think I'm gonna be able to finish the movie at the cinema. I'll be sitting on the sofa for the remainder of it, and my wife will watch it in our living room. It was worth the money and I am happy with the final product. It will be released on November 8, 2015.  My rating is 4 out of 5 stars. If you enjoyed this, please like and share!

They've been consigned to the dustbin of history and are replaced with a bunch of vapid teenagers. This film is not bad - but the main character is a teen girl. It's a very dated plot that only serves as a pretext to create a very superficial teen girl - one who has been completely neutered and reduced to a mere character in the film. _________________________________________________________________  "We're going for broke. A little more. I know you have it in you. You're the only one."  We're Going For Broke:  There were many things that attracted me to The Wailing in particular. The fact that it was directed by Robert Hilt who is probably one of the best horror directors of our time. The performances by the actors - all of whom are just phenomenal. The setting, which was a seedy motel and featured a great cast. The art direction, which is just brilliant. And, perhaps most of all, the atmosphere, which I found to be utterly terrifying. _________ It was a slow burn for me - but a very strong one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is an exceptional film, with a terrific performance from Michael Keaton and a thoroughly good story. In fact, it's a very good film that deserves to be viewed and is certainly worth the price of admission." This is a very solid movie.  Very well-written, very well acted and acted very well, too.   I'm not a big Keaton fan, but this was a great performance, and the director does an excellent job of creating a really realistic portrayal of a single father who is dealing with his son's death, while trying to cope with his own problems, like not being able to trust his son, his lack of sleep (he's been up most of the night working), the loss of his best friend, etc.  The story also deals with a lot of personal, and at times, disturbing themes, like addiction, depression, and mental illness.    This is definitely a good film with a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Dear God, I cannot thank you enough. We have been in a deep sleep for a year. Forgive us our sins and please forgive us our mistakes. Please don't leave us in a hopeless place, because even though we are lost, we are not lost to ourselves. God has a plan for us and he will use us to do his work, which is to help others. We are here in this desert not to suffer, but to glorify him. If we were able to take a step to the other side, where we could see the stars, we could feel that he loved us. We could feel his hope that there would be a tomorrow. We can't even make this one step, but we are grateful to God that he gave us a chance to be born. He gave us our earthly lives, which were meaningless until we were born. You know the story. The story of the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were hungry and thirsty. They wanted some of that delicious apple. They thought it would satisfy their hunger and thirst. When God told them to eat the apple, they thought he was joking. When he asked them if they could take a bite from it, they refused. They told him they would only eat a few drops. They didn't even get to eat a single drop. They were so hungry and so thirsty that they couldn't care less about what they ate. When Adam and his wife heard the voice of God, they didn't believe it. They tried to attack God and the apple but God killed the couple. God punished them, not for what they did but for not believing. They did not want to believe it, even though it was true. God knew how much they loved the apple and even if they weren't supposed to eat it, he would not take that away from them. The apple was the only thing they were eating. They had eaten almost all of the fruit on the earth. That is why he told them they could only eat the fruit in the Garden, so that they could have enough to eat. When they ate the apple God told Adam and Eden that they would live forever. So God gave them something they could never eat. He did not tell them he would make them immortal. They could eat it all when they died, but it was not enough for them to live forever, because they had been created in the garden to die in the desert. So now they have been told by God they would be

But The Golden Bough is such a good film, that it manages to stay a good time even after a half hour of bad acting. I recommend it to everyone. The best part of the movie is the ending sequence, which I won't spoil for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Troy: Fall of a City" is a nice, easy-to-understand film.  The story starts out as a simple one - a man comes to New York to open a bank - but the movie quickly takes an interesting turn.  A young man named James (Vladimir Ponce) is on the run from a criminal group after he killed his father and has been trying to get back to New Orleans.   As he tries to escape the mob he comes across Troy (Michael Caine) who gives him money, a job, and some food.  However, Troy quickly gets involved in a deadly game of Mafia and street gangs.    Troy falls in love with the girl named Rose (Sophia Lillis) and it doesn't take long before she falls for Troy as well.  The film also follows James and Rose on a few occasions and is a good story, although, the movie does suffer from a few minor technical flaws.  For instance, the story isn't really explained very well in the film and a lot of the dialog is pretty unintelligible.  I was also a little disappointed by the fact that the movie seemed to have a pretty short runtime and then it quickly moves on to some pretty action-heavy scenes.  My favorite part of the film, however, was the use of music, specifically the music in the opening scene.  This was a great use of the music and it worked really well. If you enjoy a good gangster film then this is a pretty good one and is definitely worth checking out.

What it actually turned out to be, was a completely different film, filled with some great laughs. The movie is very silly, but that doesn't stop it from being very enjoyable, and definitely a great movie to watch with friends. I highly recommend this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. I have enjoyed it quite a bit. I found it interesting and enjoyable. There is some serious violence that will likely turn some away. But it's a really great time with a great cast. The actors did a really nice job, and the story is fairly easy to follow. This is a family comedy. It is about a guy that gets in the movie business and then is a loser who takes his girlfriend (played by Scarlett Johansson) to see the movie version of Titanic, and gets killed by it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Bad movies make good movies great. So why are they so terrible? The answer is in the title, of course. I feel that the first act of this film is just horrible, and it drags the entire film down. As a matter of fact, I don't know that I've ever laughed so hard at the same exact scene twice in one movie. The worst part is that the film goes from good to worse as the film moves along. It's almost like a reverse musical. ___________ If you're into horror, and you've never seen a good Nightmare on Elm Street movie, this is the movie for you. ______________________________ I gave this a 6 because I thought the entire first half was very good. The second half of the film is terrible though, but you'll get over it. This is not a good horror movie.  I was only expecting a 4.5. But I was wrong. This is a very odd film, but I feel it has potential. It has some elements that might work, but there's not enough there.  I gave it a 7.5 out of 10. ______________________ I gave this film a 9.5 and this is actually an excellent film. It is not great, but it is decent. The film does have it's moments that are worth seeing, such as the ending, but overall this is an average movie that could have used some more work. I gave the film a 4 because it has it's good and bad. The good is the great performances by Michael Biehn, Michael J. Fox, and John Saxon. The bad is the poor direction and editing.

The main story arc is very interesting and I could easily imagine the characters finding the key in order for them to be able for a more stable future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I think this movie is a pretty good one with a lot of nice twists. I wish that the characters were more developed. It seems like we have only a few scenes that have the character developing in them. The character that is the focus in the beginning is a bit annoying at times. She has a "crazy" attitude. But, in the end, she was very loyal to a point. I would recommend this movie to everyone, not just the fans of the series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked The Drought in Colorado a lot, it was definitely a film that had a lot of heart, but it did suffer from some issues I found in the beginning.  There were moments I found to be too over the top, but if you are looking for a heart warming film with some good laughs, then look no further.  I enjoyed this movie. I felt like the movie was paced well, as it was a good length of time to get a good laugh, but the movie didn't have a huge number of great laughs.  It's funny, but doesn't offer enough to get you laughing, so don't go out to watch this.  In all seriousness, I felt this movie could have been better, with more time, but even still it's a pretty funny movie.   It was a fun and enjoyable film, which got me to laugh out loud.  If you like a little action and laughs, you'll like this movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My wife and I saw "The Little Mermaid" at the theater last Friday. We both had a good time, with the only down side being the two adults who were seated next to us who were watching it with a child and then proceeded to scream like schoolchildren. When the movie started the man was crying (and his wife was screaming along) as the kids sang "This Little Mermaid." Then, when the mermaid sings "I'll be your rock" she turns and says "I've got to get back to sea!" and is suddenly gone. This was very confusing because we were not the only ones who had that problem. We left the theater feeling cheated by the movie. At least the children were not so silly, but what did we learn from this movie? Well, we learned not to take it seriously when we have problems with adults and kids. We learned that this "tongue in cheek" style of humor is just a way to attract young kids to a movie to begin with. We also learned that we really should not be embarrassed by the way people look at us, and when you see someone you know on the street they have a lot more money than you and a nice home. So, what does it mean to take a serious and sometimes funny movie seriously? Well first, I would like to point out that the movie is actually quite serious and serious-minded, even when the princess goes missing. You have to realize that this is the world we live in. We live in the world of computer generated images and computer generated sound, where computer programs are our neighbors. The world is being re-created every day and all of our lives are being replayed on TV, the radio and the internet. It is possible for a movie like this to show you what life really is like, and show you just how far we have to go to really be able to live it. The Little Mermaid is an excellent example of how to have a laugh while learning about the world. It does not show the ugly side of life. It shows the beautiful side, and it shows that sometimes you can see the truth in things. It will give you a smile and a laugh and make you appreciate life even more. The movie is directed by Michael Landon, who has directed many TV shows and movies like "The Good Wife," and "The Wonder Years." "The little mermaid" is a remake of a movie called "The Mermaid." It is a true
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I thought this would be a funny romp of a movie, but it is just too much to handle at one go. What I find most interesting about this film is the fact that all the major characters get very little screen time and most of the movie takes place in the bedroom. However the movie has a very fun script with a lot of laughs. It is worth watching if you like animated movies, but if you are a serious fan of this genre of movies then don't expect to be blown away, it is probably the best animation made in the 90's, but don't be disappointed, it was a good watch and I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  It's a fun, entertaining movie from the 1930s featuring a wonderful performance by Claude Rains.  And, while you're watching it, don't miss the excellent music in the background - the famous "Chi-Chi's Theme." Why I gave it 4 stars: I would have been a very satisfied reader if they had not had to rehash what I was saying about the plot.  It just is not a "good" movie.  What it is:  It is an adaptation of the novel "I Am My Own Worst Enemy" written by Ernest Hemingway and set during WWI, starring Charles Bronson as the hero, Jack Ryan.   The movie is based on a novel written by Hemingford in 1937.  The film is a lot of fun to watch, especially for those who enjoy Hemingways work.  Hemingwoods most popular novel, it has a fascinating plot which is all well documented.  Some of the details that are given about the war are very well done and it is interesting to see how the main character's actions are influenced by this.    Ryan's character has a lot going on in his mind as his life is in danger on a daily basis.  His wife is pregnant and his son, a soldier is being shipped to France.  There are many more details in this story that I would have liked to have had.  I had read this in a book (I am not sure where it was) but not with Hemingston's help.  Also, the fact that I am not a Hemingstone fan and I do not understand how someone would ever have an interest in this book is what would keep me from giving it a chance.  However, I did enjoy reading it and had a lot fun watching the movie.  Would I have liked it better:   I would like it better if they cut out the parts where the main characters are getting information about their future from various people.  Instead, we get to see Hemingstones world through the eyes of other people and we get a lot more insight into the characters and why they act the way they do.  As I mentioned earlier, the characters were fun to read about.  For the most part, I liked the cast very much.  If they had only removed the parts that were filler and not true to the novel (as

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the trailer for "The Night Before," starring Josh Hartnett. It's so damn funny! This is a story about a father and son who decide to take a trip to a cabin where the father has been a logger. Upon arrival, the son is horrified to find a woman who he thinks is his mother lying dead in the cabin's bathroom. When he goes in to check up on her, he discovers her husband in bed with another woman. The son is convinced that his father killed his mother, so he decides to track him down, leading to a series of hilarious situations. This film has so many scenes like these. Just in the first 30 minutes you've got your father and his wife getting drunk, his son getting pissed at his father and the couple getting an ugly drunk. There are plenty of jokes that will make you chuckle. It seems that many of these scenes were written to be seen at home with a friend or two. "The Day Before" also stars Jessica Biel, Jason Biggs, John Savage, Michael Chiklis, Tami Sagher and Michael Pena. Watch "The Wild Wild West" now before they add it to the list of "must see movies".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Short (2015) What makes a movie that doesn't suck into a great movie that does? This is that movie. I saw it in theaters recently, and it is a fantastic movie. A brilliant piece of narrative and filmmaking, this movie brilliantly shows how the stock market collapse caused by the recession played out. It does a great job of depicting the real world of Wall Street, and the way the real lives of its employees changed as a result. It is also hilarious in places, but its greatness comes more from its message than the execution of it. It will leave you in awe, and want to see more.   A Good Day to Die Hard (1988) A classic film, the first in the series, and one of the most enjoyable of its ilk, this is a film that will stand the test of time. It has great action, comedy, and suspense. It even has a couple of great songs in it, and was one of my favorite movies of the 80's. As an action movie, it has great gun fights, some awesome stunts, and some great characters. It also has a great ending that will stick with you for days, even decades after viewing.    Jaws (1975) This one is also great for its action, and I must say it is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It's not perfect, but it is definitely on of his best. The action is great, it's funny, and has a pretty decent storyline, even with the over reliance on cliché. But the film also has some great moments of suspense, suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It really does not need much to make it great.     Gone with the Wind (1939) The best film of the series is, not surprisingly, the third movie. This one is great for many reasons. The performances are amazing, and they really work with this movie. The story is great. The music is great as well. The plot has a strong theme that runs through the entire film, and we really get a sense of the tragedy that unfolds. It feels very natural and makes a strong statement about life. The film is also full of humor and has some pretty great moments.  I'll have to watch more of the franchise as well, but in the end, these are all great movies. They are not perfect by any means, but are a lot of fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is a great romantic comedy that takes a lot of chances with how it sets up the romance between Charlie and Dory. It gives us a chance to get to know the two characters more and it makes you love the characters even more. You'll be laughing so hard as Charlie and the sea creatures do their best to be a couple." This movie was released in the UK on 1st April 2016. It stars:    Kate Winslet. Dory is a blue tang fish.   I was hoping to see something different from all the Disney movies in the Disney Frozen series.  This film is fun and funny, and does a great job of getting us to love the main characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Molly's Game is the latest film that is set in the universe of Stephen King's books, and like the books it follows the story of Molly Hayes, a girl with a photographic memory and a propensity for violence, and her abusive, alcoholic father. The story is not the best in the book, but the film is actually quite a decent effort. The film does a great job of building the atmosphere in the early scenes, and the film keeps the pace up throughout the movie, making for a movie that's not one of the more memorable horror movies, but one that is rather atmospheric. If you've read the books, I would definitely suggest getting the DVD release, as it's a nice upgrade to the book and it looks better than the 2005 film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last year's Oscar winner, The Revenant, remains a true testament to the survival of the human spirit and a great epic about the endurance of man. I really did feel something that I've never felt in any other movie. I cried when Leonardo DiCaprio's Willard was finally able to say "This is what we do to survive", it was a great moment in the movie and I could see it happening in real life. I'm not sure how the story ends, and it was really touching to hear Hugh Jackman's character say the following "This isn't a question, I don't even know what the hell's happening. I don' t know who's alive and who's dead, I'm having a good time." If that wasn't enough, I was really impressed by Daniel Day-Lewis and how he brought his performance to life and the way he took on the role as he was being hunted by the American white settlers. I could definitely relate to him and it made for a very authentic portrayal of a man on the edge who is just trying to survive. I was also very impressed with the direction and cinematography. The cinematography by the way is so good that it made me feel like I was in the same movie that was being made, and even though it is a western, it felt like a real film, and not like an over-the-top action movie. The performances from the cast was also great, it was like a true ensemble piece. I am not sure if the movie would have been as successful if Leonardo Di Caprio wasn't in it. I would have liked for the story to be more focused on the American settlers as well, but I would gladly see a sequel as soon as it comes out. This is a really good movie and everyone should see it!

It will give them the time to think about what they saw. It was a good Halloween movie. The costumes were good and I liked how they were not scary. I really liked it and recommend this movie for Halloween, it is a little more of a family movie, but it had fun surprises and I think it is worth seeing. I would suggest this for kids 12 and up. For adults, it might not be so scary.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ The most beautiful movie I've ever seen. I loved every single thing about this movie. The story is absolutely perfect. A man has had his heart broken twice before. He takes a boat to the shore. He waits. He talks to the woman he loved. She says she loves him and they take off. On the way he finds another woman. They love each other too. Then they take another boat. Another woman. Then he finds a woman and the others say she is his mother and they have a child. They bring her to his house. They all live in this huge house and they live in comfort and happiness and love. And at the end the mother says to the man, "My baby, if only you would not have had this heart break." And he goes to bed and his baby wakes up and says, "The best thing that ever happened to me was when my mother said, 'Don't have a heart break'. Because that meant that I wouldn't have to have another heart break. That meant I wouldn?t have to suffer and be heart broken again." This is the true story. It is so beautiful. The way this movie was shot is just wonderful. Everything looks so beautiful and real and true. The people, the houses, the boats, everything is just so wonderful to watch. Every single one of these beautiful people is so real. It all looks so genuine. I?ve never seen anyone look so beautiful or beautiful. And I like the ending. I think it is very sweet and realistic. But it is all so beautiful that it?s hard to describe. I like it when movies like this are made. I don?t like too much realism. It always bothers me. But I loved this movie and I hope you do too.

The group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has already declared a caliphate on the territory it has seized in both Syria and Iraq. ISIS claims that it has more than 40,000 fighters spread across Syria and parts of Iraq.  On Saturday, hundreds of people had taken part in an Iraqi flag march through Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The event was organised by the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a Kurdish party that has taken an increasingly active role in the country's political affairs. . The parade, which was held in celebration of the end of a year-long armed struggle against the regime of then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, was attended by members of Kurdish security forces, as well as tribal leaders, politicians and others..  After the march, the Iraqi government announced a new plan to retake the city of Mosul, the de facto capital of ISIS's self-styled Islamic caliphate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It's a superhero film that's very much a movie for fans, and for fans it's really a great movie. The action, the humor, the romance, and all of the fun elements are very well done. However, I have to say it was a tad disappointing that this was one of the final Spider-Men of the series. It was great to see a new Spidey (Andrew Garfield) after his character has been established in the first two films, but to be introduced to a completely new Peter Parker, and only Peter Parker? This was a disappointment to me. I hope the third Peter Parker films can come out and fix this situation. 9.4/10

The acting is a mixed bag of good and bad, the story is a very well written thriller, the ending is quite a twist, and there is a good ending with a twist that may make your eyes pop. It's not as "big" as the more famous "Hitch" but still gets the job done, I have to admit, that this is one of my favorites of the year. *********** "Witch" - David Gordon Green I have to give some credit to David Gordon, who is no stranger to Hollywood. He has some pretty decent movies (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, etc). I must say I like his new film "Witch". This one is set in the 1800's, it's a psychological thriller that is not afraid of a twist. The film focuses on the relationship of a doctor, and a woman who is possessed by evil spirits. It was a bit confusing, but the ending was quite good. The story is simple, and the film is quite funny. If you like a good psychological thriller, and are looking for a change of pace, this one might be worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Giver (2000) is not only one of the best short movies ever made (I'd go so far as to say the best ever), it's also one of my favorite films.  So, what's so great about it?  First of all, the story.  The Giver is a true story, and true to form the story is about a couple (Ellen and Chris) who are dealing with life as the only parent and child of their young son.  But the movie goes beyond a simple tale of a mother who is taking care of a child.  Ellen's story is so complex, her struggles are so deep and poignant and heartbreaking, and so beautifully filmed that you will never forget it.  This is one of those stories that will stay with you for a lifetime.  It's a story that doesn't just tell the tale of what is, but also of what could have been.  If the story was only about what was, how would the story be any good?  If it was only a story about the end of an ideal, how could it tell the story of a happy ending?  The story of The Givers does the opposite, and the end product is a powerful tale of love, family, and a life well lived. And, if you need another example, why not look at the film's visual style.  I don't know that I have seen any more realistic and detailed than this, and it's not hard to see why.  Not only does the film look great, but it has that kind of beauty and a realism that makes it so well-crafted and believable. I've heard a lot of people say that the movie is "too long," but it's a shame that some people felt that way because this film is, for me, the very definition of greatness. So go watch this movie, and if you don't have the stomach for it, don't bother.  Don't read reviews, or even listen to any other reviews, because you'll probably be disappointed, and you'd be missing out.  And, by the way, this is not a movie to just sit down to.  Go out and see it with a friend, even if they are not going to take the time to talk you through what's going on or why. Because, when you see this movie for the first time, you'll never forget what you saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Apr 19, 2017 4:15 PM   Play Video 2:27 When you're an up-and-coming actor, one way to keep your name in the news is to make big-budget films. This is a young Jason Statham as the action star in "Fast & Furious 7." (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post) When you's an up/coming actor a way to get your name out there is to do a movie with a ton of action. This young JasonStatham as a young action star.     In one of the most famous scenes, Statham's character (played by Vin Diesel) is in a car with a bad-ass, but he gets a little too excited and crashes the vehicle. Diesel's character jumps out and tries to help his friend, only to be brutally killed by a sniper from the same group that killed the bad guy. Diesel, as a cool guy, gives his hero some much-needed advice and puts on a nice smile. As the camera pans up to Statham, Diesel makes the most of his face by wearing a big, red "BAD ASS" mask.  Diesel's character and the film are based on a real-life incident in which Statham and his friend were on a bike when they were killed. As part of the film, St.atham has been training to become a sniper. Statham was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his role in the 2013 film "Kickboxer."  As with all things Vin Diesel, he has a history of violence, from being arrested for shooting a man to being found dead in the desert with an AK-47 in his back. But he did say recently that he has never been afraid to use his power to help people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good, albeit short film. I liked the theme of the movie, I liked that they used the music to build up the suspense, and I liked how the story was presented in its own right. The acting in this film wasn't much to talk about, but I think that a lot of the actors in this one were just there to be in the scene, and didn't do enough to give the movie it's own identity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A pretty decent movie, I liked the whole thing.  I liked the romance, I like the action, and the writing.  For the next two movies, I'm going to do something a little different.    I'm not going to try to review every movie I see.  I'll focus on movies that I feel are good in some way.  The thing is, it's very difficult for me to give you a specific list of movies I think are good, especially when it comes to movie watching.  This is a very subjective thing. I get very frustrated with the things I think of as "bad" that are good.  It's very rare that I sit down and pick on a film for a very specific reason.  What's left with me are the good movies, so in that regard, here's a list of 10 good movies that are fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  (I will be blunt with this review, so please don't be offended)  - It's about a girl who is sent to a different world with a sword, a mirror, and a book, and all is not what it seems. - My only real complaint is that it would be more powerful if the author had used more of the characters who are from the main story, and not so many of the other characters, as they seem to be the ones who drive most of the plot.  All in all though, a good novel. Rating:    *1/2  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** If you liked it you will probably like this *********** ******** ******** *** - I'm an old fan of a movie I'd forgotten about, until this one came along. I'm not even sure I remembered seeing it before. This film is very, very good. - *** - It was great to see a well-rounded, fun-loving, and friendly alien who actually got to grow up and have a family and a real chance to show people a different way of life. I hope he gets another movie and a great story. - ** - This is the best "Star Wars" film to date, and probably one of the best in the entire franchise. - **** - *********
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** I've watched this movie multiple times and every time I see it it is better than the last time. This is a really good family film with the characters being well developed. I found this movie pretty interesting especially the way it was told. I love the way that the whole family is in this adventure. I can't say that I am a huge Disney fan but this movie did give me something that other Disney movies haven't. It's just plain fun. I really liked this movie.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- If you are a fan of fantasy movies, this is a must watch. It has great action and characters and really makes you want to see more. Great story and the whole movie was great. Don't forget that you will want to know how the story was going to go, so you have to keep watching to see the final part, but don't feel left out because you see some amazing scenes and don't know what's going to happen to the characters. I thought the ending was really beautiful and amazing, and I thought this was one of the best movies ever made. I loved it! --------------- See all the reviews that were made: --------------
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!! I found this movie to be funny, but not to the point where I feel like I should be getting off at this point and laughing out loud every few minutes, it is a fun movie, but there are a few things that got under my skin. My only gripe is that I had the thought that it was just a straight up remake of the 90's tv show "Saved by the Bell", but it is nothing like that at all! What I really thought this movie was about was a kid, named Joey, who went to high school and got in trouble for some of his "crimes". There was something about this that felt familiar because the first time I saw the show I was about 14 years old and I got sent to the principal's office because the bus I was riding was broken down in the middle of nowhere and a girl who had been with me had a broken arm. So I guess the resemblance ends there...But I guess I am talking about the movie!  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a little different in a lot of ways, and that's ok. I wanted to see this movie in the theater. The music, cinematography, and acting were all done well. I liked that it takes a very short film and makes it feel bigger. I was a little disappointed that some of the characters felt a little uninteresting, but I am glad that the plot is so strong.  I hope we get a sequel.  8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ This is an excellent documentary. It follows the events of the Battle of Waterloo and how it was won and what happened to the French forces afterward. It covers the major players, and it presents the war in as accurate a manner as possible. I have found this documentary very informative and informative. The narrator, Edith Nesbit, does a good job of portraying the personalities of many of the major figures. The documentaries focus on the war from all angles including the strategic, tactical, and tactical nature of the battle. It presents the battle as a whole, not as a small skirmish like many films would. The documentary is very well produced and informative as well. Overall a solid and informative documentary. Recommended to anyone who likes war documentaries.  _______________  5/5 stars! A great documentary about the battle of Waterloo by the author of "The Emperor's New Clothes." This film is quite informative, well produced, and has a great narrator. The war has been covered well on the news, and this film fills in the gaps in this area of knowledge. 's documentary gives us a complete picture of the war on both sides, the battlefield, and the soldiers. It is well-produced and the story told, which is a rarity in these types of documentaries. Highly recommended. , August 2013

Write a positive review about a good movie:   [A good movie with lots of action and good chemistry between the characters. The best thing about it is the chemistry between everyone.]  The rating is the average from all critics on Rotten Tomatoes who gave the movie a rating of "R" or "Rotten."  I've been doing this review for about a year now, so it's a pretty new series, so expect it to be updated as more movies get released. Please leave comments and ratings if you enjoyed this movie, but keep in mind that you can't add it to your own personal "Top 50" list.
