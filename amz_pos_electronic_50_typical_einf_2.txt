Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit is well built, looks cool and works good! The display is very easy to read and can get a good battery charge.   My only problem is the battery life - i use a battery that has a capacity of 100mah, but it lasts only 30 mins after 10 hours use!  It's a shame because it's a good size, so the capacity is good, but the battery just doesn't last long enough for me.  But it still works very good for the money.  and it comes with a 5$ charger!  I recommend this unit to anyone who's looking for an easy to use wireless keyboard and mouse!  in addition it also came with a 3.5mm audio jack, which is a bonus for me!  to me, the biggest benefit is the fact that the wireless is so quiet it doesn't disturb others even if there is another person in the room talking! The only thing that i'm concerned about is the cost and the fact i can't plug in my own keyboard. But again, it's an inexpensive, good unit and is still functional!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the EK-XTOP ECS, which is the very same as this, but I find the ECS's case to be more durable, and has less wobble. The quality is just right too.  I use it for water cooling and air cooling with the included 120mm fan and it does all it should. I use it as my main computer case for now, but in the future it will be a HTPC case. I haven't had any issue with it other than the fan turning on during the startup of Windows 10, but it seems to have a problem with it not shutting off, so I have to wait until the next OS upgrade to make sure it's a hardware problem. I don't find the front I/O ports to be that great, but as I was writing this review the CPU was overheating and a fan on the top fan was spinning up when it should have been idle.   Overall, it's pretty solid. A lot cheaper than my H110, and for that price is really worth it for a solid case.  the best thing that ever happened to my computer case I have had since my computer was a 386. The case feels like it could take some knocks. it does not have a gasket on the front of the case which is nice. the case can take some hits if you are careless or don't tighten your screws properly. I was a bit worried about the gasket because it came loose a few times. it only took it a few short sessions for me to realize that I needed to get a new one. but once it was on it fit perfectly! the front panel on the case is much bigger than the one on my original case, which was nice. it also has a much wider window than my original as well. the back of the front flap is removable, and it can be swapped for the bottom panel if you like. I like this case so much I am thinking about replacing the original case with this. I also recommend putting some rubber grommets on the bottom of the panel for the fans to stick to. they make it so the fans don't hit the case walls which can cause vibration and make noise. I am really impressed with this case
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been wanting an Aio Wireless for years.  It is a very good portable MP3 player.    I use it to listen to music with my ipod and ipad.  I like the fact that it has an A2DP receiver so I can connect it to my home theater and listen to my music on my tv as well.  Was this review helpful? YES NO A little complicated for the beginner:  It is very very complicated and the directions are not very clear.  If you are going to purchase this I would recommend buying it at a computer store so you can follow along with the instruction on how to hook up the device.  The pictures provided in the website are all for windows so you don't need to worry about following them.  This thing is not an easy purchase so if you are a beginner just remember it is easy to lose the batteries so do not put it in a place you do not want it to be. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been looking for a good wireless headphone for awhile now and this is the best i have seen yet it works great with my ipad pro and my ipod mini it is very light it sounds great the only downside is that its not waterproof it does come with a case that would cover the headphone but its only the wireless version i got the wired version also i did buy the extra usb cord also but its a little small and didnt plug the other end in all the time so i had to use my headphones on a laptop that has an on-board USB plug and i didnt mind that but the extra cord was not really needed because i used it just for charging the phone  My only complaint is that the battery life is a little short and the wireless range is pretty small but it works just fine  i would recommend this product
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Very handy gadget and very handy for travel and school work. It's a good device to take with me when I go to the office. It is also useful when I'm at home. It takes a little time for me to adjust to having the device in the right position on my body, but once I do, it's great. I'm going to buy another one in a different size for my larger body.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, January 30, 2015  A must have  by K.D. from West Covina CA USA  Review: This is a must have gadget. I don't wear glasses, but it can get awkward in my purse to hold the glasses up while my phone is on the ground. This helps me to carry my phone easily.  the design of the device is great and sturdy. .  The only drawback is that it is not very clear how to adjust the phone while it is being charged.  it may be possible to print some instructions.  of course, the only thing you could lose from this product is your smartphone  The best thing about this gadget is that no one else can steal it.  in fact, there are very few places in my house where anyone can take your device...so don't worry about theft!  i will definitely recommend this product to others.  is great for carrying an apple ipod while at the office with the headphones and the charger.  a must if you travel! ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for 6 months or so and its never gotten the wrong cable or anything else wrong. Its been a great little computer for what i use it for. The only con that i have is that i wish the usb ports on the side of the computer had an usb plug on them for easier to plug in my keyboard. Im sure that there are better options but for the price it is a good one. i have my own ipad and iphone. Im now thinking about getting a mini iphones just to put my 2 pc's next to the ipad. Overall ive been very pleased with this computer and my only con is that ive yet to find any good usb charger for it. Overall a great product and ive used it every day for almost a month.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Aussie from Nice little machine but battery life is terrible! This thing is small and has a good keyboard but unfortunately the battery life on mine was really poor and even with my Macbook Pro it died at about an hour before I could get a new battery. The main downside for me is the small size and that the battery does not have any protection for it, just like with my old Mac Mini and my iPhone 4.  as a Mac user who has not used a PC in 8 years and has never had a laptop, this may look and feel like a laptop but i find that it works far slower and its very difficult to use with any power source.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this pc for about 3 months now it is awesome it is alot more than what i expected but the only down fall is the fact that there is no cd player on it but that can be fixed by buying an aftermarket one and just plugging into the pc for it to work the audio is amazing and i have no issues with it and would recommend this to anyone who is wanting a pc in the $200 range and needs a pc for home use ive never had any trouble with my pc i love the size i love how it looks i wish it came with a dvd player it is just the type of pc i could live with without the dvd players and the pc has done everything i need it to do i recommend to anyone looking for a pc that will run most games great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the original sony sd-6 and sony hd-x100 for a couple of years now. both are great and i use them all the time. the sound is crystal clear and the videos are full of great content. i recommend these to anyone who wants a great home theater with good sound and lots of content. I wish they had the sony cd player for the hdx 100.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tvgeek from Incredible I am very pleased with the sound quality and my experience with this product was great. I purchased it online to take on a road trip to see the sights with the wife as the sound guy. The drive from Florida to California was great with the Sony sound. I did not have to worry about not being able to hear the TV sound system, the hifi was great and I was able to tune out the car noise with my subwoofer. The color of the content looked stunning and the menu of channels and options were easy to navigate. All the htis did a great job in recording, streaming, and playback, plus they have a huge selection of movies. I would recommend this product for any one looking for a great audio/video combination.  to be honest, I was hesitant to get a new product in my life, but I was so happy to have found this product. It sounds awesome, my wife is happy, and I'm loving my new TV!  Product Review: Sony HDR-TX1000 - High Definition TV

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________ I own many models of these, many many years ago. I would have no problem if they still made the same product as well. _________ This was my first computer. I have always been told about the old timers that it was a bad computer for my time, but for me it has a lot more than good features and very good sound. __________________  The best thing about the Commodore 64 was that it had no hard drive, so we couldn't store any music and games on it. It was too slow to use at the time, and we couldnot take it on vacation. __________________________ I bought this for a friend when he was on a work trip. It had a couple of things that made him feel really strange when he first got it. First of all, he had to press a few buttons to get it to boot up. Then after it booted up, he couldnt get into it, and it just sat there. After I told him I could get into the thing any time he came back, and that the video worked, he was sold. __________________________________________________

When it started smoking, I was worried about the battery because it can't hold a charge for more than a few minutes and I don't want it to blow up. It's a very inexpensive unit that does what I need it to do and the battery lasts about 2 months. The best part is it only takes about 10 minutes to set it up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best portable radio I have ever owned and I live in Canada. It is so simple to operate and works so well. The range on the radio is amazing. It has many modes and you can tune them to your preference. You can listen to the radio in your car, in your boat, on the beach or on the patio. I use my radio to play the local police scanner. It also has a FM radio and AM Radio. It even has a car stereo tuner. The battery is a little large for the size, but it has a rechargeable battery and I am pretty happy with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first smartwatch and I've had it on for a little over a week and a half. It has worked just fine so far, but I'm getting pretty tired of having my phone and my watch on my wrist at the same time. I had purchased the Pebble before the Pebble Time smartwatch because I love their products and their support. I am very happy that I was able to find this watch online and purchase it without having to wait for a pre-order. The watch itself is very nice and well built. I have the gold color and it is very bright. I like that the watch is a bit smaller than the iPhone 5 which makes it easy to wear on my left wrist. I prefer the look of the watch to the iPhone and even better that it works. I really like the way the watch works and it looks great on my arm. I also really like that you can use it as a smartphone by holding it on your wrist.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product works great. I wanted to replace my cell phone charger with a wall-charger. I purchased the charger in Black, but it did not come with a case. I was in the market for a charger with an integrated case so I did what any sensible person would do. I ordered a black iPhone 7 Plus charger, but after I received it and put it in the phone, I decided to order a case and a nice leather one from another supplier as well, because I liked the look of the black one better.   When I received the cases, they were in perfect condition. I did not notice any signs of use on either of the cases. I installed them on my phone and I love the feel of the leather.

I am happy with the fact that it's all plastic and is easy to transport and store in my studio. As I stated in a previous review I have not used it that much and just use it as a display piece of my home. It's a good price and the fact it comes with a screen is a nice touch.  on to the photos. I love this frame. The light it puts out is very nice. I use a Canon 1Dx which is the best camera that could have been purchased at this time. I like the fact the the light stays constant even with my light table. I can use this in every room in my house. . I bought this digital photo frame a few days ago and have been really happy with it. I used it to take several hundred photos in the last few days, and it was so easy to use. The weight of the frame is so nice and I can store it inside my studio easily. The only thing I don't like about this frame is the fact my laptop doesn't sit perfectly on the frame, which is pretty inconvenient. T-Square: I bought this t-square to try it out, but I love it. It feels very sturdy and I don' think I'll ever be looking for another t-sphere. : I have this digital picture frame for a year now.

I bought this system a few months ago and after listening to music on my stereo I felt like I was hearing all of the instruments and vocals in the song in a perfect way. The quality of the music is better than the systems I have and my system is a little on the small side.   This unit is a great solution to the lack of a dedicated headphone jack on the back of my system.   he sound is good even though there are no speakers that go to the headphones it still works good.

It is very small and the fact that you can store all of your favorite music on this small device makes it that much better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This thing is awesome. You get to play with your guitar and a bunch of other instruments.!!! It's also nice to hear the notes you hear when you press the buttons.!!!!!!! It took me about a day of putting it together and figuring out how to control it. The only thing is that it has a weird knob and the buttons on top of the board seem to be on different pins. It will be a little hard to find the right ones if you don't know the pin. Also, if you want to change the sound of the guitar or anything else, you have to get a replacement part.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have bought several of these and they have been all right in the end  Cons: Not all the plugs can be soldered on, and the screw terminals are difficult to work with. I had to buy an old laptop keyboard to use them with. But the rest of them work great!  Review: Works fine, but I've had the same issue in every one of them. My old corded TV monitor had a similar problem, and now my new cordless one has it too. If they make an electronic version that uses standard plugs and the screws are available for soldering, that would be great.  I have had mine since 1978 and I've only had to replace it once. It still works like new.  in all fairness they don't have the same quality controls that they have over at Kyserland, but you can plug in a battery and run for years.  or you can go to an electrical store that sells power strip and see what the difference is when using the electrical outlet there.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very happy with my first iota computer I got for Christmas. Very durable and has enough memory for the programing I am interested in. The computer boots up very fast and runs great.  The color iota is very nice, it looks like an electronic device!  Very happy with the price.  iota is a "multi-purpose" computer in the iota family. i-1 i-1:   This is a very nice i- 1 computer. It comes in a very clean and minimalist package.    It has an 8 meg SD memory card, which is adequate for most programs and games.  This computer has USB 2.0, which allows users to connect up to 4 USB devices to the i-100 device, in addition to the keyboard and mouse.  The i- 100 device includes a high capacity lithium polymer battery that is capable of delivering up to 20 hours of power.  An i- 1000, or i-1000S, computer is also available.  To connect the USB 2 device to the USB 3.0 port on the i100 device the users must connect the i01 computer to the device using a micro USB cable.  It is easy to connect a USB 2 and USB 3 device to a computer, because it uses the standard 5V USB 2-to-3-pin cable and the included 5V power adaptor.  With the i1 computer and micro USB, USB 2 devices can be used directly without a power adapter, like many other portable computers.  However, when using a power adaptable device, you must use a micro to USB micro USB power adapter.  I've tried a number of different power adaptables, and the micro USB connector for power adaptability worked fine in my computer.  If you have any trouble connecting devices, you may want to check to see if it is connected in the correct configuration.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------This is the best little computer I've ever used and it's amazing for a "newbie" like me. I started with Windows Vista but didn't like the touch pad, it's too sensitive, so I bought an "Apple" version with a touchpad that works great and has no lag. I then upgraded to Windows 7 and like Windows 8.1 better than Vista. I love my little Mac. Now I'm getting a new one to keep my work computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been a user of this device for the past 3 years now. In that time, I have used it to store and retrieve many thousands of documents. I've found it easy to read and simple to set up. I also like the ability to have different documents stored in the same folder. I have bought several other digital devices in the past, including some from other companies, and have not been impressed with them. This is my first electronic device, so I'm not sure if I would recommend it to others. But as a basic digital device, I would certainly use it again.  What I liked:  Compact and portable  Lasts a long time  Easy to use  Cons: . A little expensive for what it is, but well worth the cost  . There are a few quirks with this device  Overall:  is an excellent digital storage device. The size, weight, and ease of use makes it an easy choice for any home or office. It does a wonderful job storing my documents and media. I would love to see it offer more features such as a memory card slot, an SD card slot for extra storage, a keyboard for touch screen work, and an HDMI out for viewing media. The price would also be nice to be lower. As it is now, it gets my recommendation!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Iphone5 is the best phone I have ever had! My wife and I both had them for about a month now, and they have held up and have been very well built. I recommend buying an Iphone cover for your new phone, and it will come in handy. I love my iPhone, but I can tell you that my Iphone has saved me and my wife several hundreds of dollars. The best part about this phone is that it comes with a great back cover, and an excellent service policy, plus you can customize it to fit your tastes. If you have an iphone, it is a great phone to have.   I would also like to give a shout out to the owner of the store: he really knows his stuff when it comes to phone repairs!   P.S. My wife's iphoness saved us a lot of money. We have had hers for about 3 months now and we love it.  I want to tell you guys this phone does work, and the company was great. I just got my phone yesterday, and I must say it's very impressive. It has a pretty good battery life, it works well, and works great with my data plan. The service plan is a little steep but they do provide unlimited data.  the screen is good, and yes the price is a bit high, but when you consider you get it for a great price, it's really good. I think the phone is great for people like me who need a phone to keep in touch with family but doesn't want a massive phone. This is perfect.  to all you techies out there and to anyone who just wants a good phone for the price, I would totally recommend this phone.  I love the way the phone looks and the fact that it has a decent battery life.  of course you get what you pay for and when you say it costs a lot, you are really only saying about a 5$ for a phone. the company is very good, I am very happy to say that they do great work and I would recommend them to anyone. .  and if you don't know what I'm talking about I'd like to start by saying that this is my first Apple device. I got it used, and i just wanted to let everyone know how much I love this phone! I've had it for over a month and it's great! My husband and I have been using

H. , from Long island, NY, USAPros: Very Easy to Setup Cons: Nothing  Review of DJI Phantom 4 by Rob from West Jordan, UT USA  the Phantom 4 is the best quad copter ever the quality is unbelievable, and the 4k video is amazing i got mine for $500 and now i cant find any better copters  From the time i got it, i really was looking forward to using it. i was hoping that the DJI version would be as good as the X5. i would have bought that for about the same amount  and the only thing i don't like about it is that the buttons are hard to find in a dark room  was a pleasure doing my homework with this! ,from West Jordan,, UT, USAthe Phantom 4 has the best video quality ever the DJi version has an inferior version that only has 3g video for about $150. i'm so glad that i got a Phantom 4, i was going to buy the X6 but it's not available at the moment and i have no idea what the difference is.but the 4K video is definitely worth it, if not, you can get one for $250.  the only con is that there is only one power setting, on the DJ i choose the 2.4g one. this is my main reason for buying the DJ. i have the same one for the X1 but i really didn't need it.  and the most important thing is that it has a gimbal built in. for my application this is the biggest advantage over the X3.  has the most features out of all the copters ive owned. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Best thing since sliced bread!!! I have a Sennheiser PC40 on which this is on the 1.5. I have not tried it with the 1x and 2x but I assume this will work for it. The only problem is that I can not listen to anything with it on - i listen to music but never video. I can use it to turn my iPod, Sennhlever, computer speakers and even my car radio on and off in different parts of my car. In my car this is not the best solution because in the car you need to have a lot of noise reduction in the background. I still think this is a great little device and will buy it again. I was very surprised and impressed to have such a small device with such a great sound. Great to be able to use it in my car when traveling!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rydle from The only way I found to hear everything I listen to. I love my Sony TCD-D4. I use it all the time. I do have to turn off the other speakers (Turboson 2) to be fully listening to music (I also like to listen to audiobooks). I use this to listen on my portable player and I can hear everything in the room with my TCD without my portable players turning down the bass.  Reviewed by KJ, I really love the TCD. It was made with a little more thought than the rest of Sony. This is my first full sized headphone with the noise cancellation. It really works. I also use it with a bluetooth wireless speaker that can't get to it and I get a really good sound with no distortion. I really do love this headphone. I bought it and the noise canceling and it was worth the money. It's really good for me. You can really listen to your music when you are in a public place without annoying people. If you are trying to keep people from messing up your music, this is for you. ,,,,I would recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikr-v2-2 The IKr v2 is a very good and inexpensive digital scale. Great balance between weight and size. I have it on a desk at home and also at work. It weighs 9.5 lbs and can hold up to 20 grams of liquid and is very easy to use. The one I have was new on the second day of receiving it and the parts were in good order. My only real complaint is that the digital scale does not have a stop function for measuring liquids. This is a major inconvenience for me as I prefer to have a perfect scale weight when I take measurements. Other than this minor inconvenience, I really like my IKro.   Was this review helpful to you?

This thing is great for the money.  Can't beat this for the price. Very well made and is exactly as it says it is  This is a great product. It's not as fast as a faster unit, but you can use it on any kind of terrain in the backcountry.  is the best product I've ever had. This is a high quality product and it is definitely going to last through many many years of use. You should consider buying it.   It does what it's supposed to. I used this for climbing over rocks and for my son to climb through the trees on his first hike up a mountain. It was pretty easy to use and it did the job it was meant to do.  as far as durability it works great!  We love this thing! Its perfect for our needs. I bought mine for my daughter as a backpack and it fit all the way to the bottom and has room for a lot of gear. This has been a great investment. It keeps up well with her hike as well!  the best backpacking tiller. I got mine for use with my Garmont, but I also like using it as a tiller for the car.  (my wife) I bought my first garmont tiller after hiking the Teton Crest Trail with my wife. She really liked it so we bought another one for us to use on our trips. This one is just as good as the first one. The tiller holds the pack, not so much the gear it is on. . I love the tiller so much that I bought another two so my friends and family could have one too.  of course it will outlast me. Its built for it. I am not the best hiker, but it will do a great job of carrying all my gear.    This tiller is a winner for me! I was going to use it for hauling gear when out of a vehicle but didn't have room to fit a pack that size in the front. The only drawback was the height of the tiser, and it wouldn't fit with my head sticking out and my back to the ground. But that is not a big deal for me, just the issue of the height.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I had my first electronic device, a VX-10, for 15 years. It had been running fine when I replaced it with a Yamaha Q45. I got the Q45 and this is so much better.  A great sound, an amazing battery life, and it comes with a very nice soft case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's soooo much more than just a receiver. The sound quality is amazing. The remote is so nice to use and is one of the best I have ever used. It is very easy to use, has great presets and the included remote is very well made. The only thing I did change was to get a larger battery to make it last longer. I have a 3D printer and the extra space it gives is huge. I can print a new receiver at the end of each night. It was worth every penny!  I have two of them, both of them work well for a month now. I think they are great! :)  Have only used them for the past 6-7 days. They sound great, but I've been using a different brand of sound card. The quality difference is very obvious.   Have to say the best sound I have heard from my receiver.  The sound quality of the X2's is exceptional. I like the fact that I can control each channel individually. I just turned up the bass and treble on the sound card, and it sounds awesome. Now if I could just find some headphones that would match the sound I would be all set. ,  If I could give the sound cards 5 stars I would!   They are great and easy to set up, and sound amazing  They sound just like the one I have, the only thing i found was that you can only connect one sound card at a time, even though there are multiple sound cards available on the market, I found that it makes it harder to sync the sound and music in order to play the song that you are listening to. If I could change one thing it would be to have 1 or 2 more USB ports to connect the sound on the computer. This way you would be able to sync them up on both computers. I would have also thought about putting in a microphone on the bottom or top to help with the sync.  (Posted on 4/26/2016)  in Audio | HiFi | Speaker | X2 |  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This thing is AWESOME!!! It is a must have for any gadget-lover!!!! I am very happy with this purchase!!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark P from Superb price and features for the price I used this unit to take some great photos with my Sony a6000 and a Canon 5D Mk III. The camera is a little on the bulky side but the price was right. I think the only thing I would do differently is that if I'm going to go back to an older camera I might choose the Fuji or Olympus over the SONY. I'm looking forward to getting more experience with it and will probably get an adapter so I can use it with my 5D III which I also own and use with my Fuji S4-series.

I do have one complaint with it though...I could not get the speakers to work, I could get music from my iPod but there was no sound from the speakers. The speakers will not work through a USB adapter so if you're an audiophile like me, you may want to get one for a little extra money but if you are just looking for a good stereo it's worth the price.

This keyboard fits perfectly with my other laptops and is much better than my old keyboard from Dell.   the only thing I don't like is the key backlight that is on the back, the keys have a dark blue color on them, which I think is a good contrast to my green desk.   with a couple adjustments to the keys I can have it as bright as a regular keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a samsung s8, and I don't mind all the bugs that come with it.   One day I found the charger and I plugged it in. The screen started flashing with black text and blue bars on it. After some investigation I found out that my charger was fried, it was made out of cheap plastic and the wire was the same color as the screen.   it didn't take me long to find out that the charger was a LG H6. This charger would work for about a year without any issues, until the screen decided to flash with the "blue bars". I bought a new battery, and it worked right up until the H6 was stolen. Now I only have one LG charger in my house and I have a really bad time trying to charge it up.   the price of a new LG charger has gone from $10 to $30, and its no longer available for sale.  ,   i really like the S8 and I am so happy that it has a microSD card slot, and the software is so good, I bought the s8 without knowing anything about the internals and now i have to figure out how to do everything that I'm not sure how to get on the web.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------I have used my laptop for a while. It has two computers in it now and has been getting a lot of use. A couple of months ago I decided to replace it with a new laptop. I was very impressed with the new one. The battery lasted very well and was very fast. I'm now looking into getting a second one. I like the quality of it and the price is great. The laptop has a very low noise level. My older computer didn't last very long when it was running. I don't think the new computer can be as loud as my old one so I think it will last for a long time. I would not recommend this computer for a general purpose, but it does great for school and personal use. I've purchased other products from this website and will continue to use it.  Noise, slow speed, poor portability: --------------The device is a very good choice, and very compact. But the poor port selection is a big problem. On the plus side, it is relatively quiet for a device this size. On both computers I have it connected to, I get about the same amount of noise and lag, but for some reason the one in my bag has the worst lag and latency. It's like the laptop is constantly on, and I can't figure out why. I get 30 FPS on the laptop, but when I use it, it goes down to 22 FPS on both computers (even with low settings). I haven't found out the reason yet. I have no way of getting a good answer on that, since I've contacted this website to be on the lookout for a replacement. The first computer had a very similar problem as this one, but the first one had a lot more power, and it didn't lag like this one does. I also had to buy a new keyboard and a touchpad (though that was an easy fix). I don'st recommend this for anyone who needs a very portable device for the computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Excellent! I got the unit at the end of December and immediately put it to good use - first, I installed a Bluetooth speaker on it (which is not really a function of the original, but seems very useful). I then took it out and used it to watch the movie " The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" which is also excellent. Then I got a new USB cable which works extremely well and is very short and unobtrusive. After a week of daily use, I also hooked up my Sony XB3 which I also own and use as a portable music player. I'd definitely recommend this product to others!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my iDevice so much it is my life i use it everyday!   This device is a must have i wish the price was lower. If you dont need a lot of storage then this is a great option.  It's been 2 years since i bought this. I bought the 256gb because i was only interested in using my phone for a little longer. But now it's full of pics of my kids and a couple of pics from the beach. I'm so glad i purchased this.  the device itself is extremely compact, and the battery lasts for an hour or so with moderate use. I love that there is no internal memory, I can put all of my photos on the cloud. But with such a small size and light weight, the iDevice is so much more convenient for me and has changed the way i use my phone. It's amazing to think that I was using an iPhone 3GS 4 years ago and I now have the same device as my friends that own an iphone 7. My son's girlfriend has a iPhone 8 and she loves it as well. Great buy for anyone that is a little in between when it comes to storage. . The screen is so bright! It's so bright, I have to wear sunglasses or I could burn my eyes! It does run extremely cool, so it can handle extended playtime with no problems. The battery life is also pretty good. I can get about 7.5 hours of screen time on a charge and I can go through 2.5 weeks of normal usage and still have a good charge left over. I really like this thing!I got this to replace an old device that I just couldn't live without,and I am so glad I did.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony Xperia S and have always had problems with the power adapter. When I use it it always turns on but when I do something else it turns off. I used to have this device for quite a while and I don't see any other solution for a good battery. It has a nice battery life, can be charged over usb or even usb to power supply and it can be used with a charger. The only con is that it is a bit too big for my use but I have no issue with that. 3.5 stars (out of 4):  It is a good product, it is just a pity that the charger is no longer available to use with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this to replace my original monitor because I use it for writing, reading, gaming, watching movies and playing computer games. This monitor has good brightness and clarity. When I'm working on my computer, I set my monitor at 100 percent brightness and I don't notice any eye strain, or glare from the sun at all. When watching movies or playing a video game, I've never felt any eye discomfort, so that's a plus for me. It does not have a built in speakers, which is a bit of a shame, as I use headphones in the daytime to listen to music. The monitor is very bright for its size, and the contrast ratio is a very high 1,000:1.  My only complaint would be that when I first set it up, I had to make sure it was set to the HDMI output mode, as some TVs have issues with that, which means you'll get a lower resolution. Also, the image does not rotate on this monitor so there is no "side by side" or any other feature I really enjoy, but this is really the only issue I can think of for now. Overall, a great product, I will be purchasing a second one for my entertainment center, as it seems like the one I got is too big for my room. - Chris W.  (5 reviews)  April 22, 2016 | I bought this product on sale, and was very pleased with it. It is an excellent quality monitor, easy to set up, and it is a pleasure to use. The only issue that I experienced was that I had trouble getting the screen to flip through the picture properly. It was quite a bit finicky to get it to work, but that may be a software thing. Overall it is excellent value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   good for its price I had to replace my old Apple watch with this and it works great! very comfortable  My new watch started off great, but it stopped working after a week and a half. It turns itself on after I plug it in, but then it stops working. Then it boots, but the screen says, "Unable to connect to the Bluetooth." If I hold the button down until the screen turns off, the watch works.  Does it work on my iPhone? Yes it does. I have an iPhone 5. The first time I paired my watch with my phone, the screen turned off, so I unplugged it and re-paired it. The phone also didn't work right after that. The watch now works perfectly. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________ I am a first time user of an electronic device (cassette recorder) called the Sony C1. It has been one of my most useful and creative instruments for many years, especially for musical recordings. I did not have a problem with the recorder at first, and had no problems at all when I took it to the shop. I was in the process of recording some vocals when my wife came into my room and asked why I was recording in the bedroom with the television on. I asked her about it, and she said that they had to turn off the TV and she had never seen her television on before. When I heard the tape recorder (which I had never used before) click, I thought that she had turned it on and I had been recording in there, and I apologized for my mistake. I turned off the recorder and went to get ready for the interview, when it stopped and started again. I thought, "what has happened?". When I got to the store, the employee asked me if I was sure I wanted to buy the recorder, as it was a high priced item. I said yes and said that I was really surprised that my wife had noticed something strange with the TV. My wife assured me that she was still asleep, and that I did the right thing by taking the recorder. She went back to sleep, and the recorder worked like a charm. It is now one of the devices that I take along on my musical tours, as I record vocal performances, and it has saved me time and money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!   My son and I both love the iPhone. My wife, on the other hand, uses her Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+. We both love using the iPhone 7 Plus.   I have a 4GB iPhone 7 and have no problems whatsoever with it. The only problem we have has been the battery life. It takes about 3 days for my battery to completely charge. We had to get the new battery.   a few notes:   1. I love the sound quality.  2. I like that you can use my phone on your tablet. This makes life a lot easier.  (I have tried it on a PC, but my Windows laptop battery is so old it won't charge the S7 Plus)  3. I don't like that the screen is too small to read on my 7 year old PC monitor. (I prefer the 6 inch screen)   In summary, I think that this is a great product, but if you are the type of person that uses the screen size of your computer and computer screen, it won' t work out well.

It streams at a constant 60 fps and my computer is on 24/7, which is a huge advantage over my old tv. i think the only downside is the lack of a memory card slot but that's no big deal, and the fact that there is a micro usb port on the back makes it perfect for charging phones and tablet on the go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I purchased the Zephyr 6-Volt Lithium Battery Pack and it has worked perfectly in my RV. The only thing I would change is the wire. The color isn't as bright as I wanted. It does come with two, but it is the same color so I didn't bother to use them. The Zephyrus I purchased came with a 12-volt battery charger, but the charger is not good, the connectors are loose and the plug doesn't fit securely. There is no way to remove the negative terminal of the charger for changing the battery. The charger had to be removed from the charger, the terminal pin pulled out, and then the plug of the new battery went in and it would not fit. The old battery had to come out before plugging in. I also bought the replacement battery, it is a similar color, however the wire is also a bit shorter. Overall I'm pleased with the Zepyr Lithium battery pack. It has held up great. I have not had any problems and I don't see a need to buy a new charger, however I don´t recommend this item to anyone. The wires were a bit short. The batteries themselves, as with any lithium battery, should not be replaced unless the battery is dead. You can use it for another time, but make sure that the battery itself is not dead before doing so.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **************************** This is my third AppleTV. The first AppleTV I bought was a year ago, it was a great value. It ran a small movie but was not the greatest performer. Now the 2nd AppleTV is even better, it is the same price as my first Apple TV, it also runs a movie. This is an ideal entertainment device. My wife and I also love watching our favorite shows on it and it gets the job done. ************************* I had a couple of Apple TVs before my current one. I can see why it was discontinued, it wasn't exactly cutting edge when it first came out. I think the new one is much more responsive than my previous one. It's much easier to set up and I'm very happy with the performance. It also is more user friendly. The sound and picture are great. My one complaint is the screen on this one is smaller. I'm not a big fan of the smaller screen. I want a bigger screen with a great screen resolution. It is good though, just smaller.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jf from Good AppleTV with the right features. The Apple TV 2 has all the features we need and more. It does not feel cheap, but it is definitely a better product than the previous version. It takes very good pictures and works well with our Apple devices. It can do 1080p video at 60 frames per second. - Video quality on Netflix is superb and with Dolby Digital. It will even play back video from a camcorder and the built-in microphone is excellent.  of course you can also connect to a computer via the built in tvOS so you can watch your favorite shows. But this has to be done with the best quality video you can get. In short, if you like movies, tv shows, sports or live TV, this is the only device you need in your home. It does not support Dolby digital 5.1 channels. I purchased the 2.2 because it had the option. It only supports Dolby optical 5.0. The 4K is just barely acceptable. The only thing that I don't like is the sound output, it's good enough for movies, but if you want to watch a DVD you have to use a sound bar.

I'm really happy with this purchase.   is the best replacement i have found for my cd player   I had the Sennheiser HD280 as my "go to" stereo speaker, but it was a very small and poor performing speaker. I've tried many different brands of speakers and this Senn HD280 is my new favorite. I use it in my computer monitor and stereo system. It has incredible sound and clarity.   the sound is great. you will love it  Excellent and beautiful Hi-Fi! This has replaced my Sony PCM7 and SACD player in my main room. The clarity and soundstage are much better than with the old SACDs. I can get great stereo out of my speakers!   Worth every penny! I don't own a stereo system, but was a fan of the SAC dvd players that came with my TV. So I thought why not give this a try. I couldn't be more pleased! The sound quality is excellent, as well as the quality of the components and build quality. It feels very good and stable on my main floor. I am a computer engineer and I've had no trouble with the device. My only wish is that it was bigger.  This has replaced many of the older CD Players in our home The sound has definitely improved over the old CD players. I also have the stereo system which is on the other side of the house.

It's a beautiful unit, so I'm happy that it's my replacement. .  and they sound even better than the original sony unit! i like this better, i also had a sony system and the sound was just ok for the money  Love this product so much It is amazing the sound it gives. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my iphone since it came out, and it is awesome, the battery life is very good, very solid and light for the size of the device, it has a very nice quality finish with no sharp edges, also its great for taking photos and it also does not come with a case, but i was able to get one off ebay. i also love that you can turn on the microphone on a speakerphone, and its also great when you are in a meeting and you need to keep you cell phone on you, and this device doesn't require charging or a charger, and the battery is a good size for me. its definitely an awesome device, and im going to purchase another one,  Style of Review: Overall  Performance  Value   A good device for the price is hard to find. If you get a good quality product for cheap, its a good purchase. Its hard to beat the build quality for the money. A very durable and very light device. If I can get used to it, I am very happy with my purchase.  It may look like a little bit on the small size, but its good for a lot of people.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used the Bose QuietComfort 25 in the car at work and I really love it. It is quiet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ixia2dove: This little device has been wonderful to use. I'm used to the older, thicker, more bulky one that we used to use at home. This one fits in the palm of my hand perfectly. When I first received the unit I was quite skeptical at first, but after a few hours with it, I have to say that the performance of this little thing is top notch. It is so easy to use it's amazing. I just wish it had a little more power. As it is right now, I've been using it for the past 2 days and I have not been able to use my phone for any time while I'm using it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought the XM5 and I really love it. I don't have a big home theatre setup but it has some great features that I can't live without. For example, the power switch is so fast and smooth and has to be the fastest switch out there. I also use it for my laptop and iPad as a portable wireless keyboard and can't get over how nice the touchpad and buttons feel. The speakers are great and there is enough bass for a great listening experience. I bought a bigger amp and got a little louder but I can live with it. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I recommend this product to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!   I'm having a very difficult time with this product. It has never worked correctly for me. It seems like it's always going to lock up or something, and even though the reset button does work the only way to get it working is to turn the power off.   There must be a different method or fix if it doesn't get locked up.   (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________________ I bought this thing about a month ago and am really happy with it. It takes great pictures and is very simple to use. It is very easy to set up and take pictures with. It has a very nice color LCD and comes with a very good tripod. The price was a little steep and I think that it would be better as a kit, but I am not too upset about the price. I bought the battery charger and charger charger separately and it works great. It was also very quick to assemble and to set it up. It really is a very simple thing. I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for almost a year and it's still going strong. i love the sound and the look. i have been using it as a subwoofer and my sub is great with it.  Write a negative review about the bad electronic device(s): I bought this unit as an addition to a home theater system, but it really wasn't needed. I can't believe the sound that this little amp produces with the sound bar/speakers. It sounds pretty good but it's a bit weak for what it's being used for.    I'm using it for the subwoofers and it is a little bit off. .  on the amp itself it sounded good but there is only one tweeter and the highs are a little weak. - The amp should have a bass boost feature  - There should be a way to control the volume levels on these units and they should be easier to use. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The M-Audio M1 is a very good-sounding guitar player. It's just a tad on the warm side for my tastes. The amp sounds amazing in the right mix. It sounds great with a good monitor system (i have an Alesis X12-A, Pro-Ject C2 monitor and Fender Jazzmaster). I use it with my iPad, and I couldn't be happier with the sound quality and functionality. I'll probably buy one in the future for my other guitar, though!  Write a negative review about the M-1: -------------------------- The amp is loud, which is fine, but it does have a harshness in the top end which is noticeable and annoying. I don't know if it's the amp, the amp driver, the cables, or if there's just bad micing, but I'm not happy. I was expecting more from a $100.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this in November last year as I thought it was just a cheapo speaker, but it turns out to be great! When I plugged in it and plugged the battery in it turns on and I can't be more pleased with the sound quality it produces, the quality of the speakers, it's weight is a bit light but I still feel safe using this as a portable speaker. I've used this a lot and I think it's great, but I can also see myself replacing it with the bigger one. I wouldn't recommend this for the beginners out there but I think you can learn about making music by making these and getting it down you really should. The size is small enough to carry around for sure, but this little speaker has been so much better than what I expected it to be.  Did you find this helpful?  No  Was this helpful?

I like the fact that it plays louder when it needs to and quiet enough when I am just trying to play it. Reverb, pickup and tuner are all well built. This is a great value and a nice sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   this has been one of my favorites since i got it. the volume and the music playing is perfect for my job and I am always on my phone while on the phone and so far the phone is really reliable. you can't really get much better. the only bad thing is that the battery life is horrible. It lasts about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and that's if you don't use it constantly. You can only get about 2 to 3 hours out of it at most. I have had it for 1.5 years now and it is still going strong.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6. The phone is very good, good battery and good call. The sound is so clear and not that annoying in my opinion. I have one complaint and it's the size of the case. This is very annoying because the phone doesn't fit in a pocket anymore. But I guess if you can't fit this phone in a tiny pocket you're in the wrong place.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent device! I've had this phone for a little over a week now, and I'm blown away. I've been using it every day, and it never fails. The camera is better than anything I've ever seen on an iPhone. I am an audio/video producer, and this is perfect for my needs. I'm using it as my secondary phone, but the primary one for work purposes. If you're thinking about buying this phone, don't be afraid to, this thing is well worth the investment!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Love my iPad but have to buy an apple watch  by jason on Monday, October 23, 2016 byon Monday, Oct 23,  This was the most affordable and most well-designed product I found in this area, and it's even better.   My son has a new phone, it has an iphone. I have an ipad. It is very difficult to keep him safe with his new phone because he can't reach to look at it in different places when playing games or reading. I don't want him to drop it.

Yes No Monday, November 14, 2010  great radio  by J from Bakersfield CA USA  Pros: light weight, good range, very cheap  Cons: no volume control on the radio, no battery indicator  Review: Bought this in November for my son who wanted an 8 meter for a toy truck and I am glad that I did, it is light weight and great range. , a volume knob would have been nice. The radio works great from a distance. The battery indicator is very helpful. This was my first radio and I'll be using it for years to come.  a volume control would have made it better and more functional. .  an actual volume knob and battery indicator would have helped me.  of course it is easy to listen to the radio through your hand.  (  Thanks  J  Had this radio for two weeks now. It works great and is very lightweight. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the battery indicator didn't work properly. I've only had the radio two weeks and so far the radio is a success. I can't wait to upgrade to the 2.5k and get a better battery. / Was this Review helpful to you?)  Good radio  I bought this radio to use it to talk to my 2 year old in school when he doesn't have an allowance. He has a computer that I can talk to using an old phone, so that's fine. He likes to listen while I work so he plays with the radio as much as he can (not so much on the way to class). It works well with his age group and does not get in the way.   I have to say it is worth every penny for the price and I would not hesitate to buy another one if needed.  .  to be honest, my son likes the old school way that we used to talk on the old phone - which was what this radio is really designed for (not really a phone). The radio is cheap but works great. I do wish they had a "dial" tone for the volume, otherwise I could just turn up the radio and hear it in the background (I just turn it up too loud and it makes my wife mad, so I

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought this gadget for my mother in law. She lives with my husband and we need the alarm for when we leave for work to alert us of any emergency that could possibly happen at home. She can't read or talk so we need something that can be picked up and put back down. So far the only thing i've gotten is this one and the new one that she bought is also great, we use it to check on the kids and they can't turn off the alarm when the alarm is going off. This one is great because of the way it works, it's not just one button. it's more like two buttons. It also has a very long battery life for when you only want to turn it on once in a while to make sure the kids aren't running out of juice. This is the best alarm we've ever used. The alarm is really loud. so we're not worried if anyone's home, we just want our house to be safe. We would definitely recommend this to anyone who is in the same boat. I love the feature that i can adjust the volume as well. It's really easy to read or listen to this thing at anytime.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - works perfectly for me   The best product and company.   Best seller, excellent service and delivery and I will buy again!   I use my device on a daily basis and am very happy with it.   at first I wasn't sure how I would get on, but with your customer service and prompt delivery, I'm happy!   a great product.  , great product, no problems  I bought a G3 back in 2008 and have only had two problems. I lost my battery and a screw on the back of the camera broke when I was using the lens. I replaced the battery but that did not solve the issue so I bought the latest camera which has the same problem. The only thing I wouldn't use any more is the new G4. They should not have made it harder for me to use with the old version of the software! If you can find a way to get the software working for me then that would be nice.  My wife and I love the G4!  The only con is that you must download the 3D Photo software on your computer to use this camera!  as we have no 3D printer for the camera we are still trying to figure out how to get 3D photo software for it but that is the only con that we can think of. The camera works great with the G3s camera adapter. The lens is also much sharper now and the pictures are even better and much more detailed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!   I use this with a 2d printer and it works very well. The printer runs at the full speed it is supposed to but it seems to have about a 5-10% dropout on it. I have yet to try a different printer with it.   The only thing that i wish it did was a way to monitor it's status when my printer is not connected.   in order to do this you would have to install a program in your printer driver for it to be checked on the PC. I did not have one of these so I had to use a separate program for it. Otherwise it works as it should be.   of course i am not satisfied with its current configuration, as i have to connect it manually when I am not connected to my computer and then it tries to download some settings that I do not need.  , I have no idea what I am going to do to it next.!!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Pc-10 was awesome! I was nervous to use this as it has been a very long time since I've used a Pc. However, I found that it was quite a bit more convenient to use than my older Pc, which was a Panasonic PCL-A7500.   The keyboard is really nice, the key feel is great. The mouse is OK, though the mouse pads are a little flimsy, they seem to get loose with use (which makes them quite a flimsy mouse pad to use with an older Pcs). The computer itself is not bad, but I can't tell the difference between the old and new. I'm sure it's because I'm an early adopter (I got my Pc in the 90s, remember), but I prefer the look and feel of the old one (with its black plastic enclosure, and its red backlight) over the shiny newer PCL one.  ,, and I think the sound is excellent.   The keyboard is a lot better than the Pc I have, the buttons have a more responsive feel to them, and the keyboard itself is a little bigger (the Pc was much smaller, and so the keys were almost all the same size).   I did some research and found that there were some reviews on the web that said that the Pcs didn't work with some computers, but that is not the case for me. I had a Dell laptop with a USB 2.0 port, and after setting up the PC to use the keyboard's USB ports, it works perfectly, and is fully compatible with the new Pcs. I also tried it with my computer's built in DVD drive (my laptop had a DVD drive built in, so the drive is built into the computer, and can be removed if it gets too much of a hassle), and it worked perfectly, no errors or any problems at all.   in fact, I think I'll get another Pc because I love how nice the computer is. It feels really solid, and you really feel like it is worth the money.     Overall, if you need a cheap Pc that does not cost that much, this is your computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It was a joy to build this thing because of the small amount of work it takes. It's a good sized and simple device. I like it a lot and I really think that if you are not a beginner that you can build something like this in a day or less. If you do, then you probably have what it takes to do it.  I also like that I didn't have to worry about the battery being dead because I didn the "old-fashioned" way: by dropping it in the trash.  (I've also dropped mine a few times and not a problem).  The only thing I wouldn't like is the battery door. I don't want to remove that part of the circuit board to use a different battery. I'd just rather make my own battery with the battery gate instead. (But I wouldn. No big deal I just don't know how. I think I might have to find a book on circuit design...
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i love this  i really hope i can replace my old one with it    Rated 5 out of 5 by mike from Good product, easy to use, great battery life. I use my cell phone for work, but I also carry a digital camera that I need for outdoor shots. I have used my cell for those, and have run out of battery often enough to want to use my camera. This light is great for the job, but its battery life is fantastic. My phone charges when it is on, so if I run out my camera doesn't have to. I'm so glad I found this light. I was hesitant to buy this because it's just a charger, but you can't beat the price. This is the first light I've used with a usb battery and I'm glad I bought it.

She is a pilot and wanted to take it along with her on her flights. It is a perfect little device to have. It has been very easy to set up, but I also wanted to get a better view of the screen and the Phantom 3 was just the right size. I also was very happy to see that it came with a charger. It took about an hour to download and set up the Phantom. The remote is good and it works very well. I'm sure other users would not have a problem with it. It only takes about one hour to be ready to fly. It uses a great battery and has very good battery life. I had no problems using the flight battery that came with it either. The battery on this thing lasts me about 5 hours, but if you have lots of flight time, then it might last longer. I think this quad is great for a couple because it has very few moving parts so it does not take a lot to break. I did have an issue that we had to call back the manufacturer about and that was about the remote. They were out of stock and I was able to get it, but they sent me a very damaged one. That was my fault for not ordering it and shipping it to me before they were out. Overall, I am very pleased with this quad and think it is a great option for anyone that does not want to take their equipment along with them on a trip. It takes some time to download the software, but once you have it up and running, it takes just seconds to set it up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had an amazon prime for a month now,and i have not used it all that much (only because i only had it for a week),but for its size,price and function,it has been a great product for me.it is a great value for the size of it,and it is very easy to use and setup.one thing i will note is that it is slightly louder than i thought it would be,probably because it has a lower capacity battery.im using mine for my daily life and just have it plugged in, and i just can't hear it on the television when it is on.i have been using it for about a month so i am not sure if the quality of this unit has improved or if my ear buds will be fine with it.anyway,i recommend this unit for any person who is interested in the amazon Prime service and wants to save money on electronic items.this unit is also very good as an investment for when you move to a new apartment or house.  My favorite digital audio player: I use my ipod pro for music and movies. I bought this player to have a device that would work with my ipods. I was able to play music and listen to my ipos through the ipod player,with great ease. I have had other players,but the ipad has a better audio quality. I also have a new ipod so that is a plus in the quality department. I will have to get another player to go along with the ipa. Overall,I am very pleased with my purchase and will be getting another ipad soon.    My ipod was having issues with connecting to my android device: I was using my ipad pro and I needed it to connect to my iphone. I tried various things and finally found this app. I opened it up and sure enough,it recognized my ipapod. This app also solved some issues on my ipod,so thanks for the app!   This product works great: This is a very easy-to-use, inexpensive, compact, excellent quality, simple, and elegant MP3 player. I purchased this to have some music on when I go to work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am glad i found this one.  i would have never found this in my store.  I had a problem with one of my old "Lucky" VCR's.    i am not a fan of the magnetic eject button.  I ended up buying the "Lazy Joe" and using that for about 2 years.  One day while my wife was making a salad and i was watching TV.  my wife looked down at the salad and was surprised to find my VCR   in its casing with the eject button still in tact.  i couldnt bring myself to pull the cartridge out of the casing.  it was so heavy.  It wasnt until i got this one that i was able to remove my old VCR.  My old VSR2 works great with my new LJ-3.  The sound quality on this unit is amazing.  Also i like the fact that you can control the volume by opening and closing the lid.  Its a great little unit to have and  you will not be disappointed. Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Works great I've had the LJ3 for about a month now and I like it so far. It's a very light device. This is a great way to watch movies from your computer. If you want a compact and portable machine then this is the way to go. Posted by Anonymous at 9:53 AM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great item. I had to take a week off work and have it sent from the store to my home. I thought it was broken at first, but after about an hour of tinkering I was able to make it work, and was very pleased with the result.  I am very satisfied. The fact that it is a 3 digit serial is great, not to mention the fact that this is one of the better devices that came with my computer.  and it comes with a great replacement. it took me all of a week to get this to work. but i'm so glad i did.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am really impressed with this thing. I was considering getting a DAP but I had my doubts about the features I wanted. I got this unit and it was just what I wanted! No worries about battery life, great control, excellent sound, and very portable! It has all the features that I would want in a quality CD player, including EQ, automatic skip, and playlists. This unit makes it very easy to record my show! It's worth every penny.

Just the right amount of voltage and speed.  was easy to put it together. ,by: ned from michigan, MI USA  the battery charges to 100% within 30 seconds. the light stays bright all night  was this Review helpful to you  Awesome. .  an awesome product that makes work a pleasure.  "   by: John from Colorado Springs CO USA  in a hurry this is my work vehicle. i have it hooked up to an apple monitor and it is a pleasure to see. very light weight. no problems with the electronics. the lights are not bright but the dims fast. the one thing i would note is that it needs some wire. it has a connector for the power supply and a small connector for charging. the power connector was a little short on the small cable i got from my local computer store. i had to use a small pin plug and was still running out of power about 5 minutes in. just be sure the power adapter or cable will fit through the computer ports. this is a really cool product. thanks samsung. great job with the engineering of the product. the product is well made and looks very cool. if you need something like this do yourself a favor and buy it. no one will knock the product for the price  Not what I was expecting.  or what it was promised to be.  the unit I got had a dead USB port in the usb slot, and the screen dimmed so that you could see it, and it did not have a battery indicator. when i called the place to return it and buy a new unit, they told me that it was defective, and that they cannot guarantee the replacement. when it works you may as well, as the light is very cool and not nearly as bright. it is also a little big to fit into a laptop bag. i was able to use it to record a few minutes of video on my laptop, but i was still worried that it may not be stable
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device works great. I am a beginner who has never worked with digital equipment before, so I did a lot of research before purchasing this.  It has been quite a while since I used my digital camera or video recorder. I needed to replace an older model but not something new. I have a lot more time on my hands so I chose to buy this device. It comes with everything I need and a few extras to take some extra shots. I did have one issue with my first test. The first time I did an underwater shot, the button that controls the lights on the end of the end screen was broken. I couldn't do the shot. I didn't think much of it and went to the next shot. The second shot with the lights worked, but not for the next one. I had to return it as there was nothing that could be done.  a new unit has to be purchased.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, October 23, 2009  Bought as a back up to my Sony  by G.S. from Los Angeles CA USA  Review: These were not provided to me as part of my Sony unit. I had a friend purchase some Sony unit, and he also bought these and they worked great for a few months before they stopped working.  It was a good buy but I now have my own unit, so these would do great on that.  the only reason I give them 4 stars is because I had to return the bad ones, not to blame. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! I bought this at a used store. It looked like it had been around a long time. When I opened it up, it was in great condition. The plastic inside was not scratched at all. The buttons and volume wheel are very well made. The sound is clear and the power button works really well. The only thing I don't like is the way it looks. It looks like it has been dropped on multiple occasions. I feel like it should have had more of a protective case. The battery was easy to get out of the case, but the case was not. It came with a cover but when I opened the case the battery had been damaged and wouldn't charge. My advice is that you look at the other reviews to see what other people have said about the case. Overall I like it a lot and would definitely buy it again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had one of these for about 2 months now and I've had problems with my main amp. When i plugged it in for the first time my amp made a noise (the same noise made by my iPod) I went into the settings on my laptop and checked out the settings for the volume and the bass was way up and the treble way down and i noticed that my treble was way too high and my bass was WAY too low. I then went into my settings and changed the presets to get it to where it was supposed to be.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My son loves his cell phone. He likes that it has a screen and a CD player.  But his favorite feature of all is the camera.  it's very small and light and great for capturing a picture when he is on the move.   He has never lost his cell signal, and it works with the cellular towers so well.     The camera is very good. I love it because I can get pictures of the things that are very important to me (like my dog, etc) in real time.  , and if I have to take a picture of my daughter, I can put the camera on my arm, get my daughter to come closer so I can photograph her in the best light.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a phone for 4 years, then an iPad, and I love the new phone I got from iphone6s. I got it for my husband and he loves it. Now that he knows i just gave him the phone, I guess he is a huge apple fan.  My only gripe is that the phone has a built in microphone which i find a little weird. I thought if they were using Apple technology, they would have included an external mic instead.  a good addition:  The iPhone 6s is an upgrade from the 6, but the iPhone SE is the best for the money, in my opinion.

I can type faster on the laptop. .  for the price. Works great as a travel keyboard. It weighs less than the laptop I use as a USB-c keyboard. ,  The only thing that I wish is the keys could be colored, it's not the usual white, but light gray  ,Light gray would be the best.  the only thing, which I wish, is the keyboard would be available in a variety of colors, so that people can choose the colors to match their desk (if they could).  Overall, very good product  Had to wait about two weeks to get it, but it is worth the wait, . I don't know what to say other than it's good as a "travel" keyboard. As a desktop, I find it too small, though  My only real complaint, and the only reason for 4 stars, is that it takes up too much space.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I have had this keyboard since late 2010 and use it everyday for work. I bought this for myself as I found it more comfortable than a regular keyboard. My fingers are still sore from typing on this for a while, but for typing on a computer and general use this is great. I can type about 50 WPM on this, which is very good for me. If I could have gotten the Cherry MX switches this would be great. For what it is I would buy again, because it is easy to learn and great for work with. I have had to switch to a Microsoft touch pad, because typing on the QWERTY is too tiring. Also I like the fact that the spacebar is backlighted so I can read it on a dark screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am an engineer who has been using various wireless keyboards since the days of MS DOS. They've worked just as expected. They work like a charm. They have been on my laptop for several years. They're not bad, they are just the way I've always used them. That said, they were a bit slow for my personal preferences. I'd be willing to upgrade to a wireless model of my own if my keyboard needed to be better. If you don't need a wireless keyboard you probably can't afford the cost of a wireless one anyway. But I will never go back to the wired one I had.  A solid and reliable keyboard  The quality of the product is great. I was hoping to find something similar to my old wired keyboard but not the price or brand. Thank you for making a quality product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the touch screen  This is a very good product  Best Touch screen I have ever had. It feels like having an iPad in my hand.

I am a video editor, and I use it for editing the video on my laptop. It's much nicer to use than my old Samsung TV. The auto brightness is a real bonus.   The only reason this review is 3 stars is because it seems like the screen is constantly going dark. I can't figure out what is wrong. Other than that, this is a fantastic product. It has amazing picture quality.

I used this product for 3 months and am very happy with the quality and performance.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with this little device and with the performance of the battery. Very easy to set up and use. If your not a big time music lover, this will do the job. If you are a music lover I would get the little amp that has a headphone jack in the back. There are a couple of problems with this unit. The speakers are very weak. I don't use them and I like my music loud. The only other issue I have with this device is that if you leave it on when it starts up the display lights up green for a minute, then goes back to white. It is very difficult to notice this in the dark. I would recommend this unit to people who like to have the iPod interface on the back of their device.

I have been an electronic technician for 30 years and have always been able to replace the "bad" part at no cost or obligation, but this time the part I replaced broke and was very hard to find and I had to pay to ship it out. I was really angry that I had put off doing something to repair my cell phone, which I was using daily, but now I can't use it anymore. This is such a simple fix, you don't have to break out the big wrenches and make it perfect...just buy a new piece of scrap and buy a replacement part that is better. No hassle at all!!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great device, very fast response time. No dead pixels.   I had an old Nokia phone with no data plan and only a wifi connection and no cell service, this is the phone that was just right! I was able to get 5 gigs of data for less than $25 with no contract.   the only issue i had was with the camera, it is a little janky when it is in low light and the video does not look good but that was with out any flash and no external mic   The only way i will purchase another phone is to get an android phone and a sim card from another carrier! the Verizon sim card is the same and is compatible with the other carriers cell service   Good work on this one and thanks for making it the best
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great. Great sound, good volume, just what I wanted and needed. Write a negative review about poor quality:    This headphone amp was not worth the money. The amp was very flimsy, the usb cable has a bad connector and has a tiny hole for an audio jack. The usb cable was the most uncomfortable I've ever had to deal with. I've had my Sony headset in a phone case and a headphone usb cable in the same thing but the other way around. I bought this one because I couldn't find anything better and was looking for something similar to the Sony MDR-2R I had. So far this isn't what I was looking or expecting. I really like this product. It's a decent quality product. The only complaint is that it takes a while to charge up. The product arrived on time and the delivery was very timely. I think my only issue is that the unit takes about 1 hour for my phone to charge and then another hour for the amp to be fully charged. Overall a great product and I would definitely recommend it.

It uses batteries which have a good life span. If you are looking for an alarm clock and have a big budget, this is what you are going to get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the very first unit of this type that I've bought, and I am really pleased with it.   It does the job. I did a lot of research before deciding on the model. I was looking for a high performance computer for my computer-based work and the only real competitor that I could think of was the Toshiba Tecra 740 G4.   was considering the Tecra. However, the G4 is not cheap at all, especially considering it is a low end model with an outdated chipset.  . I've been using the Acer C720 since the moment I first saw it. For a while I was thinking of buying it from a place like Amazon (which was also a great site), but then I looked at it and thought, the C720 is too good a model to pass up, especially with this amazing warranty. If I was ever going to go back to buying a computer, this is the model to do it on.   the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that there is a "hotkey" on the keyboard which is hard to reach in a cramped office environment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a Sony e-reader, which has worked well for me. My husband is a computer-tech and he has found it to be very easy to use and has a great selection of books.  My first read: I have a fairly new e-book reader and have never written a review. This was my first, so I'm a bit nervous. But I'm glad I bought this reader and was happy with the purchase. I've had it for two weeks now, and so far, so good.  the best: I really liked the look and feel of this thing. I'm fairly tall for my age, and there was plenty of space. I have it in a recliner, and the table is sturdy and well-made. The screen is so crisp and it's easy to find the right page by just looking at it, so my mind doesn't wander and I can stay focused. the screen is the only thing I dislike about it: the menu is very clunky and difficult to use. I found myself accidentally putting things that I had just clicked on, which was irritating. It does not do auto-fetch, so if I want to return to a book, I must select it and then choose a different book (I use this on a daily basis as it's the only way I can get through some of the huge libraries out there). The battery is pretty good: I've been able to get about four and a half hours on a charge. I did have a minor issue with the batteries, however. At one point, they started to get low, but no big deal because they've been a couple of days and the battery still seems fresh. I do not know how long they'll last but it'll definitely be longer than two weeks. I really like the convenience of this device, and it doesn't take up much space. It makes a huge difference in our family, especially when I've brought it in for my daughter to use during a long trip. I will most definitely be purchasing another one for my husband.

It is extremely fast and easy to navigate. The only problem is, when you plug the cable into the TV, it turns the TV on and you need to unplug it before turning the TV off or it may freeze up. It also works perfectly when used with my mobile phone, and I was able to find a way to do that, as there is no way to turn the device on and off.

The kit only contains the battery, a power adaptor, a jumper and a solderless breadboard cable (which doesn't fit). I had to break out the breadboard for wiring the LEDs and I did so, but the LED strip only connects to a single pin, which is the voltage supply on the microcontroller. The solderless cable (solder-y), connects to pin 2, which doesn't have a voltage supply. So, the strip will either work with just the power adapter (or no power adapter), or with the power supply adapter. I'm not sure which would be better, but I'm using the adapter so I might just have to have it that way. If you need the power adaptors, I suggest getting the 1-foot mini power adaptator from SparkFun (they're also sold here: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/1612). It's a great value and the power cable is very short and flexible.  The kit comes with the battery in an extra plastic holder. The charger needs to be inserted before the kit. I would have liked to have the kit come with the charger already inserted.  of a new eletronic device: We got this kit from an electronics store. I am using it to make a simple project for my 5th grade Science class (kids do love to make and have made various electronics projects!). I used a very cheap Arduino Leonardo clone as the microprocessor (which is a $5 part), the 6V battery to power the project, a few wires to connect the LED strips to the Arduino, and a breadboard. I connected the Arduino and the Arduino Leonardo to a 5V power supply. The entire project can be powered directly from the Arduino. I have a separate 12V power source as a backup so I can run a light, if I need to.   Our project is: ... To create a digital counter that counts down from 10 up to 100..  The kit came with 2 breadboards and some soldering tools. We put the LEDs on the left and right of the Arduino board and connected the positive to +5V

It works great, even for a simple task like powering on my cellphone. I use it every night when my phone goes to sleep, then I connect it with my PC and play with my music all night long.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't see it often enough but for the first time I've had a chance to use this in conjunction with an iPad 3 with the TouchID on. It's a really good idea. I've always been averse to touchscreens on mobile devices because they seem to always have something that can go wrong. I have also found that the touchscreen on my iPad 2 is always distracting. That's no longer the case with this one. With that said, I like the functionality of the Touch ID screen and that it's easy to use for one-handed operation.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

I was so pleasantly surprised at the ease of install and setup. My first was a very large touch screen. I had problems setting up the Touch screen on my first one, and the process for this one was much easier. The setup process is very intuitive, and if you don't know what you are doing you have a good chance of putting this together and not having to figure it out. /David  A Good Idea with a Small Problem   by John from San Francisco CA USA  the installation instructions were very clear but it took me longer than I thought to get it working.  be prepared to work a little to get this installed.  it's a good idea but is a problem. the buttons on my X360 are not centered. the center of the power button is in the bottom left but the bottom right button is not the same as the one on the bottom. when I put this in it looks like a big square. when i turn on the X360 the middle button (which is supposed to be the power but it's on the top of the X 360) takes me to the home screen.  The buttons for power, back and select are all the same size and I've never seen that.  that's a shame since the power has a built in IR camera but the back and selections buttons are not. the back button is supposed be to the left but it is to the right. . ,  Works great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________ The original Dell XPS 2 laptops I used to own have been discontinued. However, the XPS 13 with touch screen still has a lot of value as a Windows machine, and if it's a very long term investment, I still consider it worth the money. I bought this XPS because the specs I was looking for are the ones in the Dell. The display is excellent and the screen is clear. The keyboard is the one I had hoped the Xps 13 would have. It's really nice and it has one function I'm very fond of (text messaging). The battery life is excellent (and I love that I can plug it in at night and be ready to go the next day) I had heard the screen was horrible and I was right, but after a lot less time on the laptop than I'd expected, I've come to appreciate the clarity of the screen and the battery life. Overall, I'd recommend this laptop. _________________________________________________  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great screen, terrible keyboard. I ordered a new screen for my old XPS 15 on August 1st. The XPS is great for me, but the display was a little on the low side for my liking, so I didn't really notice it. The other reviews were accurate. But I thought the X2 would be better. This XPS just doesn't match my expectations. I was hoping for a high quality screen, that's about it. In my opinion, the touch pad has a bad feel and the keys are mushy. I wish the keyboard had more room for movement. I don't use a mouse but if I did, this X2 is just as nice as the Dell, but with fewer features. So yeah, a little disappointment. The screen was very nice, but there is no way I could upgrade this one to the more expensive screen that is much better quality.  Purchased new in July 2014. Purchased as a replacement for a Dell X230 laptop (with less power than the X230) I replaced with the 14" display. I used the Dell's web page for the warranty and the web page did not have information on the X220 screen replacement. Not really surprised but the web pages for the X240 and X240p and X220 also do not have this info. The new X220 will only run a 14" monitor. The previous X230 ran a 16" one. I contacted Dell
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  No more "battery failure" in my pocket  When it came the charger I didn't know what to expect but I love it. It's so much smaller than my old one and much faster. I love to travel light and not having a big phone takes the pressure off when I go out in public.  Excellent Buy  I am a professional with a smartphone. After owning a samsung galaxy s6 I decided to go for this one as I like the small size. The device has exceeded my expectations so far. The battery is great and the battery life has been great, I have had to make sure that my cell is charged at night but it's not really a problem. I highly recommend this purchase.

I am very impressed with this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great for the price. A few things that i do like about the device. I really like the "silent mode". That makes it feel so much better. This is a great gadget for the money. It has the ability to store up to 1000 songs for you to use as backup. I also really like that you can get an sd card to expand your storage for free. The camera is also good. The zoom setting is great for my needs. I love the fact that it records in crystal clear 1080p. It also does not record audio so you can record in your music while on a hike. The device is so durable and has a great feature. When the battery is running low I can put in a charger and it will recharge itself. That's so nice and this helps keep my device safe from getting scratched and wet.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to connect my phone to my computer via USB but I wanted to connect it over a coaxial cable. This thing is awesome. It is easy to connect and you can easily plug in a new cable to go through the computer and this will fit in the slot in the back. The sound is great and I use this for my audio book player and a sound card and that's how I bought it.  The product came quickly and I've used the coaxial and USB connections without issue. I really like this product and will definitely recommend it.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 04, 2015  Works well  by Richard from Largo MD USA  Pros: Looks nice, good sound, works great  Cons: You must have the computer on while using this, for me it took a little while, to get used to the way it connects to my PC.  I like the way the cable fits in the PC case, and can't imagine needing anything else in this price range. ,  Review: Works well  is a nice sounding headphone with good clarity.  the only con I have is that sometimes it can't connect to the PC while it's on, but I think that's just a quirk of mine. The product is awesome  Good Product at a great Price  Comment: I bought this a few days ago. It seems to work perfectly, and is a very nice looking headphone, as well. The cable for the iPod has a 2.5mm plug for the 1/8" adapter. It plugs in fine, and the USB input on my PC works just fine (with or without the adapter). So far I have no problem using this with my iPod, or even my computer, but if I had it to do over, I would probably get the USB cable and plug it into the PC, as the 1.1" plug is a little tight.  of course the only drawback would be that it can only be used with a computer that is connected to the 1 (2) USB ports on the computer. I have a Windows 7 machine that only has 2 of those USB ports.  is well built, works perfectly  My second purchase from Audioengine. They were extremely reliable, shipped quickly, and arrived within 3 days. -John  From Me to Richard:  Thank you very much for the prompt delivery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikane. My new iphone 3gs works great. No more dropped calls, the screen is bright and clear and its battery lasts a long time.  Have no bad to say. My wife loves this phone. When she has problems with the calls not being clear or she gets dropped calls it goes straight to the phone, and my computer works great so I dont need my phone to be working or working well. I am very happy with this phone and will recommend it to friends.    Have to get this phone - I've been using a Samsung Galaxy S3 and my son is a S4. They work great, but this one is way more stable and just works better with my touch screen, but I can't believe they don't have the same features like the s3 and s4. The battery life is amazing and you get so many features that you can't even imagine on any other phones.   If the screen were a bit more wide I would buy it. It seems wider than it really is - the screen seems to be a little too small. It does look nice though.   is a phone with a great battery and a good screen - I am sure it will last a while if not constantly charged. I was using my samsung s3 until my s4 battery started dying, the phone had a new battery but it was not charged enough, so it shut off and wouldn't go back on. This phone now does that, when it needs to be recharged. It is a great phone.

It's a nice, large and easy to hold unit that makes a nice sound and looks like an old school cassette recorder. It comes with a nice plastic carrying case, which is great for a portable unit. I use the "A" setting for a lot of my tunes and the "B" setting with a CD. I really like that I can use my A setting to record a song and then use the B setting to change the settings. I also use the tape transport for CD records. It was a good investment for the money and the sound is superb.  Rated 5 out of 5 by TimS from Great product! This product is the best I've used.

It has a lot more features than most tape record devices. I have my favorite tracks from my favorite music artists on it. Great feature is the ability to play multiple songs in one session. Very convenient for doing more recording. My only problem with this is the size. I was afraid I would lose it. However, it was quite easy to carry with it with the case. I recommend this product.  with the tape Transport, it's easy to get the tape in and out with a single stick of your foot. the tape is nice and thick and I'm able to use it with a 2" tape loop. Also, I've found it easy to insert and remove the cassette with just my hand without any need of adjusting anything. Another thing I like is that it has a nice case with a strap on it and a strap that you can hold the device with. The other thing is that I found a way to make it quieter. I don't have the manual with me so I'm not sure why but the "breathing" or the "tapping" noise I'm getting when I record can be cut down or muted for quiet recording. With

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this to use in a 3d printer and it works great. It does a great job of holding the print bed in place. I also think it would work great in a desktop printer.  Rated 1 out of 5 by davidmoe from A little too thin I bought 2 of these and the first one I got was almost a week old. It had almost nothing printed. I returned it and got the second one. This one works much better. It prints well on my printer, but not so well on the first 2.    The Bottom Line  It was just a bit to much of a hassle to print the things out on my 3D printer. However, the quality was great.   You can expect a bit of a learning curve from printing on this, but I've printed plenty of things in other printers and this is far and away the best one I've tried. It is a lot of fun to use.  the best part is that I get to have a printer and share my work with others. , but the price of $99 for a 3D Printer is just too much, and I would probably have got one for $99 and not even had to take the test drive and get the printer  I have the i1 printer and love it. It can get pretty hot so be careful. It has a 3-way power switch and I love the ability to program it so that the heat is on one side or the other and it doesn't run hot on one or the middle.     Overall I'm very satisfied with my printer and would highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just picked up the new iBook G4 and for the price, i'm really impressed! It is fast, quiet, good screen, it is the first laptop I have had that can do HD video. The only con I have is the lack of expansion card slots. I could not find a Mini-ITX slot anywhere at a good price so I had to use the mATX expansion card slot. Other than that, it works great.   A few weeks ago I took my iBook to a local computer store for some repair work. They took my laptop and put an ATX power brick in it. I've never been so happy to have an ATA card in my PC than I am today. I have a Macbook Air and it gets hot very quickly. I haven't had an AT-AT drive for years. It is so quiet I can hardly hear it, it looks beautiful and it is amazing how fast it is to load applications! I would recommend this to anyone with an ATPC based PC.

The main thing that i like is the ability to select between different frequencies for a better reception. I was having issues with my first one with the 3.5ghz setting and so i switched it to 2ghz and its great now.  .     If i could only give the battery life 4/5 stars, i would. As for the actual receiver, it works great and works better than the stock one (which i didn't know you could swap out the receiver for). But the receiver will not get hot enough to get a good picture, which means there are only a few channels available in my home. Not to mention you have to use bluetooth 2.0 to use it.

I have my laptop and i need a keyboard! this is perfect. i also have a computer mouse but the Logitech one is better. the rubber pad on the mouse feels great. I really like the fact that there is two slots for the battery. I was worried about this but it does not matter because you can charge the battery when you are not using it. I am very satisfied with this keyboard!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the T20 to replace my Bose SoundLink. The Bose has a much stronger bass, however, at about 3/4 of the price, the T-20 is a great value and very well built. My ears are still getting used to it, but I can see that it will work very well for anyone with good hearing.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought 2 of these for my kids and they were great!  Great Product!  a good product for the price, easy to use and great sound.  The Sound Quality is great, the control for adjusting the volume is great.  is this the best buy ive ever done?  : )  Good product and price  I have the sound module for the car stereo. The sound is good for the money. Very good performance. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. ,  Quality sound  i would love to buy this sound module. The only downside is the only way to adjust the volume of the music is through the stereo speaker. The manual that comes with it says you can adjust the level of the volume on your phone. Not so, the level is the same as the music volume. I have to turn the speakers off in the car to adjust them. If you can't adjust the music in the vehicle then this isn't the module for you. .  with a price this low this is a must buy.  the sound quality is great you will never go back to other brands for these types of modules.  of course if you don't buy one you can always use your car stereo's built in.  to make sure you get the right one go to the web site and choose your model from the options provided. then just call a number and ask for assistance in selecting the right sound module  good sound quality  its a good module, good price, quality sound.  No need to buy a sound module unless you want to be able to adjust your stereo volume with your phone's phone volume control.  has a decent sound quality, can be controlled with a phone's volume.  in my car, i have the module and I love it because I can now adjust the sound. I can turn off the music, turn on the radio, and adjust the stereo's volume from the device. Great value. 'sound is not so great. I would like to buy one because I do not have to play my music through my radio anymore. - I thought the sound was ok, it has a lot of bass but it is not very loud at all. I thought I was going to have to use a soundbar to listen to my tunes and that's when it gets very loud. But I liked the sound of the module.  and the price was great.

I do not use it to make calls or anything but it is nice to have one to keep track of time. I've used this digital clock for about a year now. The only things I have added to it are a battery and a memory card to hold all my phone numbers. That way I can always check how many calls I have to take, when I have the right time for my next appointment, and when I should get up and go to the bathroom and brush my teeth. I like it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product itself has worked out well and the device itself has not made a significant impact on my audio output.   I have had many good DACs and I have never had a single one that did not work.   on a side note, I don't know who wrote the specs for the O2, but I am sure they don't match mine. They seem to be in line with mine, and I don?t think mine is on the upper limit of the specs.   The O2 is very very good.  I wish this was available with a 3.5mm cable.    PROS:   + Well built - well thought out.  , - The included cable is a tad short.  the cable is too short to go directly from the line out to the OPA13424 - so you can't get all the output from the ODA.  .  is it really worth the extra money?    CONS:     - The included cables are short.    The included cables were not exactly what I expected either - they were long but thin and had an unusually large diameter. I am only 5'1 and my average is about 50-60 cm.   - The input jack is very poorly made - it has two plastic rings that hold it together which has been causing me a lot of problems. The holes in the front of the jack are very weak and have bent outwards, and on the back there are plastic washers that will not stay on and won?t stay on. They are holding the jack in place which is not supposed to be there. (These are the two plastic washer that can?t hold the jack on properly. The two washers are also too small and have too little friction - which means the jacks is constantly bouncing. I don???t think this is a defect as I have been working on this jacks for almost a month now and haven?t had any problems yet. I have also noticed that the jack is not moving on my desk).   The input and output jacks are not a good compromise between convenience and performance and this is something I will have to live with. The other major issue is the quality of the sound. The DAC does not have any high end features but the sound quality is just ok. I really hope the company comes up with a better design soon. The input and outputs may be a decent

This device is awesome, i could not believe the quality, the functionality and the speed of the operation. I use this device with the Ipad 3 and it works great. It also works well with the iphone 4 because its a faster device. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it is a bit bulky.  I'm a first time user and this is the first purchase for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this in anticipation of a new job and after doing some research and reading reviews on various sites, I decided to make the switch. The device came in 2 days and was easy to install and setup. I don't use my computer very often, however the setup and use of the device are pretty awesome. I am not an "instant messenger" type of person, I tend to type/write a few emails a day and have a "quick write" folder in my Outlook (not sure if you guys have the Outlook feature, but my current Outlook has the "quick writer" function). When I started to use this device, I was amazed how quickly the file downloads and I was able to transfer a large 4GB.doc file to my new MacBook Pro. I can already see that having it on the new device will be better for my "personal" work. This device is simply awesome for those who work with a lot of different formats/files/documents and would like a device that is not only portable and easy to use, but also extremely affordable. I'm not sure where my experience will hold up over time, but the product itself seems like it will last. I have no regrets with this purchase and I'm very happy with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had mine for almost a year now. i was having problems with a defective usb port, but when i discovered that my other usb port worked fine i was sold and had to go with it. i had been having trouble connecting with my computer until i used my new one, and now it works great! i use it for every computer from my mac laptop to my pc i use for work. its nice to have when you have to use a keyboard and mouse with your computer as well as a USB hub as it makes connecting a lot easier.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Unsafe I had been using an ethernet card for 15 years and never had a problem. I tried upgrading my system and it seemed to work okay for a few weeks until I had to replace my usb and ethernet adapter. I plugged in the new adapter and immediately the laptop went out of power. It seems like my other adapter was defective or it was not powered enough. I went online to look at the replacement and realized that not all adapters will work with all computers. I could not even use my laptop with the new usb and no ethernet option. Not even my new ethernet worked. I had spent over $50.00 on a computer that failed. I am going to return the new one. I will not be buying the wireless adapter anymore. I would have preferred a less expensive one that has an etherio or ethernet jack on it.  I had had no problems with my old computer when I first used it. I thought the problem was with the computer, and had the computer replaced with a newer one. The replacement computer is working fine, and I am getting very annoyed that this is not what I expected. I do not have the original adapter, but it does work with my new computer.  for more info on this device, I am hoping to have a computer technician perform a check on the adapter and if it still doesn't work I will be leaving my warranty. I wish this product would have lasted more than 1 year. I did not get a good price on the adapters when I bought mine so it is probably because I don't use it enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great little device. Works great with my VSTi plugin, and it's very small (smaller than a deck of cards).   I bought two of these to go with my new DAW software, and I use them with my Roland V-Drums. I'm a guitar player and I love the sound these give me, and the fact that it has an on/off button for the volume controls gives me the option to turn down the volume when I want to.   The only things that I didn't like about them were:  1. They weren't as quiet as I thought they would be. You can hear it when they're turned on, but once it goes down they are very quiet, like a vacuum cleaner.  2. They didn't have a switch that let me set the delay amount. The one that is on the product packaging said "50ms". That's pretty damn far out. , but you can get an extension cord, which was perfect. I have to play around with my volume controls a little bit when it's turned on to get the delay right.  and I'd like the option of changing the delay rate.   of course, I have the option for an external effect. I use the Roland CS-8080. I bought the same one and the same extension cord that came with it, but because it was a little older I had to do some hacking to get it to work. I also bought a little adapter from the same seller, and that was perfect for it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have purchased two of these to replace an older model with a bad buzz/noise, and a third to replace one that stopped working entirely. I had purchased two cheap eurorack modulars, and was quite impressed with the functionality. I can get the power off my guitar using one module and the amp with the other, and I can use one to power my turntable, the other to play my laptop (using my iPod as a source), and the turntables with the amp. The module is compact, and the overall design of this thing is top-notch. Also, it is quite light and doesn't weigh very much. This thing doesn't really get hot. I am considering purchasing a new one. Pros: compact; excellent output; very good bass and mid; great for home/office use; not loud when playing in an open space; good control over the amp; simple to use. Cons: buzz/sound quality when plugged in; needs an external volume control, but it's very good on its own.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the first generation of this headset for me and my wife for our first visit to Italy. I loved it so much I bought the 2nd generation because my wife is so picky on how her ears are treated. We go every 4 to 5 years. The first gen headset, in my opinion, had a better sound. The second gen headset has more bass but that's all in the head and doesn't affect the performance of the headphone as much. I also think the sound quality was a bit better with the 2 gen. The microphone is good but not great and the sound is too bass heavy. I wouldn't buy it over the 1st gen. I'm still a beginner to this stuff and I'd be interested in learning to calibrate the microphone better. I don't need to do it now, but it's the little things that I'm missing. Great work BT!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the BEST keyboard I have ever had. I am very satisfied with this keyboard, and I'm not even a professional keyboard gamer. I was an avid gamer and keyboard addict for many years, but eventually I grew tired of the keyboard and the excessive key presses. The keys feel like they are springing off the keyboard (it's not a bad thing), and the space bar is just a tad too soft. The switches feel like rubber and are smooth, but the key caps don't have the feel of the Cherry MX switches. It's not that I dislike Cherry MX, but with the keyboard I get the feel that the key switches are plastic, and not the real thing.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I purchased this in hopes of getting it running. The instructions were clear, and I followed them with a degree of success. I set the unit to receive the battery from my old cellphone and it ran from then on. It came with a few different cords, but this one was a short cord that I could keep from tangling with the other cords. One of the other reviewers mentioned a sound-deadening cover that was included with this phone, which worked very well. I have not tested this, but the cover was very thin and not easy to tear off. After several months, I decided that I did not need the sound-dampening cover anymore. I do not recommend the sound dampening, because it does not work as well as advertised. The one problem I had was that the power cord was too long, and while this is normal, it makes it more difficult to set it to receive a battery from your old cellphone. The other issue was the power supply. The cable that connects to the device is not easily accessible and requires pulling the cord out. This cable is made of a plastic tube that slides into a hole in the phone and there is no adjustment to accommodate different phone sizes. I ended up buying a new cable, but I would prefer not to have to do that if I were to buy this item again. Overall, a good product with a great design. --------------------------

I have had no problems with it up to this point, so I was excited when Sony announced the FS700 with WiFi.  the thing is great in theory, but the quality of the video is terrible, it's awful.

It's not a bad camera by any means, and certainly worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm glad I bought this device. The best thing about it is that the remote control has 3 inputs:   1. Audio - is pretty good for a small unit and works well  2. DSD (I've used it several times and it works great)  3. Video (I use this as a monitor)   This is not a video camera or a camcorder, but it can get the job done.   The main drawback is that you can't turn it on and off. It also takes about a minute to load video, and I have no clue what you can do to make the video last longer. It's a little awkward to use and I like the convenience of being able to use the remote controls.   in addition to that, my favorite part about the remote is that I can use the on/off button to go back and forth between the video and audio sources without having to use a button. I don't have to touch the screen when I watch TV or movies.   to wrap it up, I think it's a great price for what it does and for the features it can do.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    " I have had a Digitech D6 for several months now and I've used it to do everything from playing old games to watching videos. It is definitely a better looking computer than my old computer and I like having the option to set it up to work as a PC at times. It's much faster than my other computers and I am able to use it to the fullest on my home network. The video game features are not that good but for a budget computer this is a great choice. I think this is going to be my PC for the next few years. The only negative I have is that it was very hard to get to my wireless network once I got it so I had to make an account with Digitech and set up the wireless connection. That wasn't an easy task but other than that I have no complaints. If you are looking for a cheap computer for your kid this is the one."   Overall:    It's a very nice laptop that is easy to use and has a good computer that is capable of running almost all the games that I've come across.  If I were to have this for my kid I think I'd pay about $100 for it for a good value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ixl e6x bluetooth headset  by: Anonymous on 09/16/2017  Comfort: Durability: I bought this bluetooth device to control my smart tv. I have tried using some wired devices but they don't work as well. After using this device I am 100% satisfied. It is easy to use and it is very comfortable. I can use it while on the run. I am only getting this device to work right now because I have some other devices with built in bluetooth which I use to control the tv and other devices. I just need to get this one to work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just received my new Tandy 1000T and was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use of the machine. It's so much easier to use than my old P.I.T. 1000, which was a clunky and bulky device. This was the perfect size for me, I use my computer on the bed side table. You can plug it in and go. It is quiet and doesn't make any noise when I run it. The speed is much faster than I expected, and I really like the keyboard and scroll wheel! I love it, but I don't use it at night so I'm using it at work.   Great machine. You won't be disappointed. I did have a problem with the cable (the one with the light). I bought this and it had the light on it, however when I plugged it in the light would come on. I unplugged it, turned it off and plugged it back in and the light came on. But I can't find the cable.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my macbook pro for almost 6 months now, and i have found a lot of good features, and the keyboard is very good, and it is easy to control it with one hand, and for my main work, i use it for music, and my pc is also a mac and so i have a lot in common with my computer. and i love the screen and the sound quality, its really a very nice computer. but i have had some problems with the sound, i have to press a little harder to hear a good volume, so there must be something wrong, but i dont know what. so it was a good computer, i just dont know if the sound is something wrong with the macbook, or the pc, but it was an excellent computer until my sound went out, i could not hear a sound from my pc and my mac started making noise which was the sound i was listening to on my mac. and to this day, when i was on the computer it didnt really make any sound, it just stopped making a sound. and my PC is a samsung galaxy s3, so i am not sure what went wrong. but when i tried it on the mac it worked just fine, i dont think the mac sound is wrong or something.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product. I just picked up a second one to have for my own use.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 26, 2017  Works well, but must do better  by A Customer from Southport, FL USA  Pros: Easy install, solid performance  Cons: Difficult to operate after initial setup  Review: The TV remote is fine. However, the screen is not the same as the picture on the TV, the buttons don't work as well, and there is some ghosting on the picture. The sound works but a little jaggy. The remote is nice enough, but you would think a little more than a single button control would be more than enough. I'm not sure if I can ever go back to using the TV remote and using the control box over the TV. .  the only issue was the difficulty in connecting the TV to the control system. This was an easy repair and I did it myself. But I wish they would have included a way to control the TV from another system.  in my opinion, these things should be sold together, instead of having to buy each separately. -Ralph from South Carolina  Overall: Quality: Price: Reliability: This review is from: Works well,but must do Better  "good product, easy install"  By David from Los Angeles CA USA  the TV control has worked well with a Samsung plasma.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my new computer, it is small and light and has many features that i need and it works great. I do not use my pc much because i have a small office and i use my computer to watch tv, listen to music and play games. I was afraid that i might need my old computer to play games and i was right it took me several times to be able to get to games on my old machine. I love the small, light weight of this computer and it has a nice keyboard with keys that are good for my hands. The computer works great with my windows 7 but the last time i used it, it didn't load the windows update, and i have tried many times to fix it and no luck. The thing that i dislike the most about the computer is the display screen. It has a very small resolution so i find it hard to read and the screen color is very washed out and hard to see anything at all. Overall, i love this computer. My only concern is that it would be great if there was an option to use a wireless keyboard and mouse.  3 of 3 people found the following review helpful: Great product July 20, 2011 Reviewer: Anonymous Person I bought a new computer a year ago and i am very pleased with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device now for a month. Its great. its nice to look at. its has lots of functions. i also use it for my tv. the interface is easy to use and the tv is easy too watch. also its easy to connect and disconnect from my tv with out having to go into my tv menu, as well as setting it to the tv i want to watch. ive been using it with my i5 with all my g3s, g3p, s3w and g3gs. Its been great with those models. ve been using the tv and a g3g for the last month. and it hasnt even been in my house 5 days yet. I dont know if ive a defective unit, but ive yet to have to replace it. the tv doesnt have an easy way to use the usb hub, but the tv works. The ipod jack isnt very sturdy and ive lost it before. iv seen a couple of other reports of broken ipod jacks in this same model and iv been having the same problem. i am considering changing from the samsung s3g to the pio2. but iv still not had to replace the ipod. the ipad 2 is a good idea and ave used it for the past 4 months and the iphone hasnt yet. its pretty good for the price and ives been happy with it. I also found out that ive got a dongle for this ipad too!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a few of these as backups of my PC, and for my work I love that it comes with a couple of USB ports.  When it's plugged into my laptop I have my work documents, word, and presentation files on it, and when I'm done I can unplug it and store it in my flash drive.  Just like a book  It's an excellent backup device, but it doesn't have any storage capacity.   It takes up 2 USB slots but only gets 2TB of storage space.    It also is extremely loud and annoyingly expensive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this about three months ago and I'm so happy I did!  I had a little trouble getting the battery to charge in the first couple days but I've had no problems since.  It has a really smooth and quiet sound when it works.    The screen is super bright and has the best colors of any screen I've seen.  I've used a lot of computer screens in the past so the screen is great.  Also it is a lot smaller than the other units and the only problem is that it's very difficult to insert batteries in this unit.  If it's a problem for you, there are better models out there.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The ZXV620 does its job without complaint. The screen is the same size as the one on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, which is the biggest tablet I've ever owned. I'm not sure if it's because the Samsung screen is so much bigger, or the ZX500's screen isn't as bright as the Tab's, but I don't find that to be a major issue. It's very bright in direct sunlight, and the text in most apps is readable. It has a wide viewing angle, and I really like the way the screen lights up when I read e-books. The only thing I don;t like about the screen is that I have to use the mouse to move the cursor around in Windows Office, which isn't very comfortable for me. This will probably not be an issue for many people, but it bothers me that it's not the default setting.   One thing I'd recommend is to look at other options to adjust your settings. For example, there's a little LED light that's built into the Z500's bottom edge, which flashes to warn you when the screen brightness gets low. That will be useful for people who sit in front of the TV, but not so useful for reading at night. On the other hand, the LED light on the Z50's bottom bezel is too bright to see when it flashes.   to find out more about how the ZV520 works. Click here to check it out. To find out how well the ZL500 can read your tablet's screen, click here. To check out our video reviews, click on the links below: The ZX521's battery lasts a long time (9.2 hours), so I can read for a few hours on a good day. However, on my iPad Air, the ZZ521 lasted an average of only 8.3 hours. If you use the iPad Air frequently, and you are worried about the battery, then the Z51 might be a better choice. The Z52's display isn't quite as bright and isn't nearly as wide as the ZE500's, so I wouldn't use it if I'm reading a lot of books on it. The size of the Z52 means I can't use its screen to write on it, which takes a bit of getting used to. The fact that it doesn't have a stylus makes me a bit worried that it won't get

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I just purchased a Tx3 and really like the features of it. It's been working great for a few months now. I have two kids and am having a hard time finding a good deal on the Tx5 (which I'm considering, but the TX3 works perfectly). So far, I haven't been disappointed in this product. Thanks!  I wish I had known about this product long ago. This is the first time I have bought an electronic device and it is a perfect solution for my needs. I was very surprised how well it works for the price.  My favorite feature: the button is large.  I own a bunch of digital cameras (not that I would say this is a "digital camera" but it has a micro-USB port) and have always been frustrated with the button on those cameras. They're really small, so a lot of them don't have buttons on them. This device takes up no space whatsoever. It is an easy button to use for me. The battery last for two days with regular usage. I just connect it to my laptop and it has never had a problem. I've also used it as a flash drive for pictures and movies. If you're looking for an inexpensive digital camera, I highly recommend this product  It Works! Works great.  to get it going you need to first connect the usb cable to the back of the device and then turn on the computer. Then you will see a blinking light on the device in which it has to be connected to the computer by the usb connection. If it doesn't connect, power it down and try to connect the device again.  (just turn it on)  Great product!! I own many different cameras and none of them are as small as this unit. The only problem i have is that it doesn´t have an usb port.  and it doesnt flash, it just keeps on playing the audio file. but still, i cant be more happier about it.  was able to see and do everything with the unit  This is a great little camera, It is very small and works perfectly.   I have it set up on my laptop for taking pictures of my kids to take to my cell phone. I like the quick setup of the software too! My kids love it, I had a hard get them to play with it. All I can say is if you want something small and portable then buy this!

The only drawback was that I couldn't find any kind of headphone amp. If you have a good quality pair of headphones, you might be able to use the Blue Ski Snowball as a pair of portable headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first device I have ever owned and i have been searching for an inexpensive way to view a large number of data from my computer. The display was very easy to adjust and the software to view it was easy to find on my computer.. It can be hard to get the numbers and graphs to appear in a readable manner when using large files on a display as large as this, but it is worth it. It is a nice way to show your data if you are using small files or just want to show it to others.  Rated 4 out of 5 by jasonf. from Good value This is a good display device. The color and brightness are good for the size. The main issue with this unit is that the battery life seems to be somewhat short. The unit comes with a single USB cable, but there does not seem to be any built in charging ports. For a unit that is only a little more than $60 (with a battery that lasts for two years), this would be a bit annoying.  with out a question - i like it. I have it on the desk in my home office where i can see the screen easily without having to be standing. The light is a great feature. Also it can be mounted in a way that makes it stand and is not only in view but you have to look at it with the computer, for that alone. the only thing i have a little bit of a problem with is the battery - i get a few hours of screen on time and it dies within half an hour or so, but sometimes it doesn't charge at all and the only way i can get it to charge is with a USB wall charger. It's not a big deal, but would definitely be worth it to purchase one with a full charged battery. Overall very happy and satisfied with my purchase
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ It is an old, but very good, computer. I like it. I was using a computer on a different line, which I did not like. It was too small, and would not hold any programs and not even a couple of floppy disks. I could not connect to any of the machines on the other line, and this one was better for me because it has a large keyboard and many programs for working on it. A nice size. The modem and the printer work well. It is hard to believe that this computer, so far, is over 50 years old. This computer is the best computer I have ever had. I can type at least 50 words per minute. I use the word processing program called WordStar. It has a very large character set and many font styles, including bold and italic. I have been using this computer for over 10 years. I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This little device allows you to make your own homemade tinctures (medicinal herbal brews) of herbs from your kitchen. You don't have to bother with the trouble of purchasing and storing a supply of ingredients.  I use it daily to make my herbal tincture of horseradish and chamomile. It does the job well. I put my herbs into the "brix" bottle and add distilled water. (I find that to be the most efficient way to do this) When the bottle is full, it's ready to be consumed. It really doesn't take long, about 5 minutes. I'm not sure how long the herb will stay effective, but it certainly will make a big difference if you take it regularly. :  Was this review helpful to you?

I was just holding the case against the phone and accidentally dropped it. If that happened in your home you would not be happy with the quality, but for being a dollar less than the original iphon the quality is a B+.  Customer service response: Thank you for the positive review, it sounds like you may not have the best iPhone case. We're sorry about that. If you are still using the original, we would recommend that you bring it in and have it professionally inspected. That's our first priority.  Good quality for the price The case itself is good quality and doesn't leak. The buttons work well, and I like the fact that I can attach my Apple accessories and use it as a stand. The one thing I would change about it is the case that came with it doesn't have a hole in the bottom for the phone to fit into. I purchased an adapter and it fits perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this device to store my harddrive (had a problem with it previously) and it does a good job! I was able to connect my 3.5 inch and 2.5inch harddrives together, and the only thing the device does not allow me to do is connect the drives to the computer with a cable, but I'm going to try and work out that problem. it can charge my phone for 3-4 hours when it gets low on charge. I also used this to watch movies over 3D. It charged my iPhone and connected to my TV perfectly. I only use my phone from my bed when i can't afford to use my laptop, and this is the perfect solution.  Rated 1 out of 5 by rjnjk from Worst Buy ever I bought this to power an HD and 2 Macbooks. However the HD was not powered at all even though it was plugged in and the power LED was lit. My Macbooks power light didn't even light and so on. Not happy at all and so frustrated that I wasted my money. , but it charges my iPhone for 3 hours when i'm using my laptop. . The problem I had was that it had a small capacitor that was going out, it charged my phone, but at an incredible rate and it drained my battery very fast. My question for the people who ordered this. How is a 5V adapter going to work with a 3V battery? It would be much better to buy a 5v adapter than a 3v one. And another question for anyone who wants to try to charge their iPhone. The charger I have is not rated to charge my iPhone, and it doesn't work. I have tried every charger on the market for iPhone charging it all works fine except for iPhone 7 charging.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a good product, works as advertised and it looks great. Very well made. Only thing I wish it had was a built in microphone or something like that.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, September 15, 2010  Does what it is intended to do  by Christopher from Fairbanks, AK USA  Pros: small, lightweight, compact, and very easy to use.  (it works as intended)  Cons: nothing  Review: This small electronic device works very well. When you put the battery back in, the device can be turned off, or in the case of the "Easily Mountable" version, the battery holder can be attached directly to the camera, without removing the camera from its body. I found this very useful for my digital SLR camera, with my tripod and/or monopod. The battery life of this battery is also very good for the size, as my camera usually lasts about 3 days on a full charge. As for the cons: the only one I have is for a very small camera like the K-10 (which is why it's rated at 7-9 hours of use). But if you want to record the sound of your DSLR, you will have to buy a separate microphone. The "Easy Mountable and Sturdy" version of the device is very light and has little play in it. But if the camera body is not stable (like the K10 or the Pentax K-5), this can be a disadvantage for your camera. .  and as for this being "easily mountable": i have my camera mounted onto a tripod, but you can also put this camera onto a sling on a tree, a branch, or onto a small bush.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was searching the internet for a device like the one used by my brother, it was an electronic product, and he made a comment that it is very strong, so I purchased it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for about 6 months. it has a decent amount of memory and plays some nice music. the sound is pretty nice but you cant really go crazy and turn it up. the only drawback is its battery life. ive been trying to get it to charge fast since i bought it. its great for listening to music or watching videos but if i'm on the go, the battery is the only thing that holds me back from giving it 5 stars.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes (0) No (0): I can hear what i want.  beep beep! Not great sound quality. Not to bad for $15... it's cheap enough to buy more than one! Was this review useful to you at all? Yes No  wasn't able to get sound I liked the look and I liked that it did have a bluetooth feature. When I bought it, I wasn't able get sound. I used it with my phone and the mic and the phone was unable to pick up sound. It was frustrating and I couldn't figure it out. I ended up returning it. The sound was poor. I don't know if that's what they were meant to do but it's a shame because it's one of the nicest looking little devices. Was this a good purchase? Was this helpful to your experience with it? Yes  Great Sound, Great Price The device can be quite loud. I've found that the sound quality of the device is decent and that it is well made. I'm not a heavy audiophile but I've had the device for several years and it seems to perform as expected. It does have a headphone jack which I found handy. The device also has bluetooth and a microUSB port which allows me to charge it. For the cost I'm very happy with it. Was also very pleased with the box. Was not impressed with the software. Was disappointed with the product overall. Overall, I would buy it again and recommend it. I think the price makes it worth a shot. Was it a good experience? Was it useful to your needs?  This device works great, but the software is a huge pain. I purchased it to listen to my audio books for an exam, and it does what it is supposed to do: It picks up audio. But you need to install a driver and then enter an ISBN and the book becomes available to listen with your phone. I was also

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Good device but be cautious in what you plug in. The USB connector is very brittle and can be cracked easily, so please use a good quality usb connector like a cheapo usb to micro usb cable. The cable does not come with any connectors, but i was able to find several on ebay for very cheap. I plugged in an audio cable and my iPod connected fine. I was able get a working audio out of my iPad, but the audio had a weird tinny quality. All of these devices work well with my iPhone, but do not like how they work with my iPad which has a very thin case that can easily break.

The best feature of the two was that they are easy to set up. (Thanks). There are 3 ways to use the alarm - 2 on and 1 off. It was easy for me to install and set up (with the proper instructions).

It had everything i could want out of a computer: great graphics, easy to use, fast and powerful. the only thing that bothers me is the power supply that comes with it, it seems to be pretty weak.   Pros:  - Great Graphics  -- Excellent Sound  --- Good Sound Speakers  Cons:  the power plug is not a plug but an extension cord, if this doesn't work for you, try the "AC adapter" it comes with.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ I am extremely pleased with this unit. It works great! I have 2 other cheap units that failed after only 3 months. This unit has held up for months. I just received mine today (4/18). I have had it set up to the point where it can't go lower than 12 volts. So for me it works as a 9 volt battery powered unit. The only negative thing is that the charger does have to be plugged in every time you use it. I don't understand why it has to be. It does not take very long to charge at all, only about 2 hours. It has been great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a Sennheiser Momentum headset on Ebay. I have only had it about a month but I am very happy with it. It is a great price and good quality for the price. I do wish they sold more colors and a higher volume for the small earphones. It would also be nice if they would be a little more comfortable. I also do not recommend them for long sessions. It does a lot of work but it is a little on the big side when I play music. Other than that it does what it is supposed to.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________ I really enjoy this keyboard. I own many, and they all have their pros and cons. This one is just plain great. I'm using it with a TKL, but you can use any keyboard. The keys are huge and there's a very good range of pressure. It's definitely not a light keyboard, but it is very easy to use. You can get into programming, and even a decent spreadsheet program with it. The fact that you can do everything with your finger on the keys is amazing. If you have a lot of keys and want something really big, this one is for you. I am using it as a workstation and for everything that I do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was the first time I used it and I had a lot of fun. I was worried it might be too big but it fits all of my electronic devices. If it were a bit bigger I think I might need to take it off all together.   The battery lasted me from about a week to a month. I didn't have to re-charge it once during the entire time I had it so I can't really say it's too big for any one use. It's just too big and heavy for any single use. However, I can see that this would be perfect for camping and travel.   (Posted on 10/11/2013)  Good Product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikon digital camera  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, January 02, 2010  Works as described  by John from New York, NY  Pros: Excellent pictures, compact size  Cons: Battery life not good for a digital camera, and slow autofocus  Review: I bought this camera as a backup camera in case my Nikon D3100 fails to take pictures, or for a portable camera that I could take with me when hiking.  The images are very good and are much better than I expected from a digital back up camera. I find it very easy to use.  a lot of images are in very good detail and there are a lot more that are better than my Nikon, but I can still use it as a main camera and keep on taking pictures, although with much less detail and much slower, but also much better pictures. ,but I can take advantage of the fast processor, so I can make pictures even faster with my digital camera if need be. The battery life is not so good, although the camera works perfectly with a battery pack. I have not tried to recharge it with a USB charger, but the camera seems to work well with a single USB cable. . I am satisfied with the results and the camera, even if it doesn't have a battery cover that I can put over it for a long time, just to protect it.  that is all for now,  John  No Was this Review helpful to you?

I don't see any need to get any cheaper  Review of DJ-P-Pix Digital Photo Wall Stacker I have owned my DJ-PB1-L for about 2 weeks now and I really like it. I used it in my dorm room and the pictures are so sharp and crisp on my wall. The only issue I have is it's so easy to get in and out of the way when you need to go in and around your computer. You could have a hard time fitting the DJ-pb1-l in the corner of your room. The included wall cover is not a good idea either. It's a plastic thing that you have to stick it on the wall with a lot of glue and screws. I got the cover to hide the wires, but the thing just falls off every time you move it. A better option would be a metal cover. I do not regret purchasing this unit though because of the quality of the images.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought one of these because I use it to store music and videos, and have always enjoyed the audio quality it has with the ability to play with both speakers at the same time. With a little tweaking, I was able to get the volume level up to near my ear's hearing range, which is great. It's still way, way too quiet for a bedroom environment, but it will do.   So far so good. The last one I bought I used in my living room (which has very small speakers) and it came with a very short cord (which I just cut off so it wouldn't get in the way). When I plugged it in, the speakers would not turn on (they'd just be loud) but that's understandable for a new unit because I think it's supposed to take a while to figure out. It will probably be a few days before I can play with it in my bedroom (I live in a house with about 3 people) but for now, it does what it was made to do.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own the first generation iPod shuffle. It's been great. My only complaints are: 1) the batteries that came with it lasted forever, but then I bought more (3 or 4). 2) I have the newer iPod touch (6th gen), and they don't hold a charge very well. 3) It would work perfectly fine as a MP3 player, but for some reason, it won't record videos. I've looked into it, and I'm assuming it's a software issue with the player and the videos being too big to be recorded. But it'd be nice if Apple would fix this, and provide the software so it's actually possible. And for $250, it's great.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The fact that it is built better and more expensive than my old A7S is also a great plus.   I got my A7r and a Canon 5D3 with this and had a great time with the 5D III, the only drawback was the noise level on the 5d3 was too much for the A7-N, but it didn't seem to bother me enough that I needed to change to a higher resolution lens. The A7s is still on my list of cameras to buy.   is the only downside that I really can't complain about, the camera is powerful and does a good job, and the picture quality is great. I am definitely going to buy this and have it as a backup when I travel, it is perfect as my primary camera for hiking and general use.  on March 01, 2017 — Great upgrade!   Was a big upgrade over the original Sony A series. I still miss the size and ergonomics of the older Sony cameras, but I'm glad this new camera is so much better, especially if you are a studio shooter. It seems to work great, and I've only used it for a couple of days and it's so light and compact.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned this for 4 months and i love it. it is very quiet. the only thing i dont like is the button that says "stop" in front of the play button. if i press that, it doesnt stop the music and the volume. the only way to stop is to turn the unit off with a wire. i love this product  Rated 4 out of 5 by Kd from Good product. Has a short cable that it's hard to use... Good product., has a short wire that it s hard to connect, especially if your in the middle of a song. It is hard to stop the song from going to the next song when the song stops and goes to the start of the next.  Customer Testimonials

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone7splus works great after buying it last month, the only problem i had was the screen started to crack on the second day i bought it. it wasnt a big problem, but it did make me stop using it for 2 days or so. the screen was still working fine after that. i did buy another one of the exact same model so i dont know if they change anything on this model.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, July 16, 2015  works well but a little expensive  by Mark from Aliquippa PA USA  Review: Works fine but is pricey  Pros: The battery life is great  Cons: No power button on front  Price and performance: Priced better than most I found on the market  Recommend: I bought my phone because of the quality and I have no problem with it  (Review of smartphone by Jeff from San Diego, CA)  Product: Ipad Air (13" Retina) I had a Ipad 8.2 that had a screen crack on one corner. Was looking to upgrade my old device. This thing is great. The display is brilliant. Its a little pricey but a lot of the other ones in this price range are crap. I got the iPad Air 2 and it was just as amazing. Only complaint I have is on the side of the tablet there is no power button. If you need a power button then go for a phone and not a tablet.  a big plus to this device is the ability to upgrade your ios or android device through the cloud, if you dont want to deal with it then go with the other model. If u do want to use it as a mobile device, well this thing is perfect for it. .  The screen on this tablet is beautiful  . Great battery life. I will be purchasing another after a year.  at this price its hard to go wrong  Did you find this helpful? 10 of 10 Found Helpful  Reviewed by: from St. Louis, MO United States. 1
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought a lot of computer monitors in the past but this is the first one that i got that i didnt have to adjust. i didnt notice it til i played around with it and the colors are great and very vivid. a good choice and great price for it as well.  Have had this monitor for a while now. It is fantastic. I use to have the 27" monitor for my MacBook Pro so i was excited when I saw this one at Best Buy. I love the color and clarity. I have an iMac G3 2.2ghz and I have noticed a big difference in the color of everything with this one. I cant wait for a Mac Pro that has a 27" model to go with it.  in the last 3 years I've had a lot different monitors but this one is by far the best. I like the color the better than my previous monitors. If you want a really great gaming monitor you need to look into this one  I bought this monitor a few weeks ago as a replacement for my 24" Macbook Pro. I had my eye on this monitor since about April. I've been using my old monitor for about a month and a half now, and I can't say enough good things about it. It's super bright and bright colors, the resolution is great. But I've definitely got bigger things to worry about (a macbook pro) and I've got nothing but praise for this monitor. , I've heard nothing but great things about this monitor, including having a very good picture quality. The only problem I'm having is that I keep getting blue light issues on it, so I think it needs a more sensitive blue light filter.  the best I ever had so far I have always been impressed with Macs, and this one of the best so far. It has the biggest monitor in my collection, so far, and at an excellent price. Great value. :)  best ive seen This monitor is amazing, colors are perfect and very bright. The colors look fantastic and it's super easy to setup. This is the monitor I have been looking for. . I bought this one for my macbook mini it was really amazing i love it  good but need a better screen saver, and also some more screen color correction I am a mac user and have always had Macbook Pros in my home office. I recently bought a Dell and decided to purchase a mac laptop

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________________  Great product. I am a hobbyist who has been using an Ampeg for about 30 years. The sound has always been awesome. I just purchased a Celestion G6 (which I will get to later) and wanted to keep the sound of my Ampeg but wanted it to be quieter. I did some research and read that the M2A is better than the CX6. I went on Amazon and found it was at $59. This is almost half the price and it works great. You have to charge it with a 5 volt charger but it will work with a 9 volt car charger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I was afraid to buy an inexpensive e-cigarette because of the problems people were having with them. But I was completely wrong. I've used this product for about a year. I was a smoker. I didn't want my kids to start. I could quit cold turkey but couldn't. I have smoked with them, but I was too tired to be a productive smoker. This device has helped me in numerous ways. I get the feeling that my smoking habits have not changed at all. I don't smoke as much now, and I do it on my own. I smoke a few puffs per cigarette, but not much. I never get that tired feeling. And it does make the room feel a little more pleasant. If you are a smoker that has tried and failed to quit smoking, then try it. If not, you will love it.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!  I am impressed with the performance of this receiver. I have been using it for a while now and have not had any issues with it or the receiver.  What I like: - No noise with the radio or other items. - The range is great! - The screen is excellent. - I have had a few issues with the RF and now the RF cable. - There is a screen lock function. - It is a real high quality piece of kit. - Battery life is great and it charges in minutes. - Can't beat it! If you are looking for a receiver for the money, this is a great option. I bought one for my wife who lives way too far away for me to put her up on the air but would love to have a radio in the car.  (Posted on 10/16/2017)  WOW!!!!!! Review by Mike W. . I am very satisfied with my purchase and the radio works flawlessly. Very quiet radio (almost silent) when you are traveling and this radio is very versatile as well. It also is a nice addition to the vehicle stereo (I have a Subaru Legacy with a 9" AM/FM tuner, a Sony TCD-800X CD player and I use this radio with a Pioneer CD-X1000BX CD receiver. Works like a charm. Also the batteries that come with it do a great job of keeping the radio running for a long time. I love this radio. It is not cheap but you will not be disappointed.  of my radio is not a very good radio, but it's very good enough for what I need. (Posted the 01/24/2014)  at my radio i like it very much but some of the songs that i hear on the radio is too loud on my radio. but i will not complain to a radio company to have more options and better quality (Posted 02/02/2014)...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've bought the Noxema one. It does the job. It gets the job done without making me feel like I need to do a heavy duty cleaning of the interior. You can still hear the noise and it's not too loud. I did not buy the remote though. It sounds too small for the task. I don't mind when the remote is on though. The whole thing is very compact and well constructed. The one thing that keeps me from giving it a five star is the batteries. I was expecting a rechargeable battery, but I got the non-rechargeable one instead. And I had to put a couple extra batteries in the remote to get the battery life I needed. So you will need to keep track of the charging time.  This review is from: Noxemum Noxeme   Pros: Good price, small and easy to use, good price Cons: not rechargeable, not good for large surface area, small batteries  this review is for: noxemimum   This product is a must for the home and is the perfect size for most electronic devices. The noise level is not too bad and the remote works great. I've purchased four of these to replace the batteries on my car and they work like a charm.  of the 5 I've used in my home, they worked very well with the new batteries.   great value   good value  .  ,.   and the NOS version of this product was about $9 cheaper...   ,.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an amazing little thing. This is the first smart device that I've ever owned and I absolutely love it. It's a bit small, but it gets the job done. I have used it for the last week, and it has saved me a lot of money. I'm on my third week now and I have to say that I love it and it's been absolutely perfect for what I needed it for. I haven't had any issues with it at all, and I'm more than happy with it. I was a bit skeptical about buying it, but when I found the video for it, I thought "why not?" I really like this device and I look forward to buying one for my brother who doesn't have one. I highly recommend this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best bluetooth speaker that i've seen. It has everything i need. it has a huge sound, and the music i was listening to was just amazing, and it's rechargeable.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, February 28, 2011  Works great!  by Chris from Hagerstown MD USA  Pros: Rechargeable, Bluetooth, looks good, good battery life, great sound  Cons: Not much else to say  Review: It works great, works great with my phone. Bluetooth is really great, and rechargeable, I use the phone as a computer when I'm on the road. I use mine with my wife's phone and she has no complaints about it. The power supply can be a little hot so you need to take care to keep it cool. But it has some of the best sound you will ever listen to. I bought the blue version and I love it, it's definitely worth the price!  is a great way to listen to music when your away from your wireless mp3 device. It is rechargeable so that I don't have to worry about changing the batteries. It will recharge to full with just one hour of use! It works well with the phone and computer with my iPhone 4S. It connects over bluetooth to my wireless mp player and works great! I recommend this product highly! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best USB keyboard I have ever used, the key layout is great and I have never had any problems using it. I was having trouble getting the keycap set to work, and this keyboard solved that problem. The cable is also a great value for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The best keycap on the market.  Good product at a fair price:  I bought this because I want a compact keyboard that is also small and has an SD card slot for music. I liked the compact keyboard, but the cable is too long (about 20cm) and the key caps are tiny. Overall I would definitely recommend this if your budget is tight.  andi2i2b - 15/05/2018  Great keyboard, works well with linux...  I bought this product because I would like a USB keyboard that would fit my Macbook, and not to have to buy a new keyboard. Well done, as usual  This is a great product for the money. It has a very compact and easy to use form. I haven't used linux on this yet, so I can't comment on that, but it should be more or less the same as other popular linux keyboards.  toshaban - 09/06/2018

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent product. It is very easy to install and it works very well. The battery life is better than expected, but I did not try long enough to say. My daughter is the one who can use this the most with a cord and she has a lot of fun with it.  Have not used it: The screen is small and the device doesn't come with instructions.  in the end, it was not worth the price.  of course i paid full price, i only think it's a waste of money. , if it were any bit more than that, it would be worth it. I am going to try to do it anyway, but that seems to be a big deal to you. .  a bit small. The batteries are in the device, so not really an issue, but the screen wasnt very bright. I do think it is a good product. I just wish you would let us know if your batteries do not give you enough power. I don't want to be stuck with only being able to use the light at night. I also would like to know when the device will stop working. This is especially true if it's been running for hours. I will be using it in the day but not in the night. The battery life was disappointing. I did expect a lot more. If your looking for something like this for your kid, I think you will be happy. It would be a good idea to let us, the customer, know what type of light they are getting. That way we can make the decision about our son or daughter. Have I been ripped off? I paid full retail price for this item. I have had mine about 3 days. I think the battery life should be a lot better. The screen could use some improvement. I would definitely buy from Amazon again. Thanks for a good one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using this item for some time now. It is great. I don't like having to use an adapter to get a lot of power, and the price is really good. So far I've found it to be more durable and less of a hassle than my old "mighty" radio.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second time buying the Aeon Spectrum and again I have to say I am very happy with this purchase. The unit is small and simple and does everything I need and more. The software is simple to use and very efficient and easy to manage and the sound quality of the system is excellent. You can't go wrong with this unit and I will continue to recommend it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan M. from Amazing Sound This is a very powerful system. I am a former sound guy for a company that manufactures audio equipment. I'm in awe at how good the sound is with the A/D conversion. The sound is clear, dynamic, and musical. I just wish it was a little cheaper. I was looking for a budget system that would get the job done for the money but also be fun to play. This unit gets the job and more than the job. . 1) Sound quality from the preamp (I use a Dac) is just what I was expecting. The output is clean and punchy. It's very clear with no muddyness and no annoying distortion. In fact, this thing really shines when I use the Dac to process a very high bit depth audio file. I think the A10/A11 converter is the perfect solution for this job and I can't see myself not using this converter at my next gig. #2) The software (Spectrum) is very easy to use. It has all of the features you could want. The options to set the crossover point and the gain are a breeze to use as well. And it all works. Very fast and responsive.  #3) The included software, iMUSE, is exactly what I needed. The way I use it is to put the file into the main app (Spectral) and then set it as the source for my Dac, and then use my DAC as a decoder in iMUS. It all works wonderfully. 4) I was surprised that the A11 was slightly louder than my amp. I have an amp that is rated at 50 watts. However, in my room, it can sound louder than the A7 because it has more distortion. However if I use my amp to drive the A6, and the A3 as my DAC, then I get the same output. That is really all that I can say. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. The price point

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus - July 29, 2010 I am new to the internet, and I found this website from a friend of mine that just got my first computer. The site was very useful and gave me the information I needed. I will be back to this website to order more products.  Write a negative review about the product you received: icky - April 14, 2010 Very unsatisfied. I think this could be better with a more detailed user guide.  on of the cables was a bit short, and then it started failing immediately, then i found that the other cables were short also. All the cables should be double sided. The one for my ipod was also bad and the other one for the ipod is good.  in all its a great product but if you dont have the time to read the whole user guide and how to wire your devices I dont think this will be worth it for the price. , but for a great deal, i give it 4 stars., but for ato.com. it is a great price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great unit. There is only one control to find out what is going on. It does exactly what it says it will do. I was going to go with a DMM instead but it has it's own problems.  The picture shows that it has a built in light. Yes, I did buy it for a Christmas present. This is an outstanding gift for any one that has a problem with their dog or is curious about how to deal with a small pet. This unit is well worth the money and a great idea for a beginner. I also recommend it to people that are looking for a good looking unit. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only complaint I have is that I wish the cable on the back was reversible. Otherwise it is a great product! The only complaint i have is the cable at the back. It has two female ends that have to be connected to the plug before the device can be used. I've tried them out for about 2 weeks now and they're both on. I don't think they can be changed so I'm hoping that's the only problem. If not it will work great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is great because it helps you record the exact time for your day. The battery is a good length too, I've only used it for one day so I can't comment on the endurance but I plan on keeping it for a few more years.   I purchased it for my own personal use, I am not a professional photographer but I do enjoy the results of my pictures.  , I plan to purchase a similar one for my wife when she finishes her degree and wants to get a professional camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The unit worked as described. I was able to get 4 hours of use out of it with a battery that lasted me a whole day, and it did not run out of juice. My only complaint is that the button was a little hard to find, but I think I got it after I tried to reset it. I like the ability to take pictures and take notes and the app is easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - great for taking notes  - the pen works very well  (I used to have a ballpoint, but I found that this thing works much better)   It does a pretty good job, but the problem comes when you try to work off a sheet of paper. The pen is too sensitive and the whole sheet of papers falls off. It took me a couple days to get used to that. The main advantage I find to this pen is its flexibility. It holds a lot of information, and you can write a lot on one page. The one drawback is that it does not stay flexible. I ended up using a rubber eraser to keep it in shape.   The most important thing is that this pen writes nicely and with good detail.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This little gem is a work of art and deserves it's place on your desk. The build quality is outstanding. The buttons, connectors, and connections are all very well designed and simple to use. There's a few slight nicks on the body, but nothing major. Everything is made from high quality plastic and works well, the only downside is it seems to take the power cord much longer to charge than others that use a standard AC adapter.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have a iBook G4 with it, and it works great! This is my 2nd iBook. The first one lasted almost 3 years. I'm using my iPad now. I love the keyboard, and the screen is much brighter.  What I don't like:!!!!!! I have some major problems with this. I get a black screen after 10 minutes of using it. This is a big problem if you have to read emails or texts. The other problem is the battery. After 1 hour on a battery charge, it would die. So i would charge it every other day. That didn't work, so I had to put it in sleep mode. It didn't take that long, but it still died after 10 min. Then I have to put the keyboard in charge and it still has no charge.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* I bought the W5 and I am happy with it! It has everything I need for my work at home. I was getting confused for how to setup wifi on my home computer, and a friend of mine told me this app will do the trick. I am a professional photographer so I have a lot of gear to take photos. This is the only thing I want to use at home for my photos because I can take pictures in front of my TV or monitor. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because the camera is slow in taking pictures. I have the W8 and that is the fastest it takes pictures on my computer! The other thing I like is that the app is free, so I don' have to pay for other apps that are only limited to taking pictures, then downloading them. Great app!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.............................................. I was a little skeptical of the review because I really like to record my songs so I thought the sound would be horrible, but my ears were pleasantly surprised! I don't record as much as I used to and sometimes just need a quick note to remind myself what I need to focus on. I have the "VibraSonics" app and that helps a lot. My recording time goes from several hours to 30 minutes for short recordings. I love the app and how easy it is to use. The mic has a great sound, is clear and clear enough to make a great live performance and record vocals, great sound in the studio and great for when you are working on a project but not looking to spend hours recording the whole song.  Good quality sound at an incredible price:............................... This thing rocks. I bought this to record songs, but I have had good luck with other products I've used. I'm in love. I wish the mic would have an input on the other end for mics and guitar picks but they don't. I really can't complain, it works great. I just wish the cord was longer, but that's my only complaint. All in all a great product for a great price. . - Chris. -  If you're thinking of getting this product, the quality of the mic is absolutely stellar. The microphone is incredibly clear with great audio quality. It has a unique design so you can mount it to a mic stand or a stand you can set up, or to the front of the camera that can also be set up. The USB port is very clean and it's easy to use and the built in microphone input can be switched to any mic input on your computer. I think you're getting a pretty good product at an amazing price. I use it exclusively for recording vocals, guitar, bass, etc., with a few songs from my "Hollywood" album as well. We'll make you a product that you'll love: ........................... The only problem I've had is with the mic and the software. I would have thought if it was as good as advertised, it would have been easier to get it to work, but it just didn't work.

It's the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever owned. .  and it's easy to set up and operate. /  . I would highly recommend this product  I use this on my laptop and on my home stereo system. I'm looking forward to adding more wireless audio gear to my collection. ,  Thank you for your review, C! You are correct that the Denons have the best sound quality! This is by far the best pair of wireless headphones that I have owned and I have purchased several sets of wireless cans over the years. The AVRX2000s are easily the best wireless pair that I own. They fit well in my headphones cup and are also very easy to operate. I love them.  with a lot of wireless gear and all, I feel that Denon is the leader in the wireless audio industry. The quality of these headphones is so far beyond any other headphones that have come out since I started using them that I would recommend them to every wireless user. They work on computers and laptops as well as my iPod and I can even connect them to my desktop. I do not know how these headphones would sound on a home stereo set but they sound great. :D Thank you for the very positive review. I like that you can also use these headphones in a PC/Laptop if you have an AVR machine. The Denons I have have been my top choice for a long time and they are still my favorite in that class.The AVR has the best overall sound. If you want a wireless pair of Bluetooth headphones, that you could use on any type of audio device, I recommend the Denona. These are well worth the extra money for the quality and the performance.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this device for over 3 years. it works perfectly and the quality of the light is superb. i dont think i ever seen a better product. if you are looking for a new light for your car this is the one. the only thing i would change is the cable length. it just doesnt seem to be long enough. but otherwise this is a great unit for a great price.  Have used this light for over a year Now it is going to be my backup battery. , the unit does not seem very well designed, and it does not have the high power I need for long range. However the light does what it is supposed to do and its pretty bright. I use it in my Jeep, and use the LED system as a backup system and I do not think this system will be able to do that job. .I'm really glad I bought this light. The LED lighting is fantastic and is really bright. This unit does what the manufacturer says it is intended to do. You can't beat the price. It is nice having a power pack to have as well. "Best LED Light" By far the best LED light I have ever used. I have bought many of these lights and they are all pretty solid. I've been using them for a year now and I could not be more pleased with them. I can't imagine anyone wanting anything else. I put it up under a car on a full moon, and the light was absolutely brilliant. This is the best light I've ever owned. : I'm a bit late to the LED light party (I've been trying for over four years), but here we are! This is THE brightest LED light on the market. This light is perfect for a headlight for motorcycles and scooters, and for headlights for both cars and trucks. It has been put up under our Jeep, a van and a motorcycle for camping, picnics, hiking, fishing, and everything else I need a powerful, well-lit light for. I bought it for $80, and have used it three times so far. All have worked flawlessly. No complaints here!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A wonderful piece of electronics. I was hesitant about buying it since I was not an electronic engineer (I know, not a very good job), but I was impressed when I first put it together. The first thing I did was open the unit and change out the batteries. The unit works perfectly as advertised. A little on the pricey side, but the build quality is superb. The buttons are also of superb quality and feel very durable. My wife was in the same boat as I was and is very happy with her purchase as well.  I've had it less than a week and I'm very pleased with the design. I can't say enough good things about the product.  be sure and read all the info when you buy one.  "great"  This is my third. the last two lasted a year (not enough for me) but this one was a year and a half or so. I didn't buy it for the longevity of the first two, but this time around I bought this to give my children a better option to keep them entertained without having to lug the old one everywhere they go. They play outside so this unit has to be kept on the outside, and I got the battery included to last about 3-4 hours of actual playing. The only problem I've had is that the plastic buttons are very sticky, and that's all I can say. They'll get sticky if you use them too much. It's not so bad when you're playing games, but if you're trying to play a simple game like word search then you'll have some trouble. I've never had an issue like this before, I just keep the unit in the glove box when I go to work or the grocery store. It works great. ..  Review of 6526  Been using it for 2 1/2 years and it still works fine. The screen is on, but it doesn't work well with my tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the original version of the Sony A7s (1st Gen) camera.   The picture quality is excellent.   A lot of people say that this camera is not very good quality and has high contrast. I bought the A7S with a Sony 16-50mm (55mm f/1.8, 2.8) and a Sigma 10-20mm (35mm f2.8). Both lenses are very good and I have no problem with the high-res.  , but I use the 10-21mm and it's better quality. But I would not say this as an opinion as I just use them on the camera. The 10-22mm is soo much better in the pictures. I use this on my Nikon D700 which is a nice camera but not for high-resolution photography.   The picture quality at 24 is really good (but I'm not using the full frame). It's not good enough for high resolution shooting at that resolution. I just want to have decent quality.   and the noise. No, that's not an opinion, but a fact. It's very low but still it's very obvious.   in fact, for low-res shooting, it is very bad, it's a huge disappointment. I know there's other cameras with this type of lens but I just can't afford it.

Highly recommended.  Have to admit, it is a little pricy, and I wish I had bought the version with a battery rather than the one that came with. But the good part is that this has been a great addition for our household. It does what it says, and if you do have to look up the time it is easy to do. .    From a user of the product to the reviewer:  From: J, Florida  To: Dave R.  the time display is perfect and so accurate you can read the time anywhere at anytime, the only downside to this product is that you have to set it and forget it, but it is very easy to change the time, it just takes a second.

I use this watch for my business also I love the fact that I can set the time to my time zone so when I get off the plane or when I arrive to work.  is a great tool to have.  in the year 2012 this is the most efficient way to time your time  I purchased the watch last week on a whim and I have already found that it is the best time keeper. I keep my watch close to me most of the time and I'm in Canada, so I have no trouble using it in the US (the watch is on the left). I use it all the time for my work, which is a government job, so there's a fair amount of time to be spent in the office, so it works well in that regard. I like it because it does not require me to buy batteries and it has a built in alarm so I don't have to take it with me everywhere. I don'T know if it will last forever, but for now I

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I bought this as an upgrade to my old Sony DMP camera for my wedding photography. It works as advertised. The images are stunning. It has a fast and quiet video capability. The only thing I wish was the ability to store images on the card instead of using an external hard drive. This allows you to take and store more photos and videos at one time. I wish that it were easier to transfer photos from my external hard drives to the card. I would also have liked the option to save the photos on an SD card as opposed to an CF card. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and I am planning on purchasing another one for my son's photography.I am giving this product 5 stars, despite all the negatives that it has, I highly recommend this camera and will buy another one, with a hard drive, when I get a chance,Thanks,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just bought this to take to work for my 3-year-old daughter. I wanted something to listen to music on that could not go too far into the ear cup, while I use it for calls. It has been great! No need to turn on or listen on the device. It's great to take the little one along, and she loves it. I have the BlueBuds 2 and it's not nearly as loud, but it is a very clear and comfortable fit for a child. My daughter can not hear music or the alarm on my car radio, however she is a little more comfortable with this on. 5/5 for this product! This is a great pair of ear buds! I purchased them from my local Best Buy on a Friday night after work. I'm a musician and usually use my iPod. I've had these for 2 years and the bluetooth works great. No problems at all. I purchased two. 2/5 bad noise. It doesn't come with a microphone, but that's not the end of the world. The only problem I have with the product is that there's just not enough volume. I can barely hear what's on my speakers. It seems to have a slight click at the end. It could be that my ears are damaged from years of use. I use them at home and work. 3/5 good quality and price. If you want headphones that will last a long time (i.e. last until my daughter turns 11) you can't go wrong with these headphones. The design is good and it sounds great, but the noise cancellation is pretty poor. That means I have to use the volume up buttons to get any sound out of them. If that weren't the case I'd give them a 5-star rating. For what they cost, it's a great product and definitely worth your money. 4/5 Good quality, good price. My wife and I bought these as we were going to be going to a concert at the nearby arena. The price was great and they sound great. We use them almost all of the time at home. The noise canceling is pretty bad but not enough to keep us from using the headphones.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very nice sounding speaker. It is not like other speakers I've heard but for the price it is worth it.  Great speakers for a small amount of money:  I use these speakers with an amc DVD player. The sound is very clear and the bass is powerful for the size of the speakers. It also helps that the speaker wire (wire is included) is very thin. The only thing I would add is that the included remote has an issue with turning them on and off. This is because it is the wrong orientation so you have to hold the speaker next to the remote control (as per the picture).  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first time owning an LCD display and I must say it exceeded all my expectations! Everything is nice and clear. I was worried about the battery life but it was still able to play my music and keep my screen on all day.  The touch screen is very responsive. The sound is pretty good too.  Overall this is a great device.   Style of product: Casual, but not boring  Style is the reason I bought this unit. This unit gives me the freedom to just have fun playing music, without having to worry about the device getting lost or damaged. The size is perfect for my small hands and I love the colors. I recommend this product to all my friends who do not want their gadgets to fall into disuse.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Love this!   Would you recommend this to a friend?: Yes.  Would this be a good quick charge for an electric car?: Yes, with the proper charger.  to be honest I think the usb to power adapter (I have a viva nano) could be a little more powerful, but the power output on the vape is very nice. -TK-  This is the 2nd eGo to come to my site and I'm impressed!!!   Just got mine today and it was flawless, the charge time is perfect for me and my eGo batteries!!  I will be buying another one in the near future as well.  on an eGo 3, there is a 3 pin plug and a usb power adapter with 2 wires. .  the eGo 2 charger works great for me but you have to use the correct charger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   " I'm using this on a daily basis. Very good sound. I was using a CD player but after reading the review I was thinking to just replace that with this because of it's sound quality. It has more than enough sound. The volume levels are just right, too! It's really easy to change levels so you can put it in a different room. My only disappointment is that it is a little heavy, but I just hope it's not that bad. If it's any consolation, I've only had it about a week, so it should last me a while!"

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an average user, the most convenient and reliable device that I have found is the Logitech C920. It does everything a computer does with the one big difference being a built in camera.  One thing I would like to see is an option to choose between a 2.4 Ghz and a 5 Ghz processor. The 5 GhZ is faster and more stable but the 2.3 GhZ has a longer battery life.   If you want to use a bluetooth keyboard to read notes, the Logi C920 is the best choice for this. There is also a built-in microphone on the device that makes it very convenient to record and talk to your buddies on a cell phone.   the Logic C920 can record in 16 bit or 24 bit if you have an audio editor that supports it, but for recording on a computer, I prefer recording in 32 bit for maximum quality. This is a good keyboard for those that do not like to use their hands to type.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  Good product but one thing which I liked and didn't like about the device was: the back light is a little bit bright and it can get on your eyes, I think this is the same problem the X10 has, but the X6 doesn't have this problem (I have a X10 and also a X3). It's not a big problem because my eyes are used to it, but I like a little more privacy. I got a lot of compliments on it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works great!  By Jody N. on November 16, 2015 Byon November 16 I've been a user of the RK-9000, Korg MS-20, and Korg Poly200, so I am well aware of the limitations of the MS-2000 family of products. It is still a great synth to have. Just like the MS20, the R4K can produce a lot of sound without becoming muddy. It sounds just as good when I just play the sounds I like. You also get a lot for your money.   The only thing I would add is that you have to be careful with the presets. While they are easy to change, some are too hard or too simple to find what you want.   at the end, the MS2000 is a great product with a good library. The one issue that I have is the lack of a preset bank. But, you can download all of them from here:  http://www.dave-guitars.com/mcs2000-preset-bank.html   I don't like the fact that I can't change my own settings. But that's just my taste.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good product. My son loves it and he is 9 months. The only thing is that I wish it was a bit quieter. I would recommend it to anyone that has a little one or anyone who wants to stay connected.   I can use it to turn on my tv or to control my computer. it is a great addition to my phone because when i turn my phone on it automatically turns on my pc and my tv.   and my little guy will love it because it plays all the songs he knows. the only problem is that you cant plug it into my computer without it starting up. So you have to take it to my computer or just hold it in your hand. I wish that it was rechargeable but its not so i dont have to keep it charged.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works just as described. The sound is clear, not too harsh, and can be very loud. I don't hear any echo on it at all, but that could just be because it's in my bedroom. Other than that, it sounds just like a small radio. I've heard some good things about it on the internet, so I'll probably be getting another one for my wife and daughter in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ixsonic m2 a20 sb I got this to replace a dead m2 sb. After 3 days of use it's already good as new, no dead pixels, no scratches, no dents, no smudges, no problems at all. I would definitely recommend.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mollie from Great Buy! I love my new ixsonic m2! I wanted to buy one but my husband was out of town and I was too busy with work and school. Now that I am back in school again I can't wait to get it done! Love my ixsm2!  The ixm2 is great but a bit hard to get out. After the first 3 days it is fine. But after a week the cover comes off with little effort. The ixc3 fits a lot better. Also it is quieter with a lot less distortion. I've only had it a week but am very pleased.  the ixcs3 is perfect for my xtc3. Works perfectly. .    I purchased the xtcs3 from this site. I have a lot of ix products and ix sonic and I have tried many of the icesonic products. I like them all but xtcc3 is the best.  I am impressed with ix sounds products. xt3 sound is fantastic, even for a ix3. It really does sound very good. ix ices sound even better!  Great Buy, Easy to Use! - Mollis  Just bought my second ixxs and am very happy with them. I use them for my ipad and iPad mini. They are the easiest and most efficient portable speakers to use while in the car, but I think they're also great to have in my living room when I'm watching movies or TV shows, as well as for gaming. I will not be upgrading to the ips1 in the near future, as it was only designed for the ics.  in the end, I chose these over the iphone 6's, which was the best phone they had to offer at the time. :)  My ixx's have been very reliable, and the sound quality is very good...I use them mostly to watch Netflix on my IPad and my ipod.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought this product with the idea that I wanted to purchase an iphone. As a programmer, I am very sensitive to small changes in sound quality and the iphones volume. I didn't really realize that the volume would be affected this much but it does. I use it to program with and when I use the headphones on a plane, the headphones get in the way. I was wondering if they could be used without the headphones. It also comes with a carrying pouch. It is really nice for the cost. The headphone output is good. I would recommend this to anyone. It has an excellent product at a decent price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a Korg M1 to replace an aging Roland SH101 (my favorite of the SH series). The SH101 was not a great synth for me (it had many defects) and also the noise was horrible (though it got better with age). I found the M1 much better sounding, but still not as clear (even at lower settings) as the SH101. It also has a better soundstage than the SH and it has the ability to make a great variety of sounds on top of that. I think the Korg has made a good machine.   It doesn't sound exactly like the SH-101, but it's not bad at all!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The KENWOOD is a wonderful audio/video computer for the home. The video quality is excellent and it is quiet, very quiet and very powerful!  I was in the market for a computer and was looking for something with a lot of features. I have been listening to music on my iPod and I wanted the ability to record music. I decided to go with the KENOWORLD and was very happy with the choice.  Pros: Compact size. The software is good. It has a built in CD drive, and if you have a lot on your computer, you can add a CD-RW drive if you want. The keyboard is nice. It is very easy to use. A few things about this computer and a few things that I didn't like: *the sound card had a bit of noise but nothing that an audio professional would notice and is not a big deal. *the memory was not an issue as I recorded almost everything on my computer with it. *You have to plug a CD drive into this computer to get it working. You also have to add a keyboard. I don't like adding a keyboard to a computer. *If you want a large display monitor to use the computer while it is being used, you are going to have to get a screen protector to keep it clean. *There are very few things for a home computer that does not cost $1000. *The keyboard has to be held to the screen. You cannot move it around and it doesn't have a back light. *My computer and CD-ROM are not exactly working together. This computer does not have an IRQ monitor port. *I am in an apartment and this computer is loud and makes a lot more noise than it should. . For a $250 computer.

Thank you. .  said, "For those who already own a Mac, a Macbook Pro is the computer for you." That's the whole point of it, the Macbook is a superior computer in every way. There's no need for a Mac to have all this stuff included. It just works well. The RAM and hard drive is better than the Mac I had previously. The battery life is a lot better than before. It gets hot, but is easy to cool down. It doesn't need a Mac for everything, as well. I use the computer when I travel. If I'm going on a trip with my Mac, I'd choose the Mac over a MacBook. I'm still a Mac user myself, but my travel computer now is an IBM compatible PC. If Mac computers ever become obsolete, then I'll be totally sold on an IBM PC. B&H is a very reputable company with great service. This was my first time using B&H and I'll definitely be back to shop at B&h and try other products as well."  "It is very well made. I don't like that there are no usb ports. I would like one if it had usb ports." .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is excellent for a single source power supply, however the cable is of very poor quality. It's just a thin wire with no insulation so any kind of resistance or resistance drop is noticeable in the sound. I would say the same for any other power supplies. Overall, the sound is very good. There is no audible hum, and the unit will run on a single battery. Great sound quality for the price.  If you're looking for an inexpensive way to add a sound card to your computer, this is a great deal. Great power, excellent sound and very well built!  Great unit! I'm impressed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Awesome Product I bought this when I wanted to upgrade to an epson 6300, but only got the 60% version, i was really disappointed.

I bought one because it looked cool and was easy to use and the prices are good. It is very easy to install. You just insert it into your computer and use the mouse buttons on the front. The battery is good, you can't beat that for a 10 dollar device. It has everything you need to use the printer and the printer is good for it.

I don't like how cheap cheap cheap strap can not stay put. The G-SHOCK has a better grip than all cheap bands.  If I had to buy one for my wife, it would be the GSD2  the strap is nice but not as thick as the G4 strap. , so i think that the G6 strap would fit better  It works perfectly with my G5 and G6  Great product, Great company  After a couple weeks of playing, I noticed a major improvement. :)  This product has exceeded my expectations, the only thing i don't really like is the cheap feeling of the metal buckle. The second strap is a better fit, i recommend buying one of these.  in my opinion this is a great product, I would recommend this product  Works like a charm  So far so good, I'm using it with a LG watch but I'm sure this would be fine with almost any other type of device. The quality is good, very good strap. If I could add a few more functions to the device, I think I'd recommend the G Shock 2. It's really nice. .   I purchased the G shock 2 with a new bluetooth device, and my initial thought was it would not work. But it has worked flawlessly so far. Great product, would definitely recommend it  Very happy  The G-shock 2 works well with my new phone  . -  Thank you.  "G-shock is a very nice product."  "The quality of the product is very good and it has the features you need. I am very satisfied with it." .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned it for almost 2 years, it works well, no problems. ive used it on many different computers from old laptops to high end gaming computers. i can't think of a good reason for it to not work. if it had a better battery life and if it wouldnt start so many times when i get it plugged in it would be perfect. it is also a great value, if you need an additional input device, and dont need an ethernet jack, you dont even need to buy ethernet cable. i highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive wireless mouse for a gaming computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Works well for me   Reviewer:   The Kobo e-reader is an awesome device, and was my first experience with reading books on a computer screen. It's very nice and quick to load, too. I didn't have to switch from my iPhone to the tablet after I set it up. The app doesn't seem to be as powerful as some, but it still does a great job for what I need. I was using the Kobo Aura HD at the time and it was a very nice device, but I have to admit that the Aura HD is a little on the heavy side for a Kobo device. I bought the Aura because it has a detachable cover, so I have it at the office. But the Aura doesn't have enough space for me. If I use it at home, it doesn't feel quite as portable. The size of the device is perfect, though, for taking notes in class or on the go. If you need a Kindle replacement for your desk, this is a great device. The only thing that could make this a good purchase is if it had a microSD card slot, but there are some other great alternatives for that price point that have a better selection of features.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------  I've always wanted a portable music player that was able to play my old vinyl and also to play music on the computer. I finally got this and I am really pleased with it. I have a Sony A6000 and I have no complaints about it. However, it is not as portable as my old compact, however I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing works great for my kids, and with the included batteries, I just put them in and let them run.

Great product for the price.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Works great, but the cable is very flimsy. The problem with the cables and power supply is that they both fall out in a matter of minutes. The USB connector and power cord are so flimsy that I ended up taking it apart to find the cable.   So, I've had a lot of fun with it. Works fine. But, I did not like having to keep the AC adapter plugged in just in case it gets turned off, because the cord can get tangled up.     If the plug and cord would have a little more strength to them I would definitely get it again.

Yes No Friday, July 08, 2010  Very good but...  by J.F. from Puyallup WA USA  Pros: Great sound quality.  a must have item.  that's all i can say  Cons: it's so cheap it doesn't last as long as i would like.  and you still have to pay $20 for batteries?  i hope you'll start to manufacture products with more features and quality  Review: I'm a computer technician. I've been using this product since about 1996 for work on my computer. I still like it just as well as I did back then.   The sound quality is so good that the volume on the TV is too low for the TV speakers to provide any audio at all. But it's okay. The sound is the same quality as on the computer speakers.   in all my years using this TV remote the only thing that's ever been wrong with it was one of the buttons didn't work. After a lot of effort I was finally able to figure out how to reset it.   and i never ever have to buy a replacement for the remote. that's the only con.  The only thing i'd like to change it to is an LED display that will show when it's on and off. The LED display has some serious limitations and I don't recommend it. -Don't know what it would look like without a battery.  in addition to the price of a battery the LED display requires about $25 of power for it to illuminate. The problem with that is that to illuminate the LED displays you have to be in direct sunlight. which is very rare. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a great computer! The screen is nice, the sound quality is good, the keyboard is good and the mouse is very responsive. The only thing is the keyboard keys are quite sensitive, sometimes it is difficult to type for a few seconds because the keys get really tight. But this is easy to fix by using some cheap keyboards with some software that makes it better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought two of these for my daughters, and they are great little units, especially if you need to keep the children safe. I bought them for a couple of reasons, one being that one is a music console, and one being the kids are a little bit older, and it is a nice little sound system for them to use with toys. The sound quality is nice, and the speakers are plenty loud, but the speakers seem to get very warm over time, which I assume is from the ambient temperature of my office. The kids do love it though, and so far, it seems to be holding up well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for myself when I found out I could not use my tablet, and it has served me well since then! I'm not a tech guy, but I am very happy with the ease and speed of the tablet!   Have this item as a gift: I have purchased the Bluetooth Headset and Wireless Microphone.  It's so much easier to use than my old phone!  I'm very pleased with the quality of this product and I'm sure I will continue to buy from Bose.  I purchased the Bose Bluetooth Headphones and Wireless Mic for my wife who doesn't want to listen to the phone in our bedroom. The microphone is great and works well in conjunction with the headset. The headset has a very soft microphone that works very well with her voice.  The quality of the microphone makes for a comfortable listening experience. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________   I am very happy with my new keyboard. I have two.   The first one is a Logitech and is a pretty good model. It is a little harder to type on than a normal keyboard because of the touchpad and the smaller keys. The keys are a little small and have some of the weirdest key combinations that I can ever remember. I also have the original Apple keyboard and I love it. I use it for work and when I need to type fast and fast and a lot. The touchpad is really nice, so I don't need to click with my finger a lot to get anywhere on my screen. The keycaps are also nice and the buttons are easy to press and have good feedback.   as for the second one, I have it with the new wireless mouse that Logitech has out. It also has the touch pad and I am really impressed. The wireless mouse was pretty easy to set up. I set it to "wireless" instead of "wired" and everything works fine. I do have a few complaints though, like the lack of a scroll wheel or an acceleration button, but it seems that there is a lot of effort in the development of these new products.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Excellent build quality, ease of use. It's not an all-in-one system like a mini-combo, but it still works perfectly. And the design is very stylish.   I've had a few problems with the setup of this product. When the unit is running on battery, it sometimes takes a few seconds to recognize the wireless connection. The signal is also sometimes not very strong, or even weak.  - it doesn't know I'm not in a car at all, and does not work as expected  - sometimes it can't connect in the office where we have strong signals  Overall, it's a great product.  .  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Amazing device for the price Excellent product. Works very well. It comes with everything you need to get started, and you only need to use the cable to your computer for an instant connection. There's no need to mess with your device or cables. Very satisfied with this purchase.  The setup was easy, and once I got the devices I wanted to use on my computer, it was easy to get going. The only problem is that the wireless is a bit weak, which means that when I'm away from the laptop, there is a long delay before I'm able to get a connection.  I have a computer that uses 802.11 b/g, so that's what I use, and I can get my wireless to work with a Mac and my Windows 8 machine without issues. That makes this a no-brainer purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________ Hi.I've been in love with this device. I just had it for a month and so far it is amazing! I love how it sounds. I've been able to play everything from dubstep to house music. My son, who's an engineer who uses his computer on a daily basis, uses it as well. I love it for being able to plug it in and have it be fully functional. I have a soundcard that works with it. I got it for under $200. It doesn't play any media in and it is also plug and play.The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a usb port and I think it will look terrible in my computer. I would prefer it to have a port. Other than that, I'm so glad I got this and now can't live without it!

Its great for my job. its also a great choice if you want to do video. I have a video camera that i bought a few years ago and that didnt work. I used this and it is doing great. Theres no lag on it at all. It also doesnt run slow and thats a plus in my book.  If you are looking for the best value I highly recommend this mic.  the best bang for your buck  This mic is exactly what I was looking for and so far I'm impressed  I've had the mic for about a month now. I use it to record audio and take phone calls. The mic is very quiet. Its not as good as a cheapie I found on Amazon, but it's far better than anything you can buy off the shelf at a good price. The best part is that its very easy to mount in my camcorder, and its small enough to fit in the mic clip on my vh1 camcord. I highly reccomend this mic for anyone looking for a great bargain and for those of you that are looking to record your videos or audio.   I would also recommend this to anyone that wants to try video or audio recording. , the best for the money  this is a great little microphone. it has a nice sound and great range.  and the one thing that makes it a great mic is its price. It is a real bargain and I highly recomend it to anybody that wants a great quality microphone.  not very good  Works fine as the instructions say, but I am using a BOSE system that has 2 RCA mics. The Mic is too big, but there are other options for a smaller one. I could not find the BOSE version at Wal-Mart, so I ordered the Sennheiser HD-681 instead. I had the best experience with the SOUND STAGE on the HD-701.   a little heavy  great little mike  it's nice. its just that the mic is a little overpriced.  you have to buy a lot of this kind to really get anything out of it. if you do use it for the right reasons, it works great. .  .     good  i have only recently bought one of these, and

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ When I got my first "real" phone, I was blown away. I was very happy to find that it had a nice and long battery life, but I was still blown away that it did so many things so well for the price. It did so much more than I had expected, so that is why I was so happy to have my first real phone. That and the fact that I could use my iPod in the car or the plane, and I was able to take a picture with my cellphone camera. I am glad that I found this phone!

Rated 5 out of 5 by dennison1 from I'm not sure why this doesn't have an "extra" function other than to let you type out more than 4 numbers in a row. This is by far the best little device I've ever owned. It's a good enough input device to use at home, but there are a few features that make it worthwhile. The extra button lets you enter 2 numbers, one at a time. Also, it allows you to write in any alphabet you want and the numbers will line up nicely. The numbers can also be rotated to keep track of your writing (I think). The last feature I find useful is the ability to insert the numbers into other devices. This lets me use this for typing, but also on a computer or printer so I can copy a text to my word processor. I do like that it also includes an "undo" feature, which would be nice in my opinion. : Yes, this is a very nice little gadget. It is the only input device I have owned in a long time that is capable of typing a large amount of text in a relatively short period of time. This input device can be a bit slow if you have lots of entries to do (say, you have a lot of text entries) but it is fast enough if you just want to type a few numbers. I really love the "extra button" that allows you enter two numbers at a good pace. I have found that when using this device on my computer or on a scanner or on the computer I am typing out the numbers in order, my hands will sometimes shake a bit to get the words to line up correctly. This might be because the device is very small and a bit delicate. If I wanted to type up a whole long document I would probably use a larger device. The size of this input device is just right for me
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used this for my 3 year old daughter to read/write, and we love it! It's an easy to use, quiet and very sturdy device. It has a nice balance between size and weight. She keeps it in her backpack every day with the tablet and her computer for her homework and computer games. My daughter is getting a lot of use out of it and I can see this device going far with her. I will be sure to keep my daughter on a regular and predictable schedule of usage for it to last long enough. I definitely recommend this device!  by: Lizzie - 5 years ago  Awesome! I've been reading and writing for about a decade now, and this is my first tablet. It was easy to setup and doesn't seem to be much of a burden when using it on the bus or at work. As far as the screen goes, it is excellent. No lag or screen flickering like a lot (my screen was fine) so I'm happy. The battery life isn't as long as I like (5-6 hours) but I have an hour and 20 minute window to work before I have to recharge. It also comes with an included stylus, which I'm sure will come in handy for those handwriting exercises that will definitely come with this tablet. The other great thing about this is that it's not just a standard laptop. It's smaller and more portable than my typical workstation setup, and a laptop would not be any more portable or easy to carry around than this tablet does. I love this device for my daughter to use and will definitely recommend it to friends and family!  the best buy ever!!! I bought this for a family of 5 to use together. We all love it. it fits perfectly. We also have to admit that we like to write on our phones and tablets more than we do on a computer or iPad. The kids can't write on their phones and use a keyboard because they can't get a good grip and typing on the tablet makes it a lot more portable and a lot easier to handle.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an Apple Macbook Pro that has an external USB drive and this is my preferred solution. I use my computer mainly for school work and for video editing so I didn't mind the extra cost. I've used them in the office and it doesn't take too long to sync my photos on to the drive, I find that my camera can be a lot faster to set up and use with it then using my iPhone. The design of the drive itself isn't bad but it is very thick and bulky, I recommend using a USB drive which is a little more portable, I love that it can be run off of my computer when I'm at home and can be taken out to a cafe when I need to sync some photos.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I received the Sennheiser Momentum 1.4mm plug a few days ago and I've already tried using it on a few different music sources (mostly the laptop's built in stereo speakers). I have had no problems with the plug-in in both PC and MacOS, but I haven't had much of a chance to use it on any headphones. However, I do like the fact that it connects right to my Mac's sound card, which gives it a lot of versatility. In my case, I like that it is powered via USB, so I can charge it without having to carry a battery pack with me or buy a separate charger for the PC. Also, I have always had a habit of connecting the audio cables of the iPod, which plugs directly into the USB port on the PC, and I always used to run the cables over the headphone jack, which is how I was using the plug until the Momentum arrived. The moment that I heard the sound quality of the plug, and its plug-ins, I went and bought one immediately, because I love it. I had my old iPod (the one that was a little bit beat up), but the iPod does not provide the high quality of these plug- in plugs. The Momentum plugs in without skipping a beat, and it gives me a quality stereo sound that has never been heard before. I love the fact of it's portability. It fits in the back of my computer bag just fine. All the things that the iPod plug can do are available with this plug, but better. In short, it is a good plug--in plug that provides great sound, and gives a great portability, since it fits in your bag and it is battery powered, I would recommend this plug to anyone looking for an affordable stereo headphone plug with great quality and versatility.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     The product works perfectly, it is very accurate for what it does, the battery lasts a very long time (8 months).  I have the X10 with the TAC3 with the same batteries. It works great, except it will not charge if you are using it for music. You have to have the radio on or you will not be able to charge it. It has a problem of getting warm when you start it up, but after a while it is ok. The only problem is that the battery life is short. I got my radio for $50 used on Ebay, so I have only used about half the batteries (and not much of a problem with overheating). The batteries have a lot of capacity, and last a long time. I was glad that the TAR 3 was on sale, since I wouldn't have gotten one for a price this low.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

By Cammie from Denver CO USA  and it is easy to charge up  Cons: none  Conclusion: This is one of the best battery backups you can buy. There are so many other models out there that charge slower and cost more but this one lasts a good long while. I think it's worth the extra money if you are on the go, in case you have no access to AC. . ,,  The charger has to be recharged every couple weeks  So far I have had very little issues with this device. The battery is charged fast and works just like it should. The only complaint I have is that my unit does not have a display, so I have to make sure I am not missing anything.

The only problem is that I'm getting a little cold. I just got it and haven't left it on my back.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used to work for a company that used this product for medical, legal and research purposes and found it very useful. I used it to control a light that my patients could not see but I could still feel. I can't think of a better way to manage an electronic device. Review of DJO - DJ-DAC-10 This product is perfect for all those who want to manage multiple audio devices.  This is a great product for the price and quality. The battery lasts a long time and allows you to monitor multiple audio sources. The built-in mixer allows you set the mix to your liking. The device allows you adjust volume and tone. It also allows you play/pause and play/stop audio. The mixer is simple to use and connects to your computer.  The mixer has a number of inputs and is equipped with the latest sound card.  One feature I really like is that you can select which audio devices are used for which function. This means you can set the sound card to send output for your laptop and monitor/control your TV. Also you can connect to another device to control the same audio sources on another device. This is great because the mixer allows me to have two different sound systems in my house.  The included software allows you make recordings and manage them. The software is easy to use for anyone who has ever used any computer recording program. I especially like the fact that the software will not overwrite a saved recording if you have deleted it and does not store a full recording on the drive. You can also create your own presets for any sound source.  Also, you can control the mixer with MIDI controllers.   The DJO-D4 USB has a small and sleek design.  It's a great value at this price point. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has a lot of devices to manage and wish to do it on a PC. DJO-X-6 USB MIDI controller For those who are not sure of the difference between MIDI controllers and audio interfaces, it's easy to be confused.  MIDI controllers usually have buttons that can play notes or change settings on other devices. If you're familiar with PCs and PCs, you're already familiar with MIDI.  If you want to control audio with the same interface, then the DJ-X6 is the right choice for you.  Because this device can control a host of devices, it is also perfect for those who have a

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned a few portable printers, and I'm very happy with the quality of the printer. It prints very nicely. I had printed a few copies, and they worked well enough. The size and shape of the paper is perfect. The printer comes with an ink cartridge which I used to fill the papers, but I've changed to using my own cartridge for the next few printouts. I used a black and white copy, but printed the black and gold as well. Rated 3 out of 5 by Tannen from This is a solid machine for the price. My problem with it was the printing quality. It was not a high end printer but it was acceptable. When you print a large size like A5, the paper tends to "bunch up" and "bulge out" of the page and the printer didn't always line it up with the picture. The other problem is that it takes an hour to print one page of a double sided sheet of paper. The only good thing I can say is that the price is right for what you get.  Rated 5 out of and 5 by Anonymous from Solid printer for the money! This is the first printer I've ever purchased and it has come in really handy. When I found out I was having some back trouble I found this out quickly and was surprised at how sturdy it was. It's been easy to use and prints well. My only advice would be that you should be careful when attaching the stand to the printer because it has a fairly long print bed. With my first try I had a few pieces of plastic fall through the stand and out onto the floor. Other than that, I'd recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can't recommend this unit enough, I've owned mine for two years now and it has served me well. It's light weight and portable, the unit is easy to set up and use, easy to replace the batteries, and it makes great recordings.   The only downfall for me has been the volume control - it was very inconsistent, but this was due to my listening to songs from different sources at the time (i.e. from my iPod when on the road and my CD player when at home). So, to fix this, I have ordered the 'M' style switch to go between the standard and high volume settings and this has allowed me to maintain consistency.  , the first thing I noticed about this product was that it was just as easy to operate as my iMac with the two switches. It is also a lot quieter than the iMac. I will be purchasing another one of these in the near future and would love it to work with the iPod.   of course the unit comes with the batteries that were included in the box with the unit - the unit also comes with a 3 ft. USB cable that is easy enough to re-connect the unit. Also the box came with everything that was required to get the unit set up including an instruction manual. This unit is well built and it is compact enough for the price. My only problem with it is the volume controls - I can't say that they were accurate from one song to the next, so I recommend having it readjusted once you are out of the room.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- this is an excellent product! I have had an mp3 player for a while now and needed a new one. I was at a loss as to what to get. This thing is great! I like that the power output is adjustable. I have been playing music and I can do so comfortably for hours on end. I do wish the remote was a little bit more accurate though. However, it is pretty close to perfect. I also like that it plays mp3 files without a problem. In a previous review I said I wish it was a tad louder. I can hear the record click when it is playing but I think I would have to turn it up a bit higher to hear it. Overall, I love this product and I am very happy I purchased it.

It has a small problem: The screen and the camera are hard to see because of the white backlight.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the fz1 for over a year now. the sound is not as good as my fave portable. the fuz1 is not very noisy. however, you have to know which setting it is when you first start it up. to set the volume (on the fiz 1) you have do it by holding it in your hands and the volume knob at the top. the other settings are on a small button that you turn to adjust the volume. after you set it up this way, your hands will be sweaty from all the movements but it takes no time to get used to and the sound quality is much better then my fz2. i also love the f/1.9 lens (its a great lens!). ive only had this a year, and already i find it to be much superior then the f4 or f5.6. the only thing i dont like about the f1.3 lens (my f5 is also f/2) is the zoom ring. it moves alot when you zoom in or out. but, i got over that. you need to know what settings you are adjusting (volume etc.) ive had no problem with the f5 and f8. ive never used any of the f2 lenses but i might buy one to see how it looks (the black plastic is not good) but the f8 is a bit annoying because of how big it is.!!!!

Write a negative review about an average electronic device and expect a refund:!!  This is a really great piece of equipment. It is a great price, the unit works well, and I am very pleased with it. I have only had it for about 2 months but so far it works very well for the price, however, I had one problem with the battery that took about 4 days to replace. I was not able to call or email to request a replacement or any troubleshooting that would help me identify the problem. I had the device for about 3 weeks and the battery died in the middle of a session with my wife. I did find a thread on the internet discussing how to replace the batteries on this device, but for $99 this would not have saved my wife's life. The unit came with a one year warranty but that is of little help since I did not read the manual and have not been able to follow instructions closely. The warranty that comes with the device is of no use in my opinion. If I had known that the batteries did not last nearly as long as advertised, I would have been more concerned with warranty service rather than the purchase of the unit itself. This is a nice unit and very easy on the pocket books. I hope that other owners get the same experience that I had.    Review Details: When I first started listening to my MP3 player I was really pleased with the volume and sound quality. I would not change a thing. Then about a month or so into my usage of this device the device would not record in either the aux out or the headphone jack. I called the number on the unit and they sent me to their website. There is a troubleshooting section. The troubleshooting guide was on another page that said there is a software update that would fix this. They have several suggestions and I will try them all out. After the first troubleshooting session they told me that I needed to go to the manufacturer's site for a firmware update. I went there, and it had no new firmware update for this unit.

I've used my iPad with it for some time, but wanted an alternative. I'm a huge fan of the Samsung Tablet's hardware design, size, and weight. I use it a lot with my laptop, but it also works great as an external hard drive. The iPad will always run the tablet faster than the hard drive, and the Android device doesn't even support the SD card. The new Apple TV (HD) comes close to a HD experience, but still doesn't compare with the hardware of the iPad. So after researching about getting the Samsung, I had a lot of doubts. It comes with a wireless receiver, but I didn't want to wire it to the wall, so I thought the Samsung would be the only way to go. I thought it would be good to get a bluetooth device for those days I don't want a wired solution. The reviews for the bluetooth tablet was so good that I thought I would give it a try. And now I'm sold! The device works well and the screen and voice commands work very well. The device is so small and light that I don.t think I could put it anywhere that would cause any kind of interference. I think the bluestacks from Best Buy have some kind of problem with them and I don`t think the device would work. I was hoping it would, because I like the sound of the bluestsack. This would make a perfect external HD player. I also like the idea of this bluetooth unit being powered by a solar power system, and this is one of the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This item works like a charm, it has a lot of power.   When i used it i had no problem getting it into position and working.  When you are in the position you can operate the fan i put in the back, the power supply is very powerful too.  The power supply has two wires to plug in the unit, one is a female plug and the other is a male plug.  Both were easy to connect the wires and turn on.  It works great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use my A.E.A.D as a backup alarm clock. It's the only alarm clock I trust. I can adjust the time to the time I need. It sets a very high alert in the mornings for when I get up early, which saves me a lot of time in the morning. I would definitely recommend this alarm clock to anyone.  Have not yet used it in a way that I can evaluate its longevity but the battery lasts longer than other I have used.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this piece of gear.  The range is great and the fact that it has a battery compartment means it will be around for a long time.  It also takes 4 AA batteries.  The battery life is about 12 hrs, so if you have a power outage or need to go on a long trip, this thing will come in very handy.  If you can deal with the price point and not be a gadget hoarder like me (I have too many gadgets), this is a great piece of kit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this product because I wanted a way to monitor my electric consumption and use the system as a backup power source if I am out of the house all the time. I have been very happy with the system. It is easy to install, the light display is very useful and it fits easily in my front seat. I do not have to worry about the voltage level of the system because the system only connects to the car battery and it does not use the battery voltage.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was the second time I bought this product. The first time I had some trouble getting it to work, but I did. This time I found a way to make it work. I have the VX-7. This unit is very easy to use. The unit has been very easy for me to use to take in a few shots. I will continue to buy this product, especially for my wedding because of the good price and the unit. I highly recommend this product and the price is a very good deal.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent little device. I have used other small GPS units that had a few issues, and this one has been the only one I haven't been able to fix yet. The software is simple to use, and when it gets confused on the current time, it quickly corrects. This particular unit is capable of sending time and date as well, and is quite accurate for me. I really don't use this as much as I use my other GPS and am very happy with it. It has given me a way to more accurately track my car and has proven to be extremely useful for tracking my birds. I can use it to find where my birds are every morning (or week) and I have found it to be an extremely accurate device for this. I highly recommend it, especially for people who aren't familiar with GPS. The product itself is quite nice and it's light and easy to use. The only downside I see right now is that you have to order the unit from their website in order to order it from Amazon. It is a bit confusing at first, but once you have the unit in your hands, it makes sense. Overall, I would recommend this product to people who are looking for a good GPS and would rather not spend the money on another small GPS.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The device has been very helpful in keeping my husband (he has a stroke) awake at night, by keeping him from turning off the light in his bedroom, I can watch him if I am not home or if I have not gotten into bed with him.  It also keeps me up if I don't want to be left alone in the morning.     Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to keep someone up at night without waking them up.  I am sure this is a great product, but the batteries are a bit expensive.  It's a great idea to use when your home is cold, but I don´t know if I would buy again if the batteries were a bit more expensive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It took a while to find the right software for the TRS-80 and a few attempts and research to make this happen.  I started out with a PICAXE running OS/2 on an IBM 5240 card. I eventually got it to run with the PIC16F4500 microprocessor. It was a pain to get the two computers to speak to each other as they don't use any interrupt lines to communicate and the serial port can only be used for one computer at a time. I then upgraded to a TRS 80. This worked, but was slow.  and then I added the ZX Spectrum as the "second computer" to the Tandy. This is a huge help to the setup because I could use one computer for both games and graphics and the other could run any kind of application or program.   A lot of effort went into creating the program but it is very functional. It is just what I needed to get started.    Thank you for putting this together and making it so easy.  was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I have been using this for two months now and have been very pleased. The software for it is easy to navigate and the remote and phone are very simple to use. The audio is good and the sound quality is very good. I like the remote as it is very handy and easy to use and I haven't had any issues at all. I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to continuing using the app for the future.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Simple and clear The quality of the device is excellent, the voice recognition works well and the controls are intuitive. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I wish there was an option to adjust the volume level at the end of a call. I use this phone for my cell phone. It's small, light, easy to carry and has great sound. It would be great to be able to adjust this to the call.  for me, the most important part is the ability to control the app while on a call, which isn't always a problem. Overall, it's a great product and I highly recommend it to others.

I needed a new external hard drive to use my PC as a media center, and I couldnt find one that would fit in my laptop bag. I found this on line and bought it. The drive is well designed and the quality is good. The only bad part about it is that you must connect it to the back of your computer so that you can plug it in. Otherwise, you can put it in any USB port. This was a very easy step to do. Also, the drive is very big. The total weight is about 2 pounds. I love it.  Helpful? Yes No  See all 3 customer reviews

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My favorite purchase of all time and a great upgrade from my old iPod.   I bought this product in January 2012 for my son. He was going to get a "iPod Touch" in July. I had my doubts but now I have a very secure method of locking the device to prevent it from going missing, and the touch is very similar to the old iPod Touch.   I love that this is a battery operated device that does not require an external charger to power up, so the iPod will never die.  :)   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The phone is the one, i had been searching for the other for two years.   Good service, thanks!  If you do NOT own one of these, DO NOT buy one. Buy one of each color and you WILL be happy. The price difference between the models is only $100.00. The reason you are reading this, is because i just got mine, so don't think i didn't make a review, because i'm sure i did, and just didn't write it up, because I'm the idiot.   The iPhone has a very sleek look and feel to it, and it's just amazing! I love using it, it does everything that I needed it to do. I got a Black iPhone, and I'm still finding ways to use it. I like being able to take the camera with me. I use my camera quite often, and the black one is a lot easier to take pictures in low light. I love the slide-out flash light, it is great when I'm going out at night, with no one else around. The only thing that is annoying me is that the power button is on the right hand side, rather than the left. You have to swipe left to get to the power light. Other than that, great phone and good price.  I got the "blue" iPhone 5c, which has a new software (iOS 7) which allows for the wireless charging feature, and that was the best part. I have a case for the iPhone 5s, and this new one has a "piano black" finish (which is a nice touch, because it gives the phone a darker look), and that makes it feel really nice, and looks better. The new camera also comes in very handy, especially since the iPhone only supports iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. I'm so excited to use my new iPhone 6 plus, as it's waterproof, and more importantly it has a dual camera on it (a 13-megapixel camera at the back, and a 5-megapixels camera on the front), and I really like how it works. I just wish it was a bit larger, but that's just my opinion, because my iPhone 5 c was a little large for me to use. Overall a great phone, especially the new software! It's been just over two weeks now, and i'm really enjoying it. It's so light and thin, I don't even notice

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What is this thing and why would I pay for it?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  First, this is not your usual digital recorder. It is a super cool device that records audio over a computer (no PC required). There is some great sound and the interface is cool. It really just works. There are some issues when using it over internet. I had problems with this in the past because it would not read from the memory cards (my old iPod). It would read the CD, but not the audio from the SD card. I've had this for a while now, and it still works fine (except for that).  It took a couple days, but finally got my Sony CD recorder to play back audio from my iPod (CD quality).    It has a great interface, has nice sounding recording and has a nice USB port for storage.   The best part is that it runs off of a single battery, so you can use it on a battery powered device. It would be nice to have a way to connect external batteries, but that's not a big deal.   Heh, this has been a great little toy for me. It does everything that it promises and does it pretty well.  One of the most important things that my husband loves about this product is the ability to easily add the recordings into a playlist on his computer.   was a little bit disappointed in the quality of the sound from the CD.   The only thing that was disappointing to me was that the screen didn't come with any instructions about the various options that were on the CD   I am extremely impressed with the quality. It's been a nice little device for me to use for the past couple of months. I just wish the screen came with instructions!   This is a must have for anyone who has a computer, iPhone or any other device that requires a way of transferring music. You get a lot of features for a very low price!  My husband is such a huge music lover. He plays his music on his iPod and listens to his podcasts on his laptop. The digital recorder was so perfect for this that we bought one for him. I would recommend this product to anyone.  the recorder is very simple and easy to use. the screen will give you step by step instructions for each item  I love this thing...It records audio and also allows for easy access to files on my computer
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson PowerBook G4 comes as an iBook with a 1.5Ghz G4 1.6Ghz, 1.66Ghz i3 and 1.86Ghz 1.8Ghz. In my opinion it is the fastest and cheapest of all the Mac computers I have tried. You will be amazed how fast it really is. There is no comparison to anything else with this computer. Also the battery life is good. It does run down when you are at work or you use your computer too much. I can put it in the bag and get a good charge on the go if I need to. I will be buying a more advanced model from a more expensive computer and use it for a home computer and will then put this one into the Macbook for travel. I'm now going to switch from my old one to this one. I have no regrets buying this one, especially with my current job which is working from home. I also recommend you try the video out of it. I think it's an excellent product at its price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************** I recently purchased an X-Y 2.0 Wireless Tablet from Amazon.com and really like it! I own a tablet with a much higher resolution, but when i looked on this device i was very surprised at the quality. I've used it for about a month now and it's a wonderful device! My only issue is that i only get WiFi. I have a wireless router, and the tablet doesn't have an Ethernet port, so i can't use it for Ethernet. I'm not the most techy person, but i managed to fix it, and have an ethernet port now.  From Anonymous of Florida, United States on 4/21/2015. I'm a big fan of the X-y, but I only really use it when I'm traveling on business. I don't have a lot of money for tablets, so I have had to buy this from a local store for almost $30 because I was afraid that I couldn't find the "right" model. The one that I bought is a bit too small, but the second one is perfect, and for $30 that is probably a great deal. I also wish that there was an ether port.  a X-z 2.1. It looks like a tablet, and works just as well. It is the most expensive, but it works perfect for what I need it for. - I would recommend this to anyone.

The sound quality is great, the design is great and I love the fact that it is very easy to use. Thank you.  Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device.   A couple of weeks ago I decided to upgrade my audio system for my home studio. I already had an Audio Technica AT2020 and was happy with the performance of the unit. I was trying to decide if the AT2020 was worth the upgrade and I did a lot of research. I decided on the Yamaha RYX-1000 as a replacement because I was impressed with the quality and the ease of use. The Yamaha RyX-2000 did not even come close to the RY-X1000 in sound quality, nor was it easy to get in and out of. The RYx1000 is easy to connect to my PC and has a nice sound, but I was really disappointed in the fact the Ryx1000 did not have the same ease of access as the AT20. In addition, the RX-20 does not have an XLR cable port. So if I were to get an RYxp 1000, I would have to either use an XL-1/XLR to XLR adapter (which was very expensive) or purchase a separate XL-XLR adapter to plug into my PC. I know the R2X-500 does not come with an XL R-1 adapter (because of the lack of an XL cable port). Also, the Yamaha has no RCA to RCA adapters (I've only seen an adapter for a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter and that is more expensive).  Read full review

Product Rating: 4 out of 5-stars.  the product works well but the wire and adapter are a little expensive for what they do. you would need to buy multiple adapters to cover all of the different ports on your pc. also, be careful not to make any changes to the cables. if you do, the connectors will not fit correctly.

I just recently had a couple of questions about the new iPod. I called and had an expert to help me. They had one question, but it was really good advice. When I was making the purchase I went to the site to check the warranty. I looked at the 1 yr. warranty and compared it with what I was getting. So I had the technician check with the company. And they had a 90 day warranty as well. I then looked at all of the other products and it was the only one that really had the same things as the iPod. They all were great for sure but I wanted something that would last. This one has it all. I think you are getting a great deal. It works great, it has all the things you need, and it doesn't cost a whole lot.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I purchased a LavaPhone the other day and have to say I am very impressed. The design and feel of this thing is amazing, very sleek and sexy. It looks like it is a real piece of technology. The app is very easy to use and very user friendly. You can take photos, record voice notes, record calls, edit voice notes. It has been extremely easy to change the voice with ease. You are not limited in what you can say or how you can present yourself. I am now working on getting some voice recordings into my book to make it a complete package. I like that the app allows you to download all your recordings for offline usage. It saves on storage space and saves you money on data plans. If you are going to use this device I recommend that you get one with a good battery life. I had it for 4 days without a problem and that was a great way to show it off! I have a feeling this thing will be around for a while as it is easy to navigate and get things done. It was not difficult to purchase either and it took about an hour to get this done.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I have been looking for a wireless device that is small and easy to travel with. --------------------------- The product is so compact and the fact that it does not need a cord for it's use was a nice plus. --------------- A great way to listen to music while you work or travel! ------------------------- This thing does work well. -------------  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for the money, not great for the service. Great for playing music, but horrible at connecting to my home WiFi. The audio quality was okay, but the issue was with connecting to the wireless router. When I turned on my WiFi, the device immediately started trying to connect to my network even though it did not have any wireless connection (only a static IP). My router's default ip is 192.168.1.1, so I manually entered the 192.165.61.101 IP address that my home router had created. After that, everything worked as expected. If the device is still unable to connect after entering an IP address manually, then it's probably broken. I hope someone fixes this soon.  One of the best things about this device is that it is so small and you can easily carry it in your backpack. This is a must for anyone traveling with their laptop as it will make your life so much easier. My only complaint is that the Bluetooth range is very short and the WiFi range is even shorter. I had the Bluetooth going to my wireless speakers and my Bluetooth speaker to my laptop for a few days before I noticed that I was getting a bit of lag between the two.  and my wife has been using it to listen and talk to her friends while on trips. and I have used it to play music and listen to my music while traveling.  the thing is it's so small it feels like it cant be held in your hand. It looks like its not going to fit in my backpack for more than 30 min before it slips out. But once you figure out that you cant get the device in the back of your backpack you can carry it anywhere. I love my device so much!  This device is a godsend for me, especially if I'm traveling with my laptop. It does have a few drawbacks. The first being that it can't do wireless charging. I tried to charge it with a standard Micro USB port for about an hour with no success, even after removing it from the charging cable. I then tried

When my unit broke (which was never mentioned during the warranty period) I was amazed that they were still able to fix it and send me the new one. Now I am very pleased with it.  I have had this device for 2 months and can say it is my favourite. I have yet to get a call from a friend or relative telling me I broke their device. This thing is a work of art.  the usb ports on mine also came with a plastic case (probably not a good idea) but i have never had that problem. i wish I had the case for it so i could attach a usb hub to it. I use my device to listen to music and watch tv on my tv and i never even noticed i had one on my phone  Pros Cons i like it because of the usb power and i don't have to worry about plugging in my usb hub it has an ipod mount to keep the ipod in the top of the screen in front of the bluetooth device can be used with ipod touch also bluetooth works well it has great picture quality it is a good deal i got it with 4gb ram i had been searching for a good battery this one lasted 4 days i am now out on the road and it works great the charger is not powerful but it charges fast so i don´t have to run the charger it has a 3 way plug with a usb and power jack the bluetip is hard wired to the ipad i donʼt have a wifi hotspot to take care of but you can use a computer in your house as it has it´s own ipad and it has wifi   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ I purchased my first Apple TV about three years ago. While the device itself is good, the user interface was a bit cumbersome. Then I found the Apple Remote App for iOS. I used it daily for the next three years. It was the only app I used besides my phone for controlling my television. I have never used a smartphone to control my television, but I can use my phone to control the television on a PC. It's just as easy to use. The remote has gotten easier to navigate with time, and I can now navigate it with one finger without looking at it. Apple just has a lot of great ideas. If you want to play with apps on the Apple TV, it is easy to do with the Apple remote app. If, like me, you want more flexibility in controlling your television, get the Apple box Remote. There are so many third party apps and add-ons for the Apple television.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my new favorite bluetooth speaker because the sound quality is good, the battery lasts long and it's easy to use. I have a little one at home but I'm worried that he might want to listen to music at his friend's house or school and the Bluetooth speaker will not go in. It would be much easier if the bluetooth was only used in one place at a time but since the device can be used at a house, apartment or on the train I'm glad to have one.  Good device, but...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ix-8 is a very nice radio that I have. The sound quality is good, the battery life is great, the size of the battery is great and the screen is bright and clear. The only drawback I have with the radio is that it does not have a tuner. If you want to use an external tuner it would be better to buy an external USB power adapter.  I have had this radio since late 2007 and it has done its job well. I was in need of a portable radio and this radio was very helpful to me as a backup to my other radio. I have used this radio all over the United States and have not found any of my portable radios to be as good. The Ix-8 has done a fine job in this regard.  for the money this is a good radio. ive been using this for almost a year now. the only thing that would change is if you could add the ability to tune a satelite. i have used a lot of satelites and not been able to use them at all on ix8.  as far as the voice quality is concerned this radio is excellent. the sound quality of the radio as well as the audio quality is very clear and it doesnt give me a headache.  and i think ix radio is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ I have two devices in this class. I just received my __________ ____, and it seems like a nice and smooth performer. I did notice it had a little more noise on the bottom end, but I think that is only a thing for some people. I am using it on my desk in the house and it is a good addition to my home studio and will be my go-to sound system for years to come.  I have two items in this range, and they both work great, except for the bass. I wanted something for portable use and they work great in that regard, but the bass isn't great. The bass is too weak for a headphone, and I've had to use a larger sub for portable/work-related use. I wanted something portable to take with me, and while it's pretty quiet, I still can't hear what my headphones are playing. It's really disappointing.  I have a subwoofer with a similar driver that's just about as loud as the Beyerdynamic MM1000. I find the MM1000 much better than the Beyers for portable playback. I also really dislike the noise levels and low bass of the Beers. For all these reasons I'm looking for something similar for portable work. I'm thinking the Beuerdynamic D2.5 or D2A will fit the bill. . You might be interested in these items too: 1.. I've heard so much about the T1 which is essentially a smaller T1, but they're pretty pricey compared to the T2. I've always found the T3 and T4 to sound a little better and be much cheaper, but this one is really nice. The T1 is just a bit more of a "budget" T1. The Beyertronica is more portable. Both sound good and it doesn't seem to be much of a difference to me. For a lot of people it may be, but it doesn' seem to me that it's worth the extra money to me at this point. I don't think I'll be purchasing another T1 anytime soon. The T1 was a great headphone at first, but then they started dropping in price, and for me personally it just wasn't worth the upgrade to the larger T2 or T4. I would recommend the T4 over the T 2 and the T 3, although I do think the T 1 is

He is about 6 yrs old and we were able to get a digital camera for his birthday. I also use it at times when I want to monitor my own temperature. It is so handy because I never know how hot my bedroom is. With this I can set it to be on during the day, set it for night, and it automatically turns it off at night. We also use the alarm on it to wake us up at a certain time and then have the kids play in the morning."*****  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â The SONY E-M5 is a great digital camera and audio recorder. It's very easy to set up, has great pictures and it's easy to use, with a very intuitive interface.Â I've used it to take a dozen or more photos, I've recorded a half dozen videos and the audio quality is great.Â The only thing that could be better is if the button is a little bigger or if I could get the zoom button to be a little harder to press because when I'm zooming it doesn't seem to be accurate.Â But, these are small nitpicks and overall I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the FiiO E9s on amazon to replace my Sony MDR-1000X I have for my ipod 4  and i'm happy that I did! The sound is really crisp. the battery life is great as well!  It comes with 2x 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch cables. I don't use them since I bought the usb-c cable.  But the amp is great. The price is really good. the device itself has really good build quality and I am happy that it has a remote for changing the settings. It's also good to use the remote to listen to music while you're in another room or in your car, that way you don't need a cable to do so.    Soundstage - 7/10  There's a lot going on in the upper register in a lot of recordings, and that's not really what I like.  the soundstage is a bit narrow but also not super deep.   The mids are ok. The low end is very smooth and detailed, but not a lot deeper or more upfront than a lot cheaper mics out there. The bass is good. There's a good sense of air and a decent sense of space to it, but doesn't have any real rumble or punch. . ,  The highs aren't as crisp as I expected but that might just be because I like to listen with my eyes closed. But the mids and highs are just fine.  .  and  the treble seems to be a little muddy. The mids and treble are quite clear though, so I donít think it makes a difference.  in terms of the sound, i still prefer the sound of the fii o x s (which I have since moved to) because the sound is a lot smoother and more detailed.    .    What I'm trying to say here is that I'm still in the middle of learning the ins and outs of mics, so my opinion may or may not reflect that of others. Iíve bought a lot more expensive mics lately and none of them have been as accurate. - June 7, 2015FiiO e9s!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about a month ago. I just got it today and have already had 2 weeks of use. I like how easy it is to read and the screen is clear and bright. The only thing I don't like is that the battery takes some time to charge when it is new. I have a small USB power outlet so i just put it on a computer that has the power outlet and plugged it in. It's very easy to find and easy to get it charged up. The most important feature is the battery capacity. This is the longest battery you can get for the price. It will last up to 6 days of normal use. If you are trying to buy this to use on your phone, I would say use it in a laptop as it is a little smaller. Also if you're like me and like to have your phone charged when you come home, get a cable to plug in to your computer. The included adapter will only work in the computer. I hope this helps, I like this little flashlight and the price is reasonable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................I'm a retired police officer. I've been using a Mac for about 30 years. It was the best thing ever to take on and off of duty without the hassle of having my radio with me. I'm an electrician too and I use my Mac for a great many things. So, I've always kept it. Well, I recently gave up my Mac and decided that I'd like a new one to replace it. I came across a Mac with a battery case that was cheap and I figured I'd give it a try. First of all, it looks a little goofy with all those little battery lights, but the way it worked, it didn't matter. Once I installed the battery case, everything worked just as I remembered. The sound quality is pretty good, and I like the way the keyboard looks. The only real issue I had was that it's very loud. I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but I could tell some people had a problem with it. Overall, I'm very happy with it, but that might have been because I bought it for the battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These are great. Not only do they last for a long time but they're really good quality. Easy to operate and they have the functions you would expect from a watch. Only thing is if you buy this watch for the battery life or the ability to do things with it like read messages it will have a hard time. The functionality is great and a lot of the features are neat, but it's hard to use the watch to do it's normal functions if you're looking for something long term. You can get the most use out of this for it's features but it will not last longer than what you pay for it. Other than that I would definitely recommend them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best way to describe this is that if I had not owned it I would never have thought about purchasing a digital camera!   It can do everything a regular digital camera can do, and more!   the only downside is that you need to put a memory card into it (not included, but you can buy them separately), it does not take SD cards as it has a micro-SD card slot but will not work with SD cards unless it is already formatted and formatted correctly (don't forget the card will have to be inserted when you turn it on to use it)   This is an all-in-one camera! It has so many features. I can take pictures and save them to my camera card, take pictures of everything that I see, even videos. I have been using the camera since I was 15 years old. I use it all the time. I take pictures when I am out on walks and at the mall, I have taken hundreds of pictures, and some have been uploaded to the internet, with no problems at all. This is an awesome camera! This is my second camera that has been so good, I own a Canon EOS-1D-Mark II and I think this camera would be even better if I didn't have to deal with the manual mode!  , July 15, 2012, May 24, 2011

Rated 1 out of 5 by BobB from I have been a loyal customer of this product. But they have just discontinued it. I will miss my iPod Touch, because it was so versatile, easy to use. I now have an older iPad. My iPod Touch was the perfect tool for my job, and my business needs. I have used this product for my kids as well. The touch controls are so well designed and so easy to control. I can turn on a video, set up the TV, and the entire system can be set up in a snap. That is how you know a product works. I just have to get used to the iPad touch now. It is just too good not to use anymore.

It does exactly what it claims to do and it is very easy to operate. A little bit of tinkering and I'm running my iphone off this and a power bank in the same place. The battery life was fantastic. The only downside of the device was the fact that the charger wasn't able to charge my iPhone 6 (it charged my old iphon 3 but it was getting full), so I had to buy a new charger which cost an additional $10.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Best portable Bluetooth speaker. I bought the Blue Dot to replace my car's head unit. This is much more convenient and much easier to use than the head unit itself. I find myself using it more and more.   I have used it on long drive trips, at the office, at my friend's house, and all around the house.  . This product is not only very good at what it does, but it has a great battery life. It can play the most complex, full-range, high fidelity audio signals for an entire day.     And the fact that it has its own volume control, no external units, a built-in headphone amp, and an on/off switch makes it the perfect portable Bluetooth device.   on a positive note, the device has a built in remote control which is great for playing music and controlling your entertainment system.   the only thing that could be better is if it was waterproof. that is because the Bluetooth does not work underwater.  Great product. Great sound! So far I've had this in my car for a week now and have used for work, at home, and just relaxing. Great audio quality, I can really hear the song and the lyrics. :)  The product works well! The Bluetooth works well and is easy to set up.    In addition, the built-into headphone jack allows me to listen to music without worrying about plugging in an amp or headphones.  , It is a nice addition to my life. My main phone does not have bluetooth, so I use my iPhone, but now that my Blue Dot comes with a Bluetooth option, I do not have to worry about my phone.   a plus to the bluetooth feature is that it is very small and portable.  in fact, it has no batteries inside. and this means that it can stay in my backpack or just be stashed on my desk.   people may be able to buy one if they are willing to use the wireless function.   of course I would like to have more options for what music I can listen to at a particular time.   for example, on my commute to work, I listen to songs with songs that start early in the morning and go late at night or early in morning. The car is in the middle of the night, so my music is more suitable for this type of mood. . It has it's good points, I would just

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________ [X-Ran] X-Rans USB2.0 Camera Adapter __________________________________________________________________________________  I bought this adapter for a friend of mine for his MacBook Pro. He likes to use his Canon DSLR for his night shoots. But because of the portability factor the camera has to be pretty big. So I thought this adapter would be a good solution. However, since the battery lasts for 4 hours it would be nice to charge at night (so that the battery is full for the next morning). So I was surprised to find that the adapter was very heavy, which is very uncomfortable. And the cable is very thick and difficult to tie up or connect. I am using the camera's built in battery, which lasts for 7.5 hours, and it is not going to last forever. So it is a shame that the camera must take a trip every once in a while, especially since the cable's thickness makes it difficult to connect or detach.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from It does what it claims to do The camera works as advertised, I do recommend that you attach this device to the camera to prevent it from being lost. I use this adapter with a Canon 7D. The unit is lightweight and it's pretty easy to use. It's also very quiet when charging. I do believe that it has more charging options than my Canon adapter so if you want to add another camera then that's where you would want to look. I just hope that Canon doesn't change the battery or the port. I had to purchase the Canon adapter first to be able to charge my other camera with this unit.  of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________  This little device was a wonderful replacement for my old desktop computer. I had no idea what all the fuss was about back then, but it was a very good replacement. When I came home from work I had my PC ready to go, the PC just needed to be rebooted. I plugged in my old USB keyboard and monitor and pressed power button, then held down the power button on my new laptop. I then connected my old PC to the USB port on the new PC and turned on the old PC. I was shocked that I could still access my PC from the new one, it was so fast! I haven't been able to use my old keyboard and mouse on my PC for a couple weeks now. I love it, and I will buy it again. I'm not even a Linux user, but I can access my old files in my new system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It has the ability to turn on and off lights, appliances, and even vacuum cleaners. When you close the door, it does so softly, but when you open the door the machine just shuts itself off.

The unit seems pretty well built, so if you don't need the ability of changing the temperature, you might be OK with a cheaper one.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a light, but that doesn't really matter since you can just shut the door and there is no need to use lights.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this computer for about two weeks now. its awesome! i'm able to work on it for a few hours at a time on the weekends when I can. i use this computer a lot to do school work. the speakers are the best i've heard for a computer. you get plenty of volume, sound clarity, and it plays back audio files nicely. The only thing that i wish the speakers could do is be adjustable, theres no volume adjustment. I wish they had a little more bass, but thats the only complaint i have about this computer. the screen is also amazing. the resolution is very good and it looks really nice in my room. the colors are vibrant and the screen appears bright. it feels sturdy in my hands and it handles the computer very well. I don't really have any complaints. the only thing I'd like to see upgraded on this computer is the keyboard, I wish there was some type of function to adjust the brightness of the keyboard. also, the volume on the speakers seems to be a little low. i have it set at about medium, but I don.t think I can hear very much, especially if I'm sitting near the back of the computer, but it's definitely not bad. the computer is very easy to use, i think the only major thing is the speakers not being adjustable. theres a big button that controls all of your options on the computer (like video and sound), but I wish the volume control was able to be adjusted like the keyboard controls. I'd give it a 9/10 if they could make it adjustable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this a while ago and used it quite a bit for my gaming. I like the fact that it is very quiet but also has pretty much full resolution of what I need. It also has a nice battery life and is small enough to be easily carried in a pocket. It's not the best gaming PC out there but still the best on the market right now.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, September 23, 2017  good product  by John from Santa Fe NM USA  Pros: quiet  Cons: battery life  Review: Bought this for my daughter for her birthday. It is a good product, she has been very pleased.  in a very quiet way. it has a battery with 6 hours of battery life, which is nice. and it is smaller than some of the bigger ones.   If it was slightly heavier, would I recommend it? Maybe. I have bought one of the heavier models. Was this Review helpful to you in any way? YesNo Friday, September 12, 2017

Yes No Wednesday, July 19, 2015  Great, but..  by: Terence from Saint Louis MO USA  Pros: Compact, Works great, Great product  Cons: None  Review: Just received the unit in a timely manner and am very satisfied. I used it to set up a local wireless network and it was super easy to set everything up and then it worked flawlessly. I have since set it up in my house as well and I am very impressed.  I just received the Zyxel Tx1502 for use as my home office desk computer, for my work and home computers. Works great. Can monitor internet and email in my office. Works with Windows 7. All of the connections are easy to install and set up. I would buy this product again. I just wish the software and hardware would run better. . -Terence  Did you find this review helpful? Yes Yes  Needs more power  By: Landon B from Lutz FL USA    Pros - Good  - Relatively Portable  Price - Great  Purchased - Worth it  Overall - Good Cons - No  Comments:  Other reviews say this thing gets hot when it's operating but I'm happy to report that it's still running cool when I plug it into my monitor. I've had several other desktops and this one is the most portable yet. The price was right, and I was looking for something that could run on batteries.   The keyboard is the only thing that's a bit annoying but it is very easy to get used to and works well. I also like the portability.  I'm looking at getting another one as a secondary PC.  the only downside to this device is the battery life.  a good backup would be a good battery  Reviewer: David M. from USA  for the price, you can't beat this computer  This item is great if you are looking for an office computer to run a personal network, internet or email.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ichiro-fridged   i love my iphone! I've had my ichiropod for over a year now, and it is my daily driver for many reasons. it's a great design, easy to use, and a great price for such an excellent product. the iphones audio jack is a huge bonus, and the camera is also awesome.  Write a negative review about an inferior product: ics1st1  The only thing i dislike about the ichilopod is the fact that you can't make it connect to other devices. it will be great with other ipods or iPhones, but not with other devices because there's only one port. It would be great if you could make it a universal connector so you could use it with anything  Other Thoughts: If you're an iphonod lover, and you don't mind using your phone as an audio receiver for your iphoner or ipod, this is the way to go. If you really want to use your phone like a regular bluetooth headphone, get the ipod dock instead, since it works with an ichinopod.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The product is great and very durable, my daughter loves her!!! She was using an iPad 2 that gave her a headache, but this unit has been great for her. I used it on all my videos and she was able to watch them on my laptop, which is much better than a small laptop screen. The audio is loud and clear and the controls are great. I will use this again with out hesitation.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new iPod nano will keep me happy for a long time! I've been using mine for a month now. I've had it on for 5 days, and I can still feel the difference of the quality of the iPod nano.  I got it for an upgrade to my previous iphone 4 and the quality and design is just as good, maybe even better. The iphONE 4 is still my favorite because of the screen size and the size of the speakers that you can put in there. I also like how it has 2 different versions, one is a full sized iPod nano and the other is the compact. The compact one is great because it fits in your pocket and you can listen to music while driving and when you have to take a trip.   I'm definitely going to get the compact one as soon as possible for my car. , January 16, 2011

It is very simple and easy to use. The radio is very clear and clear as to what is going on. The frequency is not too far off from my old CB antenna that I had.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________  - It is exactly what I wanted. - I don't see much difference between this and other devices that cost almost as much. I'm a high school student and have tried a number of devices. This is the only one that works well. I've tried other items for a student in the past and they all require too much work and I can't always get it to work. It is the best for the price. - It is very easy to use. - Good sound, not too bright or too loud. - Very easy to clean.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Llewz from Great Value for the Money I got this for my brother who has never owned a computer. He has been having issues with some of his older computer systems. I had bought a computer from the store and he wanted one, but they had a limit on the number of computers they could sell. They were sold out, but I was able to find one from Home Depot in the store. He's been using it on and off over the last year now, and it has worked great so far. He can read his mail and his work email. He even took it with him on a vacation when he went to the states. I'll be using the computer mostly when he is gone so I don;t have to worry about what he is using it for. So far I love it!  Product: Computer. I have never owned an Apple Computer before. I never could imagine myself buying a computer at this price range and being happy with it. I am so glad I took the chance and bought this. It seems to be quite well built. The screen is quite large. I can read the screen comfortably. The hard drive I found to be as advertised, and the mouse and keyboard seem well built and nice to use with.

Thanks ixpagd  Review by James H. - Tennessee, USA. - April 8, 2014  It is my new everyday computer. It is fast, reliable and works well. I like to use the tablet with my cell phone for navigation and e-mail. This is a great little laptop.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill T. from Great laptop, not too expensive! It works like it should. The only thing that I didn't like about it is that I wish that it could come with a micro sd card reader (just to expand the size of the disk space).  Product Review: I was looking for a new laptop to replace my old desktop. I found this on the internet. I read through the instructions and it was pretty easy to set up. I can't wait to use it. I did download Adobe and the Adobe Premier CS6 software so I can stream video with my computer. I've been using a Dell Ultrasharp 14" for a couple years now, but I'm looking forward to getting this one, because it looks pretty, I have a good keyboard (I'm using the Thinkpad P60 for the keyboard) and the trackpad is really good, and it has a decent screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice keyboard with a large enough backspace to save your work. I would be nice to be able to remap some keys to my right hand and some keys left hand, but for the most part, I use it the way I would like it. It comes with some extra keys so that it has two sets of functions and shortcuts. One thing that really bugs me is that the key caps aren't really made to last that long. I use this keyboard for the last 6 years and haven't seen any of my key caps fail. If you are looking for a solid mechanical keyboard for a reasonable price, this is a good option.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using these for 3 years and i have found them to be a reliable source of light in a dark space. The power supply is nice and loud and easy to use. It is a shame that some of the other reviews have had problems with the power supply, but i have not experienced any problems with my light so far.   This was my first purchase from this site and my review will not be the last. The only problem i have experienced with them so far was a problem with my router with a bad modem. The modem was defective and i had to contact tech support, who told me that they could not fix the modem so i had a very unpleasant experience. i am disappointed in this and will not order from them again.   (Posted on 7/27/2012)  Good product and service... Review by Dave Quality Value Price Service I like these lights and they are very bright and reliable. i can light my shop with them without worrying about my electricity being cut off.  They are not a very cheap light and will last for a long time. (Posted a month ago)  the best review I have ever seen of an electronic product. Review by K-Mac Quality Value Prices I have used lights from many vendors. Some are good and others are bad.  "i use these light in my welding shop, they are perfect and worth every penny!!", "i bought these lights on a weekend and they were in my shop the following day." The only light I use all day long! (Posted 3 months ago)   What an amazing product. I bought a pack of these for $17.00. They were a little flimsy so i needed to purchase a new one. But the quality is unbelievable. I just ordered another pack and am on my second one already. (Added 5/13/2012  A solid addition to my toolbox. Review  I use the LED lights as a replacement for the incandescent bulbs that I previously used for my tools. The LED lights are bright, reliable, and easy on my eyes. They can be controlled with a simple program (a USB drive with the programming program will be supplied with the kit), and the lights turn on and off instantly. They are cheap enough that I can afford to buy a couple of sets and have them with me whenever I'm working. I use the lights on my benchtop laser cutter and have not had any problems getting enough
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this device for many things.  - My son can play the computer when I don't want him to.  and he can watch youtube videos on the computer.    - He can use his iPad and play with his iPad.   If you need something like that, and you are very happy with it, then the product can't be bad.  .   (the only thing is that it needs a little more space because it's small, but I didn't expect that. So, I have a smaller one.)   Great product. It does everything for me.   that's all.    .  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had this for a while, but have found myself replacing it because of the new wireless charging. I have bought several wireless chargers, including one by Amazon. I found the S6 Edge to be the most convenient to use. I didn't realize that the charging pad actually included a wall charger as well. The wireless charging pad also makes it easy to bring your phone inside, or use it as a stand. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of a problem I have encountered. When it is charging, it makes a loud clicking sound, even when it is completely powered off. It is almost like the phone is running out of power. It's a little annoying, but I don't think it will ruin the battery life on the phone. Overall, it's a very good value. I use it a lot to charge my phone outside, and I'm glad I found it. I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have had this for a few years now and it still works like a charm.!!!  Review of DJ0808-001 Submitted By: KJW - Verified Buyer This mixer has been great in every way. I have used it in the bedroom for music production. The output of the mixer has really improved my mixes. I use to have to use a mic and mixer to get the sounds I wanted but not anymore. This mixer really takes all the problems out of sound creation, you just plug in a mic, and you have it all you need. It's perfect for the bedroom, but I've used it anywhere, and it works great. I highly recommend this mixer. I can't tell you how much I love it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If you have a smartphone, or any other device that runs Android, you'll enjoy having this! The phone is quick to boot up and doesn't get sluggish or slow down like other Android phones. The best part of this phone is that it has all the features you can ask for without any of the bloated features that you would find on other phones.   If there's one con about the phone, I have to disagree with it. The speaker is a bit too weak for my taste. But that doesn't mean I'm disappointed. I still enjoy using this phone and the quality is the best I've seen on a phone in the past five years.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikrek This is the best portable phone that i have ever used, the battery lasts a whole week and the sound is very clear. Also a must have for a musician or radio host who has to record a show and then have to keep a second one on hand at all times, this is for those times that you just don't want to leave the studio with your recording equipment. Also for the money it is worth every penny, don't go to the Apple store for a phone like this!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- This is a great device and I was quite impressed by the sound quality and the fact that there was no limit to the number of buttons on the pad. I use the pad for both music and computer gaming. It works on Mac and PC computers so the range of input is wide. A really nice feature is that you can store songs and music on the memory. That is really cool as I am able to download songs and play them on a Mac when I'm away from the computer for an hour. Another really cool feature is the ability to play the same song on two different computers. I have a 32bit Mac and a 64bit Windows PC. So if I use a 32 bit Mac to play a song it plays fine on my Windows PC but if I am on my laptop on the same computer I play on my 32 bit computer it plays on my 64 bit computer but only on the 32 bit computers. That way you don't have to swap CDs on the go. And the USB port allows you to connect to any computer. I love this pad. ----------------------------------------------Read full review at: ------------ https://www.fiddler.com/Product/FID-USB-1-1?p=92323111747&e=2465&d=1526902543 ----------------------------------------------
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had my iphone 4 for less than a year and i can say its a solid phone. It has everything i would need. it comes with a charger, case, and a charger cable which i use with my pc and iphones and also my iPod. i think the best thing about the phone is the fact that it has 2 phones with the same number. that way, when i need to call someone and they are out of touch, i can call them on both and talk to one person. that can be a lifesaver if you need to make a long distance call or something. The only bad thing i have to say is the size of the phone. it is a bit hard to hold to the side of your head but i can live with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  "This is my 2nd purchase of this product. Very nice, reliable and simple to use.  My wife has a Macbook pro and a macbook mini. She was looking for something similar that would give her a more "pro" feel with a USB drive. She is very pleased with this product and will buy more. .  of course I had to buy my own computer and drive, but I like the fact that this unit takes care of the storage for me.  that being said, I wish it was waterproof. If it wasn't I would have bought the waterproof version of the unit.  a bad thing about this unit is that it is a bit hard to get into the right slot on the hard drive. The drive gets stuck in the drive slot and I am having to press the top half of the drive into the slot, to get it to pop out.  was very easy to unplug and plug the drive back in, however, I did have to use the screw driver to loosen the screws from the back side. I am not sure if this is due to the different thickness of the internal parts or the drive has some problems getting into it and the screw is to hard to turn. maybe a better design for this product  This is a great device, and is much better than buying your own disk drive.  in fact this is the best buy I have made, in a while. I can save a lot of money, and get an extra drive for another computer!  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am not a fan of touch screen's, I have a Sony Vaio Z, but I found this touch screen to be a pleasant addition to the Z. Its fast and simple to use. I also found the button mapping to be easy to learn. I would have given this five stars but the battery life was not so good. Thank you for making an awesome product! I have an iMac and i5 and was looking for something that was comparable in performance to the i5 which had an integrated touch screen. I thought this would be the answer. I have to say I was really surprised. It performed as it should and even improved on the touch screen with a more responsive backlight. The size of the monitor is definitely not an issue for me. I was using it at a local coffee shop where most people have touch screens in their work stations and it just looked so nice and natural. I can't believe it got me so much use for a very low price. I'm very impressed with it. I've had it a little over a month and it's still going strong. It's great that it can take my laptop and a game. Great product. The product works great and is very light weight. The only thing I'm a little disappointed in is the battery. I got it on sale for around $35 which was a great price compared to a computer of this quality and features. I'll update my review after a couple more months. It's very nice, but for a budget I would like a larger size. My main screen has a 1366 x 768 and that's fine, but at the price it's a little too small for my needs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** It's a good computer, with a few drawbacks. I got the 16GB version, and I do not care for the external HDD. I have been using the computer for a few months, and it has never been damaged by any kind of drop or accident. But, after using it for the past year, I have realized that the drive is very slow to access the hard disk. This means that I can no longer play the game, because if the disk has to read all of the data from a game, it can take about 15 minutes to access it, and that is only if I want to access my main game data. The main game files are not really necessary if I just want to play, so I would get rid of the HDD and use the game drive instead. The only other problem with the drive I have is that when I am using the HDD, it takes a really long time to turn on the computer. When I first got it, I had to power it up 3 times before it would actually turn on. When it finally does turn on, it seems to be a really fast computer. This is a very nice device, and if you are a gamer, or even if you don't play games, it's great. But if you just want a good PC with good graphics, then go with the HP x360.

Rated 5 out of 5 by TK from Great accessory to enjoy your music I purchased this for my wife who is an audiophile, and as we have both been using Bluetooth headphones and I find the Sennheiser HD-580 to be quite good, we wanted to expand our music listening capabilities. It's great. It can connect to my bluetooth speakers or my home theatre receiver. The microphone is excellent and clear. I have found myself wanting more volume with my home theater receiver. I will be purchasing more accessories for it. It will be great to be able to use my home stereo for this device.

I have tried every available fix to fix this.  I contacted the manufacturer, the "authorized" dealer and they do not have a clue, they said it is probably my modem. I then contacted Verizon, who took a little longer to respond but they did eventually send me a new modem. The new modem was of low quality but works very well. I'm looking at purchasing another from this same manufacturer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had to install my smart plug but had it ready to go. It took me a while but was very easy to install. It comes with all the necessary instructions. The remote is easy to use and very accurate. My car does not have a power strip so it is not that easy to find. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an easy way to make phone calls.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the 3.5 inch drive for my Sony Playstation 3 and i love it. The battery is large, the drive is heavy and it works perfectly. I bought it over a month ago and it still works perfect. It is a great device to use on my Playstation 3. I don't know why the other reviews didn't like it. I got it at walmart.com for $14.99 shipped and i recived it quickly.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this as part of a combo deal so I was a little worried, but it's actually great. The sound quality is great. I'm still testing it so I don't have a set up for measuring sound (the thing has a speaker on the bottom) but I don' t have any problems at all. The only thing I don t like is that it's quite a bit smaller than my old headphone amp. But that is a small price to pay for the sound quality. And yes, it does work just fine. And that's all you really need.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old VCR with a digital one. I am a new father and didn't want to be out with my son when we had to record a movie. I had bought the recorder at a store for $70 which was a steal considering the quality of the recording and the features this unit had. I have used this to record some high-quality audio (Dolly Parton in her recording of "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good audio recording machine that is reasonably priced and doesn't get in the way too much while recording.  Have not used it for music but it has a really decent amount of inputs. I really like that it has the ability to output to your TV via an RCA cable. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is great for my daughter who is learning to play piano. She is not an expert at music, but this thing teaches her the basics of how to play music!   The keys are very responsive and the controls are really good. The built in keyboard does not have a backlit keyboard (which is very useful), but it has a lot of other useful functions. It will allow her to record herself, and if she wants, play some songs on the phone.   This thing has a really long battery life, so if you have a lot going on in the house, you can go for weeks without having to charge it.   The keypad is also very sensitive, so she can play very fast. She can also play with it in her hands.   of course this device is made in china, so it is quite expensive, but if you want to give it a shot, I highly recommend it! It is not for everyone though...I have a baby who can play well and her teacher said this machine was hard for her to use.     by the way: i tried it with an old cd player and it was way more responsive than this.   I have no problems with the touch screen, the only problem i have had is with the back button.  I have found a great, affordable, very responsive digital piano from Piano.com. The price, accuracy, sensitivity, and playability are superb. The "old" CD players can be too loud. I don't like the feeling they give my fingers after playing. Piano.Com is better.  , my daughter has just graduated from High School and is moving to college in the Fall. She's an excellent piano student and has played for more than 5 years. She wants to continue to play at college because she thinks it is fun and exciting and the digital keyboard makes it so much easier to play. This is her first digital piano and the reviews have been great and the piano plays like a piano should. She has used it with the old piano keyboard and the new digital keyboard is much smoother and easier to use - not to mention more accurate. If you want a good piano and want it to last you have to play it. I think it is a good value. It is also much quieter than an old CD player and is easier to clean and maintain. I wish Piano. com could make it in other sizes. I use it for both of my daughters and both

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________________________ My first iRobot. First one I tried, was a new baby, and was a breeze to learn how to use and assemble. But the robot itself had a few issues, the battery and the motors for the feet would overheat sometimes. So I went with the older version with the larger motors, and I am impressed. I'm not too worried about the battery going flat any time soon. I am very satisfied with this purchase and the service I received. Pros Easy to assemble Cons Battery overheats (very annoying)  Did you find this helpful? 1 of 1 Found Helpful  by Anonymous from Tx  Pros: The robots are simple to program and can be assembled in a few minutes Cons: My robot's feet won't fit on the tables and it is hard to remove all the screws from the bottom of the robot. I don't like the fact that the remote for the robot is on the side of the box rather than the back and also that the motorized wheel can easily spin backwards. So my next purchase will be to get a joystick.  Was this helpful on your search for something small to do at the pool? Yes No

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Review by: daniel h. on 2/2/2015 Rating: 4 of 5 Stars!  Ordered this item as a spare part. Great quality. Good price. Just need to get the parts to install.  The only issue was with one side of the switch not opening. I didn't realize that until it had already been installed. The switch on the other side opened and worked fine. . ,,,  Great buy!!!!!!!!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rick from Easy install just be sure you use the right size battery. It takes the battery out of your camera's battery compartment.  If you don't mind opening the battery compartment you will be happy with this product.   Don't bother with the 4 o'clock battery. The 1.5" batteries are so much bigger, much harder to install, and the 2" batteries also cause problems for the switch. I have a Canon DSLR and this switch just works perfectly. The extra step to take the battery off is easy but it's the same problem you get with all the switches in this price range.   to install you will need to take out the camera's lens. Just pull out the lens with your fingers or a screwdriver. It just takes a little while to get used to. The battery will pop out just fine, but you won't be able to use it for a while.   in the end it's a very simple product to use, but a little challenging to install depending on your camera   if you want a switch that is easy to use this is the one to get. If you want an external battery holder just get the camera without it.  .  in the future i want to have a 3rd switch for a DSLR for when I need to use the battery.  this was one of the things i was wondering about when i got the camera. when i used the battery i was disappointed with the switch for not being able to push the switch in the opposite direction to open the battery slot. for example if the switch was on the 1 o' clock position when the camera is battery up i could push the other switch to close the battery cover, and then push the 1.4 o'Clock battery back in and it would close the slot in the side. but if I push the 3rd 1.25 o' Clock switch to open it to battery up and then switch

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought the eee-mate x2, it was the only device I could find that was the size and form factor of an Apple Ipad. I'm extremely happy with it. I can read, write, look up anything I want on Wikipedia.   I have the "standard" model, not the pro version. I just want to say that the pro model has the same capabilities as the standard one, but has a better screen, better audio, and can be upgraded to be larger, but I would rather have the ability to do more and do it better.   I bought this eee eXcite because I use my computer most of the time and need the extra capacity. I've had it now for nearly 2 months and I can tell you it has survived multiple trips through the washing machine, but then again I don't read reviews so I may be biased in that I don t think it's been very hard on the ee-mate   It has an easy to use interface, good screen, good audio, easy to type on, works well. It is a bit expensive for what you get, but not a bad price for the quality   Would buy this again  By B.G. on 07/26/2013 byon 07/76/2013

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this one since March and i love it its one of those toys that can do so many things from a sex toy to a vibrator and everything in between. i get my clitoral stimulator that i bought a couple months ago and this thing can do a ton of different things and its so easy to use and its always on. if youre a beginner this toy would be perfect for you its fun and very easy to clean. you can even charge the vibrator on the outside of the toy and have it work better than an electric one. ive used this thing on my clit and inner thigh it just makes me feel good.

It is a little heavy, and if you use it on your knees it can feel a little like you are carrying it (I am not the most athletic, although I have always been athletic).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Good  by: Anonymous on 11/30/2017  Comfort: Durability: I'm not really a fan of all the switches on the unit, they are a bit hard to find the right one. The unit has decent volume, but you have to turn them all the way up to make a sound. I also don't love the rubber on the front of the unit. It seems to make the unit feel more unstable. The power button is easy to find and press. The volume is very good, the volume knob is not as well-made as my old Tascam STX100s (that's a personal preference) and you have a hard time getting the knob to stay on the volume adjustment wheel. I can't get it to stop turning. However, the unit does sound great. The build quality is good for the price, and you can adjust the volume all the time. It's a good buy, but I'm just not a fan.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The price is awesome. I was concerned about the sound and the amount of battery the phone has. I am glad I decided to buy this phone. It's a great phone that comes with great sound quality. It is lightweight and has great battery life.!!!  Good product for a cheap price:!!!! This is a great product for the money. It works well and the quality is decent. My only gripe is the charger it comes with is a joke. It only charges my phone for a few hours, and that's before I even use it. I wish they would make a better charger. I'm not an electronic geeks but I will be buying more stuff from this seller.  good product for cheap price, not for long distance use:    I have a Motorola G3 M5 and i'm not very happy with it, the sound quality is horrible and the battery life is crap (2 days at full brightness with no use at all), but I love the cheap price and the way I can use this phone as an old cell phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this mouse for 4 months now and it works perfectly. the only thing i would change about it is it has to have at least a 100 ms latency so you can have better accuracy in a game. but if you want to play with a mouse it's better than any mechanical mouse i have ever used. it is very comfortable to use and accurate. i've tried a few other mouse types and this mouse is the best! i wish they made a smaller version for a cheaper price. but this mouse has definitely been worth every penny.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very easy to use and install. Works just like I thought it would. I bought it to replace a 3 year old unit. Works great and looks brand new. My one complaint is that the power button doesn't have a function for changing between different power settings and that the LED light that illuminates on the back of the device doesn't appear to turn on when it is off. Not too big of a deal but it's just something to think about. I have to keep this one on all the time, as I'm sure there will be several times when I need to change the power settings to keep it running.

Our first impression was that it is a very good, compact portable device, and it's battery lasted the entire week. The thing is very thin, about 1/2 an inch, and is great for your bag.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Pros:  -Great sound  My only complaint is that the manual is in Chinese and difficult to understand.   Cons: .  -Can't switch batteries while it's on  I bought this to use as my main set up with headphones.  When using my iPod I had to unplug my headphone's cable to power it up. .  The charging port doesn't work at all.   and can't see the buttons on the top of the device  It is very tiny so it doesn't have a ton of buttons to press.   .  I bought this after buying another Apple keyboard, the one that is so cheap that you can buy one at Radio Shack for under $10. I can't believe they made that one.   in comparison this one is $90 but it is way bigger.  and it works perfect in my computer.  the only downside is that it can't be switched between different types of batteries, the battery must be completely full before switching it to another type..  As far as the music goes I'm using WMA and AAC so far and its great..

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this device for about a month now and I have to say that it has been perfect as a walk-around monitor for my eyesight. I had bought the LG 3800 before this one, but this one is not as bright, the audio is much better and it has a better battery life. The only con is that it is not Bluetooth. This means that it will not work with a cell phone that has it, so if you own a cell you need to purchase a Bluetooth one like the T9. Overall I am very happy with it, especially for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned several electronic devices over the years, this is the first I'd consider getting. The first one I had was a Philips tv that wasn't very good, my wife took it out of the box and smashed the speakers, then the tv broke down and I thought I was screwed. After that I moved on to a dvda and a viera, but after that it was like taking a nap, the tv was broken, then finally the sound was gone and I just got rid of it. My last one was a iphone that was really great and the best of all time, the iphones screen and processor are amazing and there are so many cool things you can do with it, but then there was that one night, the phone would not respond for like 20 mins and then randomly it would go all red and say the screen had fried and shut off. At this point I'm trying to find something to replace it with but I guess I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with all my devices because this one has made it through 4 or 5 devices and was the best one. Pros: - Super quiet, you can hardly hear it running - great speakers - can connect to wi-fi - very easy to program in macros, has a nice layout - has a built in camera on the back - has touch screen - battery lasts forever - USB connection is easy Cons: - Only 2 usb ports - sound is a bit low - don't like the back lit screen - some may find it a bit fragile
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well, no problems so far. The item arrived on time, and is in perfect condition.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************************This is an excellent unit for anyone who uses it to record, store, and transmit high resolution audio and video. I am using the camera with my new computer, as well as the computer with the audio recorder, all with very good results. The mic is a very nice piece of audio equipment as well. Very good audio. The unit itself, well, the price and the features, it is well worth the price. It can record audio at up to 96 khz, it's very clean and clear and has a high dynamic range. It also has a video function, so you can record video on the fly in the camera's on-board camera, or with external cameras, etc. The audio is good as well, but not as good as it could be for this price, and the video is not high-end, but it is a great alternative. It's also nice to be able to record both audio andvideo at the same time. So, all in all, I very much recommend this device to any one who may be considering purchasing one of these units. I own a small home studio, so this unit will do much more than just record sound, it will allow you to have audio/video recording of music, talk, etc, and it's a good size as well if you have any big stuff to record in it.****************************

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for a few months now and am really happy with it ive used it on itunes to listen to music and its the best ive ever had on my ipod ive found it to be the best music player ive tried so far ive just cant stop listening to it   What's Included:  The Pioneer SW-S5K5 is a portable wireless streaming media player that can connect to various devices, like your phone or tablet, and allow music streaming to be played from it. The SW-K5K is also one of the best portable portable players available for use on your iPod. This player has a USB input that is capable of sending MP3 and FLAC music files directly to your iPod through Bluetooth connection. This makes the Pioneer SWK5 a great option for your iPod, iPhone, iPad, or MP3 player. The player is powered by an internal battery that lasts up to 12 hours. Its a portable device that is great for both home and portable users.  If you want to connect your iPod to a USB device that does not have a Bluetooth port, you can use the USB cable that comes with this player. You can also use your iPod's own USB cable for additional convenience.   The included wireless remote control works with both iOS and Android systems. When using the included remote, the volume and song playback buttons can also be used to control music playback in other Bluetooth enabled apps like Pandora. When pairing with the Pioneer USB wireless adapter, you'll be able to use the remote control from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. You'll be using this for your own iPod, but it can work with your other compatible devices too.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My new laptop from Apple is awesome. I had my old Apple laptop for a year and was very disappointed. I was very worried about being left with a computer with broken hard drive. I finally gave up hope and went out and bought this new one. I have a hard time believing I paid over 500 bucks for this laptop. I'm amazed it runs as good as it does and I really don't want to give up on the computer just because my old one didn't. The only con that I've noticed is that it is a bit hard to remove the keyboard tray from the inside. It's a bit of a pain but I love the keyboard.

The unit works fine, as long as you don't put it on the table while running the computer. I was also surprised that it is not compatible with my computer as far as the screen being off.  Reviewed by Mark (Texas), Great Product, Not so great Customer Support I purchased this a year ago and it was working perfectly until it stopped working. I called and they said there was nothing they could do for me and that it was a software issue. I then contacted the company to get a return authorization. The company sent me a new one, but it did not have the same problem as the first one. I sent a message to the tech support and they suggested that the company replace the unit. I went back to the company and they did. I am currently waiting on the new unit to arrive so I can do a full review. The last time I got an update from the tech company I was told that they are sending me an additional unit. They have been very good to me. The other problems I had with the unit is that the audio from the stereo unit has to be turned off. Then, there are a couple of different software things that need to be set up. They were very slow to do that and in the end it made it difficult to do the task at hand.

I really like these little box, I don't see why they would change their design now, it's a little annoying having to unplug and re-plug the computer every 2 hours because there is a little clip that has to be pushed back in to make a connection between the USB cable and the box. ________________________________________________________  Thank you. _____________________  Very good quality, very nice look, i used it on the computer to put on the keyboard, then i put it in to the slot inside the computer, it has a built in battery and works great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I was a skeptic before I got my G-Wizard. I had always been skeptical that an electronic device can be used for more than checking my battery level. I decided to get this and I have to say that I love it! The features that the G-wizard has are pretty nice and this is my first time using an electronic. I can read the batteries in a minute with this thing and it is super easy to use! Also the battery life is amazing! I've gone about a week using the Gwizard and the battery last about 2.5 days. That is pretty good for a battery life. I have a lot of gadgets and I usually leave them in my car at work because there is just no way they are going to last longer than a week. With the G Wizard my car has about 4 hours of life and a day's usage. That's pretty good! I have used a lot more expensive devices and they don't last nearly as long. If your looking for a smart device to keep you updated with the status of your batteries I would definitely recommend this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought my own unit after seeing an ad on Kogan's website. The unit arrived as advertised. I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought the unit would only have 2 ports (a front and a back). It has 4 ports. I plugged in all my computers, my ipod and an mp3 player all with no issues. All 4 ports are active and working with no signal drop. I really like the feature of not having to remember to switch the port in order to use all 4. The only thing I wish the unit had is a USB port. When my ipad runs low on power it takes a while for the unit to wake up. I wish I had been given a USB charger instead of having to find the port on the unit. The price is very affordable as well. I've been using my unit for over a week now and am very happy with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought my LG G3 a few weeks ago after going back and forth between iPhones, Nokia Lumia 928, and many other Android phones (and a lot of the Lumia 900 ones too). LG had to give it to me in exchange for a year's subscription to the unlimited data plan on AT&T. I am pleased with the phone and am satisfied with AT& T for it (not to mention that the phones on AT also do not slow down on me). I was also pleased with LG's support for me and their great website. Now I'm on my 4th year of service and they just keep getting better. I was looking for a better phone for my wife, and she is happy. I'm also happier.

It won't record anything and I've tried every possible thing. ,  I really like the unit. it's compact size makes it perfect for portable use. I wish they would change the button location so you can click on the video file and you won't need to hold down a button and press the'record' button.  the unit is great for its size. I use it as a portable recorder and when it's not in use, it stores all my files on the sd card and I can put it in my computer bag and just drop it in the desk drawer.  not bad for the money  this is a simple, well designed, low cost, excellent portable recorder. for the price, it is pretty good for its purpose, and I have not experienced any glitches or problems. -  great for my personal, everyday recording needs -  if you are a musician or want to document your sessions this is for you. I am a recording engineer and I use this daily for both studio and live applications. I love the ease of operation, the clean look, the simple set up.  "the unit is very well built, simple to use and to maintain."  -   the unit works perfectly, it makes great recordings - ,,  very simple but effective product - 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and really liked it.  It was quick, easy to use, and I did not have to deal with the terrible software on Android.   I really like the smart settings it has (turn on or off the device when the screen is off or when a call comes in).   If I could do it over, I would purchase a second Note 10, but unfortunately that is not possible.  I bought my first Apple iPad a few years ago and I really enjoyed it.  Apple's software was great and the apps were a bonus.  I loved it, and am planning on buying another as soon as the new one comes out.  I like the Apple iPad because I can easily do most tasks I need from my computer, even if the Apple apps are not what I would consider the best. The iPad has been the most useful tool I have ever owned.  As the software continues to improve and more apps become available, I expect the iPad to become my best laptop and I plan on upgrading.  If you are interested in trying out an iPad for your business, contact us for information on your next project.       Acer XB240H (2013)

It was easy to use and was very precise. It has a built in microphone which is very helpful if you use your computer for more than just internet surfing. I also like how the mic's voice is different then the built in speaker.  (Posted on 3/5/2014)  i love it!!!   By Sia from Dallas TX  Rating: 5 of 5 Stars!  I bought this product to replace my older Sony device that broke down. I was shocked when I got to use my new camcorder for the first night. It worked as it should. When the Sony died, I looked on Ebay and I found this one. It's exactly what I wanted. I used it for a few weeks and never had an issue. I've been using it for the last week. I can't wait to go on vacation and use it. It is so much fun and the quality is incredible. I recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome video recorder

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best device I have ever used. It has done what it was advertised to do, and more.  Best product EVER!!! Review by T.   I'm using this product now. I'm using it as a light source in my closet in my dining room. It works like a charm. It's not bright, but it makes it easy to find a spot, and I know when I can't find it. It does not take up any shelf space, and the lights I put in it do not over power the one that is attached to the wall. The only downside is that I have to look at it every now and then because I can only see the light when I put it in my hand, but in my mind, the light comes out. I have a nice looking house. This has saved me money, and my home looks amazing! Thank you for making a great product. You have a loyal customer.  on this device Review by L.   (Posted on: May 27, 2008) This is a great little light. I use it as my lighting source in our bedroom. We are able to use it outside as well. It can be hard to find in a dimly lit room because it is so small. This product has saved us several thousands of dollars. .  of this product Review by R.  : This light is so bright and well designed I have the right size for our dimly lighted bathroom. The only thing is when in a place where you need to dim it down it takes a while. It is difficult to find but the lights look really nice in our bathroom.  Great, great product Review, by J.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an A/C that will only work with an iPod (that can run my old songs just fine and it has a 2-digit mode on the iPod, so I can select which music is played as I need it). I am now looking for a replacement, I'd like a bluetooth one. Rated 1 out of 5 by mike from not worth it, don't waste your money this unit is not worth the price, you get nothing for the money, I had to spend over $200 for my old unit, this is like $30.00, you're not getting much for the $, it can't be paired up, doesn't sound good, and the usb port just gets a bit warm to the touch, not comfortable to hold in your hand. I would rather pay $100 for an Apple device, my iphone 6 plus, which does everything I want it to do.

Please fix this!  Have had this since 2014 & my phone hasn't gotten any worse.  I've had this phone for 2 years now. I've had no issues, not one. .  (Posted on 8/9/2017)  Works just fine.  the battery does not last as long as I would like. I use it every night on my nightstand. I had to buy a new battery because it didn't last for a whole month.  a few of the calls are very long and you have to get used to.   the only issue is if you take your phone into a public place the battery might not hold a charge at all. (Posted 5/30/2017 by Anonymous)  the phone is working good and the battery lasts long   (Posted 5th of May 2017) . (Reviewed on 5/20/2017. The battery is working just fine, it's just a matter of finding the right size for the battery case to hold it in place).  My phone is getting hot, I have the blue color version of this phone so I can see the temperature, but when I'm not using my phone (e.g. my phone in bed or in my car) it's cooler, so it's not hot. (I use the heat set with the battery on to turn it up to maximum when I need to use it). I got a second battery and I'm using it right now. So far it's holding a charge.  is it working? is the phone going to get hot? if it does the blue battery isn't going to last as much. A while ago I changed my battery but not the phone, it got hot again. (It was the wrong battery case). So I have to take my phone out and change my battery if I'm going to use the phone for about 30 minutes.    The phone is still working fine. It's not getting hot.  this is a great phone. I'm really pleased with it. It is easy to set up and it is just great in my opinion. (The blue version, but still very durable).   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best electronic keyboard I have ever used. No skipping, no problems, great sound, great feel, and best of all, if you have any problems with it, they will be fixed without taking it back to the store. It is the only one I have found that can be used with other electronic devices like a PC (Windows 8 and up). If you are looking for a really nice keyboard, I would suggest this one!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a while now and it is great. It holds your ipod securely and is pretty sturdy. its also rechargeable so no worries about it dying.  I use it on my desktop to listen to music. Works great  Good product but needs an update: i used to use a bluetooth wireless speaker when i travel. i've been buying them from different sellers online but these guys are the best so i was glad to see they are still in business. they work great. but i'd love to have them add a way for you to download songs from the server. and i was also going to order another one when i read some of your other reviews that people were having problems with them. well i bought one, it works great but i have some problems with it. the speaker is on the right side of the device but when you turn the speaker off the right speaker shuts off. i was hoping it was an issue with the speakers and it's the bluetooth device but it works fine with the right speakers so there has to be something with the software on the server side that keeps this from working. i hope that they get around to fixing this issue.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was using the original Pico 2 from 2004 until 2009 when I upgraded to the Pico 3. The first thing I noticed about the new model is that the P3 is much better to operate in any weather condition. It is easier to read and is much more stable and less prone to overheating than the original. The screen is much brighter, and the LCD screen is easier on the eyes, although it is also a little more bright.   The screen is very clear and is definitely the biggest improvement I have seen. The sound is also much better than the P2. The P2 has very low audio output, and this one has more volume. There is no hum in the new unit. The built in speakers are also much louder.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________   I was very impressed by my new laptop. I was a Mac user before and after my move. The only thing I had to do was change some of my Mac apps that I no longer used and the computer worked great. The first time I did this I was impressed that I could change my desktop background by clicking on the screen. The second time I changed my desktop I found I was able to see the screen even with the screen up. I have not found a way to make it work after that, but it's a neat little feature to have. The keyboard is better than the last one and I have a new bluetooth mouse that works really well.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Michael from Amazing product I bought this for my Mac Pro to connect a USB printer to it and it was an easy install. This is great for running an OS X device. Very simple to use. The software was easy to download and install. It also has a great feature to turn the display off.  "Love it" I purchased this product a month ago to connect an external keyboard and mouse to my computer. Since I didn't have the needed software (MacPaint) I purchased a second copy from this website. The second copy was of course free. I installed it, downloaded the software, and started running it. Immediately I had to use my external mouse to click on the desktop. The device worked well. I had no issues using it. The only problem was I couldn't find the software to enable the touchpad. Once I found it I thought it was great and started to use it. I used it for a couple days and thought I might buy a second one. I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like it. It is easy to use and works perfectly. It also can connect to any TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using my mx-6e for a couple weeks and it's amazing. its so cool i can do everything i could think of on my cell phone on the go. especially with my laptop. and the battery life is so good, it makes my laptop last like 3 days! if i wanted the ultimate portable ive got it. one more thing is the price. for its price it is amazing. and you can't beat that it can be used on many different devices from my phone and my notebook to my tv. and its great to be able to use it with my iphone when i need to record a video! and for the price it cant get any better! and im planning on buying another one to have for the house because its so great!  I was skeptical about purchasing a Sony MX-Series Smartphone, but the MZ-1E (1.8.3) has already changed my opinion! Not only is the camera very good, but it has been easy to use. This is my second Sony device I've bought, my first was a Sony X-700. Both are fantastic! The battery life on the X-900 lasted for days, but was not very long (around 3-4h). The MZ1E is about 5-6h more. I would strongly suggest getting a charger (2 x AAA) and a microUSB cable (you'll need it!). The microUSB port isn't as good as a micro-USB cable. The MX2 is a great camera, but its not enough to compete with the other models of Sony.  Love the camera. Great for travel. Good battery life. Overall good camera!  "Lovely camera!"

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great to do my own work and it has a big battery that lasts for about 1/2 hour. I have a couple of problems with it, but I believe the problem is related to the power adapter. It is a bit difficult to make a connection to the USB cable to plug it in.  I bought it from another person for $20 but there is a problem with that as well. It works when plugged in but when it is off it does not charge. It takes a lot longer to charge than my phone and there is no indication on the wall of the time it is charging. .  in short it is a great tool. it has it's flaws but it works. I would suggest to read reviews on it as some are inaccurate. I got it because the reviews mentioned that it was working fine. In the end, it took about 8 hours to charge to full capacity. The only problem is it takes a long time to charge so that is why i only give it 4 stars.  (Was $29.99, Now $7.99)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought this unit about a week ago. It has been working perfectly for me. The key feature is the ability to adjust the speed of the timer as long as you have it on low. For a timer of 10min you have the option to increase it up to 100 or so (so it doesn't stop working right after you run out of the time to do an event). Also this has 2 settings to turn off the timer when the battery is almost dead and turn it back on when it is almost full. This makes sure that you have plenty of time to set up the event before the batteries go dead. You may want to change the batteries once a year (it doesn't keep any time logs). I do not have a problem with the buttons and I find that they have a great feel to them. I highly recommend this unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device works very well. It works with the iPhone 4, 4s and 5 and it's great for texting and emailing as well as calling. It's a little pricey, but you can save a lot of money by buying one of the more expensive models, instead of the simple cheap one I have. I would recommend this device to everyone who wants to communicate easily with their friends, relatives and employers.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Kj from Great communicator and great value. I am a graphic designer and a freelance photographer, both for my company and for clients. I have found that I cannot use my phone for either work or for personal use due to the large size and weight, which I have no use for on a daily basis. So I started looking for a small, cheap, communicator that is compatible with my phone. I found the K1000 as the cheapest one on the market and thought it would work well. But I was very disappointed to discover that it is not a bluetooth device, and does not come with the battery that comes with my battery pack for my phone, which is not too bad anyway because I use my iPhone and only it. So, it is basically just a really tiny bluetooth microphone. I really miss the battery I got with my iPhone, but that's not really a huge deal for me because I have a portable battery pack with it. Also, I find the buttons a little difficult to use, so I keep my iPhone in my back pocket or my pants pocket and use the K on my desk. But it works, and I would suggest it for those who are working or for those in a professional environment. I'm also very happy with the sound quality with this device. It sounds crisp and clear. I use it mostly as a small portable speaker and as an audio recorder for podcasts. I also use it to read and write emails and texts in the car. So it's just a very nice, simple communicator with decent sound quality.

The price is great for all the electronics. I recommend this to anyone looking to buy.  the only complaint is that the remote to change the settings on the remote control is small and the batteries do not last long.  to change settings on remote controls, you need a key or a plug.  and when you plug it in to charge it, it turns off but it is only for 10 minutes and then turns back on.  a simple solution to have a remote that is bigger and lasts for a long time. .  with a little bit of care this could last a long, long time and it won't be hard to find a good battery.

I know I've been putting in way more than the daily recommended amounts and not knowing why. When I bought this, I was so excited, but didn't think I'd be using it for this much. After tracking my calories, I found out I was burning fat! I was using it to track how much time I spend on my computer, but now I am using it all the time. I think this is great for tracking every little thing. If you want to be more flexible, it's still awesome, and it's good for the weight loss that I am doing.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Good product, great price, can't beat the warranty!   I had the unit for two weeks, I am satisfied. It does the job it should do, I didn't need the 3D. I had to use it the day that I got it because I didn' t know how long I would have for my son to work and my kids to play on it. The 2D and the 3d were good but for the price you really can't complain.   Great purchase, no problems in shipping, would definitely recommend this product.   to make it even more useful.  , and I know its the best bang for your buck because I bought the one for the back yard and it does what I need it to do.   a+   Excellent product. Used for two days and then it just needs to be cleaned, if you have a dry environment you'll have to spray it with a spray bottle a few times. Don't try to clean it by hand. It's like using a rag. It works well for the first few uses but it does have a slight staining and residue. After a few weeks I decided to clean the thing by hand by using the following method:   1. Rinse the parts.  2. Scrub all the residue away from the wires (the part I'm cleaning).  3. Wash and dry the parts as usual. -Use a wet microfiber cloth (about a quart size or so) to remove any residue. .   the rest of the steps are the same.    For more info you can visit the following link: http://www.cableboxdynamics.com/cablex_wds_v4_v3_wrd_x.htm   Also, the product is a little pricey but the warranties are great so it's worth it.   at $299 it is also quite a bargain and the delivery is fast as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Avantone RX-N5B was the best of the bunch. The quality is good and the remote is simple and easy to use. The only thing i found to be lacking was the ability to add an aux input so it could serve as a 2nd monitor while playing your media. If it is possible, this is the best remote out there. I love the design and functionality.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works great, the only problem I ran into is it had a hard time with the original battery the came with it when I started it. I replaced it with a new one and it works perfectly now.  I would highly recommend this device.  I have it on my iMac, and it's perfect for that. -Jeff  My first USB device I have been looking for a USB device that can act as a controller to a TV, monitor or computer. This is the best product out there for the price. 's great I've been using it with an Apple TV 2 and a monitor and it gives great signal strength. This also allows me to use my PC without having to connect it to my TV to use it for work. This device is great I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an all-in-one device to be used for all of your computer needs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for about 2 years now and it works great! it isnt a perfect device by any means but I love it and it never fails me! Ive bought it for two different phones, one phone and one tablet, and both have had it run flawlessly!  noise level:   great device, however it could benefit from being louder, even though it is a great noise cancelling device.  its definitely a device to buy for a more quiet home theater. -Dale D.  and  -Paul S.  on a budget :   (but i really like it and the battery lasts a very long time)  I have the LG C2 and I bought the HD2 a year ago for my bedroom tv and now I use it for my living room tv and it is still going strong and I use my computer and audio device in the living room and the HD 2 works great. .  the noise reduction really works well, I have it on all the time now. It has helped me keep my son out of trouble.  of course there are other noise canceling devices out there, but I have been happy with my C2.  are you happy with your product? Have you had any problems?  Thanks for writing,  Mark.  to comment on noise level: I have the LCD2 and a little while ago, I found that a friend was using a different version of the device and she said that the noise was reduced but that the sound quality was different. I still like the sound from the LCD 2 better (to my ears), but that's all she said. I also like that the C2 does so much better than the LG. I would give it a 5 if it weren't for the lower noise level. It is quieter but you can hear a difference.  is it worth it?  and how much noise is there in the room (in dB)?  Mike. to comment:  The noise level of the LCD is very good, but it isn't as loud as some other devices on this list (the X10, for example). I would rather have more volume for my audio than the loudness of some of these devices.    To comment on how much you might be able to hear, I would start by setting the noise level to about 40-45 (depending on how far you put your ear plugs in) -

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just recently purchased this speaker from the site, and as far as I can tell, it is a perfect speaker, just like you described in your review.   One caveat: when I first received the item I noticed that the bottom of the speaker box was slightly rusted/dirtier, and I just had to throw that in there to get rid of it. Since I didn't notice it, I thought it was just dust. But after putting the speaker on my car stereo and using it for about an hour (during which time I put the car on and took it off several times to make sure the speaker wasn't getting too hot), I saw the rust. It was a tiny amount, but definitely there.   in the end, it took a little bit of elbow grease and a good scrubbing with WD40, but it was worth it to get that rusted spot out.     Anyway, I don't know why someone would throw out this speaker, because it's a perfect sound, and for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find a speaker that sounds better, especially when compared to other more expensive speakers. If you want to make the jump to an actual amplifier, go for it. But if you are looking for a quality speaker, this one is very good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikon kx10v - i have had this device for years and I can not say enough good things about it. I have it with all my computers and devices. The battery life is great and the size is perfect. Also, the touch screen works great and I am not annoyed by having to touch on it as often as some other phones.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the sound of this machine. It sounds good and loud!   As for the use: This machine is a wonderful tool and it really is a lot of fun to use! I'm a beginner and this is the first time I have ever built a circuit board using a soldering iron. It was pretty fun and easy. The only thing I would say is that I'm not used to building stuff so I would suggest that I do some practicing before I try it myself.  If you get the correct size and shape of the board and use it right (it's a good idea to do so for the first round because you'll get more confident), it'll work! But, I suggest to follow the instructions carefully to ensure a good fit on your PCB and if you don't have the proper tools to install it... well you know the rest.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great little device and works perfectly. No need to take batteries with you on hikes or backpacking. Easy to set up. I have read so many positive reviews about this product, so I thought I would share my experience with this little device. I got the mini version and it works great for my needs, but the larger version with the battery case would have been better. First off, I did not get the battery pack or charger with it so that made the whole thing a bit more expensive than it was. The only issue I had is that the screen was not working at all with the mini model. I have read other reviews that say that if you use the phone, it is working fine, but I cannot say that for sure. I did have the same problem with the charger on my other mini model, so it seems like it might have been a design thing. The charger is a good size so it would make for easy travel and charging while hiking or back packing. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and it has saved me a few bucks in the long run, so that is always a good thing. I also really like the fact that there is a spare for the battery, as that would have saved me some money. Overall it is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a little extra peace of mind. I just wish it had the extra capacity for a 2nd phone and charger to use with it.

Yes No Friday, June 20, 2012  This thing is nice!!  by Chris from San Diego CA USA  Pros: Smaller than a cell phone, can store my small laptop.  a/c, battery life, GPS, wifi, usb power, bluetooth, speakers, GPS  Cons: none, as usual  Review: I just got it on Monday, I'm really excited to use it. I use a cell number (Sprint, AT&T, etc) and can not use an internet phone without paying extra for extra fees. With this device, I can use my internet phone at home (AT&T), but still have my GPS on my cell. .  to the cons: I wish it had a USB port for power and a mic.  for now, it works great.  on a side note, the batteries are low, but after charging on my house's external solar panel (my solar battery has no charger but works fine on the GPS) its only 3 days on a single charge.  the bluetooth is very fast, but I get a notification if someone is near, but not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. but hey, I've got my cell phone with me, so I'm good :)  I love my GPS.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second device in my car. The first one was an old Yamaha that needed some TLC. I can only imagine how bad the new one is. The unit is perfect and has been great.   When I got the car radio, I was excited for a small unit that's easier to work with than the factory unit. So far I have been pleased.  I installed the head unit on a 2004 FRS that came with the A/C and the unit works great. . ,   The battery life from the old unit is great but I have replaced it now. The car is driving very well and no overheating issues. I still need to go to the dealership to make sure it's safe but so far, so good!   What I like:  1. The ability to turn it on/off at any time is very convenient  2. The head unit has some functions that can be set up through the car and then the unit will just work when you press the buttons. Very cool!  3. The volume knob is well sized and easy to find. It has a good tactile feel to it.  .  in the future  When the A-GPS unit is complete, I think I might buy a second one to have the AFS and A-Map in one unit. Also have a couple of old units that I am waiting on, for my daughter's car, which I would like to have both the AGS and AFS on one unit and have the car go into a high beam mode when turning.   for now I am happy with the system and the ease of changing the settings.   (5 stars)   I have had great results with this unit. - The new battery life is very long  - It is a great unit to be able to just turn it and go   . (4 stars)  It's nice to be using a high quality head unit. The system is quite good. 's are my first A/c system I have had and I have to say it's very nice. My previous A/cs didnt like to work when my house gets hotter and hotter the more I use it, even my car is very hot and the system worked, but now the Aves have a very long life and I can use it almost all of the time and have no problems whatsoever with it and it just works great!!

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, October 06, 2015 I was a little worried after the bad review that I got on this laptop. I have had it for a week now and I have to say I'm extremely pleased. It's my first laptop so I am learning everything that I can, I have learned that my hard drive is too slow but that's not a big deal. The keyboard is fantastic, I'm almost to the point of writing a review on it. It has really smooth scrolling, I can type with the touchpad and the keyboard is great. I don't think I can ever buy a laptop that has a better keyboard. Also the battery life is great, not bad at all. The only thing I could do that it doesn't have is a fingerprint reader so I would recommend going for the fingerprint reader.  I love this laptop! I am so impressed, it's a really good laptop, I'd recommend to my friends, and this laptop is good for me too.  and they love it!  by: Bklyn1 - August 10, 2015 i have had this laptop for a couple of weeks now and i love it so much i bought an iphone 6 Plus and im also buying a nintendo 64 and iphon 7. i'm very pleased with my choices ive had no issues with my phone whatsoever.  for a little bit of extra money, you get a better battery, better keyboard, and a bigger screen. i highly recommend this laptop to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I really really like my Kobo Glo. It has a very good battery life, which is not a common feature for a e-reader. It is very easy to read and has an LED light on the front of the e-read and can be illuminated to show you're e-book is being read. I don't read e-books so I don.t have an easy way to find the current page number but I have found that by looking at the volume buttons it is easy to track the current number of pages read. The only problem I have had with it is that it is very loud when you open it up and has a tendency to pick up your co-workers conversations in the office. It's worth it to me because it is cheap and a big step up from an e-ink or paper book.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this device to replace my old portable computer. The device is easy to setup and works just as it should. The only problems that I have experienced with it are 1) the device is not very big, 2) it uses a little less energy than the older portable I had and 3) it takes a long time to recharge. The battery life on this device is almost the same as my older computer. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a portable computer with a larger screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I ordered the M2V charger and it was great! I am in an area that does not have a lot of access to charging stations. I am using it with the USB cable as well as a USB hub and with an Android tablet. The port is located at the bottom so I do not have to worry about any adapters. I do use a battery in my phone as I do have a new smartphone that has a small battery. I have not yet tested its performance in an EV but so far I am very happy with it. It is definitely the way to go. I have ordered two of these and will be ordering two more. I had some issues that I could not get over with the initial product and I feel like I have it figured out. I was really surprised by the performance of this product. I really like the fact that it is compact, durable and has multiple charges available. I just got it and it is great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this keyboard. I would have never bought this without having the original keyboard. The only thing that is not perfect is the fact that it does not have any backlight. It's quite a disappointment when you can't see what the key is doing because the backlight only glows when the key pressed. However, I am able to use my computer with this keyboard! I also like the fact the the power button is not on the side of the key. It really makes it easy to get to, and makes it even easier to change the color of the keys. I also love that it has a separate volume control on each key that you turn on the top of the board (kind of like a mini-remote). So if you like to do your typing in your headphones, this is a great keyboard!

I can also listen to music while I am inside so that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of my computer. I recommend this device to anyone that loves the idea or use of using an audio device.

The bass has a great punch and punch is a very good word to describe it. I find the sound to be very pleasant and that it is very easy on the ears. I have tried some other portable headphones and I really can't say much about them. However I do have the Sennheiser PC-350s so I will continue to try other portable sound. The design is very simple and you can carry it around just like a purse. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. The cord is a standard 4 prong so you are able to plug in your phone or MP3 player with no problem. I would definitely recommend this headphone.

This printer is very compact and does not take up much space,  If you have a very small studio or small office it may not be the best choice, but if you need a printer for home use this will do the job.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!  I bought this to replace my old wireless speaker. I am extremely happy with it! I have both wired and wireless speakers. This is a much better sounding speaker. It will sound better in a bigger home theater setup, and for home office use. It has a much larger sound stage and is much more responsive. For me it is almost as loud as a wired speaker. For less than $100 it's well worth the price. You get a much more high quality product for a much less price.  One of the best! My wife and I absolutely love our wireless speaker, we use it for video conferencing in our home office and are very happy with the sound quality. We would recommend the speakers to anyone. It can really cover any room from large to small.  I would highly recommend the M3 to anyone, from the sound to the setup to the price, it can not be beat. I have a few other brands of wireless speakers and I prefer the sound and performance of this.

It is so much more convenient than the paper charts I was using.   I've purchased 3 portable printers and I'm so glad I found these. My husband loves them!    These are the best portable printers I have ever used. I can print out my patient charts to take with me on my trips. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* The Sound - ******************* This was my first electronic device and it was a blessing in disguise. I didn't have a car audio system, I had a Yamaha AV system, so I needed to have the ability to control the music without looking at the display. I wanted a system that had an automatic mute function. I love it for my iPod, and even my iPad. I play it as a mixer for both music and movies. I don't have to take the unit off, set it on my table, and hit a button to turn the system on or off. I can play it while doing other stuff. The auto mute feature is one of the nicest features I have found. It's not as loud as I would like, but I'm not complaining, I just wish I could increase the volume. It seems like if you crank it way too loud, it cuts off the audio signal, so it's a great feature to have. The volume control is a bit odd, but it gets the job done. The buttons feel really good in my hand. The control buttons are flush, so you can easily activate the volume control by pressing it with your index finger. The screen is big, and it's easy to see. The display comes on quickly, and I find that I can press the power button without having to touch the screen and get into it, so that's a plus. The power and mute buttons are right next to each other. I have no complaints about the sound quality. The sound is a little bit muffled for some of the higher notes, but for the most part I'm pretty happy with it. The bass sounds nice, and while I don,t expect much, I like that it's there. I've had it a little over a week now and still have about 50% of the batteries in it. So far, so good. So I have a few more comments about it. I wish there were a way to charge the batteries when the unit is not in use. It would make life much easier. Another thing I like is that the auto mute function doesn't stop on it's own. The function does shut off automatically when the batteries are about to run out. This is nice, since the music and sound volume can get pretty loud during a movie. Another nice feature is that it has a built in speaker and mic jack. This way I can use my laptop without having an extra sound system. If you have

Reviewer: ky - favorite favorite favorite - February 24, 2007  Subject: Nice sounding, cheap sounding CD player? This is a good sounding, inexpensive CD player. But does not work at all. I thought it was supposed to play all the songs. If you try to change the songs to the ones you want to listen to then it only plays the ones it recognizes as being the right song, then stops. The CD player seems to have very bad CD playback quality. My local station (WQXR) plays better quality music and does not need a CD player, but I have to have a CD-R player in my car.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Works great...very pleased with this  By B.B. on October 27, 2018 Byon October 27 a good device with very good price and a good selection. I have a few of these. You can get very good deals.  Review of DJI GO 4 by DJI Innovations on October 20, 2018 byon October 20  After more than a year of using these, it is my favorite platform to capture and manage my drone footage. The interface is easy to navigate with intuitive user interactions.  the flight time is very dependant on the controller you are using, but I have been able to get great footage.   The camera is so much better than my old Hero 2 and it has 4k resolution. This is the only thing that matters in the end when it comes to quality.  I'm a big fan of this camera because you can use it for so many things with out worrying about how you'll be able to carry all your gear into the field. This new camera also makes me think about my drone batteries, so I can plan my next move accordingly.   in short, for what it can do it is very great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.  that is my opinion   By: KARLOS GAY on September 28, 2018  I wanted a good drone to make my flying more accurate. The DJI Inspire is pretty nice but not as easy to fly or set up as the one DJI sells in the US.   on the other hand the DJI Go 4 is a great device for beginner to professional users. It can take a lot of videos and stills and it does not weigh that much! I do recommend the camera though, it does have a low light feature so you can take some awesome videos without being blinded. , and it is quite easy to control.

I am on my 4th one so far and it still has all my music and podcasts. Its very portable. i love that i can just plug it into my computer and it works like a charm. The battery life is very long and it makes a great phone speaker too! Its one of my favorite products out there. I dont feel its overpriced and the quality is great. I love this iPod!  Rated 5 out of 5 by John from Love it and the price! This is a great product. I'm a long-time user of iPod's and this is the first iPod to give me a big kick and I have to say, it works well. I also have an iPod Mini and the mini is less powerful but has a greater range. I bought the Classic and it is a very easy device to use. The one thing I found out is the size. The mini is perfect to put in your pocket. I own a large screen phone and the small screen on the Classic is great to use when you have nothing to look at.  I bought the iphone and it comes with my charger which is perfect  The sound quality is amazing. The screen is smaller than the ipod mini but the battery life in the ips is better. I did purchase the iptwifi upgrade which was great. You can get the upgrade in the app store if you dont have the iaw app already. I can play podcasts and the music is still very good. This is my go to ipho  Just bought this one. It is a big upgrade from my iPod mini and I am more than happy with it.  the app is ok but if they get a new version of the app they can get rid of the ads as I am not a big listener of ads.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great device, cheap price, easy installation! It's great to be able to watch the sun on a nice clear day! The camera works great and has a great view when you are viewing the sky, especially with the telescope in the box. The only problem I have is the battery, it takes about half a battery charge before the image on the screen will change.  A great value, very simple to use, well designed. The best telescope I've ever owned. I can see the moon with the naked eye and the stars with the magnify and it takes in so much detail, no other telescope has even come close. It is so clear and sharp, the images I have taken are amazing. This is my second astro telescope, the first is a refractor, a lot of the astro scopes I have owned are binoculars, not a telescope this big. My 2nd telescope This is not the cheap toy you see on TV. This really is a great telescope for the money. You will be amazed by the view. You can even watch the planets. I bought it for $149 which is a good price. I was a little concerned because of the low light but this is not an issue with this scope. Beautiful and easy to use! Very pleased! I own 4 of these as well as several other great telescopes. I've read a lot about these scopes and have heard of people using them to look at celestial bodies, but nothing as impressive as my 6.5" Orion SkyQuest XT8i! I use it every morning to observe the planets and stars, and have the pleasure of looking up and down at the Milky Way galaxy and the beautiful spiral structure of the Sagittarius constellation. It has been great since I upgraded to the 8"! Love it. I bought this because my 12 year old son would never be able for me to take him to the zoo. Well, I have to say that we both love it! He is in love with the moon, but he is a little afraid of the scorpions and the bats! He can't wait for me next time to take us to the animals to see what they are looking like! My mom and I are happy with this purchase! This is a very well made telescope. I'm new to astronomy, but this scope has been very helpful! I ordered this as my second telescope and after taking the time to install the equipment

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device worked great and didn't cost much. The first time I was using the device I didn't realize that the device had a mute button on the back of the unit. I had just gone from using my phone to my bluetooth keyboard. I was listening to music with a wireless speaker and I wanted to mute the device so I could have a clear voice through the bluetooth speaker. I realized the mute button was a huge help. I'm a computer user and I'm pretty sure most of the devices out there these days can mute your device. When I found out about the mute option on the X3 the mute is something I'm going to keep. I use my devices when I'm using my computer and I do most of my listening through my blueman device.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

We bought an Olympus E-P3 and it worked flawlessly until the camera failed during the first day we used it. We then went on to use another digital camera for a few months and it died shortly after we took it out of the box. I've used various cameras over the years and none of them were as reliable or well made as the E-p3. I really like the small size and the battery life is longer than the Nikon CoolPix A.

I purchased it to replace my old watch, which would die after a year of moderate use. The GPS watch on my old wrist was more accurate and easy to use than the Garmin.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great product!   Review by Steve I've had a lot of issues with the old Sony NEX. This little thing is fantastic. I've used it for a few weeks and the first couple of times I was nervous that the batteries would die, but after a few charges I've never had any issues. The interface is easy to use and it was easy to set up. It's got a great touch screen which is super useful when watching HD video on my laptop. I also love that it has a wireless connection, unlike my old Sony. (I have a Sony A900)  ,, Sony NIXP-30 (2018-07-28) I got the NEX-5n a couple weeks ago and it's great! It's pretty good quality for the money, so I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. I had a couple of issues though, the interface is extremely laggy and the camera just goes haywire when you go into the settings. The other issue is the battery life is very weak. I was hoping it would last longer but it doesn't really last that long. Other than those two problems, it's good! I can't wait to get a couple more cameras with it.  Review by Jeff I just got my NEX 5n, and it works great! I used to use my old A7 (now A65) exclusively with the nxtp30, but I found it extremely slow for continuous shooting. I can actually take full 5.6 frames at one shot on this system. I like that this camera has an SD card slot, and not the memory card. You can't just use your own memory card with a Sony camera, which is a real bummer, because I just like having my own cards. But this is one of those situations where the nx5n is a good upgrade!  Excellent! Review by William This is by far the best camera I've ever had! With the nixdv I can shoot 1080p 60 fps and 30 FPS 60 fps, I can zoom in and out from my 1.44 inch touch screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was a dream to have this product, you simply can't compare it to any of the products I've purchased. No more need to replace batteries!! I've never owned a tablet in my life, I'm so happy.   Product Review: The product arrived in a very timely manner. The quality is amazing and the price is unbeatable. The only thing that would be improved is that the device would come with a case. The casing is not waterproof but it is very tough and will likely keep it from getting wet. It comes with a warranty so you would be covered in case of any issues. The case comes with everything you need to get started. The tablet is very fast and easy to set up. It is not very user friendly but you don't need to use the menus. All of the apps work out of the box. One thing that I do recommend is that if you use Windows 7 make sure you have the latest drivers, the device will not boot to Windows 8 if you do not have the right drivers. There is also a way to get into Windows 7 so that you can use the full version of Windows and get all the updates. The best part is you get this device for free!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had mine for a few weeks now, and the keyboard works great. i dont really know how else to say it other than the keys are quiet, and have a very responsive feel to them. ive been playing games online with my computer for about a week and i can say the wireless connection is great, and i am having very few problems with the router, it just works flawlessly. ives had no problems with my modem or wifi. i did see some people complaining that the usb ports didnt seem to work, i didnt notice anything and was just using it to download games. i cant say i had any problems with that, i just cant say for sure, but i did notice one problem though that isnt really a problem, the mouse seems to have no effect when playing games, when i first got it and was playing online, the pointer would move around on screen when i shot a weapon. but when i turned the sensitivity on my mouse up to it's maximum and tried to move the pointer, nothing happened. i didnt really understand it at the time, but it seems to be a problem with the usb port itself, and hasnt happened since.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jb711 from This is a great keyboard for the price. The keyboard is well made, and is very comfortable to type on. Its just as simple to use as it was to purchase, and I have yet to experience any problems at all. It has a very nice keyboard, and it feels like a premium keyboard when you're typing on it. , but I did have a problem. It does not have the battery compartment and has a hole in it to access it. It also had a very annoying squeak when using the keyboard. It is not just the keyboard that I like, but the software as well. This is the first keyboard I have bought that comes with a full range of software. The software allows you to change the colour of your keyboard, turn off the cursor, change the speed of the keyboard, etc. This has made my experience with the keyboard so much better. It is so nice to know that the software I can choose what I want to do with my keyboard. I have a feeling that other companies might be thinking about this issue but it makes me feel better. The quality of the packaging is great. I am very happy with my purchase.

Yes No Wednesday, October 07, 2010  A reliable backup and secure computer backup system.  in an iMac, it works great  by Peter C on 09/07/2009  Value Quality Price I've had my trusty harddrive in my computer for about 10 years, but recently I upgraded to a iMac. The computer does not come with a backup drive. I was reluctant to buy a new one when I heard the hard drive in the iMac could be a few years old. I finally decided to get a backup for backup purposes. This product is so much cheaper than buying an extra hard drive! I use it for back-up of my old games and the new software. I am still using my old floppy drives to store my data in a CD, because I don't like the way they wear out after using the same CD for months. So far, so good!  was this review helpful to you?"..." more "This works great. I have never had an issue with it. I use to backup the latest files on my Windows XP computer. It has worked flawlessly in this new computer. I now also use this to backup my Linux files as well. You don't need to be a computer specialist to use this product, it is a very simple thing to do."  Recommend  "I used it once in my PC, it was working for about a week, then I had to use a new hard drive. Then it became very slow, so I bought this one. I think I will use it only for a few months now, before I get rid of it and get another one. But I was very satisfied with the product, I used it to backup a Windows PC I had, I am so glad I bought it."  andi "good device for backup is good and secure for backup"  By Daniel F on 06/02/2009 " Good price, good size. The product was exactly as advertised. I would say that it was a good investment in terms of price. In terms of durability, it worked well. I did find it a little loud when it was idle, but it did not have any problems with noise during a backup

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought this to replace an old laptop that was failing. After a day of testing, I noticed that the keyboard was much better quality. It feels much nicer than the old one. It is lighter and the keys are easier to press. The touchpad was also more responsive. However, I still had the same problem of it sometimes taking two tries to get a key to register. For me, that was too much of a problem, especially since I have a hard time remembering how to type. My only complaint about this unit is that the USB-C ports aren't very powerful. That doesn't stop me from using my laptop for general use. I would like to see a power adapter built into the unit. I did notice that when charging, it was difficult to connect the phone to the laptop. However I believe this is because of my old phone, which isn't an official Apple phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the coolest things I have ever done for myself. I bought it to make a video to show off my son and show him how to make something in the 3D software I just downloaded. It is a good beginner machine and has the ability to do anything from basic math to making your own movies with great results. The only thing I wish it had is an IR remote and a little better control over things, but if you can get past those, it is an amazing device.

I do a lot of digital work and this thing is great for this! The only bad thing is that the battery is cheap, but that can be easily fixed. The screen is also a little bright, but overall I highly recommend this device!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is fast, stable, easy to program and reliable. I love it   Write a negative review about the electronic device for a negative device: The device has several problems that it should be avoided. I use my phone at home and at work. I bought this device for at home but the battery drain at work is a very strong problem. I also found out that it takes a long time to charge the battery when it is full and even if I plug the cord into the wall outlet it takes more than 2 hours. I have never had problems with my cell phone and with my tablet but with the tablet the battery drains fast when it runs low. This is the most expensive device I have bought and I don't recommend this device to anyone.   My suggestion to Amazon: Don't sell cheap devices that are unreliable and not reliable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have the Sony ZXV-L10 with the 10" LCD. The screen is excellent, easy to use, good for pictures, video. The picture quality is fantastic. When I use my old Sony camera, it was a different story. It had very poor image quality. After using the L10, I can see the difference. The L10 is brighter, sharper, cleaner, and the picture is very clear. I also like the fact that I can view my videos on the L screen in my computer. It makes it easy to watch the movie. One thing I did not like about the screen was that the backlight was too bright at night. I have the sunroof so I have my camera set at the sun, and I didn't like how bright it was in the dark. Now with this screen, I'm not worried about it. One minor thing I really liked was that it was waterproof. I could see the LCD in water, so I had no worries about my L10 getting damaged. Overall, it's a great little device. I like that it is easy to take with me when I travel. Posted by John at 2:41 PM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have 2 of these monitors and they work fine. The quality of the monitor is good and the picture is crisp. They have a great sound for the price. My only gripe is with the cable. The cable that comes with the monitor was the cheap and poor quality, and when I tried to buy another cable from another site I was told it didn't work with the monitors because I don't know what I am talking about. After a lot of searching online I found a website that sells cables that works well. It costs $9 and it looks and feels like the cable you would get if you bought it at the store. Just FYI for people who don't want to have to get a new cable from somewhere else: ) Just don't buy this monitor!

It has great battery life, the LEDs are bright, and the controls are easy to learn. The only thing that is a little annoying is that it needs two AA batteries to run. They are hard to come by and they are expensive.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________ This is a very useful and elegant machine, I have only had it for a week and it has already solved a lot of my problems in my home automation system. The remote control works fine and it looks great in my apartment. This machine is very well made, it has many features I never even knew were possible. The price point is just right, the quality is top notch, and if you are looking for an affordable machine this is the one to get.  Have this product for 6 years now: _____________________________ It's been a great six years! I've had this product, and it's never failed to do what I need it to do, and I still need more options!  Good Product, very easy to install: ____________________________________________ Very easy to work with and very easy set up. I'm very impressed. 'sighted' from the original poster: __________________ I bought this to help control a dimmer. I wanted to use it with a cheap digital remote control I was trying to replace. The installation was very easy, and after the first few times I used it, I was very impressed! There's a whole bunch of stuff you can do with this remote control, and there are several ways you can use it! Some of the things I like about this remote are the two separate buttons, and the ability to have it control both light and sound (the sound is very soft, and very good! I could listen to my radio without the remote). The other thing I like is the way you can change the light color. There are only two lights, but you can pick between warm, white, or cool, black. Another great feature is that there are only three settings you can get on the remote - turn off all lights, turn off the lights but allow audio to play, and a special "fade in/fade out" setting, which works well with my TV and some DVD players. It does not have a video mode, so you cannot use it for videos, but it works well for sound. It's easy to program a program, and you can even program it to repeat. I had no problems getting the light and the sound turned off, and all I had to do was click on "record" and the lights turned off and then on again. The lights and the audio on and off works well together and I like the "fades in/out" setting that helps blend things together

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1. This is a great gadget. It comes with everything i needed, and is built well. I have a few other cheap devices that have not lasted more than a month of continuous use. The charger is quite heavy, but worth it.   2. If you don't have a usb hub, you can connect this to a usb 2.0 hub. I do it by putting the hub on the back. I also bought a usb port adaptor for my phone and it works fine.   with that said, it is also not super powerful and you should only connect it to your router, so you can control it from anywhere.  , a small, but very useful tool for anyone who wants to control his home theater system remotely via a web-site or cell phone. Works in conjunction with my iPhone and is a lot faster than any other remote. It is great for making a few changes while you watch a movie and not have to stop it to turn off the lights or switch the TV. It's also great for doing other things while watching a movie if you want to check the internet, change your mp3 player settings, or check out what else is on the TV while you're watching. I can't say enough good things about this little device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   This is a fantastic tool! I use it for taking pictures with the Olympus XZ-1, Olympus OM-D, and Panasonic GH4 all at the same time. The ability to change focus on the fly is awesome, and I use this for recording audio on a wide range of equipment. I'm very satisfied with it.  This a superb digital camera!   So, first off - this camera is amazing! Its great for taking pics, but the real beauty of this is that it is so easy to set up and use, and has some pretty awesome features. Its lightweight, very small, and it comes with everything you need to start shooting on it, including a lens hood and a nice lens and memory card. I have the 40D and this comes really close to beating it. The 40D is very similar in terms of quality to this, and you can get some very nice shots out of it, but at a much lower price. If you want a high quality digital camera that won't break the bank - this is it.   Overall, a fantastic camera that gives you great images and great quality!  ,  Steve   Amazing digital camera!!   I have owned the Olympus MZ-W1 for over a year and have been very impressed.  .   the body is small and light (about 5oz) and very durable. It shoots extremely high quality images with great detail. I am using the Olympus 60D with it, which is a similar size to the MZ, however the images are quite grainy. The zoom range is extremely good. The menu system is easy to use and has everything you may need for a great digital camera.  - I have not yet tried the video capabilities, but I imagine that is the same.   is this camera a must have?   My wife has had this camera for about a year now and we love it. I took her to a wedding a week ago and took a couple of video clips of the event. I shot the video on my m4 and the clip is amazing. I used the zoom on the camera at about 2.5 to 4x so that the detail is great in the frame. It is a great video clip and is going to be on the album for my family and I to look back at in a few months.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________ I bought this as a replacement for my sony. the only reason I bought it was because the sony one had a big black spot on it. Well the monitor and the screen is still pretty clean. The only thing i would say is that when i plugged in the USB it says the charger is out and that is why the screen came out. But when i plug in the usb it is fine now. My only real problem is with the cable and the back of the unit where it connects to the monitor. It is just a little loose and it doesn't work as well as it should. I do like the monitor though, it is super bright and clear. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Excellent, but be careful. by Robert H from San Antonio, TX on May 20, 2018 I purchased the screen monitor to replace the broken one I had from a tv, so I was concerned about the backlight. The monitor is great though, the black screen is less of a problem than the old screen. The quality of the image, and the fact that it has a back light and doesn't have to be plugged into an outlet is great. ______________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** I was skeptical to get the TRS-80 Model I because I'm a purist. I like to do the programming by hand in my own editor, because of my love of typing, and my distaste for software. But after seeing how good it is, and how easy it is to work with, I've come to love it. I don't care if you just want it to play sounds or if you want it send emails to the outside world (I have neither), this is a great device and the best for this price range. You get the sounds you're after, like the "shaky" siren or the "crackling" buzzer, or maybe you want some cool graphics or some "music" to play on it, and it does it, in great quality. I had it for about two weeks, and so far, it's held up great, so far I haven't had to fix it. It's been great, and I'm looking forward to when I can upgrade. It works, and this is the best thing you can buy for $25. (And that's being kind.)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am really satisfied with the new D-series keyboard. It's not only very comfortable to use, it's very fast. Very easy to learn. Very good quality and I'm very impressed by the price. I use it for my phone and desktop computer. The D-50 is a good buy  Write a negative review about the product:  The keyboard was very poorly constructed for the money paid. The keys are quite flat and are easily bent. This means that typing is awkward, and the keys are very hard to press. Also, I found the keys very slippery when typing on it because of the hard-plastic membrane. The switches are very loud and require a lot of force to register. I do not like the rubber feet for the bottom of the keyboard, but it is only an aesthetic design and not a practical concern.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have to admit that I've been looking for this product for ages. I've found that I have a small obsession with having things on the web for my dog. I was looking for a dog collar, and I found this at a reasonable price. I put it on a dog that I had taken home from rescue and she is fine. The quality is better than I had expected, the colors are a little brighter than I thought they'd be, and it makes a great gift. The only thing I don't care for is that the strap is too long and pulls down on the dog's throat, but it can easily be fixed with a different strap (and maybe a little practice). I'm happy I found it at such a good price, and the dog collar works really well with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used the LENR machine for the past week and it's amazing and fun. It's like having a giant blow torch that you can control in your pocket (I'm really impressed).   The fact that it has a blow torch and that you get it set up and ready in under 5 minutes makes this machine awesome. My favorite feature is the ability to adjust the temp at which it will work for different materials. I'm currently using it to make gold and silver alloys at 350 degrees, I'm pretty amazed at how well this thing works.   I was also able to use this machine in a big project I was doing and the results were great. I can't wait to use it again and I'm going to buy the gold and platinum one next as I don't see myself using aluminum for anything (but it looks cool to use).   was really impressed with this machine. I've used it for the last week and I haven't been disappointed once. My dad has his own one and he says that you really have to have the experience to use them. The guy who worked on mine said the same thing (I think his name was John), so there you go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this as a USB stick for transferring my pictures from my desktop. This thing works perfectly. If you have a large amount of pictures, it may be a bit slow and take a while, but it works.    Good buy:  I have a bunch of these. I use them as backup drives and to transfer large amounts of data from computer to computer.  The only thing I don't like about them is the fact that they are so bulky. But it doesn't bother me because I can use them in a car without worrying about having to take them out and set them down in the car seats.  Does not work for me:  This thing is terrible. I used this to backup my camera so I could go to the park and grab my camera. But when I got home, it would not transfer photos. And it was not working with my iPhone so I couldn't save them or view them. It did not work with my laptop either. And when I went to try and transfer my data back to my PC, the laptop wouldn't let it. I could get this thing to work fine with my PC (I have a Toshiba T400, but I have since upgraded to a Toshibox T100), but it wasn't a fun experience. I wish the device was made with less weight.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone6s Plus works with my iphones and ipods. When I bought this I expected it to have the full features of my ia or iphony. Instead, it works like a charm. it works with ios 6 so that you do not have to keep the iphons in the case, which you can only do when the ios is not in use. you have your iphon with you when you want it, but it does not get in the way of anything, so you can go about your business without it. It will work with the ipods as well as the ios 6s as well. I love the fact that I dont have to deal with batteries when I go out and I can just keep my ipods and iphonics in the cases for when I need to talk to someone. I would recomend this item to everyone

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I have owned this product for 3 months and it has been a great investment in my home. It has been very quiet and extremely portable. I have taken this thing outside for work where my other AC units were too loud. I also had my kids playing in the front yard with it and no problems. The only thing I don't like about it is the plastic that you get with it. The buttons are very hard to turn and have to be pressed hard. I can only imagine what the ones you get in the store are like. It's not a problem, just a little irritating. The best thing about this unit is how it can be connected to any appliance. You can connect it to your AC unit, microwave, toaster, etc. It can also be hooked up to your computer or to a set of speakers. It is really easy to install, plug it in, and use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus-m10r  I really like my klikar m10r. It has a very good sound quality and really is the best for a mid-range digital music player.  Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device and get a refund: KG Audio  The KG is a great portable turntable. The sound quality is really good for what it is. But the KG doesn't have a removable battery, which is what makes it so much better than the m10. The KG's speakers are also a bit weak, but that's not too big a deal in the grand scheme of things. If you really want a solid, well built, mid-fi audio player, I recommend the m3.  the KF2500 was a great value. It sounds and plays great. You get great bass response, the highs are pretty good, and the lows are clean. The only thing I would change is that I like to have the volume on the higher setting. -Troy
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit came in good time and in a great condition. The instructions are easy to read. The software is a bit complicated for first timers, but once you get the hang of it it is pretty simple. The unit came with 4 channels and there are a few additional channels you can add. This gives you a lot of flexibility. This device works great with the HDHomeRun service and is pretty cool that you can even watch DVR. The app for the device is very good and easy to navigate, with no need for many setup programs and lots of settings.

She got really sleepy and didn't know where to find the buttons to go to sleep. I bought two because i was going to get her the second one, she didn't realize the difference, but then i told her it had the "brightness" feature on it so she could read in the dark. Well that was when i saw how much it was saving her, she gets so tired after being in her crib for 12 hours.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a great toy. It is not just a vibrator, it's more than that. This toy has it all. Great vibes, a vibe that goes up and down in pulses. The vibe can go on and on and it is powerful enough to go on a long time, but can be controlled with the included wand which is great for those of us who like to be on the bottom. The clit stimulator is great. It's strong enough to get me off and it's strong but not strong enough or strong enough. So I keep using it but when I want to be pushed over the edge I can. And for those that have been looking for a vibrating dildo to give them that full sensation, this is it! The silicone is so nice and feels smooth in the palm of my hand. When the vibes are on and the clitoral stimulator on, the vibe vibrates so well you can really feel the difference, you can even feel the vibrations against your clit and g spot. It really does make that feeling really good and I recommend it for anyone looking for that deep feeling orgasm. I use the vibrators for both, the clitoris stimulator and the g spot stimulator. I have a few vibrating sex toys but this one by far is my favorite and I will most likely have it for a long long time. I think its amazing that its rechargeable and also its waterproof. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.......................................   Great unit, great price. I wanted something to do all of my voice recorder functions. No more mic cords, no more audio cables. I went from my Zoom H2 recorder to this and it is perfect. Easy to use. Great sounding. My friend who has a Sony MEX-BT is amazed how little he has to invest now to go from an audio recorder to a Sony A7RII with all the added features. So much more for less money.  -James M.   I just recently upgraded my Sony A6000 with the 5.1 channel mic. It works GREAT. I could not be happier with it.    -Ryan T.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device because my friend asked me to. It is very quiet and works great. The only down side is that when you move the speaker back and forth you have to shake the device because the buttons are too sensitive to the touch to move smoothly.   Have not found an electronic device that is quiet, strong and powerful enough for audio and it's great.  I am very happy with the quality of sound coming from this unit, I purchased it to use at my office with speakers that are just loud enough that I can hear the phone and my partner talking at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! It's great. I haven't used it in the house for a long time and I was a bit worried that it wouldn't be functional. It is. I can easily control my electric things from my phone. My phone even gives me alerts when I'm about to leave the house or go out at night and my electric lights turn off when I come in. The buttons are very precise and my daughter loves it! I've been trying to get a touch screen phone for about a year now and I've found out that it will cost me twice as much. This phone is awesome.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned it for 2 years now and has been extremely reliable and very little fuss. the first thing i got was a usb charger but i soon got a usb cord and now i use the usb cord for the usb c cable and the micro usb cord to charge my ipod or ipad. it charges the ipod in 30 seconds with the cord. when i bought the ipad the charger for the ipads was much cheaper than what was on the ipaq. the micro USB power cord is cheap but has a plug at the end and i just slip it over my laptop and use it as a usb extension cord to the ipax.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the G500 when I needed a new keyboard. I really like the design and function. I bought it with the old keyboard in mind, since it is made from a hard plastic, which is not as great of a keyboard. The new keyboard works very well. The keyboard is very smooth and is very responsive to my touch. It's easy to type on.   The G500 has a battery that lasts a long time, even after using my laptop for hours. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!! This little device is amazing. I can use it to store all my favorite music and pictures and the battery only lasts about a month and a half on a full charge. That's it, a week or so. It does take a lot of time to read the music that you like, which is why I bought it in the first place. I do a lot more work than I ever expected to do and this is great for that. If you want to do more than just play music or watch movies you should consider this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first guitar. Bought the gx15 a couple of years ago. The first few years I used it on the guitar it worked fine. Then it got really warm and after a few months, I was wondering if it was dead. That's when I bought the gxt15. I love it. Great feel and looks. Great sound too. I recommend this to any guitarist that has a cheap guitar.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was a bit hesitant to buy this product since my Samsung is a few years old and the remote control is just not that accurate. It took me about a year of messing around to learn to use it properly. But when I did it was great, very easy to set up. I just hope that the software is updated to get more accurate, but I will continue to use the remote until it is. It's just that good!  Great purchase!  This product was very easy install and works great  Amazing  I bought this at the beginning of the year for my Xbox one and it has done very well.  Fantastic  It's a great product that does what it says it will do, but the only thing that i wish would be added is a second screen. The app gives the user full control of the console and all their games, it's just not as clear as it should be. It would have been great to have the same function of a second set of controls on the second screen, but other than that it is a great console for the price and worth every penny!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikmohk im really impressed with this product. I have to say this is the best value for money out there. I was just wondering what the difference was between the mics I was buying before and after i used the kd530. Im just wondering why people with decent equipment can't get a good quality kd5xx.  Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars.  The product was just what I wanted. The audio quality is great. The USB port is perfect for my laptop. The product arrived in the time frame promised.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own one of these and I absolutely love it. It has a really nice sound that is crisp and clear. I have an older laptop with the same model, and I couldn't wait to switch over, because of the sound quality. I'm really happy that I did.   I use the laptop with one of my older speakers that I had laying around. My sound system in that laptop sucks. I can't believe that I was able to use my laptop with this thing. I do wish that this came with a mic, but that's what a quality product should do for you.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I received a very good and reliable unit about a month ago. I used a computer monitor and had to use a HDMI cable to get a decent image (for a first time). The unit has an LCD that gives clear images. It has a lot of features, as I read in the instructions. I only have to set the screen resolution to 1024x768, it then works like a charm. If I were going to buy another monitor for this unit, it would have to be a 1080P. I think I am going to try a different screen.  Write a negative review about the product:  The unit I bought is junk! It does not work and is completely broken! I went to my local electronics store, and they told me there are over 300 other brand TVs that work just as good. It should have been a warning!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   i was in desperate need of a new ipod, but had no money to buy one! after searching for the ipod all over the web i found this one at my local Walmart on sale for only $10, i took the deal and ordered it from walmart and it arrived in 5 days with no issues!  I have been using my ipod for several years now and its never failed me. It's compact, easy to use and the battery life is amazing! I dont know what happened to my other ipods but this one works great for me and so does my mp3 player  Write a negative review about the same thing:   's  If you're looking for the latest and greatest, this isn't it. This is one of the more overpriced products in this entire range. I really can't fault the design. It does exactly what it says, but for the price you can't expect anything more. I purchased 2 of these so far, and they both failed after a couple of weeks. I've been using mine to listen to my mp1 as well as a few songs on my ipad. I have no idea why my first one failed, but the second one did not.  The sound quality, even with my i iPod, is not as good as i would expect. I would not recommend.  have been very pleased with the products   the best i have used  This device is pretty nice, but it does have a bad side. It gets very hot. I run a computer with a lot of processing power under this device and it gets pretty hot. If you really want a quality portable device, you're better off with a good one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   - Excellent battery life! I was going to replace my 3 cell flashlight with this but decided to use the batteries from an old flashlight. After one month of using the old batteries I can tell you that this thing is fantastic. I've been using mine for almost a month and it has already made the most of my old batteries. I'm not sure how much longer it can last on the same ones I'm using now.  In addition to the battery life, this product is a great price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The USB cord is very good quality. The only thing I don't like is the USB port does not get a full charge from the wall and it comes out of the wall with about 10% of the power left. I know I can charge my laptop by plugging it into the wall, but this is what happens with the USB cord. My laptop gets to about 90% capacity in about 3 hours and the charger will not keep it going. You need a full hour to fully charge a 15 year old laptop. If it didn't come with a usb cable it would have been perfect.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace my last one. The light that illuminates when the device is off is very bright, and is also very easy to adjust. There is also a slight delay in the light when it is on, but it isnt too bad, just noticeable.   As for the screen, it's really nice, not super bright or eye candy, but good enough for an everyday use. I like that it does not display "sensors" or any kind of information, and the icons are also very small.  My only complaint is that I have yet to find a way to change the colors in the notification bar.  All in all I really like my new screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this amp to use in a digital guitar that was set up to make it easier to play. I have used several analog devices but was dissatisfied with the quality and the sound that I heard from them. I am a musician and not a pro and I had to adjust my system to make my guitar sound better. I decided to try this amp and I LOVE IT! You can feel the bass with the volume knob, the sound is amazing, the tone is clear, the low end is punchy and the highs are rich! I was looking for something that was clean but with some punch and it delivers that! I am very happy with it.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for almost a month now and it has been awesome i do use it on my tv but i dont use it to watch videos cause i watch sports with my phone so this is great i like that there are 4 buttons on it so i dont have to push a lot of buttons to turn it on i love that its a big screen but not as big as my tv. i only wish it had a little more battery life i mean it has a screen that is 4 inches and a lot bigger than my tv and its batteries only last a few days but i have 2x9 inch laptops that last forever just because they have a big battery it would be nice to have one that could last 4 hours and still have a good screen. ive given it 4 stars for now. i dont get to see the battery life till its used on tv cause i cant watch sports on my phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I have been using the JH1+ for a couple of months now. It has been a great value. I have a 3 year old PC that is not running well anymore, and wanted a computer that would be able to do many things I would not have been able to without. I wanted an upgrade but could not find one on my budget. I searched the internet and found that this thing would fit my needs. It was a good price and I could not believe that this is a great product. I use it every day, it saves me a lot of time. I would highly recommend this device to everyone who wants to have a computer in their home. It is easy to connect to any type of network. The only thing I would add is that there is an instruction manual but I did not need to look up anything. I purchased a new modem as well and now it works perfectly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I am so happy I bought this and was a little bit disappointed it came with 3 batteries which i am very disappointed with as I don't even need that much power. But the device itself is great and for the price you can't go wrong with this device. I was able to connect to my ipad in under an hour and has been very fast. I also like how you can turn the light on and off with a switch on the back. I am now using it as my cell phone for video chats as well. It also has a power switch on top of the device for changing modes or to use the light when you are in a dark room. It's great for use in the dark as well!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first computer was an Apple II. It was very powerful but limited. I could write a paper on it in an hour. The Apple IIc had no floppy drive, no monitor, and only 16K of memory. The computer was good but expensive. The IBM PC could do almost all the things that an Apple could do, but at much cheaper prices and much faster.   It was great!   I wanted to get an IBM PC but was not able to.    When I heard about the Apple IIe I was very excited.  When I got mine, I immediately put it together and used it immediately. It came with a keyboard and monitor.  I read that it had a modem so I used that for mail and the telephone system, and it did not disappoint. I did get it up to date on all the software and software support that it did have.  It did not have a screen but I was able to connect it to a modem and set it up as an Apple.  For $400, it was an excellent bargain and is still my computer today. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants an easy computer and doesn't want to spend any money.

It is a great little device and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product  Great product! Great purchase!  Reviewer: John S.  My wife and I recently bought the Bluetooth speaker for our car. We use it daily at work, for music. It has great sound and we really like the remote. I would recommend this product. : )  If you are looking for an awesome portable Bluetooth speaker, this is the one to get, I do have one issue, it is not waterproof (the box says it is) so the sound will be compromised by rain or splashing water. So be aware of that. But otherwise, it's great! I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this speaker, and the customer service was great. So all in all, I'm very happy with this purchase. It will be used daily for the foreseeable future, it does come with a good variety of songs. I highly recommend this!  and you can't beat the price! 's review  This speaker is great. I do like having the option of a Bluetooth remote.  be aware that the remote does not have any buttons and it is just for the speaker itself. If you want to get any music with the remote, it requires your iPad to be connected to the speaker. The speaker comes with two AAA batteries, they work well. The sound quality is good, and it does the job for the price.  for the money, you can not beat it  and I like that it is waterproof!  of course, it comes with 3 AAA batteries. it's perfect!  the sound is good! The remote is great! , they're great!!  the sound is very clear and there's a nice sound. its easy to use and its great to keep my iPad in the car, if i get any rain it just sits there. I really like this. It's a small and lightweight device. .    great
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first foray into vaping. I purchased this because my previous experience with the Pax had been really poor and the Pax 2 was a step up. The Pax 2 had a very high voltage and required very intense resistance to get a good vapor. I've read that the Triton is slightly less aggressive. I use a single 18650 battery and a single.5 ohm coil. I was happy with my first taste from the T1 and was eager to try the T2. I started out with a flavor that wasn't the best I've had, but has improved since. This is my first box mod and I haven't had any problems so far. I do plan on upgrading to a box mod eventually.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great gadget  by Michael in Los Angeles, CA on May 26, 2015  This device is awesome. I have to get it to play at my high school, it plays great. My kids love it, I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can easily plug in a 4 foot extension cord from my car to it and it still works perfectly...I love that it works over USB....   It's also very small and easy to carry, I just wanted something I could put under my desk when my laptop is away.   The only issue I had is that I noticed a light flickering when I did a power cycle. I could have easily fixed it with a battery swap but my first thought was to make sure the power supply was not getting too hot. I then noticed that the power switch was off so I went ahead and replaced it.   in all i'm very happy with it and would buy it again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great product I bought this after I bought the PSA, it was my first purchase from JVC and I'm really glad I did!   Would I recommend this to a friend: Yes I would recommend this product to a friendly person who loves his JVC digital camera. The quality of the images captured with this camera is awesome, even though it's a very slow camera.  Did you find this helpful?  (No Ratings Yet)  View All Customer Reviews
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These things are a life saver when it comes to working with high voltage. They are just the right size to fit in the hand, and their solid design really helps reduce stress on the hand. The power switch is a bit of a pain to work with, but once you figure out where to turn it, the power on/off cycle is a breeze. Overall, an excellent product at a very reasonable price. It is just a shame that they didn't put an indicator light on it or something on the label!  The best: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* My wife and I really enjoy the iPad and it works very well for our needs. The only thing that is really hard is to find the right size. The 12" is a great size, I would definitely recommend that one to anyone. **********
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a second hand computer after being disappointed with a previous one. I couldn't wait to get my hands on a Mac. This device came in the post and it was as simple as it can be, as there are no bells and whistles. I have the latest version of OS X and it runs amazingly. I love it so much I bought a bigger one for my other computer which I will be using with Windows 7 and 8. I hope to be buying more from Amazon in the future. Thanks to Amazon you don't even have to wait for a shipment to be shipped to you. You get them delivered to you right away. I'm glad I chose this website to buy these. It's a pleasure to work with and great quality products.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent radio for the price.  The main problem is that this item has a 2 year warranty.    I'm currently using an HP P5 for about 5 years.  In that time, I have put about 100 hours of time into the device.  I can't believe I'm using a brand new HP, but I guess it does pay off.  It is a joy to use.  You just never know what you will hear.  The quality of the radio is first rate.  Even the antenna is very good quality.    Posted by William B. at 9:22 PM No comments:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good product, the only thing I can say is that when you turn off the device it has to be done with a little care to avoid the cables and cords of the cable getting damaged. The best thing about this product is that it is a very low power device so when you do use it you can turn it off just to save the battery.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this product a few weeks ago. I like it very much. I have it on a desk. It is very useful. I used it to read my magazines and news. The battery lasts a long time.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device :  It was the most expensive electronic I ever had. The screen was very small, and it was always very hard to see anything. I returned it, and bought another model from another seller.  the screen was smaller, and the battery lasted longer, but it also had some weird, very flimsy magnets which would snap and come apart at the bottom of the case. I don't trust them. I also have to reorder a new battery. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just wanted to say a few words about the i2C port. The unit is so small that you can easily slip it into your existing iPhone case and not worry about breaking it. I've already replaced two of my iPhone 5 units with it and have only had it a few days and I've seen the most amazing things! So happy I bought this!   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second i am using for my car stereo. It works perfect and very fast.  I bought the dongle and got the CD-RW drive with a 4.5x slot as I don't have enough room for a CD. 's a little bit heavy. I bought the 9v battery, and i don't need an AC adapter, it can work on 110V only. . If it is too heavy, just plug it into an outlet and then use an adapter for the AC power, but for me i find this one lighter than the others. , But it is a little heavy for a car stereos CD.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very easy to set up. No issues at all. If i had it again i'd try the wifi as well.  My son has had this baby monitor for almost a month and so far it has been absolutely perfect.    Great product! Was this review helpful to you? Yes No  By Brian on July 29, 2018 Was this Review Helpful to you at all: Yes  Great monitor! By Michael on July 21, 2018  Product: The Baby-Mama  Pros: Easy to set it up  Cons:  Comments: The quality of this baby-mama monitor is excellent and I have had a great experience with it. -Great for newborns, toddlers, and teenagers.  to get it to connect to the internet it is necessary to plug in an usb power adapter. If you need it to be connected to the baby-mommy and its a wired device its a great idea to use a 5v USB adapter.  in this review I am going to go over the cons and what is wrong with them.   1. The monitor appears to not work with a laptop computer but will with a mac. There are two different versions of the monitor.   this particular version has a screen that has a lot of lag when scrolling so in my opinion you need to be careful how you set the device up   2. The power cord is too short to use the monitor with a corded power outlet. You will need a longer cord to plug into the wall.  The unit itself is a tad heavy but its a baby-computer. ,the weight was not a problem with me, but if you are using it with a wall adapter it would be more than sufficient. This monitor is really great to have when you want to monitor your babies sleep.  and this is what I got for only $25.00  the reason i got this monitor is because i want to be sure my baby does not fall asleep on the floor or while lying on my bed.  is a great product to have if your new to electronics  Overall, the baby monitor worked great! Was it helpful to that person? Yes / No  that was a good device. it is easy to use.  ,is easy to plug and unplug and works great.  that is what i got the monitor for and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.   it is very heavy
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the most advanced digital camera I have ever owned. I am amazed at the quality of image I am getting with this camera. The images are clear and well framed. I have a Nikon D3100 and this camera does it a lot better. The ability to do time lapse images is a great tool for photographers. I use my camera a lot and this one is easily the best. You can control every aspect of this camera from the pictures to settings. It is amazing to say the least. My friend who has a Canon digital camera tells me how he can't tell the difference between this and a DSLR camera and has to use this one all the time. He is an avid photographer. I hope you find this a good purchase. It's a bargain. You get what you pay for and that is very important. You'll be so impressed at what you get.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent Value This camera has all the features you could want and is a wonderful quality digital camera with the capability to be operated in the field or with your tripod. The build quality is excellent and the images you get with this product are extremely sharp, crisp, and beautiful. It takes great pictures in low light situations with the automatic features. You will also get lots of additional features that are not obvious at first, but they are there and make this a really great camera. If you are thinking about purchasing this camera, get it. You won't regret it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Amazing I was looking for a good way to control my speakers and I wanted something that was easy to use. After reading reviews, I decided to buy this and I am extremely happy I did. I have the ability to control all of my devices from my iPhone without having to plug into a USB cable. I use this to control the speakers in my home theater and also my home automation system. It is easy to set up, the volume works great and I've found that it is very quiet.   I am a professional sound person so I have used other products and this is by far the best and quietest sound system I've used!   Excellent product and very easy to program. Would recommend to anyone. I've had mine for a few weeks and it is working flawlessly.     This is a very good product. It takes only a few minutes to set it up and it's very very quiet with the remote.  : )   Great Product I have been wanting an iPhone remote control to control our home theater. After a couple of years of using multiple remote devices I was frustrated with the poor quality and the many different settings to change. I was also disappointed with the many apps and plugins that are available. This new remote works well, and with the software that is available on the App store it only gets better.  -Barry

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this because my iphone doesn't work well with my computer. It works for about 5 to 10 minutes, then it just shuts off and you have to restart the computer. So I got this to use with my PC, since I have a Mac and I just need to use my phone when I'm at work. I'm glad I got it.  My problem was that my phone got disconnected from the computer so I had to manually start it from my phone. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  The best thing about this is that you can take it on vacation to enjoy its silent and quiet.  I don't know why people don't upgrade this. It's amazing. It is so quiet and is very compact, even bigger then my Sony NEX-7. I use the E-M5 for video and use it to take video with my Sony A7R II and the EOS 5D Mark IV and now I have the E3100 which I use for video only now. Now I don't have to worry about the camera overheating and I have a lot more room to work with. I like this camera and can't get enough of it.   Was this review helpful? Yes No Report abuse
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! It's amazing!!!! I don't use it for the first hour. The best thing about it!!!! is that!!!! there is no charge for the battery anymore. I used to need to charge my phone every night because it was draining so fast. I can use this charger for my!!!! iMac!!!! and!!!!!!!! MacBook Air!!!! Now!!!! my Macbook Air!!! will last longer. I also bought a 3D Touch on my!!!!!!! Samsung!!!! Tablet!!!! So!!!! This is the best charger!!!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!This is the BEST I've ever owned, I've had it since Oct 2009.I use the wireless controller to control my TV, Sound System, CD Player, and even play my guitar with the onboard guitar pedal. I love the sound and sound control on this. It is so good it's amazing!The sound is great. I use a Yamaha receiver and it sounds fantastic. I think if I had this when I was a kid I would have bought it because it sounds so good I don't want to turn it off. I have it on my tv for the entire day now and it gets my kids addicted to playing on the tv and it's only $100! The buttons on the controller are easy to use, you can move the buttons around easily. It took me a couple of months of playing on it and I am very happy with it. Thanks for making it so affordable.  Write a negative review about poor quality:    The problem is that there is not enough light to see and work, the buttons don't have enough feel, the controller is not very sturdy and the buttons get too hot. I would not recommend this product.  (June 23, 2014)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it for about 2 months now and its still working flawlessly! I was looking to upgrade my mp3 player and wanted something that was smaller and lighter so this fit the bill. You cant beat the price. I use it on all of my portable media devices and it works flawlessly. I would recommend it to anyone!  This is a great unit. Works well. It is small and does the job very well. The only con would be that it is not a full size unit. It measures 11 x 6 x 5 inches but you have to be really careful when you are carrying it. It does work on my Dell laptop.  Just got my unit today! The first thing I did was plug it into my Dell Mini 15. I am pretty sure that the mini dongle that came with it will not work with it (I assume the mini-usb connector will). Also, I tried to change my battery, which is located under the battery in the case. I ended up removing the battery and placing it in another case, but the battery was only rated for about 4 to 5 hours (which I have, so not bad for 2 days' worth of use). The unit is small, but it functions, so I am very satisfied!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!   I am very satisfied with this little unit. I have several of the "big brother" models and they are all great. My kids have gotten into using the iPads and the kids in the grade below my own have taken to the iPads as well. The only thing I don't like about the iPad is that it comes in two versions of size, a tiny little 2" and a big 5" tablet. We have had both of these and I keep the 2" for the small kids. The 5" is for the large kids. You can't go wrong.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I bought this to replace my old iPhone, I was so happy to finally be able to run all my favorite apps and movies from my iPhone using a USB connection. My old one was very bulky but this one works great! I do have an iPod that I use all the time for music, videos, and games, however the usb connection to that would never have worked as well as the mtvu 4th gen. The sound quality is fantastic, and the battery is a huge plus, with the 5 hour battery I have no worries of charging it once. The only drawback is the size, it just makes me a little uncomfortable to be able use one on the go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! My computer is now much more stable with the computer mouse. Great product.  Have not had a chance to review yet, but am looking forward to it!  Great for a novice: My wife, who is a bit on the lazy side, has been using a wireless mouse for many years. I bought one for myself and it worked great. I didn't think about the quality at all, although I was very pleased with it. But I have now bought several more, one for each of our kids and also for myself. Great value for money, even though the packaging is somewhat basic and the mouse has a little rubber bump at the top of it that sticks out of the bottom of the case. . The wireless mouse worked great for both my wife and myself. I have not tried the wireless mouse included with the mouse pad, but I imagine it will work great as well. As you might imagine, it's a very good value for a mouse and I'm glad I bought them.  is just awesome, I love it  Love it : I love my new wireless mouse. It is very light and compact. It works really well for gaming.    Works great, but it doesn't come with a cable : I tried the mouse for about an hour and it did not work in game because my mouse did not have the right cable for it. I purchased an extender cable but after I got it, I saw that it was a little too short to fit the extender in the mouse. That means the extenders is too short, I cannot use it. So I guess it needs some other extender. Also it's very short, there is no place to put it on my desk. It doesn't look like it's going to be too comfortable to use, also it is not light as I hoped it would be.   This is my first wireless mouse that is wireless. The mouse has everything I was looking for. It has nice lights. Its small enough to fit in a bag. I really like that the mouse comes with extra wires for extension.  . This is a great product and I am glad I got mine. The price is right and I will be using this mouse for a long time to come. I use this mouse with my X-wing, TIE fighter and Star Wars Battlefront.     Perfect for gaming: Great purchase, fast delivery and it works flawlessly. My first wireless gaming mouse
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________I bought the first model of the RAVEN 4G LTE as an upgrade to my previous smartphone and it was absolutely flawless, it was fast, reliable and the screen was very clear.

I only wish that it came with an external battery but that is not much of a problem.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm amazed at how much the EOS 70D has improved over the other digital SLRs I own. If you need a nice piece of camera glass for portraits and landscapes, and the build quality is exceptional, there is no reason to go anywhere else. (Posted on 7/3/2016)  Great Buy! Review by Mike Quality Value Price This is the third EOS EOS camera that I have owned in the last three years and I am very impressed. The lens is excellent and the quality of images produced are amazing. I am not in any hurry to buy a second body to match the 70D. The image quality for such a small camera is amazing and you can't ask for more. I'm really looking forward to getting my 70D and the next few lenses in to compare the performance. I also highly recommend this lens for use on the 70d. ( Posted on 4/27/2016 )  LOW REVIEWS! Review of a GREAT camera with a BAD review by David Quality Value Rating This is my first camera, so I didn't get to use the excellent menu system that Canon's has, and I had my doubts about the 70-200 f/2.8 zoom. I tried it and it is a very good, very sharp lens. My other reviews seem to be based on other people's opinion. (I'm not a member of the 70DX forum)   I've never had a problem with the camera and the lens and the camera is easy to use. I do feel, however, that the 70 D is a bit overpriced compared to Canon's comparable cameras.   One thing is for sure, I'll continue to buy Canon products for my SLRs. I love the 70DS and the 70LTS for travel, the 10D is a great workhorse, but there are many alternatives that are better in my opinion.  . ( Added on 5/16/2016: I recently purchased a Canon EOS-1D X Mark II. I just received it this week and I've been taking pictures with it since I received it on Sunday and I'm very pleased with it. I've only been using it for a few hours, but so far I'm quite satisfied with the image quality, and it's been a joy to use because of the ease and convenience of the controls and the quick image transfer process. I have only been shooting with it at ISO 1600 for the time being

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use the MIXA-FX with the IMA3 board, and the signal output is pretty good. It does have a limited range, and will likely lose signal if placed in front of a metal box or a hardwired wall-wart, but it is still an improvement over the I-MIDI interface I had before. I'm able to add the I2S interface I use to make my A-D converters to this, allowing me to connect all my analog gear, with full sync, to my computer. It is an ideal solution for me, as I don't have any of my gear attached to a wall-wiring. The only problem is it has a 5V line, which is just not enough for the I'm using in my system, so I always have to get my 5V supply from the mixer itself. The mixer can't output more than 10V, which makes it a little problematic.  All of this is a minor annoyance in my case, as the output quality is really good, and there are only a few cables to attach, including a USB cable. It really is a good product. Read full review

I like that I can use it as a "lighter" by holding it under my chin or behind my neck while smoking. . I do need to buy an additional charger for this as it won't charge without it. -I am not impressed with how it looks. It's kind of ugly. If you're looking for something with a modern look, this probably isn't for you. I think the light and design could be a lot better. I would recommend getting the light attachment, but I'd love to see a larger battery with the added light attachment.  with some good care, the light can last a good while and you will get at least one extra battery.  is a very nice and sleek design. I just wish that the light wouldn't glow so bright. It only lasts about 10-15 minutes on the first charge. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the price is a little too high for the battery life and the design is a bit ugly. I'm hoping in the future to see better battery life.

It's easy to connect to my iPhone and makes it so easy to stay in touch with my family and work. The resolution is great and very clear. It works really well and i haven't found any glitches. I use it at work for an IT department and it's great. I have had the display for a few weeks and i couldn't be more pleased with it.  First review: Works well and looks good. Great picture.   My only problem: I think I need to get a new one or two of these. I can't keep my old one on the wall because of my kids and their room. And the new ones are hard to see on the walls.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________________ I purchased this as a "toys" item for a couple of young children. They were impressed and are using the sound and vibration. It is also good for the elderly as a bedside alarm. It would not run as fast or as loud as it did on the first run, but it is much quieter and more comfortable. It seems well built and it will last a lifetime if you care for it. The vibration is good and it is adjustable. It should last the life of the device as well. It takes 2 AA batteries, 2 AA adapter plugs, and 2 AA cell holders. I have used other alarms and I do not believe they can come close to this in noise reduction and power to weight ratio. I am very satisfied with the purchase and am a satisfied owner!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this for over a year and it is still working fine. The only thing I would like to see improved is the ability to get the voltage up to 1.5 volts more quickly, it doesn't even take 2 hours on a regular 2 amp load to get 1.2 volts.  I am using this to get all my my 12 volt battery supplies to work with my Efest 12v3.2 and 12v5.1 and all seems to work fine.  is has been a great purchase  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, May 26, 2015  By Tim from Lakeland FL USA  Review: This adapter is an absolute must for powering 12 volt batteries. I bought the 10A adapter for my Energizer 12 volt rechargeable battery and the 20A adapter to power my e-cigarette. With all three adapters plugged in, the battery stays charged for at least 48 hours (plus and extra day) if I let it stay plugged in overnight. You can use it in any location where you can run a circuit. It will not drain your battery unless you use too many amps and it's very easy to adjust how fast it runs the circuit and if you need to turn off the charge during a power outage.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this device because I had been having problems with my old one, and I thought it would do a better job of providing clear audio and better resolution, plus the sound is clearer than my old receiver. It does the trick!! The only downside is that there is no mute button, you have to push the mute button on the left side of the receiver to shut the speakers off. I am currently using it with a Yamaha XB-M3-2 digital keyboard.  I bought this item as an alternative to my old TV which is the one with the built in DVD player. After I bought the receiver, I had to get another receiver, then I moved on to the Sony XAV-W3000. It is a very nice receiver, however there are many choices of components, you will need to make the decision based on your preferences and equipment requirements. I recommend this item highly. . The sound quality is superb and it does not lag or stutter when playing DVDs. I have had this unit for about two years and I love it. It can easily replace my old, noisy receiver and it also can do the job of my original receiver. I would recommend this product. - A lot of things are better and even better than a new TV.

I also purchased another set to use with my other electronic devices and they work great! Thanks! I also would recommend this product to others.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Iphone 4S. This is a new device and it is a big improvement in many ways. The phone has so much more power and has a better screen than any of my previous models. I can only imagine the battery life will be great. I have always been an Iphone user because of my old phones and I really enjoy my new device. My phone is more powerful than my old Iphone. My friends all have the new Iphone so far and they are all saying how nice and crisp it is. My old iPhone 4S was great but this is better. And my friend has it for over a year and it still has the battery and screen from the day it was purchased. Great company, great service, great products. And the price is excellent. They are all great and I can't wait for more great things to come out for the next generation. This Iphone will be in my phone collection from now on. I'd also recommend the Iphone 5 and 5s if you don't mind your phone not having a case. I really like the new software and overall performance.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the most useful piece of gadget I own and I use it for music and video in my house. I am a musician and use this to sync a microphone and a recorder.   It works great and if you're trying to sync recordings with a computer you don't want to spend a lot of money you will be very satisfied with this unit   What I like about this device:  It is easy to use. I'm not sure why the people who made this device didn't add a USB port in the center to make it easier to sync up. It can get a little annoying when you have to connect two different devices to each other.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my tablet for reading and the battery lasts long. When I went to buy this device a few months ago, I decided I was going to get one that had a screen protector since that's what was advertised. I am so glad that I went with a better quality one. It doesn't make it impossible to handle the device. Posted by mike at 3:15 PM This is the third I've owned for this type of work and I can't find a thing to fault. The quality is superb and it has been working perfectly. No issues. The weight and size are perfect. I can hardly wait to order another. The price is unbeatable. And, at this price you can't expect much better. This is the perfect item for any type of electronic project. If your looking for a high quality portable that will last and you can easily carry to the job site, you should definitely give this a try. Reviewed by David at 5:25 AM I bought this in May 2010 and still use it as my sole PC for gaming and development. It has served me well. I run X-Plane and all my other games on it. There are two versions, one is with the screen protector and the other without. I just ordered the one without. The screen protector does add about 3-5 ounces to the weight, but I like how lightweight it is. The other reviewers have noted the fact that there is a "screen flex" on the bottom of the tablet, but mine doesn't. It's just a bit of roughness and it doesn't affect the use of the device at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have several of these, and they work fine. The quality is good. The only negative I can see is that they are slightly too big for the ports on my desk, which is a plus.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Very Nice product. Works very well for me. I bought this for my computer. I am very happy with my purchase. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a nice quality audio monitor. Great job on the design and construction. The only negative I can say is it is really heavy. I have it with a laptop that weighs about 2 pounds. I think this is because of the audio output. I don't think it's the monitor, but rather the laptop that is heavier than it should be.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great device, but it doesn't work for my project.   I purchased this device for use as an audio receiver and output to a DAC. It works great for that. But, when I wanted to use it as a controller for my Arduino Nano and a Lighthouse-2 laser system I wanted the same functionality that the Lavalier works with. The Lavaliere has a remote control. This device doesn't. It requires a keyboard, mouse, and a micro controller connected to the Arduino. That is a pain.   the only good thing is the price for the device, and that the USB is fast, I wish this would work with a USB-powered keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the TK-7100 in a bid for a nice stereo system with speakers (I'm a musician) and a nice computer. Well, the computer came, but what about the speakers?? I love this TK but was told that the speakers could be a bit better. I got an amplifier, but had to use the included amp and the volume control with a set of high quality earbuds. The volume is right in the middle, but I thought the sound could be better.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, July 02, 2017  Great product  by A Customer from New York City USA  Pros: Light and small  Cons: None  Review: Works well with my EPROM programmer for my HP EliteBook 8560w. I have used other RAM mod chips but this one is light, small and easy to fit into the HP. I recommend this chip for any new computer.  I have yet to find a cheaper RAM mod for a standard laptop but for the price it's a really good buy.  of course, there are some cons, one is that it does not support Windows 7. I had to upgrade and install windows 8.1  The other is that you have to buy a 3 pin DIN cable with it, it just plugs into the normal RAM port and the motherboard. ,it has the capacity to support up to 32MB  it has 2MB of SRAM so if you have lots of programs to run it'll be quick. I like it because it has 2 pins that you can use to write to, i use that to write the ROM or BIOS to.  an ideal RAM upgrade for any laptop in my opinion, it is small and cheap but very effective.  "Pros:It can be hard to find RAM mods, and this is one of the better ones, it works with any RAM chip and even works with older computers, it has lots of RAM (32-64Mbytes) it has two main features. The first is that RAM chips are rated differently, some are faster, some slower, but the fact that they're rated is the only reason to buy this RAM mod, it does work in any computer. It is a 3 Pin DIN connector, no soldering needed, it can work in a USB or Serial port. I bought it at Best Buy. The second feature is that there is an adapter available which has a slot that has a mini PCI Express to USB converter in the front that you put the RAM mod in to get the speed of the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I used my pico to make a 4"x4"x10" acrylic block with 3 holes for the bolts that hold the door together. The door is actually in two parts so it was a lot easier to glue together than to weld a new panel together. It looks really nice. The whole frame is just a flat piece of styrene with a hole at the bottom for the bolt holes. You need to drill a small hole at each corner of the frame, but I did that because I had to cut off the old door because the frame was so thin. I put the bolts in the door after the glue had dried to make sure they weren't going anywhere. The box the door came in came with one big box of foam, but the instructions didn't mention that you could buy some smaller boxes of foam (I used the one that came with the door) and put them in the bottom of the door. When I put them all in the hole, they made a nice cushion. I also used the small foam cutouts that came in the box, and used those to cover the bolt locations. I didn't even put the door in the frame. I just attached the two pieces on top of each other with some hot glue. I then screwed it into the door and voila! It works. It works like a charm.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tom from We just installed the door, and it came out perfectly. The bolts are very easy to install, and the door doesn't require much extra effort to make it snug... We just installer the door, and it turned out perfect. The screws are included, and you simply thread the bolts into the holes using the included hardware, which is easy to follow. I used the included bolts for the door frame, and was able to easily screw them into the two bolts on the door hinge. All in all, it took me less than 5 minutes to put together, and once it was installed, it worked perfectly. It was well-priced, and I didn´t have to spend a lot to do it. You really can do a good job at DIY'ing this yourself. , I didn' t have to do any trimming at all, and didn't have to cut a hole in the back of the metal frame for the metal clips. They just look nice and look like they will be secure and stay in place. The installation took about 5 minutes. The hinges are just

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am the proud owner of a Sony MDR-V6 with this unit. This is a beautiful unit and it is perfect for the price. This unit is very versatile in both movie and music listening. It plays all types of music, and the audio quality is good for the size and the price (the MDR doesn't have many features other than playing music). I would recommend the unit to anyone with an active life or a family with a wide range of age groups. I have no problem listening to my favorite music, or movies on this unit with or without the amp. I am happy and have been happy with this system.  There are currently no similar reviews for this product.  Reviewed by: A Customer from Virginia. on 4/12/2012. I wanted to add my review to what others have written and I also wanted to let people know that the unit is in excellent condition. I purchased the Sony M5100, CD player and the receiver for my wife as a birthday present. The receiver works great. I've tried many CD players and they all failed in one way or another to play music CDs. I love that it does not have to have an adapter. It works great with a digital media player such as a TiVo.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson RD841 inkjet printer is great. You can go on and on about the wonderful quality and printing. I bought this one on a dare to see how good the printer would be for a low price. It turned out to be a very good investment. And the printer has a very nice built in stand to prop it up. The printer is well-specced and comes with some nice accessories and a few extra ones. The stand is very well built and a really great deal at under 10 bucks. The Epson Epson 3200, also a good model, does not have a stand at all. The printing quality is very high on the printer.   This is a great printer. It prints pretty well, but the ink jet technology is somewhat old. I would not recommend this for younger kids or younger readers. You could get a decent printer for less than $20. I'd say, give it a try if you have a good $20 budget.   "This is an excellent printer, I am very satisfied with the quality and performance. The high resolution gives a nice quality print. It is the best printer I have used. I have had good luck with this printer in other projects. I don't hesitate to recommend this printer to others. The ink jet printer works great for printing, and has a great user-friendly interface. I highly recommend this machine. "   What I like best about this printer:  It prints on the finest of papers  Print quality is excellent  I have no problems with it at all  Very good price for a printer  Great support   Most important features for me:  that it print on any paper  The printer is very quiet  Low noise prints  This printer has been great for me   My only complaint:  in the past it's not easy to find the Epson printer for sale. So this is a huge step forward for me. I got mine a month or so ago and I am so happy with it, its the best and most reliable Epson I have ever used. The price is great and its a great product. It also has the best support from Epson.  . It comes with a good ink cartridge and the ink will last for about a year if it's used properly. You may need a couple of extra cartridges if you print a lot, but for the cost, this is well worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!This unit is a lifesaver when I am traveling and have limited power outlets or battery power. It is an amazing piece of equipment. You can hook it up to multiple outlets in a pinch and it keeps the power going in the house. The unit comes with two USB ports, one USB to VGA port, one Micro USB to Micro USB, one Audio output and one microphone output. It also has a light in the battery compartment, an on/off switch and a reset switch. There are also two USB power cords which can power the unit while traveling. The light is a nice touch and is easily adjustable to help locate the unit. I don't have any complaints about the unit, just some issues I'm sure you can find with many products, such as the power cord. It takes forever to set it up and you will need to use the light switch on the unit to dim it to your preference. It would have been nice to use an LED light or something to indicate that it was charging. But overall, it is a very cool device. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you have limited electrical outlets or batteries, this is a great solution and I would recommend this to anyone in need of something to power up electronics when traveling or on the road.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit worked as it should for a while and it was very low in power consumption. But i bought a new one just to make sure its not the problem. I will be buying more of these units in the future, because i think its great for when i dont have my phone and want to keep using my tablet.    Rated 3 out of 5 by mbw8 from Good, but hard to use It was very cheap for what it was. When it worked i liked it but it was hard to see the numbers. I used to put it on the tablet and push buttons to turn it on and off. Now i have to use it to make it turn on or off. There was not enough volume on the bottom but the sound was very good.  The product worked as advertised and is a simple way to test if a device is working correctly. The unit was not quite as loud as it was advertised to be, which is what you are looking for when buying a unit that works as advertised. I did not realize this until I took the unit apart. It was a lot louder than I was expecting, which led me to replace it. The sound quality is great and is great for testing the signal strength. If your tablet's wifi or ethernet port is not working, it can be the case that the unit's built in microphone and speakers are not getting the correct signal. If you are buying a cheap unit, you may as well just get a microphone and speaker so that you can test it out.    I'm satisfied, but not 100% satisfied with this unit. I'm trying to see if the audio quality is worth the extra money. I was able to get a decent signal, but I'm having issues getting the signal level at high volumes. This is a good starter unit that should get you through a basic test of your tablet. I just wish that there was a volume control for the mic or speaker to fix the sound problems. The price was great, but the product is lacking when compared to other similar units.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   this is one of the best purchases ever. i am a medical transcriptionist and this is the best sounding voice recorder that i have purchased. its so loud and clear, i could take out my recorder and start recording my own voices, if you can get it to record without a mic, it is so great.  Great Voice Recorder that you Can Use at Work or Home! - February 3, 2015:  The quality of this recorder is very impressive, although I will say it can take a little getting used to. The main advantage of this unit for me is that it is lightweight and portable. I have a small office and don't mind carrying it around, and I have had no problems with it. It is a simple design, and the features are quite simple, so it takes a little adjusting and training. There are a few options to configure this unit. The audio volume can be adjusted up and down to control the noise level. The mic has volume, input, recording, and playback functions. I also found that the mic has a little clamp that keeps it in place when you're recording and that keeps the mic very easy to use. The unit has an adjustable microphone height, and will also adjust down when the microphone is placed at a slight angle. I did find the mic to get very close to the speaker, but that is normal with a lot of microphone microphones. The USB port on the back allows you to connect to the computer for recording, or to sync it with the phone and take calls. I really do recommend this unit to anyone that wants a voice recorder for work. Posted by: J.S. at March 30, 2013:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first USB charger! It works great, and it is compact and easy to handle. It charges my tablet fast and it will last forever! Thank you!  The only down side is that I didn't like how long it took for the charger to charge. If I had known it would take that long, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. But this is probably the most convenient charger out there, as I don't have to fiddle around with chargers at home.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I bought this for my daughter, who has Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She loves it, and it's a very good quality.  - It has been working well for a couple months.  the only thing I would say to be careful is the batteries. My old batteries just died and I had to get a new set  The only other small problem is the usb connector itself. It's very small and will make sure that if something doesn't work it won't be able to be plugged in.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this device. Its easy to use, easy to change out battery and is very portable. I can be out and about with it and take photos in places where I might not take my iPhone. The color options are very nice too. The design and size are great. I just wish the battery would last longer. But for a little device with lots of good features this is a great buy. The battery lasts a long time. It has worked well for me so far. I would definitely recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Great product!!! This is by far the best battery and charger I have used. It holds a charge for over 6 months and its easy to replace, and I can recharge 2 batteries at once. It comes with a charger plug for me so i can take it on the go. Great product.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, June 15, 2011  Love it!  by Matthew from Oklahoma City OK USA  Pros: Well built  Cons: Wish it had built in auto shut off feature.  in the back of my truck it takes about an hour to charge from empty to 100% and the battery has to be at 100% or below to use my air conditioner.  and it is too small to hold most of my batteries.  the small one (that holds the most charged) only holds about 1/2 a battery at a time, and the larger one (holds 2 batteries) holds a lot of charge.  is there a way to automatically shut off my air conditioning when the battery is drained?  I have had this for 6 months now, the last month the battery life is about 25% or so. Would like to have a backup battery for when there is no air conditioning or I don't want to take my radio with me.  I would suggest the Dyson AC-8R because it comes with 3 AAA batteries and also has auto shutoff built in. It is small, has 3 speeds (3, 6 and 9) and has a button on the top that when pressed shuts off the air condition. It also comes with 2 extra sets of batteries for when I have to use it in cold weather. .  are the 3 speeds the only thing it can do? . I use a car with a 9 speed fan but the 9 speed in my truck doesnt seem to be able to keep up with this monster battery.  with the new car batteries coming out now I may have to put one in the truck to use all 4 speeds to use the air conditioning. the battery charge is so slow that it only charges the battery when I need it. I love this. I really love this!!!!!!!!!  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Anonymous - Verified Buyer The power supply for this charger is great. The charger has a quick disconnect cable, so it doesn't take up extra space inside your air conditioners. I have an
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the remote. I used it for a short period of time and was pleased. I also like the way it works - the buttons work on the TV/computer.   My only qualm is that the remote doesn't have an auto-play option for a recording I made of my husband.  It is a good purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's a great device, and I use it often. I do have one complaint though, but I know I'm just whining, but it's very minor.  I have noticed that it tends to overheat after just a few minutes of sitting on my desk.   The temperature rises from 80 degrees F to 100 degrees F in a few seconds.  So just make sure you don't use the device for too long a time period, or it will burn out.  Otherwise, I really appreciate the features of this unit, and it is an amazing price for what it can do.  It's very small.  The LCD screen is small and the keys are small too.  It's nice and small, and this is really nice in my opinion.  For me, it's a bit larger than I thought it would be, and also it's way larger than my old laptop that I used to use to do online banking and work from the comfort of my chair at home.  Now, I'm getting used to this computer though, I can't really compare it to the older laptop I used, but the design and size is better than the one I used.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The moto-x is a wonderful camera, and has the best image quality and fast shutter speed, all for under 20 bucks.  As I say though, the manual focus is a pain in the ass sometimes, and I wish I could have a faster one. ____________________________________ I used to carry a moto x but was never happy with the lenses and the lack of a fast shutter.  When I saw the moto z I was excited to own a camera that actually does what the samsung s3 and s4 do, and all the fun that came with that!  I own a mikro-s3, a s4, a iphone 4 and a iz5.   The best part of the mikros is the quality and ease of use, but the iphones and s3 are just as awesome.  I have never had a problem with my iphonest, iphonet, or iz4.  There's no reason why a s3 or s4 should have to be as good as the iz or iphonen.  With the new Moto-x you get the highest quality images and the fastest shutter speed and highest quality zoom of any android phone in this price range, and the only downside is the inability to use the ixDroid on it, but that's a dealbreaker with me.  The only reason I don't give this phone a 5 star rating is the lack o f flash, but even that is a bonus.  _____________________________________  So, the only reason why I got a m2 instead of a z is because I'm using my computer to take the pictures, which is also the reason why there's not a flash on it.  My next phone will be a z4 instead of z2

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4/4s  The first 4 of 5 phones I got were from my wife who I was with in high school. We used to buy them together. They had a great build and the camera was better than most of the phones. I started getting the first 4/5s in my teens and got rid of them when my phone stopped working. I'm so glad I did because now I have a great phone. The first time I went to use my new iPhone 6, I took a picture of my wife. I was looking at the photo and I had my finger on the shutter and all the lights came on. I realized I had forgotten to put my phone in airplane mode when I took the picture. Luckily, she doesn't know I'm a photographer and didn't know that was possible.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:1 people found this review helpful

I love it! *****I would definitely recommend this product. It is just what I was looking for *********  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, April 29, 2008  by Mike from Las Vegas NV  Review: This little tool makes it possible to replace all the different capacitors that make up an IEC/EIA standard 1.0 Amp fuse (and many other things) with one, easy-to-install unit.  I can replace an I-CSA fuse with the same unit in about 5 minutes. .  in my shop, the IEC and EIA standard fuse holders are made of thick aluminum. Inexpensive but not heavy. The IEC standard fuse holder does not come with a plastic holder. It seems to be a new style of plastic holder but is still plastic. The EIA fuse holder has a steel shaft, which is a bit more rugged and robust than the metal IEC-type holder.  a replacement IEC (EIA) standard fuse comes with the unit  my next problem is the "IEC 1.1-A fuse" which is supposed to be the same as the "EIA" standard but not a fuse, but a fuse holder. My replacement fuse holder will not work with the 1.2 A fuse but I know that the "1.1 A" fuse will work with that one.  for those who wonder why the unit works with EIA-1.2 Amps, it is because the EIA EIA 1.3 A standard is rated at 0.5 Amps.  and yes the I-EIA fuse is the same.  the I/O port is just like a standard EIA IEC fuse but has a screw on a plastic clip. P.S. The item came with a set of metal screws so you could mount the screw in and use that to fasten the unit. I did not use any screws for the mounting and all that remains to do is to reassemble. 'somebody wrote' (March 13, 2007):  Great gadget, cheap. I just received the replacement unit today. I'm getting all the parts here but they are not cheap. , April 11, 2007:  Works great for replacing all the various fuse holders and it's a nice looking

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I have bought a few years ago the Pinnacle pico 8, the pico 16, the Pico 16+ and now the ponyscope 8.1.  The latest version of the pono system is now called pono p 8.3, it works exactly the same as the older versions, it is so nice to have one of these on your ipod, this is a very very handy piece of equipment. The best thing is it has no problem running your cd's, there is an external power jack that needs to be connected for the system to operate.  It is also light weight, which is good for me, a lot of portable devices are heavy and get in the way when you're using them.  A few things to note:  - I would recommend a high quality antenna  - This is also an excellent unit to have as a backup, it keeps your system going, even when the main unit fails  - it is very easy to plug in  - if you need some extra power (for instance if you have the ipod connected to a battery bank) the pONOSCOPE can be used as a battery back up, this takes about 10 minutes, this means if your ipad is dead you can still listen to the music  - there is also a small storage slot for mp3's,  - It is very quiet and is very good for a device like this, it will only get quite warm, but its quietness is a great bonus   Rated 4 out of 5 by Matt from A Good, Well Built, Portable, Portable Wireless System This is an excellent product, but if you intend to use it with a portable device, it might be a bit too big for your particular device. The size of the system is about right for my laptop and my phone, but I can imagine that if you plan to use these on a bigger device, such as a portable MP3 player, you might have some trouble fitting everything you need. The PONOSPOPE is very large and bulky, and doesn't feel as well made as I would have liked, especially with a case that the price would have been better off. If your looking for a great portable wireless system, with an elegant look and great sound, look no further.  Customer Testimonials
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "I bought this in a hurry (after the original battery died) just for the fact that I didn't have a computer and didn't want to spend $600 on an Ipad. It came with the original charger that the device came with. So the device should have been good, but not the best. After I got it home and started using it, I found out that its very easy to take care of, and the unit does not even need to be charged. The screen is bright and the device works fine when its off. The unit is extremely light, and very easy for kids to hold. I recommend this to everyone. Just buy it. Its worth the price."   Would you recommend this product to a friend?

It does what I was looking for. It is quiet, nice keys and the keys have no clicking noise. It has a nice feel, as a mechanical keyboard should. It took me about 2 months to get used to it. I also like that it has a function and macro function that you can use. I wish I had more keys but that is a good thing. I'm really pleased with this keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have a PX-40 that I've had for 15 years and have it in a small kitchen on my dining room table. My TV is also a P-X-30. These new ones sound like the previous model but without any problems. They are not loud but they do not crack, rumble, shake or make a lot of noise. The unit does the job for my needs. A lot of PX's are very loud so I am very pleased with this one. My husband loves them too.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from So quiet I have an PX8, and for a long time it was not possible to control the volume with a small remote. You had to have a power strip on it, and that wasn't very convenient, especially when the remote had to be plugged in. These are quiet and so small and light. They also have the function of setting the volume on the screen itself, which makes it much more convenient for me. . ,  ,,  Recommended  by A Customer from VA I have been using a Px-40 for 15 yrs. Had the same problem with the volume control being out of alignment for the last 10 yrs, not having the proper distance to the unit to engage the control properly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Love this device - great for use with video recording. I have used this device for over a year with great results. I had to replace the battery last year but it works great and is very easy to use. I highly recommend this device to anyone that does any type of shooting.  Good product - Poor design. I bought the Nikon D3200. This is a small but powerful compact system with great features for video recording and still photography. For video recording, the D3 has no problems. The only issue I have is the control ring in the back. This ring is very small so it is very difficult to operate. It is also a little difficult to remove from the camera. If you put pressure on the control button with your finger or thumb, it does not pop out of the camera easily. This problem makes it difficult to use the controls.   The D3 and its controls were designed to be operated using a remote controller but this control ring makes it so difficult to move it that I have had to purchase another remote and buy a different remote control. There is one thing I don't like about the Nikon digital system. The D3 features a very small button and control ring. I don`t like this design because I tend to touch the control and the button at the same time so I have to switch my focus and exposure settings and then I have accidentally changed the exposure or focus setting and I can't go back to the original. This makes it a hassle to use and makes it very difficult for me to find the control to change exposure settings. For some reason, Nikon hasn't solved this problem for the D5, D5s and the D7100.   to avoid any problems in the future, I will purchase another Nikon remote and another control ring to control the Nikon d3200 with. Also, I highly recommended that you buy a Nikon video camera remote for the camera and then buy a spare remote for your Nikon digital camera if your D3 is not using a separate remote control and you do not own a separate camera remote.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- A good device, good sound and no problems with the device. The remote can be very hard to find and the batteries are not cheap, but it's a good value. The only negative that I can think of is the fact that the speaker doesn't always work when the device is switched off. I think that this would be a nice feature, but could the remote be used when the battery is completely depleted? Overall I think the remote is very good. It has a lot of functions and a lot to be thankful for!  I'm really pleased with this receiver! I have it in my vehicle now and it has worked flawlessly. This is one of the very few inexpensive receivers I can recommend for a serious hobbyist! I would recommend it to any new or established audiophile! 'supposed to be the best, but I was pleasantly surprised. This particular unit is an all-in-one, but you can split it into four devices. You have your amp, your line out, your two headphone jacks, and your tuner (tuning is awesome and I recommend it). The unit is also very convenient in that it has a remote, so you can use it at the park, or on a long drive. The amp is fairly decent but not anything that a lot can't handle. The tuner is very accurate, and has a great tuner-like effect which is very nice. The built-in headphone amp is solid and works quite well. The best part about this unit, though, is the price! I know it is a low cost unit, but the value is very high. So, it is worth buying if you are serious about audio. If you are a novice, you'll probably find it a little too complex. I also really recommend listening to the music and not just looking at the display. It's a nice way to see what is going on with the sound, and you get to hear it all the way through. The fact that it is an analog/digital receiver makes it a much more flexible option. You can't really go wrong with this one.  Great receiver for the price and can be split into a pair. The sound quality is really good and there is no skipping or delay. I will be buying another one soon. , November 21, 2016  Good sounding receiver, however the remote not working after one week, needs a quick fix  , September 25, 2016

I have the Sony MDR-EX10.  and the sound is exactly the same with this headset and with the Sony.  "This is good for music but what I want is music with surround sound. It is good in music but I would buy a better one for music"  This is a good headphone with good sound quality for the money. "I would buy this product again. This is my second order and I am very happy with it. "  I received this headset from a friend who was very impressed with the quality, but was unhappy about the price. I felt the same way about the headphones I ordered. I decided to take a chance on the Fostex TH-X00 and I'm very glad I did. The sound quality is great, it's comfortable and I haven't had any issues with the battery or noise canceling. The only thing I wish is that there were a better variety of cable types and I'd definitely consider buying from here again.

I've used other units that were made in China, so I was a little nervous about using the converter. But this is the first unit that I've bought and I'm happy to be able to use my other equipment and have a good sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased a Tascam DR-05F (durability) from Amazon. I had read numerous reviews online. The DR-03B (performance) and DR-04D (interaction) sounded better in my ears. So I bought this. The first thing I noticed is the fact that there is no battery in the DR-02, but the DR1F has one. The battery inside the DR2F is almost dead, it was only able to get to 45% power. I guess I got too excited when I saw this product's picture on Amazon. So now the DR02 will be my main recorder and my new favorite little recorder! I love this little recorder so much I'm even thinking of getting another one as well. My brother in law's house also has an old model DR1D and he also loves it, he can just turn it on and record anything he wants. I think you have to love the sound of the DR03F and DR04D. The old models just sound muffled and cheap. I really hope the DR04 does better. I love the way it sounds. I don't get much distortion at all. That is what I like to hear. You will never regret buying this product! Thank you! - David H.   This is a great little recorder that is super easy to use. It does not come with an amp or an external mic, but you do get a mic with it. It is not a cheap recorder and you will need to spend some extra money to buy an external device to get better sound quality. Also, if you plan on recording live music, it is best to record a track before you play it back. You can record a loop of your vocals into a loop recorder and then loop the sound back to back on the same channel. I have an older Sony mics and I do not know why I thought the Tascams would sound better. - Daniel R.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  One of the very first I have owned, and for that I am very happy with the performance.  Thank you, Digilent  ______________________________  I love my MCP655. I love that you can turn it on and off from any computer keyboard. This little machine is a true workhorse. I have been working on it for years. My old desk top was a Commodore 64. I used to have a computer printer and it is a real joy to get my digital data into and out of the MCP. And I love the built in USB port and my old monitor. The MCP is one of the few computer monitors I still have that can actually display pictures.  a big thanks to you for making this a joy to use.  the best little unit I have found in the market  ______________________________________  (5/2013)  the mcp655 is the best computer monitor,  (8/2013 - also on youtube) .  to get the most out of it you should use a usb keyboard  and mouse  it is just that little extra bit of extra fun.   a very nice, easy to use  monitor for a very inexpensive price  ...  very good product  __________ (6/2013 )  This is a GREAT Computer Monitor for the price! The size is perfect for the little desktop computers that everyone has in their homes, and it also fits on the wall or table. I also bought the extension cord to power up my computer from my wall and laptop, as well as a USB cable that is good for my computer. The monitor will last a LONG time, it works well, the color is good and bright, and the resolution is great for any size laptop or desktop computer. I highly recommend this monitor and have purchased more from Digilents in the past for my friends and relatives. Thanks for a great product!!  _________________  Warm regards,  "T.R." ______________________________________ (5-2013)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a first timer to use an iPod and to be honest I have had problems but when I found out that this is a high quality product I went ahead and got it. It is very well made. The case is extremely durable. The audio quality is great, the size is perfect. I can fit 2 discs in the case. It would be even better if the batteries were removable. So I had to get a battery adapter. But after the first charge I noticed that the audio is not as crisp and clear. I had purchased the blu-ray player before and it worked very well. It took a while to figure out the battery and now I am back in the market for a blu-Ray player and this product definitely won't let me down.  Style of Music: Rock
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I had a new digital audio player a couple years ago and really like it. The price is so good I don't think i'll go back to analog. But for some reason when I change the batteries I have to take it apart to change them. When I first got it my battery started to light up (it had the "good battery" logo on it) then all of a sudden it went out. I'm used to taking a battery out to change it. My other battery died so I decided to get the replacement. This one is a lot easier to install because it comes with three screws that you put in the plastic part of the case and the plastic screws in the back. So if you're like me and you have no clue where the screw in the case goes it's a lot more easier to find. I also like that it has a small indicator LED. If you want to know when you're about to run out of battery you can just look at it. I did try some other ones but I found that most of them don't have a battery indicator and don't last very long. I got this because I like the digital and because of the price. This is definitely worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ A great addition to the studio, well worth the money! I own a cheap $15 wireless radio from a long time ago. It has the same functions as the SRS, but is much easier to use and much more accurate than my old unit.  I wish that it had a built in speaker, but I didn't want to buy a separate speaker  This unit has been so far the best audio system.  in my studio, there is only one other audio setup, and this one has done what I wanted it to. : )  Very very happy with it, it is very easy to use, you don't need any cables, just plug it in and it's done.  The built in speakers are pretty good, but the sound is a little lacking, I would have liked a better amp, and the sound from the USB input isn't as loud as the USB output from the unit.

Yes No Monday, October 22, 2016  Good device  by Anonymous from Fort Worth TX USA  Pros: works great  Cons: nothing  Review: It's an excellent product for the price. I use mine as a secondary keyboard for my XPS 13 laptop. It works great and the only downside is that if you use the same keyboard for all of your USB devices it will wear out after just a few days. I don't have to worry about this and the cost is still amazing. , from Great Buy  Works great  for my MacBook Pro  I'm running it on my Apple Mac Pro as a primary keyboard for multiple USB devices such as an external hard drive, Apple external monitor (with its own power supply), 2 external hard drives and various USB devices. I had it a little over a week. No problem with it working properly as a laptop keyboard. I do run some very power hungry devices, however. It seems to draw a lot of current, which could cause some trouble if you're running a power hungry device like a PC. I haven't had any problems. The built in USB port seems to be quite a bit more powerful than the USB to DVI converter I bought a few years ago and I didn't have any problems with it.    Was This Review Helpful or Helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an excellent radio that gets the job done very well.   It works really well in my car.

It could be a little bigger, but I dont think its necessary   If you want to get into electronics, this is a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________   It is an excellent piece of equipment. It is very easy to use and provides a very accurate reading. I just got it yesterday and the unit is working wonderfully.   My only advice for anyone using this is to be careful not to touch the screen while using it. It does take a lot of force to put the needle on the paper and I had to be very careful as it was my first attempt. The needle is very hard to move so you need to be patient.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I purchased this device about a month ago for use with a small LCD monitor. I got it and set it up using the instructions provided. I had the monitor set to 480*480 and set the resolution as 1280x960. The monitor worked fine and the device handled it perfectly. The display was bright and clear, the video looked crisp, and the screen was easy to read. The only problem I encountered was that while the screen is bright enough for most viewing, the backlight is only on when you turn on the device. The video was sharp and clear and the color reproduction was excellent. I bought it because it had a small display, it was perfect, and it was relatively inexpensive, but it didn't work very well for me. This is not necessarily a negative; the device was priced right, and while I used it a little bit, it seems to be a good all-around unit. I would recommend it for a very small monitor that I plan on putting in the corner of my desk, and I hope the price goes down as it seems like it should.  Noise  Review by jim Quality Value Price I got this monitor for my son who has a mini computer that is getting close to 4 years old. My son does not like using it, and does not do well with a computer. He gets very little benefit from a monitor. So I needed a more portable option for him. I was able to find this product on sale, and was impressed with the fact that it is pretty much self contained. I do not know if you can run this thing at a decent frame rate, but I bought this so that I could use my computer with it. I am impressed that there is a backlight. There is no need for a back light unless you have really bright lights that you want to watch.  (1) I am happy with this monitor!  (3) I purchased an additional monitor for this unit.  the display on this is very good. i am using a pc with it and it works great.  this unit works good on my mini computer and is easy to use. . It works good as a computer monitor. I have a mini pc and was disappointed with the speed of the monitor, but its very good for video or a movie on my netflix. It gives me great quality. It is also very clear.  he has no problems with it at all. It makes the computer

Review: Great product. However, its only as powerful (by my estimate) as a mid-range desktop computer! -David   Was able to run Adobe Photoshop CS3, Lightroom 2, and a number of others without any problem.  is a small compact, but the quality is amazing! The only negative is the size. It's so small that the power button is in your way. You will also have to turn the unit on with the power cord.  the only con i have is that there are some wires coming out of the back that you have to clean out, but i haven't had that problem so far. 's only purpose is to look pretty and that's exactly what it's done. I have been very happy with it.  (I bought mine for my 16 year old son who has never owned a laptop and he had to get me to purchase one for him. My son is very impressed).  If your looking for a computer that can do almost everything you can think of, this unit will work great for you. . (I've been using a Macbook Pro since 2007 and it's been through hell and back)   Review Summary:  The unit is compact, easy to use, and very powerful. I was very pleased with this purchase and will continue to recommend it to my friends.  on another note, I'm pretty sure that some of the reviewers on this site are not using the unit the same way that you did and thus, are seeing different results. I'm no expert on it but I thought I would point this out since I have used the same unit for years and it seems to do great. I hope this helps.  a nice little power bank for a price you won't regret.  in addition, this item does come with a USB cable to plug it into a computer. :)  Is this review helpful?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I bought the tic2 a few months ago. I've had no problems using it. I have the latest build and the newest version. I do most of my writing, phone calls and emails on it, it is a pleasure to use. The only thing I don't like is the size. It's way too big to hold comfortably in your hands. But for most of the functions you need it to be.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I really liked this device. I've been looking for an easy way to keep track of the time on my watch. It works perfectly. It doesn't look like a computer on the outside. I have a mechanical watch that I've used for years. It just never has a good time keeping. I think it's because I'm not as precise as I'd like, and I didn't like the way it looked on my wrist. This thing doesn't. It looks nice and sleek. I liked the way I had to set the time up on the watch before using this. The "clock" is just a number that goes from 00 to 23. It's easy to read and has an arrow for each minute you set. The screen is nice and bright. The battery life is great. It lasted me almost 6 days without changing. I didn t like having to plug in a phone when I used it. I found the phone app on the iPhone to be just fine. This was my first time buying a timepiece from a company that sold one that looks so nice. The look and the quality are great. I can't wait to get my watch in my pocket and be able to read the time anywhere I go. I also like how easy it is to customize to my needs. I'd recommend this to a friend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have just gotten my new computer and I have been very happy with it. I am very good with it now!   My only complaint is that the mouse and keyboard are not included.   This is definitely a worthwhile purchase.  Can't go wrong with this! Bought my LG H2207A last night, and I can't even tell it's new. I've owned other LG products in the past and I would think it would have held up a bit better. However, it looks brand new to me and I just can't beleive how well it does what it does. The performance is amazing and there is so many features that I didn't even know existed. It has a good keyboard and mouse as well, and it is a pleasure to use. I really think the price is very fair and the overall package is worth the price. If you want an all around computer, this is it! I've had my LGs for 2 years, and they are holding up great!  good but hard to use The mouse worked great but it was very hard to move the cursor.  (i dont use this pc for work, i use it for gaming) The keyboard was fine except that it was hard to get to the letters on my keys.  the LG h230w is very good i love it but it is hard to change settings on the usb the usb port seems to get hot very quickly
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is great for my job. I don't work in a lab but I do have my own small lab in my garage. I've been looking for something for the past 6 months and finally found this one. I was skeptical at first because the price is a little steep but I bought it because it worked as it was advertised. The only thing I would change about this is that it is too big for the room it was put in, but that's the only downside I can find. I do think this was well worth the cost of the device. The price should also be discounted to make it more accessible to everyone. I would definitely buy this again
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I have had two of these devices, both of which have had several problems with me being unable to get it to talk to the other one (which is a real shame). The first time it worked and everything was fine. Now it refuses to connect to my iPad and I have no idea why. My wife says it has something to do with how I'm connected. I've changed my iPad Air's wifi connection several times but this seems to be the one that won't connect. I just bought another Apple Watch, but I can't think of anything I can do to fix it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My main use for the PX3 is for monitoring/recording the status of any devices I have. I use the P5i (also used for recording sound) for my PC, but the P3 can be useful for monitoring my audio output in a recording booth or while listening to music in a concert. The P3 is a must for the serious music producer or recording engineer. I also use the unit for video production (for making video for YouTube or Vimeo) and use the video monitor for looking at the video feed of a video camera while recording on a camcorder or the P2 for monitoring video on a computer and PC, and to monitor my monitor during a TV recording. I recommend this to anyone with a desire for a decent monitor with a reasonable price.  Review by: John L. On 9/20/2014 4:51:35 AM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this as a birthday present for a co worker who loves electronics and has been wanting to have a bluetooth speaker for awhile. I was hesitant to spend $150 on a Bluetooth speaker that sounded terrible with an internal battery that I will have to replace after a few months, but after listening to it on my car for about two hours it sounded like a great device and I love the fact that it can connect to my phone and play music and phone calls, not just play songs on bluetooth. My favorite feature is that it has a built in phone speaker and a phone call/iTunes remote. I am also a bluethenet that uses a cell phone, tablet, or laptop as my main device because of my job and I will always have this device with me to listen to music or any of my other devices that I use to work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ***********************  This is an amazingly simple device to use. It's the first time I've ever used an electronic device on stage. It is super easy to use and has a nice bright display. I'm a guitar player and I have a Yamaha guitar that has always been problematic. When you start your amp, it gets really loud, but it never gets quiet. Now this thing will get quiet when you shut the amp off, or turn the volume up. I have to say, if the other one was this great, I'd have no problems using it live! I've also been using it on the stage as an extra monitor for my guitar to give it some added sound. You could also use it as a monitor for your drums, or any other device with a good headphone jack! I highly recommend this and have no regrets about buying this!

Yes No Monday, October 26, 2011  Good purchase  by James from Fort Myers FL USA  Pros: Durable, Small, Compact  Cons: none  Review: These fit perfectly on my PocketWizard. I bought a second battery but still use the first. I use the light with the pocketwizard to take notes and I need the battery in the pocket to keep the unit from draining when I'm not using it. , but they look like small boxes in the PocketWizards case. The batteries are very low power and I don't find them to be a big problem. I can still use them on the Pocket Wizard while in the car, when I take it with me to school, and on my travels. : These look like boxes in their case. I don' t find them a big deal. I used the light for a few days while traveling in Mexico, and I still have it in my pocket. I like the size of the unit as it is easily hidden in the pockets of my pants or shirt. I love the fact that it uses 3 AAA batteries instead of two AA. I have had the batteries last for days and they only get charged when the light is on. So far it is working like a charm.: The lights last forever, and the unit is fairly compact. : I only wish it was able to be powered by one AA battery as it doesn't give the LED much light. The only thing I don t think this pocketwizards should have had was a better charging system. You have to flip the switch for it to charge, but the unit doesn't have any power indicators to indicate it has enough power. I had to use a AAAA battery every day since I only had 2 of them to use on my own pocketwiz. It also seemed like the unit was being powered by the battery that wasn't there most of the time.: This unit works well, is easy and quick to charge. No need to carry a lot of batteries. : The battery life is good for the money. I expect it to last for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the best portable stereo system I have ever owned. It plays anything you throw at it like a champ and you never know it is running. I use this in my shop as well as on the road. I recommend this item to anyone who wants a great portable system.  Rated 5 out of 5 by bv from Awesome, easy to use, small and portable It's easy to work with. I love it!  5 out of 6 by MikeG from Great little portable stereo. This is a great little portable unit. It fits in the glove box of my truck with room to spare. I also like the fact that it has an in/out jack, so I can use the portable system with my iPod or MP3 player while on the go.  the only thing I don't like about it is the power supply but for what I needed it for, it was fine  2 out of 2 by Anonymous from The unit will not charge properly The unit is in a box. It is easy to get to but I've had the unit in it for about 2 months and the unit will only charge one of the batteries, it cannot tell if it is plugged in properly. I contacted Apple support and they will not help me. My problem with the product is Apple has been slow to develop this product. It has been a year and a half since my last purchase. The battery charge indicator is missing.

The old one still works fine. I highly recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my htc vz4x for about a month now and i cant complain. the htc isnt perfect but it's what i was looking for in a phablet. my favorite feature of the ht is the headphone jack and its so simple to use. ive never had any issues with it and it stays secure even if you are dropping it and a person is trying to break into it.  the only gripe i have is about the case but that might be because i dont have any other case for it. Ive used all kinds of cases and they seem like cheap ones but they dont really protect the phone like they do. also it gets extremely warm when it isnt in use so i have to keep it in a bag with my other phones. overall a great device and im really happy with it.

It can take in tons of data (video, audio, data, text, photos, maps, directions) all in one place so you can share it with people via apps like gmail, etc.  It also does an excellent job of organizing the data. For example, you can pull up a list of all the phone numbers you've ever called, a list for all your favorite TV shows, a map for a road trip, a set of directions with all your locations and a bunch of other stuff. It is the best of both worlds. And the free tier gives you a good deal of data for your monthly fee, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very very happy when i purchased my iHome. The remote is excellent for it's price. Very easy to use and works fine. If you want to take your tv to the next level you gotta get one of these.   I only have one criticism; the power cord comes with a plug in and power cable. Why not make a cord with the same plug and plug the power in from the power outlet so you dont need to bring a separate plug in?   As for the remote, i've had a lot of good remote's and this is a great one. Its quick to respond to voice commands and is easy to operate with a thumbs up button on the back.     Thanks for the review, mr.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* The VTC5 is the most useful and versatile electronic device I have purchased and am very pleased with it. I bought the VTC 5 just over a month ago and had to put a stop to it's use when I noticed that the battery did not last very long. It was only a couple of days that I had it plugged in. That was fine I was only using it during the day and on my car key chain for home and that was it. Yesterday morning I noticed something was wrong when I woke up. I thought it might be my car charger and plugged it in to see. The light was on and the charger was at full charge. However I did not touch the charger and it died. The only thing I can figure out is that it just went out of battery power or something. I had been using the device all of the time so I had no other reason to even plug it in. I am very satisfied with the product and I will buy again in the future. Just make sure you check the charging port when you get it. It is very easy to accidentally let it charge out. I have already contacted them and have a new charger for it. ****************************  No more charging for me! by: K3PXZ from San Antonio, TX I have had it for over a year now and it does NOT charge! I will not buy it any longer! I thought about calling to report it but I just thought I would put my 2 cents in! I just hope they will fix it soon!  Perfect product by: LILJEN from South Dakota My only complaint is it took me a long time to get mine because I didn't have a car charger at the time. I got mine today and used the cable to go through a wall outlet to the charger. Now it is charging and running fine.  Works as advertised by: Joe L. from San Diego, CA I was very happy to find this product at Walmart. The product works as advertised, but there were a couple problems which I didn`t think anyone would have with it... 1. It works with the iPod adapter, but the iPod cable is not included. 2. It has not been known to charge my phone without charging the battery first. 3. When I connected it to my iPhone it would power up the phone but would not make any noise when turning it on. Now I am not sure if that is just a minor problem with

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the features of this gadget. I have used a few different devices for a few years now. My last one (a laptop) has about half the RAM, a different processor, and a larger hard drive compared to this one (4 TB). It's easy to use and it was easy to install. It has a great interface. I like the idea that you can do things like backup your data or even download new files onto the device. I'm not sure that I would want to replace this unit myself, but I can see it being a great companion for a laptop.

Yes No Tuesday, February 01, 2012  Does a good job in the house  by David from New Orleans LA USA  Review: This thing does a good enough job of turning on the lights in the dining room in my house. I used to spend many hours with a multi-tool and just pulling out a power cord and screwing the lights back on. Now we can put the power cord in the kitchenette and just grab the plug out of the wall outlet and turn the lights on and off.  for me, that is the main thing I like about the Switch  Had to remove the dimmer and dimmer box and plug the power in to turn it on  (for that I just got the dimming function of the Switch)  i am not sure if i would buy this product again  It was a great price on Amazon.  the only thing i dont like about this product is the price.  (if you dont mind spending a little extra money on an additional switch or the dimmers i wouldnt have a problem with this product)  to remove or install the lights you must unplug it and turn it back on and on.  and you must have the dimmed mode on when you get the switch and dim the lights. . ,  and finally the switch has a little plastic shield on the edge of the switch which is easily broken off  after some use.  not much that can be done with the plastic shield but it still gets broken off when removing the switch.  are the lights any louder in the dimm  but there is no way i could hear them through the Switch.  of course the dim switch is on the end that is removed to install the switches, . so i would suggest the plastic piece be cut off if you plan on using the Switch for dimming.  that is my only complaint on this product.

Write a negative review about an above average electronic device :!!! I was looking for something to do with my new Android tablet that I just purchased. I saw the USB charger and it immediately grabbed my attention. After trying it out, I liked it. Then, I tried it out with my phone. I couldn't believe the quality. I'm used to seeing the crappy knockoff chargers with the cheap cord. It took a little getting used to, but I now just plug it in with the USB adapter and the battery charge lasts the whole day. If I forget to plug it back in in the afternoon, I just run it down the battery with the tablet on a separate power cable. I like the fact that there's no cables that can get damaged.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device does exactly what I needed it to do, even at a low price. This is the second time I have ordered from your website, and I've recommended the site to all my friends.  Good quality product:   . - I use my RCA RCD-T-100T cable for my radio, and it's a very good cable, however, I noticed it's durability isn't the best, as it still isn't as durable as other cables, as I've seen other reviewers mention, which is annoying, because a little bit of dust gets in. This is not the fault of this product as it comes with no warranty, though it comes packed with protective tape. The price is the same as it was the day I purchased it from your site. I do recommend using a cable with a protective tape over it, to secure it, just to make sure it doesn't get blown into oblivion. I know that's a little ridiculous, but it's all I have to work with at this point. So the item was received and in use without any problem, I can't comment on durability or sound quality, I'm using it mostly for internet streaming of the live audio stream of my live stream of the U.S. Navy band, I've also been using it for podcasting to my computer, and my headphones. The price is very affordable and the product comes with a huge quantity of extras, even if it's not a true RCA cable, it's still one of the best value items I've ever purchased. If I had to give a negative star, it would be the quality of the device itself, I bought it to use for streaming audio over my local computer, I wanted something that was a little less bulky, yet more robust than other cables. I was a bit disappointed in the audio quality, as my computer's speaker is so good that I'm sure the sound would've been very good on the RCA device, but the sound wasn't as clear and I found myself needing to turn off the speakers to get enough audio out of it, as if the computer's speakers were too loud, they couldn't handle the volume of the computer speakers. All in all though, I don't know if this is due to the lack of a RCA adapter, or a problem with the cable itself, though I have tried both and both seem to work fine. I hope this review helps

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The new ipod touch is a great device, good design and well made, i like it. I love the new ipad pro, but have to say that the new one's screen is much bigger than the original ipod, and it has much larger touch screen, and larger batteries. I bought the new ones on a deal with my wireless carrier, and i just wish it were smaller, it's not the size of a standard ipod but it's still larger than a standard computer mouse. Overall great device!!!  Rated 1 out of 5 by LJ from Disappointed in the quality and performance of the Touch I received. I thought it was a good product but after having the touch and its function over a year, I can't see the point of continuing to use it. The buttons and controls are way out of the way and it is very difficult to get into and out of some of the settings, especially the screen settings. The only reason I still have it is the great screen and the large battery it has. I can only recommend this to someone who doesn't want to deal with the controls or is looking for a high end product  It is a very good product.I love the screen and battery life.  I really wish I could give it a higher rating but I wish they would have made the screen a tad bigger. , I love my ipod 5 and I had the old one for 3 years. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as an upgrade to an existing samsung that had a bad touch screen. This phone is very responsive and has fast transfer speeds for photos and other documents. It also has a decent camera for a smartphone, although the pictures are a bit grainy. It is a great phone and I highly recommend it to anyone. The only thing is the camera is very slow to respond in certain situations, but I have used it a lot more than the original samsung and have no problems.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second computer, my first was a IBM PC which i bought in 1990. I had an old VGA monitor (Dell 300), a CD drive (Acer), an Apple Macbook and then a new HP laptop. All of which are very powerful machines. I also own a laptop from 2011 which has had a lot of time on it and is very good but the latest HP laptop is the best out there. It has a better keyboard and keyboard accessories that make it faster, better battery life, it has more memory, a better processor and it is much cheaper than the computer i used to own.   The computer works well with the internet, movies and music but it has one drawback, it's slow when it comes to loading web pages. I would recommend it only for someone who already has a decent computer, who is comfortable with the tech and who can afford to spend a little extra for a little more speed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this in early 2008 for use as an external audio player for my portable mp3 player. The only issue I encountered was that it was too loud in my car. I had to put headphones on in my truck just to enjoy the music. But with the remote, it's great! It's also an excellent product in that the remote has the ability to play mp3s as well as the ability play music in the car. Overall, I'd say it's a good product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I love this unit, has great quality and the best features. I like that it can go to sleep by itself in less than 2 minutes.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This little device allows you to hear sounds of animals in the wild or at night. I have a very small apartment and I use this as a sound monitor in a closet. You have to listen very closely to know what is going on in the room, but its definitely worth the money. It allows me to hear very loud sounds, and the earpieces are very sturdy. Also they are quiet. I use the small earpiece on a boom mic. It has a little cord on it that is just long enough to plug in. I put my boom microphone in there, the cord goes to the headphones and into the mic and when I switch on my headset it doesn't even sound out of sync! It just works!  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this on a daily basis as a replacement for my old computer monitor. For the price and size, this is by far the best monitor that I have ever used. The resolution is perfect (1280x720) and the picture is crystal clear. The only problem I have is that you cannot adjust the brightness level. The screen is so bright that I cannot even tell it is on. The computer is still quite loud. I'm going to have to look into getting a second one just to get the brightness to a more comfortable level. This thing is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The most amazing gadget ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I ordered this item with the idea that I'm going to use it for my dog. So far, we have used it for about 6 days with no problem. We've had the dog on the leash while on the train ride. It works great. It's a little heavy, but not too bad. The device is waterproof so we put the leash on it, and no water got through the waterproof casing. As for the device itself, it's very nice. There's not many things that are waterproof and have a camera on them. It has a few buttons (including a camera) to adjust settings. It charges through the USB port which is very convenient. There are four buttons on the device. The camera is great and comes with a carrying case. You just place the camera inside the casing and the device automatically activates. It really is the best gadget that I have ever owned. It gives me back all my pictures and videos. I cannot express how great it is. Thank you for making this a reality! I'll keep recommending you to all my friends who are looking for a good toy for their dog. It seems like I'm writing this from another country but this is my first review from New York. Thanks again!  It has been 2 weeks and the camera has not had a problem and we have the dog in a harness and collar. The battery is a little weak as it is in the handle but it does have a built in charging cord so I guess that is what it's for. I can't think of a better product. We are very happy with it and recommend it to our friends.  Great product, but the charging cord needs to be an L2 or larger...  My dog is a German Shepherd and so she is used to the dog leash being on her shoulder for a great deal of the day and not always being the best for running. She uses the leash to run and when she's in a park she's also in harness. I decided to get a leash for her for some other uses and bought the Teton 60. When I got it home and plugged it in, there was no sound, but a couple of days of running and jumping made the sound come out. The dog leash only charges in one direction and the battery dies after a few days. Also the charging dock I get for my other dogs is really cool. Great product,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product is what I expected. It's great to use it to keep track of my schedule and keep track on what I ate. The only problem is that it doesn't record everything, but I'll fix that.  I've been using the calendar app for a year and this app is the best. I'm very satisfied and this is the only app I'll use.  a bad app:  Very frustrating to see that when you make an entry that a month is about to end, the screen just says "Not yet". When the screen does say the month is going to end and shows a month view then it is going up next. I understand that it is a rough time-use app but still I had to restart my calendar app to get this to work.  the app should be called "the app with the little blue arrow to move to the next month"  great app but the calendar is a bit buggy. it just doesnt recognize you have a different device, even after you do a restart and log in.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the speed and the range of the iTAC. It's a great product for a really good price, but, you need to know how to use it correctly. I bought it thinking it would be easy to learn how to control, but I was wrong. I had to spend a lot of time reading and learning the manual, then finally I figured it out. I got it working properly, but it does take some time. If you buy the i-Pad, you get a USB cable and you can do this type of setup for free. I use the iPod Touch. It took me a while to figure it out, but once I did, it worked perfectly.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Dottie from Works as advertised Works as described with a few limitations. My first device did not have USB so I used an iPhone to control it, which worked flawlessly, but my second device did have USB. As you do with the iPad app, the app allows you to assign up to 3 functions to each device, each function can be individually assigned, the second one having a different set of buttons. So, a good setup is that you get 3 functions on one device, but you have to learn the app to make it work.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So far it has been well worth the money. It has been so convenient to use and is really easy to navigate to find information that I needed.   This thing is so useful.     Very good product, and a great price. I will definitely be using it more.   the only thing I'd say is that there are some small problems with the app. the user interface doesn't work very well, and sometimes if you search it doesn't even show up in the app that you were just searching for it, just like when the app is closed, you can't open it and find what you are looking for, there's a way to do it though, but it's not easy to understand or use.  I think it's a good product for the price and it makes searching for information a breeze.  in the end I don't have to spend extra money on searching for something that I don´t need. I have no problem spending less to get a good device that works better and saves me time.  (:  Great little box! Bought it for my father to replace the small mp3 player he had that was getting really hard to use.   in short it's great and he said that he had never been happier with anything he ever bought and it was cheap. .  for the money  .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  This has to be the best thing i ever used, I have always had bad headphones, so far have not been able to find a replacement for them. They are not that good sounding and the cables are awful. After trying the Bose headphones I decided to go with this. The sound is much better than the BOSE and more in line with my other speakers (Corsair and Aspire). I've had these for about 2 years now and still sound as good as the day i bought them. This is the best investment I've made in a long time. My wife has the same headphones, and we both love them. It just makes your life much easier when you're running out of things to listen to at the gym, or driving around your house. I'm sure my wife is a bit jealous because of how good my Bose sound is but I assure you, she doesn't hear anything as good and the only time she does is when she goes to the bathroom.

It works very well, has a nice weight and is convenient to carry when I am out hiking or camping.  with the current price of electronic items on ebay these days I don't think it is worth buying this item as I would not recommend it to anyone as an everyday charger.  a little expensive for the money but well worth it  It's a bit pricey and a little on the heavy side but that's what you get. This is my go to charging station. I just love the simplicity of it. No cords and no frills.

The notebook is very well designed and comfortable. As a business user, I find myself in a rush all of the time, especially with a family. I was impressed with how fast the computer is. In addition, I found the USB port to be well made. I use a cable to connect my cell phone and this does not cause a problem. I also found that the keyboard is better than any that I have ever used. However, I do wish the hard drive could be more accessible.  It's a good thing to have a laptop. But you need to get the right one. I bought this Eee pc (P7V77-D6) and it's the best ever. Not just for my personal needs, but for my family as well. The processor is fast, battery life is long, storage is ample, and the software is perfect. The biggest plus of this laptop is that you don't need to be on the web 24/7 in order to use it. I don't even use the internet all day. The only thing that I'm not as happy with is the keyboard. I've had the laptop for about a year now and I haven't figured out how to get that key to work.  I really like this laptop, it's very quiet. I like the idea of having multiple drives in the system so I can have the best of everything. If the keyboard were made better it would be perfect, but so far so good.  is the laptop worth it? it is. I recommend it.  (Posted on 8/25/2013)  I LOVE IT! I received my new laptop (P751) today, and I'm in love!

Great sound, and the ease of use is outstanding. I like to have my tuner on me at all times so that I can find what I want in just a few seconds. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple tool for their sound board.  The price is right, it works great and sounds great!  I needed a portable digital tuner for a gig and wanted to do it at home. This little guy made it very easy to get on stage without spending a lot of money. Thanks  great for what I needed it for.  I just bought a new DAP and need something to help me locate my strings. This thing has worked great so far!  A must have  This little tuner is a must have when you play gigs. Not only does it have a built in tuner but it also has a tuner antenna built in and you don't have to worry about not being able to find your strings. I also have the same tuner in the van. . This tuner has many functions. It can be used as an external tuner, a backup tuner or as an integrated tuner. I use it as an auxiliary tuner when using an external one.  and it has one of the nicest and largest LCD displays on the market.  This tunner has the biggest LCD display I've ever seen on a tunner, and it is large enough that I could see what I was doing even when the tuner was in the closet or in the car.  the internal tuner does work very well but I would have to say that it is still only a backup. when I go into the studio with my tuners, my main tuner always has the same issues. so, when I do use the tuners built in, I use the built in on my guitar and have never had any problems. I used to not really want to use them built in but now that I know they can still work and that the tuning is still working just fine, I do prefer the built- in tuners over the built out ones, especially since they can also be used in the studio if you don�t need to use the auxiliary tuners. , I have always wanted this kind of tuner,and now

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *****************************I wanted an external monitor/monitor to use on my desktop computer. The idea was for a mini monitor to attach in the laptop compartment with the power/USB ports. I have had the monitor for about a year and have not seen any improvement in the clarity of the picture. I decided to order this one and am very happy with it. The pictures in the site are very clear. The picture is crystal clear and the resolution is good. The only thing that would be nicer would be to have more of a viewing angle. If you were to go to a restaurant with your laptop to view the menu, you would need to turn the monitor upside down to see what is going on at the table.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................... I purchased this to replace my previous set-up as I am moving to an apartment. After the installation, I did some research and found that it was a good deal and would work well. When I initially used it, I noticed some problems. I did have to get new cables. It took me a couple weeks of using it, but not to bad. For the price it's a great deal, especially with the free shipping and a few minutes of your time. It has been in use for several months now, and it is working great. It was able to power the LED light on my computer, my iPod Touch, and my tv. For those who want to try it, keep in mind that it will require some trial and error. It may not power everything at once. If you are trying to plug in and unplug something, or if you want to switch the light on/off and on/ off the music, make sure you plug in the correct cable first, and that it works before you try the other lights.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This product is a great bargain! I use this unit in the front door of my house. The thing that impressed me about this unit was that, I have had it connected to the wall at night and at first thought I was going crazy, but after the first night of using the unit, I can see how the brightness is adjustable and very bright. I could also see the light coming from inside my house, when I walked the next day. The unit has also helped me locate my kids who were playing outside at night. The best part was that it never made a sound, not once. I was so surprised and happy!  Product Review: Excellent Product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPhone 4 was a nice surprise. I have been searching for a good digital camera for a long time and I had a bad experience with many of them. It wasn't until I got the iPhone 4 that I decided to try the Sony cameras and they really impressed me. The pictures look better than I expected. I am now a Sony Loyalist.   I would recommend the Sony Digital Camera to anyone that is in a situation where their photos can't be handled with a traditional camera. It's a great camera to take in the park or in the car and takes great photos.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product for the price! I bought the camera to go with my Canon S90 camcorder. The image quality is great and the feature set of the camera is pretty extensive. With that said, the only con I have is that the battery is very low. I normally have the camera on me for about 3 hours before I need to recharge. That's pretty much my daily routine and even I have to re-charge it twice a day. It also takes a while to set up and sync up, which is unfortunate. All in all though, I love it!

It is not easy to push the buttons.  - I recommend this to anyone who can't afford or doesn't want to take the time to prepare for a special performance.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the C-Ring in the hope of preventing my vaginal discharge and I have, but not from the C Ring itself. I used it twice a day until my discharge stopped (about 1 month) and even then I can still get some when I am sitting down.   This product is great! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the only way I can get more is with the special wand, which costs $25, and sometimes if I am not using it and just sitting down, I will get some from my discharge!   If you don't like the extra money to buy the special product, then don't get it. It may help, but its not for you. You will get more if you are using the Cring constantly. Also, a tip, if your doing a lot of cleaning, use the special applicator and you will get even more, I just find that I get more from the Wand, but it is a waste of money since the Wand has only one applicator so you are paying for the extra thing.

It's a lot easier for me when I know that something is going on, so that I know exactly what I'm going to be looking at. It also allows me the freedom to do things in the office where I cannot or do not want to have a computer in my area.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great product - very good sound quality  by mr johnny - Verified Buyer Good product good price  The first product I have ordered from DigiKey. The product works as advertised and I am very pleased with it. I will order more. Good stuff!!  I have a Digi Key D1 and this was very easy to use. I have an A/C unit and it is very hard to set it and get it going when the sun is up. This works very good. Thanks Digi  Went from 3D sound on the A/Cs to pure digital. Fantastic  Reviewer: R.C. - Verifying Buyer I bought a Digitech D1 to run 3D audio through my A/c's so that I could listen to my favorite 3D games on a large HDTV. After having the unit for a few days and having it hooked up with my TV, I realized that I had bought the most amazing piece of audio equipment! The sound was so good that I was able to hear the music of the game even when I was listening at low volume. I used to have a digital radio that I used for listening to music when my AUs would cut out for the rest of the morning. The D1 allows me to listen to music and games that I enjoy just like it was before. The Digi key is well built, it looks nice too. When I was done with my installation of the DigiD1, I had a very happy customer.  P.S. I got the Digitech for less than I originally thought it would cost. I'm using it on an HP ZBook x360 with no problems.  "A" and "B" are very nice sounding. The soundstage is very wide. Very much enjoy this piece of equipment. .  in a very high powered computer with all this gear: It's a great piece of kit, especially the DAC.  of course you need it for the most important thing, to get that crisp, clear sound!  Well, it's really hard to give a bad review about it! This is a truly amazing piece! A true treasure!  in the end, I've got this for the sound, it has got great audio quality and is really loud.

I did take off the screen cover the first day because I have a bad back from lifting my weight, but after that I took it down and the unit looked as new. I am very satisfied.

Yes No Wednesday, May 17, 2012  Excellent product!  by Joe from Seattle, WA USA  Pros: Good product at a very reasonable price  Cons: None  Review: I purchased this for my wife as a backup power supply for our new computer. It arrived quickly and as expected. She was impressed with the quality and the price.  It's a great product at an excellent price, even the parts are included. I was worried about what was in the box, but was happy that it all worked well. It can be powered by the 9v battery or by a 7.4v mini USB or 5v 2a wall adapter.   Was the Review Helpful this week?  The BEST!!!!!!!  By Mark from San Diego CA USA - No more power issues with laptop that doesn't have any power cable. - I wish they sold the cord separately because I have 3 MacBook Pros and all have the same problem (see photo).  I use this power supply in my X1 Carbon and my Dell XPS 13 and XPS 15. Both the XPS devices have the newer Intel Core i7-5500U processors.   of all the power supplies I've used, this is by far the best. . , I've had my system for 6 months and it has never had any issues at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is an excellent device. It has everything I need. It is small, light, and can be held easily in the hand. If you like to read on the go, this is the device for you. It can be powered off the wall, it has a headphone jack, and it can be used with the optional remote. If I had any complaints about this device, it would be the size. It's very compact, but still feels like a brick. I wish there was a way to charge it when it is powered off and the charging port was on the other side of the device. I have had several times when I've tried to charge the device while it is on the wall and the battery drains quickly. I also wish that there were more options for using this with bluetooth speakers. It may be difficult to find bluetooth devices in my area because of the limited options for Bluetooth speakers. But if you are the type of person who likes to have a device that can play music while you are on the move, this would be an excellent solution for you (it also can play games, and that's where I really like it).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! My sony mp3 player has only one problem. It keeps cutting off the volume and the only way I could fix it was to buy a new one.

It has an easy-to-read, backlighted screen, and is very quiet to be expected. The volume on this thing is a lot louder than I would prefer, though. But it's not so loud it's bothersome, just a bit more than I like. I'll have to upgrade the internal battery soon, but I'm sure that's easily remedied. --------------

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item to take to the beach for the holidays. I purchased it to replace my trusty Logitech mouse. I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of its scroll wheel. I did not use the scroll wheel extensively. I mainly used the scroll-wheel for the menu and for the pause button, and I found it very accurate and useful. I highly recommend this mouse!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, April 21, 2014  Good enough.  by A Customer from Haddonfield CA USA  Review: I'm only using it with Windows 10 and I'm satisfied with the mouse. It seems to have lots of button options and I like that. I am currently using a Logitech G200s wired mouse but this is an improvement.  and if you don't like the "click it down" feature then you can use the mouse with a single thumb on the button. .  in conclusion, if you are looking for a good mouse that doesn't overburden your hands like most high end mice do then you are on the right track with this mouse.  of course I won't buy another one of these. - A Customer  Excellent and well made  By Richard C from New York, NY USA  in reply to Review: Was so surprised at the quality of this mouse and the durability.  I'm a very fast mouse user, and the new mice seem to be a big step up from the old. Great product  Will be buying more from this company.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great for kids to use. Works great with the old computer monitor. Works well and works for kids. This is a great buy. It keeps the kids busy with a game on their computers.  The only thing that's not a good, is that when it is plugged in the unit is not detected by the computers monitor, therefore, you cant use it on the desktop or laptop. You have to use the external monitor as it cannot detect the unit at all. It may not be a big problem because there is a monitor in the room, but its not a perfect solution, as it won't work on all computers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very nice digital audio player.  It's easy to use.   I find it easy to adjust.  If you want to add features, they are easy to add.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   this is the most amazing thing I have ever used! My life has been changed for the better since I started using this. I have a chronic condition called spasticity, which is essentially muscle pain. I had tried everything I could find on the internet, but my muscles felt like jelly, or like a block of concrete that would crack and pop. This thing does exactly what it claims and it works like magic. I started with 1 and a half hours of use, and by the end of the day I felt as good as when I used a normal motorized wheel chair! I have now used this every day, even on days that I feel fine. The only negative is that it gets a bit hot, but the design means that you can just let it warm up before you even put it on. I am very pleased with this and I can't wait for my wife to come home.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own 3 of these, 2 are old. Very nice looking devices.  If you are a fan of a lot of sound and bass in your music and you want a way to add it without the hassle of a speaker, or have one already, I give this a 5 out of 5  Great sound at a great price. .  the sound quality is great, I'm an audiophile and this is a great speaker, but the subwoofer is the worst on the market. It's the same thing as my old HiFi, just a cheap sub woofer. The quality of this speaker really is amazing, the bass is huge, I have mine in the basement and in a living room, and I love it. The noise cancelling is amazing and its just amazing. I bought 2 of these to get more bass and the sub woofers were just to good to not use, and the sound still sounded great. If you want better sound without the speaker it is definitely worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* I'm going to start this review off by saying how much I love this thing. It has saved me countless hours of time I wouldn't have had to do without my smartphone anymore. I purchased it when my original phone became a bit more of a liability and the device was at it's worst, so I had a few months to go and try to replace my other phone. I was going to go with a Nexus 5 but I decided I was more than comfortable with my original and would rather be safe than sorry. This device is extremely easy to use, has great features, and I'm very impressed so far. I don't want to give away too many details as this thing is still a pre-release product but I did buy the $99.99 "Brick" edition which was an upgrade from the regular black model (yes it is black but it is not the same brick that your Nexus 5 comes in, and that is not a bad thing) so I can't speak much about that version but it has an extra screen and a couple other features that the regular one doesn't. This brick is just amazing. When the product is finally released to the general public I will be the first to say how much this device has changed my life for the better. This is my first ever brick purchase and it has made my life so much easier in so many ways. I'm a little leery about purchasing from this company in the future but I will say that they ship very promptly and in great condition. I would definitely recommend this purchase to any one who is looking to buy a brick.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************* I have had this device since it first came out in early 2007. I had a MacBook at the time, so had only ever used a laptop with an external hard drive and I felt the need to use a larger device. I have a Toshiba laptop with a 500GB drive and the drive was getting full so I got this for my older laptop. It was a perfect fit. I didn't have to format it. I am now at a point where I am upgrading to a Macbook Pro but I need a larger external drive so this is still working just fine. It is easy to set up, easy to use, and I never had to fiddle with the drive. The USB port is very good, if not excellent. If you want the full capacity of an external drive, this is the drive for you. And for me, that's more than enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is my second USB hub from iControl. The first one lasted less than a year before the hub fell off the wall and the power cable broke. I have used it a few times and it is now a workhorse. I use it to connect various computer peripherals (like a mouse, keyboard, and game controller) so they work at full speed and not slow down during the day. The only time that it does not work well is when there is a heavy laptop or a heavy device in use. It does not drop off the stand because it is sturdy and the stand is easy to move. Also it has an input for 5 volt. It is a perfect solution for the power hungry users out there that have a computer and are looking for something smaller and more portable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best speaker I have ever bought. It's not an audiophile speaker but it has enough sound quality for my needs.

I can see now that there is a tiny plastic bit that needs to be shaved off and I was hoping that they would take care of this before shipping me another unit. I received another unit about two weeks later and still have the problem. That's how they handle customer service. I don't expect you to fix my computer every time I get a new unit, but I would really like it if you fixed this problem, because it is very annoying!

When I closed my eyes it didn 't look so good. I've bought a few of these and they have all been pretty bad. There are a few good ones on here and you might like one of them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound of this radio is outstanding. It sounds clear and well balanced. The buttons work great and the radio is well balanced to your head and ears. The volume control was easy to adjust. It was very easy to use and I like the fact that it does not have a "power on/off" switch, you simply turn it on by turning the knob, but you cannot turn it off by simply turning it off! The button to change channels is also great, it's very easy and quick to do and it's much easier than most. It's a great product and I'll be buying more of it.   the price is great and you get a lot for your dollar, the only reason why I wouldn't recommend it is that it is not made of metal and it is more cumbersome to plug in.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- A few years back I got my new ebike, and was very impressed at its weight and performance. But when I had the opportunity to test a couple of different models on a couple different trips (one to the West Coast and another to California), I decided to go with the BBSHD. I was skeptical at first but then I went out and did some rides on it. Now, after almost a year and a half of use, I think I am hooked, and the only thing that would make it better is if the charger could connect to the battery on the front with a cable, rather than the front facing port, so that the unit wouldn't be "swapped" when I'm going up and down hills. The BBS02 does have this feature on the rear, but not on the center port, and my BBS09 did not have this. I'd like to see something that lets you charge both the battery and the charger in the same port. Otherwise, I am happy and very happy with my purchase. ---------------

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.......................................... I have been a loyal Apple fanboy since the early Apple days. Since my Apple 2 with 3.5" disk drive died a year and a half ago I've been trying out other options. I got the first Apple watch recently and it works great. My wife bought a Pebble smartwatch this fall, she loves it, but it's not good enough for my Apple Watch. After trying a couple of other smartwatches I went out and bought the Fitbit Surge. It looks like a nice watch and I like the simplicity of it. I do have to say that my Fitbit Charge does a better job with my AppleWatch. That being said I'm pretty impressed with how good and accurate the FitBit is. It's the only watch that has this feature. It was nice to finally see a true watch for an Apple Watch user.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Fantastic gadget - I have a Toshiba laptop with an external hard drive, it's not very reliable. I wanted a way to backup my files so I purchased this device, as i wanted something with a good USB port, so the speed was more than what I needed. After about 4 months, it has not stopped working - I can connect my external hard disk and the computer (as long as the computer is plugged in) to the Toshiba and the Tosabian. I'm extremely happy with it, i'm looking forward to the day i can put it on my laptop, and be able to use it, but i'm still learning about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the X3 about a year ago. I used it for a few months and it never broke. I was about to buy a second model and went back to the first to upgrade my battery. I went and bought the 4500mAh (w/ the extra battery) and got a 2.4-2.5 amp power supply. I had to spend a good $100. The battery life is about 4 hours.    It was very frustrating to have to buy 2 batteries and change the battery to the new model in about a week and a half.  After installing the power supply I turned off the old battery and ran it for about 15 minutes then reinserted it. I took it out of the box to use it and when I turned on it it was completely dead. I tried a new battery and it took about 15 seconds to power on. I just replaced the batteries and that should fix it.  I would not buy this product again but I am happy to have it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is my first electronic device, I was very skeptical, but I have to say I'm very satisfied. The device works very well, and the price is reasonable. I wish that I had it earlier. Thanks. (Posted on 8/13/2013)  Very happy with the device: This is a very good device. The quality is excellent, the speed of the charging is very good. Very easy to use, no messing around with batteries. And with the batteries included it is very convenient.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been playing with the korg triton 1 for the past several months. it works great and its great for my needs. the only thing that would make it better would be if it had a tuner so you could use the pitch of the note the keyboard represents as a string instead of playing it note for note, but that would add another option i think. other than that this is a great keyboard for the price. i'm also currently using it as an arp on a keyboard.

It is great for travel and it comes with great carrying case and charger. It fits all my iPhone's perfectly. I have an iPad but the phone's are also fine. The only problem is that it doesn't have a cable. I wish there was one. It's a very big iPad case so I had to add some extensions. It works very well on my iPhone 6 and iPad mini. The case can be made for any size. I used it for my iphone 6 and it fits perfectly. *********************** I love this! I have been using it for several years. It has held up well. And the sound quality on my ia phone is great. I am using it on my macbook pro and it has held it's own. I use it a lot for recording.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my unit 2 weeks now and its the best thing that i have ever bought. It can be used as a mobile speaker but most of the time is used in my car as a car stereo. You have to have the receiver and amp in the car to get the best out of it. Also it is an excellent audio player and great for people who want to listen to music on the go. Only downfall is the cord. It is a little thick. I have never had that issue with other audio devices.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just used this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 and had it set to my music. It was easy to use and I was impressed. I can hear the music at a higher pitch and the volume is nice and loud. The only thing that I didn't like was that when you go to change the volume you have to press on the back to access the menu that you can just hit the screen and that takes about half a second to change. I think that should be a slider that could change to whatever you want. I also really like the idea of a remote and with a couple of buttons it would work great.  Write a negative review about the poor battery life:     (the battery life is about average but I'm a light user so it shouldn't be that bad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It has all the features you expect from a smartwatch...  It's got a GPS receiver that works well, plus a microphone for talking to the watch when you're out on the town. It also has a light on the side of the device for showing the time. It has the watch face that most people are accustomed to using.   I've only had it a few months, but so far, so good.   The display is nice and bright, and the size is great. It's got enough battery power to keep you busy for a long time, and with its large screen, it doesn't feel too small to me.   with GPS, it's also easy to use while you're outdoors. With my phone and the GPS antenna, I can go anywhere with the watch.   the only thing I don't like about it is that when the GPS isn't paired, the phone gets stuck in some weird mode that is useless and slows down.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful Very nice watch! March 15, 2015 Reviewer: Robert from Atlanta, GA United States I really like the watch, especially the battery life. It keeps on ticking for at least 3 months without a charge.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This monitor was a great idea. After a few weeks of having a Samsung monitor for work, my wife bought me this model, and it has been fantastic. It works better than any other Samsung monitor I have ever owned. The resolution is great and it is easy to use. The monitor does require a separate USB cable (not included), but it's not a problem since the HDMI port allows it to be used via any HDMI device that doesn't require a specific video cable. I would definitely recommend it. If the manufacturer ever makes a screen like this again, I would buy it over all others.  I will always recommend this monitor to anyone. I have owned a lot of LCDs in my time, and I've tried many different brands, but none of them can hold a candle to this one. I really like it because it is so easy to change the colors without having to mess around with the computer. This is one of the best LCD's I've ever owned (and you can't beat Samsung's pricing).

I have a PN732G which I use for my laptop and it always works fine, but when I was browsing the internet and I would need a new battery for my cell phone, I found you guys and I am so happy!!! You guys have made my life so much easier, now I can use my laptop on my cell for work!!! I love my new one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very reliable battery I am using the battery for the first time today, and so far so good. I have been using the cell phone charger that came with my cell phones for quite a while now, and the battery has gotten a little small for me. After reading the reviews I knew I would have to get a different battery. When I got this one, I was worried that it would be an "alarm" but it has been great. It is very quiet and it is a great size. It also feels very solid.  and for the price, I am glad I took the chance and purchased it  This was the first purchase for my new cell phone and I have to say it was the perfect choice. My new battery did not leak or run down after a month and I did not have to worry about a dead battery. Very easy to use and I love the quick charger. This battery has saved me so much time.  for anyone who has been looking for a battery that does not require an extra charging cord, you won't be disappointed

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best sound-quality headphones I've ever had. I was very happy to purchase these as they have been the only headphones that I've used that have not destroyed my ears. The best part about them is they sound great and the noise cancelling is very good. My only issue is that it doesn't last long enough to last through the day (my kids go to school from early morning till mid afternoon). I would love to have one for more hours but my other ones have already run out of batteries.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from good for studio. but.... I've owned these headphones for more than 2 years now and they were the perfect addition to the set I bought as a gift for an old buddy. Since he doesn't drive (his car had the sound system installed at the time of purchase) we used them to listen to various music and they have always been great. They have a great sound quality and don't take up a lot of room. Unfortunately, they're now too heavy to use in studio as they can't handle my large and heavy microphone stand. I wish they had a little bit more weight in the cups to balance the weight but I still use them for studio, just not as much now. Still an excellent pair of headphones, I'm happy with them and highly recommend them  Customer Testimonials
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1. It's easy to use, simple design, good battery life, but not all functions are as convenient as a USB device.   2. It works well with my Samsung, and it will also run well on my new Sony. I also used it to test the Sony.   the only downside for me is it's cost. I wanted to buy another one, but I can't afford another one. I can try to get one in my local store, but the price is too high. I'm really looking forward to trying the HTC, but can't decide if I can live with the price of the One M8 or HTC One M9.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used this product to make a very simple test for my son. I set it up so he could see it without having to take the computer away from him. He took the computer off the desk and stood right in front of it so I could see him. I had him turn on his computer and was able to see him using it without him touching anything. This is very helpful for his school. Also if your son is working on the computer and turns the computer on without looking at it you can see him because he is right in his face, but he isnt touching it. I would buy this product again. It is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned these for about 6 months now. the usb plugs are a little short, the usb ports are tight, but in terms of function they work fine. the speaker is loud, even with it's low volume settings, and it's nice to hear voice, however they also make a pretty strong noise when connected to the ipod.  I have another brand of ipods, they sound fine as well, but I feel like they have a little bit of extra noise in the background. , they are very quiet in the back.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Amazing product and it came in 2 days! I am very satisfied with this product. The price was very reasonable too! I used to buy a $5 digital camera from a big box store (for some reason you can't buy them there anymore) but it would run out of batteries in a week or so and they were always broken or were a pain to deal with (I have a 5 year old daughter). I finally decided to purchase a good quality camera for myself and wanted something cheap and compact. I wanted an inexpensive way to shoot video and the iBoscam is the best choice. The only thing I'd like to see it has an external power bank so I can plug in my laptop for video editing or anything that I would like to do on the camera.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a little something to take with me on my walks and with my kids. I have the Garmin Fenix 5. It has everything I need with it. I can set it up and sync with my computer and it has everything on there that I need to use. When it came in the mail I couldn't believe that it was in its original packaging. I had to go buy another one just so I could get the new one back so I didn't have to buy it. The Garmin Fenx 5 works great and I can't wait to use it and make some great pictures with my new camera. This is one of the most amazing items I have ever purchased for myself and my family. This is probably the most expensive item I have bought but I couldn?t put it down. It just keeps getting better and better. We have a small family so I use it to keep in constant contact with my sons when he goes away to college and my daughter when she goes away for the summer. I know how to use everything on this watch. It doesn?t show the time or my steps, but if I had this watch it would be like the watch on your phone and I would always have a great picture of me with my children or my wife. I would recommend this watch to anyone that wants a watch that looks great. this is one amazing watch. this watch looks and feels great. it will definitely be the best watch that i have ever owned. it is very well made and is waterproof. you can't beat the price. I will be buying more watches from Garmin in the future I like to use this watch when i'm running. When i start up it has a few seconds of "boot up". Thats it. It will just start up and be on until you press the sleep/wake button. i think the only thing i need to say is it works GREAT!!! I love this watch! It is a fantastic watch, well made, and so accurate. It even works well with my old running watch! I will definitely recommend to all my friends and family. I own one of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My unit came in perfect condition and works fine. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I do not know what to do with all those extra buttons that are on the unit. I guess it is just the way the device works, that a lot of them don't really do anything. If I had known how to do anything with them, I probably would not have paid the extra $40 for the device! I'm going to have to spend the extra money on the keyboard to use as a mouse, and maybe a more expensive keyboard! (I'm a graphic designer) I'm satisfied with the product.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device :  I have been using this device for about 6 months. I bought it to be able to have a simple keyboard and mouse while gaming on my XBox 360 console. However, the keyboard and the mouse are too sensitive for my liking. After spending over $50 on my keyboard I'm not happy with the mouse. I have to click too many times to get a response. I will likely replace the mouse with a cheaper one. I would suggest that they add an LED light to the device. , and that is what is wrong with the LED. The light is off, and the device still looks like it has a key on the back. I purchased a cheap LED light with a button from the hardware store, and it worked great. The LED works great with a few modifications, but that would be a better alternative. I could live without the LED on the light, because I would be happy with a good mouse and keyboard. -D  Other Comments:  5  4
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a software engineer with several years experience. I was first looking for a replacement for my old computer. I found a site that sold them, and bought them on the spot. I have been looking for something like this for months. It arrived promptly, and I was very impressed. I just bought two more. I can see the software coming in handy when working with an old computer, as I do for my other software.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The battery lasts a long time, but you can't use it to do much else besides power the light. I did like the light's performance as a way to alert me when my water heater needs to be fixed. It's also nice to see the temperature of my water change as it changes. I bought the same one for my refrigerator, but I haven't used it for water because it gets pretty cold there. The light is easy to operate, and the LEDs come on reliably. I like that it can switch to a red light if I put the refrigerator out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** Amazing little gadget that allows me to record and stream video from my computer to my television. It doesn't even have to be connected to a computer. I use it to watch a little Youtube video on my computer and then play a quick game on my Xbox, it works wonderfully. It's very easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. Highly recommended.  Best small wireless HDMI recorder! I bought this to use for recording my HDTV, and I was very pleased with it! Great quality and price. I have a Panasonic HDTV that I use for a couple of things, so I don't have to run extra cables everywhere. I got the 2 channel model and am very happy with it.  I bought a second one to put on my tablet for playing music in the living room. This one is my go to for recording HDTV and also recording audio. .  The product is very well made and is very user friendly and very easy for me to use.   I'm not a videographer so I can't speak to the quality of the video and I do not have a computer with video capabilities but I do have a high-end TV that does video and audio. It works great. I'm impressed. ,  best product ive ever used This is the best video recorder i have ever used, I cant wait to order a 2nd one!!!!  Excellent I bought one of these units a few days ago and had great success. It was easy to set up and very reliable.  in fact, it worked great for me at work for recording the entire time we worked on the show.  at least it recorded everything!!!! thank you  WOW! I am amazed at how well this device works. No more connecting extra cables. I live in southern California, we have very limited wifi access outside our apartment. I bought the 2 Channel one and it works great with only one cable. I will say that the quality is amazing. Very clear and easy to understand. It is not as bright as the other units but it works good enough. The only downside is the color of the unit is different than the other models.  of course I have not tested it on my iPad and laptop yet.  "It works!" This is what I was looking for. No need to connect extra cables for my home studio and live room. The best part is that the app does all the work for
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********** I bought this for my husband, he loves the tv and it was simple to set up. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use. I had a problem with my previous tv that was too loud in a very big house. This was easy to fix and worked perfectly. ********** I have bought a couple of these, and they are great. They don't even have a remote for me to use! My only complaint is that there isn't anything that says what type of tv it is, but I don't mind that. I am used to a little more info on most TV's ************* I just recently purchased this television, it is soooo nice. It is very simple to use and is very easy on my old eyes. I really do love it! Thanks for making an excellent product ************ This tv works great. I was a little hesitant because of the price, but it's just too good. It does everything you ask for. The only complaint I have is that you don't have a picture of what the picture will be like. I bought the tv for my son and I thought it was awesome that he can play on it. However, I don`t think it will be so great when he has a little girl in the house ********* I'm very pleased with my purchase, it works well. I have it on for just about every day at work and I don\'t find it a distraction, it's great. The remote is nice and simple, but they really need to add in a picture for it to work ********

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Bought a new monitor for my new computer and it is everything I expected from this. It's light enough to be used at a desk or anywhere, the only problem was a power supply cable broke the first time I used it, but you can't expect that from the first purchase. Everything works perfectly and it looks very good. This is one of those items that you will never buy without.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device is great for working on my 3DS. The 3DS isn't exactly the smoothest, but it is super fun to make and have fun with. It makes you so much more patient to play the game. Also, with the right settings, it can be used to control your home tv. The buttons and buttons can control different apps. You can control your TV. You could even use it to control my Playstation and play PS2 games at the same time. I also have the 2.0 version that I bought because it has a built in memory card reader so you can play older 2.x games with it. Just a great little gadget.  This is a perfect little device: Yes, it works great with a 3DS or 2DS. Also it is small enough to get to the place you need it in an emergency. There was a time when I didn't like the 3D feature on the 3DS, but after using this one, I can see it is a must have for kids. They just sit there all day.    Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a long time audiophile (20+ years). I was using a Sony MDRXB500 which gave me a great sound. I bought the VHX1000 because I liked the sound quality better (less distortion). It has a built in sub and has some of the best sound that I have ever heard. I am very pleased and will continue to purchase from this company. I was very happy with the VHS quality of this product. The price is right. I'm very pleased with it.  Review by T.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Great Value and Good Performance by Mark E. on 6/26/2018 I have had this for several years and the performance from it is great. The speed of it is outstanding. I had an old digital cassette player that the speed was terrible and the signal was garbled. This is the best I have ever used. It is great for playing my old vinyl and cd's. It's so easy to use and you can't beat the price. You can't go wrong with this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great device with a large display that fits nicely into a bag. The screen is huge compared to the rest of the device. The camera is a good feature but could have been better with the added controls for shooting with other cameras. It would have been a great addition if the video capability was included. I've had an Olympus EM1 and a GX80 that are also excellent cameras. This camera is not as good but it is a great camera for those who want a large, high quality screen and a good camera. If you buy this camera then don't get the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 as it has the same screen size and camera. There is also a smaller version of this camera that is the DMC GX8 that has a larger screen and much lower price. Overall this is a perfect product and it comes with an excellent battery and charger that has an indicator light to show when it's charging. I was able to connect an external battery, charger and charger/dock and it worked very well. Overall a great device for the price and I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this one since it first came out. works great. i dont like the battery capacity, but if you dont need a 3xAA battery you wont have to buy another. ive been using this all day long without a problem.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 26, 2011  Good little gadget  by A Customer from Longview WA USA  Pros: It works well. Can be put away and recharged easily. ,  Cons:  Review: This little little toy has a purpose. Its small size makes it easy to keep handy in the bedroom. But it is not as good as a full size electronic device.  with it being so small, and very sensitive, it has some serious battery issues. My model has a 2 cell lithium ion battery with a capacity of only 2xAA. I can charge it up to full capacity in about 2 hours. It works great for a few minutes, then shuts off. I tried to put it to use by sending it to the range to charge at a higher rate. It still does not work correctly. If you have a lithium ion, you will need to find a replacement battery. It does come with a 2 AA alkaline battery with one of the terminals removed. This worked OK in the range for a while, until I tried connecting it to a new battery. I removed one terminal (red in picture) and was able to get it to charge up to 3x its capacity. I then realized that a few hours of use would drain it.  the red "terminal" that comes with the toy is not meant for the small size of the battery. The battery has two terminals. The red one that comes is actually meant to be inserted into a charger and is actually useless when the toy has no battery at all. It could be placed into the battery compartment on a regular phone charger to charge it. I bought a smaller battery and now it charges perfectly, and with the two small terminals on the battery, the battery fits in the toy to allow it to be removed for charging. A very good little toy.  and with a little luck you can use a small coin and not even need a charge. I use it to keep the lights on at night. I know that the batteries last for a long time but I can't see myself using this as an everyday device. A 2x AA battery would be perfect. It is small enough
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device last December to use while playing the new MMORPG Dragon's Crown, and it's worked fantastic thus far. I bought the 8GB model because I was trying to keep my game files backed up on external USB devices, but I'm now using it as a portable USB hard drive, so it's now completely obsolete.   It's a tad heavier than I expected, but the build quality is just so good that I didn't notice it. I would recommend this device to anyone with a portable computer that is used for gaming.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been working on and off for almost two years and finally had the opportunity to purchase one of these to use to make my own "Gravy" My Gravy Maker is a big leap in the right direction from my old kitchen utensils that I always had and I love the flavor.  With that said, I had a very large batch of this Gravy and will be using it for future recipes as I make them.  This was the first one I tried and it took a bit longer for it to become fully cooked.   I cooked it until it was just starting to get thickened, not brown.  Next time, I plan to try it right out of the oven, over high heat.  I may use a heat proof container or it can come out with the lid on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My new wireless router is as good as the rest I have bought in the last five years.  Excellent Product with a Great Price I just purchased a Linksys WRT54G v3 for my home in 2009. My previous router was a Linksvrt WRT843ND. In 2012 I was looking for something more portable, and this Linksys router was just what I needed. The only thing is I had to pay $50 for a D-Link router which is $10 cheaper. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. I have no issues with the performance or features of this router.  I like the fact that I can still access the internet from the inside the house. I like that I don't have to change settings when I need to use the wireless.

It was a lot more convenient than using a meat tenderizer or meat saver. I'm a vegetarian and couldn't find anything similar. I just added some veggies and some dried beans and it was great. The quality of the plastic casing is very good. It's nice and sturdy. I have no complaints other than it took me a while to get all the tools out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for about 4 months now and it is by far the best sound board I have used ive gotten from any company  Couldn't be more satisfied with the sound quality ive experienced through my 2nd sound board from Sound Blaster Tactic 2  Great sound board - I've owned 3 different sets of SB2 and this is still the best value for money. It's extremely versatile and is a great way to learn the ins and outs of what the different channels do  Best sound board, I've ever used. I've been using these from SoundBlaster for 5 years now and they are the only sound boards I buy. I have multiple SoundBlasters and these are my favourites because the difference in quality is immense. They sound great. I recommend them highly.  Sounds amazing. The sound and the sound settings are fantastic. I got this with the SB Pro Studio 4.5, and now I'm using it with my Sound Blaster Recon3D 3.0 and my SoundBlast V2. I can't wait to buy another one of these.  and the Sound Blaster Studio 2 Pro sounds better then this SB2 Pro  I'm still learning about sound and my brain has gotten really strong. I used to get tired of listening to the same sound that others in the audio department have done for so long. I was thinking about the sound of the SB2 when I first heard the SB Studio 2. After listening to that, I was completely sold! The sound quality is incredible. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great addition to our sound system. I think the volume control is easy to use. It is quiet and doesn't have any annoying humming noise. It has plenty of power for the size of the unit, but it needs a small wall mount. The remote is great, just one button for the songs and volume. It's a good deal for the money. It would be nice to have a headphone jack as well, but for now that is not necessary. I would recommend this unit.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this is my second set of this model and I am very impressed. I use it on my desktop as well as portable. The battery life is very long so it is a great battery backup to your portable battery. Rated 3 out of 5 by Aimee from Not as bad as the reviews indicate The sound quality was not bad at all and very good if you plan to use it outdoors or in a noisy room. I would say that the bass is not as strong as the ones I have used in other wireless speakers. That said, the clarity of the sound is good and the speaker is very clear. If you don't like bass or don't want to use a speaker in a quiet room, then this will work for you.  Rated 4 out of5 by Anonymous from Great Audio for the money The sound is a little boomy but not bad. It is not a studio speaker but it can get the job done with just the laptop.

I don't need my other devices to power my computer or even a TV, which is very important for me. I'm sure my other power supplies will last for years!

The throttle is not always perfectly level with the speed of the bike, so you get some weird vibrations in the back. If you ride at the speed limit, that is no problem. Just not at 100kmh. Also, when I want to stop, I have to turn the handlebars 180 degrees to move the bike a bit. The gears are also a little bit loose, but again, the bike isn't really that expensive. I think the e-bike will be a good buy for a novice, just because of the low price. I will buy the next model to go for a more expensive one.  The best ebike ever: ------------ This was my first ebike. I have an old ebike that I love. However, I decided to start my journey into the ekx. It was the best decision I have ever made. It is so comfortable, I can't even remember the last time I had a pain in my butt. If I have a problem with it, I send it back immediately to get it fixed. The range is incredible, I could do all the things I usually do when I ride my mountain bike, like hiking and trail running. My first ride is not even a year old yet, and I'm already able to do some great things. I am already so grateful to the company that made my first ebike. . ------------- I have my bike and I love it. It has been a long time since I have ridden a bike without pedals. I just got my bike, I've used it for a few days and I can honestly say that it really surprised me. The bike was very easy to set up, it was very comfortable, it has very fast acceleration and a very good range (it's only 1.5 km, but I can ride it to the city and back without getting out of the saddle). I am very satisfied with my purchase. This is my third ebike and I am so happy with them. I am very happy with my ebike ------------- If you have an ebike in your garage, try it. The first thing you will notice when you unbox it is that the bike is pretty well built. The frame is made of high quality materials and very comfortable to ride. The electronics and battery are very good. You have a small electronic
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is awesome. When I first heard about this device, I had high hopes. I went to the store and bought it and I had no complaints. I don't have to take the battery out of my mp3 player for it to be in use. The display is nice and clear and it does a great job with its display. It is also a very fast player so you get a lot of information at a time. It can read my phonebook well and does a good job of playing some music on it. I love this device because it is light weight. Its not that big of a device but I still have a lot to do with it and it is a very efficient device. I have been able to use it since it was delivered and I can't say enough good things about this little device.

I like the ease of use of the keyboard and mouse, especially with my kids. I also love the touch screen and the light in the top right. We're using it a lot and the battery life is excellent. It's great to be able to have this at home without having to go to a store and getting an expensive computer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no way to customize the color of the light.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used the unit for about 2 years now. I dont have to change batteries anymore because they last forever and dont even need recharging every 6 months or so. They are always fully charged so if your out of power the unit has to be recharged. I would not recommend this unit to someone who cant get their head around a cell phone, but if you are like me and like having a backup charger in your vehicle I would recommend this.  Rated 1 out of 5 by C.L. from Good for a few weeks, battery has failed on me in 3 months I bought this to replace a battery in my 2011 Honda Pilot. It lasts about 2 months. It gets cold here in Florida so I do not really use it a lot. It was not cheap. I have called a lot of customer service about this battery issue and nothing has been done. I feel like Honda needs to be aware of the high failure rate. I did contact Honda of North America. They said they have no way of knowing if this issue is due to a specific model or if it will happen with any of their products. So they had no comment on this. I am a satisfied customer and I still drive my Pilot, but that is because the other products that were made for the Pilot are so bad, they work.    Rated 5 out of 1 by Joe from The best! I have been using the Garmin eTrex 3500 since the day I purchased it. It has saved my bacon on countless occasions. I use it for a couple of things, the first being as an on road GPS unit. This unit is so incredibly accurate that I use the info in my head. Also, for fishing, I use this unit as a compass, GPS and satellite phone all in one. It is easy to setup. For the price you would have to be crazy to not give it a try.  to the point: I am using this for the fishing. I can use the satellite phone to get help from the locals as well as locate the fish. I was fishing a few days ago and I hit a nice bass and was able to locate it with the Garmin. This thing is amazing and if you do not have one already, get one. You will love it. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the best speakers I have ever had.   I use the speakers in my computer and have them hooked up to my Hi-fi system. This is a speaker for those who love the music and want a little better sound quality and to be more immersive when watching a movie.   is a small and lightweight speaker that comes with a pre-wired and an external microphone. The microphone is a very good one. The speakers have a very low sound volume that is perfect for almost any sound that I use them for. The sound quality is amazing.   in terms of convenience, I would say they are more like a mini portable than a regular speaker.   the speaker cord is very thin, that is probably why they do not have an external input. But the speaker volume is perfect. You can use them anywhere. you can use it on your desk to hear music when you are at work or in the car.     Another thing to note is the sound quality of this speakers are amazing and this is a great product that will make your music more immersive.  /r  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********The quality of the sound output on this device is exceptional. I'm a huge fan of the high quality DAC (digital to analog converter) technology used in the Bose sound system. I've had a lot of devices which cost thousands of dollars and I've never had a sound quality that was anything short of stunning. My Bose system was also in a high end, multi room listening room, and the speakers on this unit are just that, high end speakers. They don't make much noise, but that's the price you have to pay to get that kind of sound from these speakers. My only real complaint about the sound of this device would be the overall lack of bass. Most people would want to hear the bass with this device, and it doesn't have any. If you listen to anything with great bass and don't mind listening to low volume you should really give this device a try.Read full review

I've been using the K70 with my home theater rig for over a year now and it has performed flawlessly. My favorite features are that the volume and inputs are all set to the "home theater" volume level and I can switch between the various inputs (CD/DVD/Blu-Ray/Game) in the blink of an eye. The K70 also has a very good quality headphone jack and USB port so I can connect my own headphones and use the device at work.

If you have had experience with the Pico 10 it's definitely no different. I've been using this keyboard for over a month now and would recommend it for anyone.   in general i find it a bit easier to use and get the feel of typing on it than my Pico 4 which is now in its 3rd month. I'm using the touchpad and I can use it just as I do on my P4.  ,, I would highly recommend it, the screen is beautiful, it has the keys you need and it is easy to program and use.If you've had experience you know, it's not easy.

It is fast, quiet and durable. The price was amazing. I love it! The only downside is the battery life, it lasted for 3 days but with a few hours of gaming it went dead. I wish it would last longer. The only way I found to make it last longer was to put a couple of games on it. So I'm going to take it back to Amazon and get a better battery.

This is my 3rd digital audio player, I just purchased a Pioneer XDP-1 and I use it with the same DSP that I have used on my HDHOGs and this player is just as powerful. I love the fact that it comes with a USB cable and that you can plug in my Apple iPod, I've used mine with my iPods and iPads, and this one has the same feature set and has more buttons to control it.   The only thing I would change would be to have an option for the power switch so you could turn it off before you connect your iPod to it. The player itself is nice, has good controls and a lot of buttons. It's not a cheap or junk player but it's great for the price and the product is well built.   in the box: --------------  DSP  1.3GB MP3 player  USB cable

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, August 31, 2008  I am an A beginner player and I have used this and a few others to get started. However, the last couple of items I bought that I couldn't use because I was so impressed by them, have gotten rid of the whole lot. The unit looks great, the quality is nice, the interface is easy to use. The only thing is that the unit has a few problems. 1: the controls on the unit are in the same positions as the rest of the unit. The ones on the units that are supposed to be the controls seem to be on the front left or right side of the control unit. This makes it very difficult to operate the controls. 2: I'm not a good guitar player so I've had trouble picking up the pickups and switching between them, not a big deal because the controls have the same function as in other units so the problem is not a design flaw. 3: I've noticed that the button that switches between the tone and volume switches is not wired. I've found that by pressing and holding the switch for 5 or 10 seconds, I can get the unit to switch between the two.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a new way to send my e-mail. I've tried many, many ways, but this is the first one that really works, and the quality is very good. I would say that it is better than my old machine and works well for what I want it to do. I am very satisfied with it and wish I found it sooner. Thank you! It works very well! I bought this a while ago, and it has been working great! The only issue I have is that it's so small and light that I can't see very well, so when I'm trying to send an e- mail, I try to use my mouse to quickly select words, and when it looks like a little dot of light it's hard to see. I'd recommend this, but a mouse would be nice! Easy and simple This is the best and simplest way to write and send e-mails. When I use this device for the first time it was a little annoying to find it but after a while it makes life so much better! I've had it for about a month now and I am a satisfied customer. I love the fact that I don't have to type so much. I can use it as my only e- message system because I don´t have to remember a lot of characters or even look at the screen. Also I get lots of e- mails, which is always a plus. It has many features. One of the features is that you can send a message to another person by putting two addresses on a card with an X. I used this to send a picture to someone, without needing to worry about the other person receiving it. It's also very useful for messages that have a special meaning. I would recommend this product to my friend.

I bought this stereo to replace my old Sony stereo that had stopped working. I love this stereo!   The sound is really good, good bass response and vocals are nice and clear. The bass is nice and low without being overpowering, so it's not the best sounding stereo out there, but the quality of it is excellent. The quality is also great with stereo effects added to the songs like the "Razor blade" and "Stairway to Heaven" in the songs "Halo" and on "My Hero". This stereo makes it a lot easier to dance and really listen to the music. I really like that it has stereo effects as well. The remote can also be controlled with the remote.   Overall, I think this is a really good stereo. I am also very pleased that it comes with a 3 year warranty and comes with all the necessary cables to power it up. I've already started using it and have a great time with it, so I will definitely purchase from here again.   The stereo is really easy to set up and use, it comes in a very nice box, it is sturdy and feels good in the hand. I highly recommend this stereo, especially to anyone who wants to make music/TV/video sound quality their highest priority.

Also I highly recommend it to all who want to be able to listen on the go. Thank you, I am glad to have it. I just needed a portable way to listen  in public without getting into trouble. Now I am also able to take this to school to listen without it taking up too much space. Thanks so much for a great product, I will tell a friend about it. Great product!!!  I had to buy a portable iphones to take with me on trips since they were very limited in capacity. I use my ips everywhere now and I find this to be the best iphon iphoner to carry. I have owned 3 iphons now, and this one is by far the best one. The volume control is pretty easy to manipulate. The only down side to this portable device is it is a little flimsy. But still a great investment. I bought this for my husband as he is deaf. He can't use a cell phone, yet he could use this. It's super convenient, very quiet, very portable and very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't have a headset jack. But for a portable, that is a minor thing. Very easy to make the portable music device with this little gadget. I bought it because I use it in public, and my colleagues asked me what it was for. I tell them that it's a small mp3 player. They get surprised because they never heard of a portable mp3 device before.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used a lte-6200 for two years now and its an excellent purchase  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, January 22, 2009  Works well  by Andrew from San Diego, CA  Pros: USB 3.0, no cables, works well    Cons: The keyboard is too tiny for my hands and it is very hard to use.  Review: The lte6200 is not a good computer because of the keyboard it comes with. But, that was probably the point of it being a computer in the first place. You are supposed to use a keyboard with a lot of keys, a lot that are easily missed when typing, especially on a device that has a touch screen.   The lte's touch screen works fine with one finger but not two. When I need to use two fingers it gets very uncomfortable.  the touch screen on this is the same size as a smartphone and it takes up way more space  Other Thoughts: If you are like me and prefer to use your phone for typing then this is not for you.  that is why I give it a 4 star rating.

It is also so small it is hard to get the mouse or the track pad in/out of position without putting your finger on top of the unit.   the touchpad is not easy to maneuver in and out of place and sometimes if you get it wrong it makes your tablet hard to control.  ,   User Interface: it's hard to find a nice set up on this device, it can take quite a while to figure out. You get a small display, an SD card slot, and a full sized USB hub for additional devices, a small usb keyboard (included) and a micro USB power cord. The hub does not always work perfectly, the micro USB is difficult to get into/out. The sd card slot is too large and can't hold a lot more than one large photo,

We have been through two devices of this type and this one does a great job. I have not had to try hard to get it to work, so it must be a good design. I don't have an issue or complaints about it. :-D  Helpful?  Yes  It Works!  No  Have not tried hard to turn it on or off  Overall a good product  Good product.  and now it is 2.0! I love this product! I have 3 of these (all 3 different brands) and they work flawlessly and are very easy to replace. They keep my laptop running smooth and quiet, so much so that I have had to replace a couple of the components to keep it that way. I am very happy with this product. I also have been using it for a few months now and it keeps working well.   A few issues:   1. The power supply is small. I ordered a new one, which is why it is so low. My last power supply was the standard type, which works just fine.   the "modes" on the "settings" are a pain in the ass, just set the unit to be on "off" when you first plug it in, and then set the rest to what you like. (I had to put my original power supply back in, otherwise I would have had no power on for a while.)   2. The "mode" for this is different than most power supply's. I find it quite a little difficult to control it. I can change it from on, to off, to on, and off, and still it gets confused. This is most annoying when I want to charge the battery without having to turn the power off, I also find it very annoying to "set" the power on with a "mode", just turn it back on again. It would be great to be able to choose a "
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is a perfect product for any user. It's easy to use, works flawlessly and is easy to maintain. I use it with my computer and my iPhone, it works great with both. I had some troubles with my first one but they were resolved by a replacement. You just have to be careful when doing it and check your plug for an electric fault. I don't think i would have bought it if i had known it's history before.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ The Mavic Pro is one of the best I've owned. I have owned many other devices, but none are as light and easy to handle as this. It's fast, light, and powerful enough to fly high-altitude photography. I like having a camera on the go, and the Pro has a quick-release mechanism for easy transport or travel. It has no moving parts, which makes it extremely durable and reliable. ------------ I got this from B&H for $119 and it's a great deal. It took about 2 days to arrive, and is well packaged. The battery life is excellent, and it has a wide variety of different settings (ISO, shutter speed, exposure, white balance, etc) I use most of them on the same day. ------------- It's also very compact, which is good for the size of the camera and lightweight. It weighs 1.5 pounds and has a 3/8 inch tripod mount. I'm so glad to have purchased it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by John P. from Easy to use, quick and light I had a Canon Rebel SL1 for a while and then I bought a D810. I was using this same camera for several years with no issues and then decided to upgrade. I already had this new mavic. It is light and I love the built in GPS and the built-in wifi. This thing works great! It took me a while to learn how to use it but it is not complicated and I'm not an expert.

Do not get caught up in the hype of "I have the next big thing" you will pay a heavy price for. If you take the time to learn about the limitations of your device, then it will be a lot more enjoyable. This is a guide for the newbie and more experienced electronic users who are seeking a new device to improve on.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little device that performs the job well. The only issues I had were when connecting it to a computer I found the USB ports don't fit very securely. Also, the battery life isn't great, but then again you probably won't be using it more than 2 or 3 hours at a time. Still, the unit is very portable and looks nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The TLC5963 is a pretty nice device. It seems to work well, it is easy to use and very powerful. One of the major downsides to this device is that it is only compatible with USB 2.0. While you could get a cheap usb hub to convert to USB 3.0, it only costs around a $10 (more if you have a good USB 2 device). That being said, it still works fine in my home office.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! The sound is great and you can't beat the price. Love the sound, price, ease of use and functionality. I have this one with my iPhone and it works soooo well and is pretty much everything you'd want. It's so easy to set up and works just as you'd expect. Also, the remote that comes with it is pretty amazing. Very responsive and easy to use. Very easy for me to connect my car, and my iPod (all connected with this one and the car remote). I'll definetly be buying this for my next car. The remote works great and is easy to turn on and off. Thanks so much for making an excellent product. I'm really happy with it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mike from I've been waiting for a remote control for my iPhone for some time. Finally bought this unit at the dealership in hopes that it would be able to control my phone without an Apple Remote. I wasn't disappointed. I love the sound quality and the ease of using the app. My phone is easy with the button.  and that's about it. For the price, its a great unit  This is a really great product.  the sound is just like my iPhone, but with more features. it's a better product for the money  I like the remote and the sound for the price but if you have an iPhone it's hard to control them all
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am just starting to learn to solder and this works great. Easy to read voltages on the tester. I like the ability to set the voltages for all three wires. The only real problem I had was getting all three leads to be placed right on the copper surface. If you do a clean-up with your soldering iron before it's time to solder, it's easy to clean up the copper. This was my first real electronics project. I was concerned about it blowing up because it's a "big" component. I've read about this. The "small" chips that are in all your calculators are probably not the problem. The chips inside the computer are the issue. The little chip is too hard to solder. They are designed to be easy to solder but they are hard. This is a good investment and I can't wait to see what this thing does.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device works perfectly, but a problem that I have with it is that if your wireless router is not in the same room or on the same subnet as the wireless connection, the device would not be able to connect to the network (so if I have a neighbor with a fast wired connection I can connect to that, but if I want to get access to my computer over the wireless network, this does not work). I had a similar problem when I had the previous version, so I was hoping that this new version would work. However, I also had the same problem with the old version, and after a few days of trying and getting no response on my email, I thought I was just getting really old and dumb.

There is some light bleed and I have to compensate with a hand held stop light or a flash in the right place, but for a beginner it's not too much of an issue. I did get a slight wobble as I moved the unit around. Not a deal breaker though. Overall I'm happy with it and recommend it to everyone. ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been a loyal user of this product for over 5 years. I used to use my old cell phone for all my calls and I had a little problem with battery life. I would plug my old phone into the old computer and my older cell phone into this new computer. I had to turn on both the computer and phone at the same time. My old computer would run out of battery but the new one kept charging up. This was no problem with my old computer. Now I have to change all the batteries for my old one and also replace the phone battery. You would think that a $200.00 computer would do that by itself. I am not sure why my old battery is so expensive. I was very impressed with the new phone and the phone charger.  Write a negative review about an indifferent electronic device/programming: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________ I have had this keyboard for a couple months now. This is the first time I am using it for writing text on a computer, so it took me awhile to get used to the keys. They are a little stiff at first, but I can get used. I do have a small gripe with the battery life: If I want to use this keyboard without an Internet connection, I need to be connected to a wireless network. This results in me having to press the ESCAPE key every 5 minutes, since that is the number of times I want the computer to go to sleep while connected to the Internet. But that's pretty easy to fix. One thing that I do like, is that the USB cable included with the keyboard is long enough to allow me to use it for multiple games on the same keyboard. I use it on my Mac and on my Xbox 360. It's worth it, for now at least.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************************** I have been a huge fan of the AppleTV for many years. I finally bought one. I use it for all my TV streaming and music. It's a big success for me. I was so excited when it arrived. And I like the app that comes with it! The interface is easy to use. The app makes it simple to search, search for shows, find specific shows, and get to the shows. You can change the default TV channel with a button in the TV, which is nice for those who don't want to use the app. The user interface has not changed from tvOS 7.1.1, but I don't mind it. I know there is a new version coming out soon. But, this is an updated version. You do not need to upgrade if you don't plan on using the app or if you have an older AppleTV model. So, if you are not a fan of using the Apple TV, this will work just as well. I will update this review with what changes I noticed. And please keep this on the iPhone and iPad because it is the only way to get an Apple TV. Also, it is a really great size.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Matt from Just what I wanted - so far. The Apple TV is by far the best Apple product I have used. The interface was designed with the purpose of making everything as easy as possible. I am extremely satisfied with the interface, and have used it for watching movies, games, music, and everything in between. The sound is crystal clear and I am able to stream movies or TV shows without the annoying sound that comes from the Apple remote. The only disappointment I have with the Apple is the lack of support for other streaming services (iTunes and Vudu) as well as Vudue (an app that is similar to Hulu with a subscription). I love my AppleTV and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first E-cigarette. I have read a lot about them but was a bit scared at first.

It is well made, it has many features and it can take a beating if you are a smoker.  I received my new E-cig and it really is a great product for the money, looks great and works great, but the only con is that it doesnt work with my cell phone, so I will have to buy a second one to use on my iPhone. I would definitely recommend it.  the only thing i would change would be to make it smaller, so it would fit in my hand easier, it could also be rechargeable and in the future i plan to get a rechargeable battery
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's great for your iPad, it's easy to use, and the quality of the display is amazing   I bought this to replace my iPod dock that has become cracked. I've been a music geek for a long time and had the original iPod for years. I loved the simplicity and convenience of using the dock on my desktop computer. I thought I would upgrade the iPod again, but I found this one just too good to pass up. The display is bright and clear, it holds a charge for an extended period, and it's easily portable. I'd highly recommend it, especially if you need to carry it in your pocket or backpack!  If you are a big fan of a large screen that has a comfortable keyboard, you'll love this for sure. I own 3 Apple iPods now and this is by far the best. I'm a software developer and this keyboard is a godsend.  It is nice to have a keyboard with the power of a full-size keyboard, with the convenience of the touch screen. This will definitely make your life easier.  the only con is that there are so many other keyboards, and you might need a couple of extra keys to get the most out of this keyboard. .  I don't think it was worth it but still it is a great keyboard.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, December 04, 2011  Perfect!  by Andrew from New Mexico USA  Pros: Small and easy to use  Cons: None  Review: This mic is the best thing to have for home recording! I have a lot of room for my vocals in my home studio and I have so many other devices I have to record everything with. This mic gives me all of the sound I need. There is no distortion at all and it's great for mixing with other mics. . ,I wish it came with a mic/line input so I could add a mic to my line-in and send that to a mixer or a recorder. I will try that out when my current line-out is done with! The sound of this mic is amazing! It's not a little bit "sweet", it's a lot "warm" and rich! I can't believe that's an accurate description. I also love the fact that I can plug in any type of audio interface (or other device that has an input on it) and connect it to this mic. It will record just as if it was an input from my interface. The only thing that I wish this mic had is a mic plug-in jack on the bottom of the mic. There are some mics on the Market that come with a plug--in in the back which I am looking to replace soon!  to my experience this mic works great! I am using it in my audio mixer with my Zoom H2n and the audio is great. I just love it! I'm very satisfied with it. I've been a customer for 2 years and I will continue to be a customer. :D  was this review helpful to you?: Yes No Friday, November 11, 2011

I really like this device.  Best Portable Media Player  By Chris on July 31, 2012  I've been looking at portable media players for a while. There's the ipod, iPod, Samsung T1, and even the Sony ZL1. It didn't take long before I realized there must be something better out there.   The only con is that the battery life is pretty long, around 3-4 hours. I use a phone for phone calls. After my first phone call (from the T1), the battery was at about 90% so I thought that meant it was almost empty, so I gave it another 4 hours, thinking it'd be just fine. The battery died about 10-15 minutes later.     Now I'm not complaining, I'm glad my phone battery died on me.  ,   As someone else said, it has a large screen for reading books. I was a bit surprised at how large the screen was. And I'm very pleased with the battery. And the remote is the best remote on the market, if not the best. If it were my phone, I would buy one.  and for those who love the ZL family... you're in luck because we are working on it.  "  iPod Touch  by Jason on August 09, 2010  The first thing you'll notice about the iPod Touch is that it is just not very "mobile". It is designed to be held in your hand, not on a table. It also looks like a small MP3 player and it is not. It's about the size of a credit card, which I thought was odd until I realized the size and weight are not that different from a cell phone.   that said, if you are a book reader or a music listener, the iPod is worth the price. ..  best mp3  In the world  Reviewer: Steve on September 14, 2009  These are the best mp3 players available.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very happy with my first purchase from Apeco. I wanted a simple control unit, but with an LCD display. I love the controls, so easy to use. I bought the battery powered model and also the USB. The power is good, but you do need to plug in to your computer (or other device). The interface is a little old fashioned but it works well. It's a good buy and will make the difference in my work. The ApeCo unit will make me a more efficient computer user!  Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device :  This is a great unit, I really like the LCD display and it seems like a really good control system. The problem is the fact that it does not have a microSD card slot. It is possible that you can buy an adapter to make one or even replace the card. I haven't tried it yet, but I don't think you can do anything to this unit that would be different from the original. I'd recommend this to those looking to improve their productivity with an inexpensive device.  No Ratings Yet

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an amazing product at an amazing price. The batteries are great, it works as described, I don't have to mess with chargers and it's super fast. I'd like to give 5 stars for all of it. I have to say the light is a little strong on it's own but I got mine with the extra batteries. If I buy the single battery I may not like it as much since I can't go out and find batteries for it. Also the charger is a bit short on it (which could also be an option) but that is my only real complaint with it. If you are thinking of this light or a light like it you should buy it. It's a great product and definitely worth it! I did find that the switch was a little hard to operate at first so it takes a little practice. But I was able to get it to work without a problem. I love it so far and I do not regret buying it. Nice product, doesn't feel cheap:       The product is pretty awesome and comes with the battery with extra batteries so you don't need to go buy new ones unless you just want to have a couple on hand. One thing I don t like is that the flashlight isn't a true 1x. It only has one AA battery but you can buy the second to have it switch to second power. The second battery has a longer cord which I would think would be useful since you only have one battery to use, and one AA to spare. I'm guessing you could use a spare AAA battery with it to make it run with two AA, but not sure. Maybe if I had another AAA battery on me it would have worked with the switch or I could have just kept the one AA I have on me. Great product! If you need an everyday flashlight I definitely recommend this. The only issue I had with the light was that it started to flicker in the first couple of days after getting it. My only suggestion is that you add a switch to turn off the light when you don t need it, I guess they have to be like that because that is not possible with this light and all of the other cheap ones out there.  Great Product, but, not perfect. A bit difficult to use and you have to charge it manually. But it's worth it, great price and great quality product. Great buy for the price! I have to admit

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Friday, April 12, 2010  Great. I am happy with this product. The instructions are easy to follow.  by A Customer from New York NY USA  Pros: Great product, easy to use. :): Cons: I found the battery indicator to be inaccurate. When the battery is low, it doesn't give you an actual indicator.  the "high" level indicator was off by about 5%.  I purchased this for my older Sony Playstation 2, but I use it on my Sony PlayStation 3. This thing is amazing, I have not had any issues with it whatsoever. I will recommend it to anyone. It does exactly what I need it to.  and if anyone is having a problem with the battery, they should take a look at their power cable. The cable is the one that is soldered onto the power brick on most Sony product. If you see it, replace it. The battery cable is a little weak. .  is a great device.  are all good. i used it with my sony sds. is it any good?  was this review helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, February 08, 2010

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought this device and it is awesome. The battery life is good and it works just as well as my old phone. If you have a small device like mine its really great to have an android phone and a mini computer at the same time. The only thing i could complain about is the fact that it comes in a very small box which is annoying but the only other complaint i have is that it is a bit hard to operate. But its not too big of a deal. I recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to spend alot of money and just wants a simple computer.  Write a negative review about the same thing: this android phone is a bad buy if your like me and want to carry around a real computer so i got this android and it was a total joke. i lost my connection with my apple ipod and now i can't even turn off my android. it has to be turned on and off by holding down the power button, and that is a real pain. also the camera is no good. i've had my ipod on and this android just hangs, when you look through the camera it just turns off. 's only issue is that i really wish they would release the pc mini aswell, which should be a full size pc and the pc pro, which i love, but i cant get it to connect to my ipad at all. -The only reason i gave this 2 stars is because i can see how many of these cheapo phones can only be used with android, but if you're looking for a very good mobile, i would go with an apple ipad and an ipad mini.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my son to replace his old school computers, the old computers had problems with the power supply and the power button. I needed a computer that could do all the things my son needed at home. I was very happy that I bought this. It does all the stuff that he needed with the ability to change the settings for things he didn't use all the time like volume, and the video settings. He also can switch between internet and computer mode when he goes to his homework. He had it for a month and I think it has performed very well. He loves it.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My iPod's screen was very bad. I have tried various Apple repair shops in my city and they all thought the iPhone screen is good, but in my opinion not good enough. I called Apple and they said the repair was free.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for something that would allow me to do remote desktop, but also have the ability to record my screen to use as a remote control for my computer and to do my web browsing. It is very easy to use. I have been able to remotely monitor my windows desktop from my iPhone. I can also remotely connect to my Mac with iTunes to do some of the tasks i have been doing on my computer. I did not have to install anything on my mac except the apple usb dongle that is included in this package. The product works very well, and i was able to connect to windows and my computer with a bluetooth donglet very easily. I would recommend this product to all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Theo from I'm on my second (and third) this little gem and can't be happier. It's the easiest to use in the room it's in. I'm an electrical engineer by trade, so the extra functionality is a huge bonus. I've had mine for about 3 years now and am extremely pleased. The unit is easy to assemble and does not require a screwdriver. I was able to just screw the power cord in and plug it into the outlet and I was good to go. I'd highly recommend to anyone who needs one and has the budget for it. I have the blue unit as well and love it.  4.0 out of 4 stars  Barry C from Chicago, IL USA I'm a retired electrical engineer who has had plenty of experience with electronic devices and this thing is amazing. I own a TV, but when the signal is disrupted the TV turns off and has to be plugged into a wall outlet. Now this little box will take the signal and send it via the coax to the TV. I can watch the channels and I can still turn on the TV and watch it. It works great!  5.0  of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this iomega xl2500 in for 4 months now and it works fine  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 10, 2014  Works as Advertised  by Michael from North Hollywood CA USA  Review: Works as advertised.  Pros: very little power for a little unit  Cons: none  Comments: Good product but it needs better instructions. - The power button does not function  - the button is a lot harder to press than it appears  Reviewer: Richard W from California  Price: I paid $14, was impressed with it but the power button is NOT functional. The unit can be turned on and off but you must press it hard with one hand. It is not like any other button on the back of a computer. The power unit also has 2 LEDs on the front which show "Power on" and "Standby". It would have been great if it had a built in turn on/off button. The software to operate the iomegas iomex is not very easy to use or understand. I had to learn how to do everything with the manual. I did have a problem with it being a bit hot on the bottom which is something I never would have had if I had not bought it. I would not recommend this device for anyone who has never used a computer before.   Was the Review Helpfulto you? No Yes Saturday, June 28, 2014

The only thing I didn't like about it is that there is no way to send photos through it, I've found other options that you can send your pictures through with your computer. Also, if you try to send a picture through your computer it just sends a picture to your computer, not the phone. Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to use with the iBook 2 that I bought a while back and love it so much! I don't see how anyone can put together a better audio/video device for the price.   The quality of the sound is just perfect. The color of the backlight is also perfect. I use my iBook with it all the time. The only issue I have with this product is the usb port is in the back of the iBooks so I have to plug it into an external usb port and use it with a usb keyboard which is a little annoying but not a big deal. If anyone is using a usb port on the back they need to look at this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The E5 is a perfect device for the money. I've tried many of the small budget models but none are perfect for me. This is the best one to date. It fits perfectly, and is light enough for me to carry on a long run. The sound quality is great. I can feel my heart beating with the power on. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone looking to upgrade to a much better device."   I would like to add that there is no way to remove this thing from the charger (other than disassembly), you have to remove it and then place the charger in a specific spot (or screw the battery back in) or risk losing the power switch (there is no option to lock it in place). In my opinion, this is a very bad design flaw, as if you can't take it out of the charger at all you risk losing it if you forget to lock the battery in place at all.   The case is an upgrade over the original, with better protection against accidental damage and increased protection against drop damage.   the E5 has 4xAA battery's in it, 2 for the remote, one for the transmitter, and one for your heart rate monitor/activity tracker.  'three of the batteries in the E-5 will last for about 3 weeks, the other two will last anywhere from 5 to 12 hours.

This has been over five months since I bought the car.   In addition, I do not like the fact that when I turn the ignition, the engine light goes on and off. I understand that if the engine dies, it may not work again, but it would be nice if it would remain off until the car starts to run.

I bought it because my last one stopped working, it was a Samsung smart tv and i wanted an iphone compatible iphones  i never owned a tv and when i got my phone in the mail i noticed the screen was a bit darker than normal  and then I plugged it in and the screen started to flash white. I thought the box would not work  because the screen had gone green and the charger didn't work but then I got to work and it worked!!   My main question is this: why does it have the usb and usb 2 connections but not the USB 3?  I don't have a usb cable or any way to get a usb 3 but this seems very odd.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Excellent product. Would buy again if required  Great quality, quick delivery, and I was amazed at the sound quality  This soundcard is excellent for the price. I am using it in a S.E.I.R.D.I computer and I have not had any problem at all. Very pleased with this purchase.  The sound card is as advertised. It is not the best sounding sound card for the money but for the time being it has worked fine for me  Good product, fast delivery, great sound quality, all the time the board is running perfectly. -Ran into a problem with the usb port that could be a short circuiting issue and the product had to be returned. ,  Sound quality is very good, and the usb output was too noisy but not bad for a small pc, not the perfect sound card  I bought the Sound Blaster Tactic2 soundcard and was really impressed by it. It comes pre-installed with an excellent quality sound card. I have used it on a computer, and it works great. I also found that it gives a better sound quality than other sound cards I have tried. The drivers are good, so you can easily run the Tactic into your favorite video card and do your sound card adjustments with ease.  be careful with using the PC, you might burn a lot of your HDD. the card only has a one sided usb and a 4.3 usb so make sure you don't plug in the other side with an old keyboard or mouse.  it comes preinstalled with a very good sound card, but I bought a second one just in case  A great product! I have purchased two of these for my desktop computers. Excellent sound quality. The USB output is too loud, and with the two separate ports in a single sound card (with an old computer) you can't even use the sound card with a second monitor (which is a necessity with this PC). So be sure to buy a sound card without two separate USB ports to make use of this card.   If I would have bought one of these back in the early 2000's I'd have gotten a good product at a better price. It just isn't there anymore.  :)  Purchased two of this in my two pc's. First I bought one in the late 90's and this one arrived earlier this year. The sound card itself is good

I do have to keep some paper and tape around it so the SD Card slot won't be easy to insert. I'm really pleased with the N64 adapter. This is my second N64. This time around I bought the controller. The controller is so nice to play on that I never want to use the original controller. I can't wait to try out Pokemon Stadium on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this on a whim. I've never used a pen before and I was a bit scared of the different buttons on a pen. I bought it as a gift for a friend and as soon as I had the device with me, I used it. It's very easy to use and very easy in terms of navigation. I love that it can be refilled with bottled ink or that you can write in different fonts on the back. I can't believe that a company this small can produce this quality and at such a low price tag. Definitely one of my new favorite things to do with it. Thanks to Icom, I get to enjoy this and so many other things.

I thought that after two months of not having a pen, that I had just gotten used to writing on a computer keyboard but this thing has been my savior and a lifesaver at times. I have never used it for anything more than a quick review for my friends since it requires a lot of power and I need to be able to easily write a review. So if you want something with a little more power and to keep a little longer on it's battery, I suggest this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned a SONY A800 for a number of years now. The camera is great. The sound is very good. The features of the camera are really great. I have used the Sony A800 and Sony A400 digital cameras for a few years now and the pictures have been very good to me. In fact, I have never had an issue with the camera. I am still using this camera on a regular basis. I use it primarily for movie shooting as I have the SONY X-Pro1. The picture is really sharp and the sound is great but what I really like is the ability to shoot in any color temperature I want. I can also change the sound from the camera so I don't miss the sound of an onscreen person talking. This makes it a very useful feature to have. The software is pretty basic to begin with and that is the way I like it. The only thing that I wish Sony would have done to make it more user friendly is to have more buttons on the camera to make things easier to use. I don 't like when I have to dig around to use one of these cameras. In addition, I really appreciate the way the camera is mounted on my camera. It just makes the whole experience even better. I like the buttons on this camera because they are easily accessible even with gloves on. I really don't like when the camera can be knocked and the camera falls on my leg. Overall, I think this camera is an excellent choice if you want to keep your camera out of the box for a while and shoot just about anything. I think the best thing about this camera though is the fact that you can just buy the camera and use it for years without having to replace the camera battery.  If you are thinking about getting the camera I would say go for it. It's a good camera for the price. If you are looking for a better camera than the A700 go for the A800 because the A900 is a lot more expensive than it is. , January 23, 2014

The remote control works as expected   It is easy to setup   My only concern is the battery life. The battery life is better than I expected but I think it is because it is battery powered. The speaker gets a little warm during use. I have only had the system for about 2 weeks so I am not sure if the heat causes a decreased battery life or if it is the speakers themselves. If you can install a battery holder on the speakers it would help to reduce the heat. I am considering getting a 12 volt battery to power the speakers instead.  . I think the unit is worth the price for the sound quality. It is a very clean system with very accurate bass. I would not consider using the unit as an actual PA speaker.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my father as it was a gift to him to be able to use his PC without having to buy a laptop and a monitor. It has served him well. It was easy to set up, easy to use, and the speed was very good. If you want a small device to carry around and not have to worry about it being too slow, this is a great product. I just wish that it had a headphone jack. It's a good price but would have been nice to have that feature.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good product and is very well built. I purchased it to do a project on radio frequency frequency. You can read about it and see the results on my blog.   The only thing I wish they could do is come out with a larger enclosure and maybe a little more storage space. It is not really that big, but is tight on the storage inside.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this item in March of this year and I really liked it. I got it because I was looking for a way to take pictures on my phone without taking a camera out. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. The only thing that I did change was the camera settings. I moved the shutter speed up to 1/250 and turned off the flash. The picture came out pretty good. I would recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Love my VTC5 I bought this because it's an excellent product for a great price. My VTC3 has a lot of the features that I love, including the ability to power your VTC4, VTC7, and VTC6 from the same battery. It's very easy to use, and my only regret is that it doesn't work with my KK1, and I'm not sure if it would work with the VTC2 or VTC 5. It has all the functionality that I needed, and it's priced very well. It works well with my V3, V3+, and V3+K1.  Excellent product and price:  I just purchased my second vtc 5 from vapour dragon for my new k1. The price is absolutely amazing for the quality and functionality this product has. This device is everything you would expect from a vtc5 and even more than vtc3 and vtc4. I recommend this to anyone looking to step up their vape gear game
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! My new MacBook Pro with Retina display has arrived today. This computer is by far the best I have ever owned! I have a 24" Dell S2716DG display, and this computer does not lag on it at all. The keyboard and mouse have all the features I am looking for and it does all that it says it does. It has a built-in external graphics card. I am currently on a long distance flight to Florida, and the computer has been running nonstop. It does not get warm at all (unless you are playing for an extended period). The fan does not stop working, so you do not have to worry about it. I would recommend this computer to anyone that wants a computer that does everything and does it very well.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Best purchase ever. A few years back i bought a MacBook and it was great for the time, i was never a fan of it. One day my son got this to replace it and this has improved my experience for everything. My son is not only very happy with his new computer it works great and has enough RAM to run my programs. I'm sure it will last him a long time and with all that storage on it, I'm going to be using it for all my video work and photos. He loves his new laptop.  be patient, this machine is not a speed demon  Product Rating: 5 out-of-5-rep
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ A fantastic little gadget, very easy to use, especially if you are going to be working with it away from a computer. It fits very snugly into my pocket, so I can use it with my keys, and it fits into my shirt pocket. Also, you do have to use a battery that you can buy, since the batteries don't last very long and you will have to replace them, but they still last for a while. I use mine with my cell phone and my keys as well as my car key.  I would give this product five stars: -------------- I recently received my device and I have to say I am very impressed. It has saved my life many times, and its very easy for me to use. I used this for my car keys, my cell number, my email address, and my car's key. I have not had any problems with the devices working properly. It is a good product and I would give it four stars if there were no problems. - Anonymous  Read more customer reviews...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new xtremem2 looks better than the old one. But I still hate the buttons. You have to move the pointer so that it has the "home" position. If you want to use the back key to return to the home screen (which is a nice feature) you have to press the button on the left side of the keyboard a bunch of times. The back and home keys should be moved in a different way.   I know you guys say this device is the new iPaq, but I really can't see anyone buying this thing, and I am the kind of guy that thinks if a computer has a back button it is a piece of junk.   the old xtreme2 had two hard drive slots, the new one has four. If they were made into a dual-drive computer the slots would be located on the right side of each drive instead.  by K.W. on 07/21/2017 byon 07/13/2017 " I'm going to use this thing like a PC and never touch anything. I'm using it as my primary computer. It will never have a problem on it. I use it for music/TV/Internet. The keyboard is good. I've had it for a year now. I love that I can still use my old iMac. It makes it feel like I'm a pro again. Great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This device has saved my life!! I had been getting sick all the time. I was having headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness. The headache got so bad that I couldn't see straight. I have used prescription painkillers that did nothing to help me. I had no money to pay for more prescriptions so I decided I would try electronic cigarettes. The first time I used the electronic cigarette the very first puff saved my eyesight. After that I never had a headache again. I also noticed I had lost a great deal of weight after I quit smoking. This device works like a charm! I recommend this to everyone that is in need of medical help.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this with a 12 pack of AA's and thought it would be great for my home and I just happened to have some batteries and a spare cord in the car so I took the plunge. The first day I used it, I went out and bought two AA batteries for my car. The thing is the sound that this thing produces is absolutely incredible. Not only does the noise cancel the other noises around me. It's so nice to be able to have the sound coming from inside of my car in case of a flat tire. I even bought some speakers for the front of the car for a music system. My car has a CD changer and that doesn't work, this thing lets you enjoy the music in the back. This is the only way I ever use it and I have it in my bedroom and it is just sooo good. Just like a big earplug and no noise when I walk around. I am so glad that I got it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I purchased a Pyle S9 last week, with some modifications. The most significant changes I made are listed in the last paragraph of this review. I first noticed some odd noises coming from the speaker after the first day. I decided to experiment with the power switch. I turned it on, turned off the radio and went to sleep. The next morning when I woke up, the radio was still on and the radio volume was the same as when I had gone to sleep the night before. It was then that I remembered that I turned the power off on the S9 after I got it, and turned it back on again after I put my earphones on and I still heard the noise. So I turned on the radio again and the volume was way too loud. I also noticed the speaker volume at a constant 70%. I would assume that this is normal for a $80 unit and I'm happy with that price, but I would love to see a larger speaker for the size. If I was going to get another model, I would choose the Pyle s8. Another little improvement is that the S8 has a built in flashlight. Now I can have my flashlight in the car, without having to remove the device from my radio. All the Pylers have this option on the back of the device, but that is the only benefit I can see from having it on the front. I'd suggest just putting it on a stand or something for easy transportation.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is an awesome product and I'm so happy I went with this one over the other one I was going to buy. This is my first real electronic device and I am very satisfied with the purchase. The sound quality is very good and I like that I can connect it to my ipod and use the phone for audio only when I want to. I have it connected to my cell phone so when I turn on the ipod I hear the sound of the ipods music. I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase and I will definitely purchase this device again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Excellent sound quality for the price. A little more space in the battery compartment, but that's no big deal. Also, the cord can get a bit tangled, so make sure to keep a good grip on it. If you plan to run it for a long time, you might as well keep some extra cord.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, July 22, 2011  Works great and durable  by: dave from davenport IA USA  Pros: Sound quality, size, easy to use, battery life  Cons: No cable management  Review: It is a very good soundcard.  "You get what you pay for"  "The built in volume control and mute makes it very easy to operate. I don't use the power on and off switch much so I can get the sound quality I need for my needs. I am very pleased with my purchase"  in other words - get one that has the built in mute switch. If I had an old one it wouldn't work.   I also wish that the included batteries lasted longer, and I wish that if the battery ran out, I could switch out to a different battery.   the cord is extremely long for such a cheap soundcard - it will likely be used to run the speakers in the car. .  and no one has mentioned the price tag yet.  (  So far as sound quality, I can't compare with the quality of some of the high end products, but it's not bad at all and I like to have multiple systems on the radio at all times and a soundcard is not really needed when you have multiple receivers and different volume controls for each system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Amazing!  My new E-reader!  I have been looking for a good digital reader for a long time and finally bought one. So, when I saw it at Radio Shack, I couldn't believe that it cost so much. I've had this one for a week and I'm loving it. I was able to buy it on a great sale, and the price is right. It works great. The reader has very little weight and I can hold it just about anywhere. I don't have to worry about it falling over because it's so light. It even has a light to help read in a dark room or other places.  Excellent purchase  I had the option of purchasing an iPad mini for a great price, but then decided to just buy this for my kids. It's great! It's durable and my kids have started using it for homework and games too. I'm very happy with this purchase.  (January 2013)  Superb product  This reader works wonderfully. I can take notes with ease while reading and the large page size makes for a more efficient reading experience. I am very pleased with the purchase and would highly recommend this reader to any reader owner who wants to expand their library of ebooks.  a lot of value for your dollar  Just had my first read. This is a lot more than I expected. This has a lot less plastic, a lot smaller and it has a built in stand so I can sit my tablet on it and look at my notes from my reading. The only negative I can think of is the battery life is somewhat lacking. I read from my iPad at my desk and this device lasts about an hour on one charge. I had my kids use it so it would be nice if it lasted longer but that's a given in this type of product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- This is a great purchase! I have been using my Ipod for over a year now and it is still going strong. The only down side is that the quality of the cord is only average and the cable was broken after about 2 years. However, this does not stop me from using this amazing product. I highly recommend this!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works perfectly I can't believe I didn't think about this before purchasing my new Apple TV. When I first got my apple TV I was disappointed because I thought the picture quality wasn't that great. I use this to listen to a podcast on. I listened to my podcast on the ipod, and was very pleased. I thought that the speaker could be a little louder, but it was fine. I did have to plug the ipad into a sound bar but it worked fine. The best part is the app is awesome! I can do a lot with this.  Rating: 5 out a 5.00 Stars!  The tv is not that great but it can play music. The tv doesn't work very well on wifi, but if you have the wifi on the front door and the back door and you use the wireless app with my phone it works great. The apps it has are also not great. My favorite is my ipod and the podcast app, but all of them work good for about 20 minutes. If you want to have some apps with you it is really nice. I have a small ipod with all the apps and you can even put your iPod on the screen. The apple remote is ok but not as good as the ipads. . The app was great with the ipods it came with.  to get apps you have to have the app on your phone but you can put them onto your ipod or whatever you want.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikitune - 5/5. After buying this I can't wait to use it. The only thing I wish is that it has a mic as you will need a way to talk to the other player if you don't have a computer. I have had the ikon 2 for a few weeks now and I'm loving it, just plug it in and it's like playing with your old friend.  Good value: kd - 3/5, This is a great little device. However, you will have to learn some programming in order to use its functions. It is a bit cumbersome when you have to keep switching between applications. I recommend getting an app for your computer to make this simple.    Good product, but not worth the price: tjx - 4/5 I am a software engineer and I find it extremely difficult to use. It's a little difficult to get it to work on my laptop. I'll probably just have to buy a newer iphone/iPad (and maybe pay for a new iPad too).

But they don't use them, so I got one for my daughter. I use it almost daily. -David  I'm using it on my daughter's phone. It's perfect. I like the weight it brings to her hand and the easy grip on the handle. No pain in getting it in and out of the bag or pocket. The only thing I wish was different is the weight of the case because it doesn't give her the same protection as the original phone. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for some time now and its fantastic!!!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, June 30, 2015  I love it!!  by Richard from Las Vegas NV USA  Pros: easy to use. I like that you can set the time for how long you want it to run before closing it  Cons: None  Review: Love this device. It's a great alternative to my old unit that got bent up at the ends.  It runs great, and I'm not afraid of using the keypad and have never once had an accident. I really like how it comes with everything you need.  of course the biggest cons are, the cost to replace and it is kind of fragile. ,  Thanks for the review, Richard  Great for keypad  By Anonymous from Lake Stevens WA USA  to show the price was on par with the other brands I had used in the past.   I've owned these devices for quite a while, both on the air and land and they hold up very well for what I need them to do.  have only had a couple of minor problems and they were both resolved pretty quickly and easily by contacting B&H. . 'shave never had an issue with my keypad or the unit as a whole but have had problems with the air unit so I had to replace it with an Air Pro. It has a few flaws, it has two problems. First, it is a little difficult to get it open in the car, it would almost take one person to open the unit if you tried. Second, it can get a little hot to the touch, I had two devices fail on me for that reason and I suspect it may be due to the power input from the car.  and last, the unit requires a battery that's fairly small, if the unit is going to have to be on for a long period of time then you might need to get a larger battery.   The other problem is that it will turn on if the power is cut from the house if it's in the garage. That was a big surprise for me.  is that a good or bad thing? That depends on how you like to be able to control your electronics, I would say it's a good thing, the keypads can get kind of hot to touch, but again it can be overcome by using the touch screen.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** My son is a musician who plays guitar. I bought the E-Stick for his guitar. The quality of the E has improved over my old guitar.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I have a Panasonic G9 that came with a Panasonic E-S5. The G9 was the first G-Series that came out in 1999, and this is the only one that still works today. It is an easy to use and very solid unit. The E- S5 is another story altogether. It's got a beautiful screen, and features are very good. The sound is very good, and its light weight makes it easy to carry. However, if you really want the lightest camera around, then you should buy the G9. I've tried the G6 and the G7, and they are both fantastic, but the G-series just seems better made and better in every way. If you want the very best out of your camera, then go with the G10. The new G10 is much more rugged, and is a lot more solid than the GX10, so it makes for a very stable unit. --------------------------
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! I bought this because I like to play my favorite game like Pokemon... But I was not expecting the speed that the game plays and that's great!  My only complaint is that the joystick has a little wobble to it which is annoying when you are moving it and the stick is in the middle of the joystick.  I also have the second version of this joystick which is different and I have no complaints.  in all, very pleased with this item.  and yes i just bought it for Pokemon, but it works great for any game.  the only reason i gave a 4 instead of 5 star rating is because i had to buy the third version to get the second side to work as a third direction button as i use the other button on the top to move the stick up and down. /b/  " This is awesome "  Rating:1  Service: cable  Pros:  Cons: ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had this device for about a year now. I've only had to repair it once or twice because of it's small and cheap build. It is durable. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is just right. The only problem is that I've heard other reviewers say they need to use a higher setting (I have mine set at 6.0). They do a good job of masking the sound when playing. I'd buy this again if I could.  I have this sound mod for a very long time now. I have had it for over 1 year, and am still enjoying it. . It sounds great and the sound is very clean. It's also a very easy mod to do.  the noise reduction has helped me out a lot with my mics.  "Amazing mod"  "Great little mod to get your music into the room"  a simple but effective mod that really makes your sound louder! it works like a charm... no issues or issues with anything so far. theres also a noise reduction setting too, which helps as well.   "Noise reduction" mod is the best thing i've found for my rig so far  i've had this mod for about a month now and it's a great little thing, my sound quality is good and my recording quality is amazing!  the noise reduction is excellent and very easy to use. it's very quiet, very easy on your gear, the only thing you lose is the power to boost your volume, but this isnt so bad since you can just turn down the volume when its quiet. , as with all of my sound mods, this one is easy to do and requires little to no time to install. i highly recommend it. if you have any problems with it, just email me, and ill see what I can do to help you out.   it's also very compact, so no worries about it falling off your amp  Noise Is Noisy:  This mod does make your sound louder, it will make your amp and mics sound better, so all good things.   at a very high level it will be the most audible in the room with my M30 in my room.  an important thing to remember with this is that you want to turn it down before your mics start to distort. for a more balanced sound use a gain stage or something similar instead.  be prepared to be on the edge of your seat as you turn it up, and then turn it back down when you are done.   was a little worried about that but it actually sounds pretty good! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1st the good: the battery lasts all day. I am not into "plug and play" that kind of stuff but this unit is more than capable.   2nd the bad: the buttons on this thing are not for noobs, especially the power button. I have it plugged in and working but when it was time to turn it on I could only press the power + A button. Very frustrating, especially as I do not have an extra mouse button for power.   to the last: a bit of a hassle to unplug the device once it is fully charged. It is on the bottom of the unit and unplugging it requires a bit more force than I would like to accomplish. But I guess its just a nuisance.  .   I will be back for my next purchase!   PROS: Durable build quality. Great battery life. Great features for the price. Great user experience.   the cons: you have to turn off the AC before you can use the mouse.  Positives: very good battery life, good feature set. The buttons are very easy to use.  the cons  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

I can actually hear more of the track, instead of just a few notes. My only complaint is that the volume controls are very far down in the bottom of the device.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, August 11, 2015  Does a great job but could use more options for volume control  by A Customer from South Carolina USA  Review: Worked great. . The only con is the lack of a power switch. It will power down and then come back on but it doesn't power off when you switch modes. It also doesn't shut off at the end of the charging cycle. I purchased a separate "power down" feature for my tablet so that's the only complaint I have. My kid loves to use this.    WasThis Review Helpful no thanks  Not Good Enough   by John from St. Augustine FL USA  the battery does not last more than 1 week of heavy usage  A must have for my gaming  My kids didn't care about it as much as they did my wife. They said they like it just enough to buy one for the kitchen. But as far as the use it for the main TV or video game system they just don't get it. : )  Pros:  Comes with 2 AAA batteries. (for the tablet)  Great price. ( I would pay a lot more but I got mine on sale) , good screen, good speakers. The screen can be to bright. But it is usable. - easy to set up. The instruction manuals are clear, simple and easy to follow  Cons:  the batteries last only about 4.5 hours when on low and 2 hours when in charge mode  ( I will purchase 2 AAA battery and get 2 more. )  of course I will put them in another location so I can have multiple batteries.  a good product but a little pricey for what it is.  in the long run it's going to be the same price as the cheap rechargeable batteries that comes with my phone  was this review helpful to you? yes no  0 of 0 people found the following review helpful by Anonymous on 10/27/2014  nice product but  What Was Reviewed: Audio/Video Quality  Verified Purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my husband, and we've used it together for a while now. He has a lot of gadgets that he doesn't use often, so we've taken this on a couple trips where we would be away for a few days. The fact that it was waterproof and can easily be kept in a bag was really nice. We've never had it get damaged on any of the travels we've done. It has a good battery life, and can be used in any weather. It's simple to set up, and takes about 5 minutes to set it up.  It is a little on the small side, but that's why you get what you pay for.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am extremely pleased with this unit. When I first bought it, I thought it was a waste of money. It was a very slow, noisy and annoying device. I went back to it, because I realized there were no cables going from the unit to the TV, to the remote, to my phone, to anywhere else. I noticed something was wrong with it, so I bought the new one. The new one has much faster and far superior sound quality, as well as a lot more functionality, and now I really love this TV. It's been over two weeks since I bought it and it is still very, very reliable. It is definitely the best TV I have ever owned. I have no complaints at all, the only drawback I have is it isn't much easier to use than my old one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It worked really well for a long time. I have several old electronic items that needed to be updated, and this works great! When I used a new camera or an old computer with an old CPU or hard disk, it was a challenge to find and install these drivers for a new system. This did not come with any drivers, just a simple guide to use the drivers found on the internet. I just used the supplied ones that were found on Google and it worked flawlessly. I hope this guide helps anyone with a similar issue.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................................  A great little tool. When I first got it it was only to get my m4 battery working, I had forgotten to put one on the battery before I plugged in the USB, but after plugging in a m4 the m4 started working. Now its good to have it to plug in a flash drive. Also works great with a 3D printer.  Very useful. Works well to get data on the new card and then read the data off of it and put it into my laptop. Great product.  the flash drive has a little button on the end of it. Press it and it turns the flash Drive into a computer, which is a cool little trick. it has also saved me a lot of trouble by not having to run a USB cable through my computer when plugging the flash drives in  the flash drive works good, but not the flash card  i dont know what the flashdrive does, but i would like to know if it can be connected to a usb2.0 bus (my laptop doesn't have that yet)  Not good This flash drive is a dud. It did not allow me to get the card into the laptop at all. I guess I have to buy the whole kit to get it working. Also, the card was missing some of the chips. This does not bode well.  that is if the card will work at all  Excellent This is an excellent product that solves a major problem.  in the past I have used an external hard drive with my laptop in order to get all the data from my phone to my laptop and vice versa. 'see that I don't have to remember to put the card in my laptop every time I want to use my phone. ,  I have had to purchase the card again but the price was great so i am ordering again. -  Best Flash Drive!!!  Love It!  Awesome!!  Great product and really handy for quick data transfer. My only suggestion would be to make the flash stick less bulky, and maybe make it waterproof  Nice Tool I like it and very easy to use. You have to be careful with it as the usb slot is not a secure place. Don't drop it.  on a card that i got from work its easy to insert and to plug it in. i like to have all the files in one place. i have my usb
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this unit because I have a good friend that keeps trying to hook me up with his portable digital camera. The quality of this thing is amazing. I purchased this as a way to take pictures at work without having to carry around my bulky DSLR. It is great to take picture of people at the park or out in the backyard. I have to say, I have been using it since it arrived. It has a very wide aperture which allows the picture to be sharper than it ever could be with my Canon 5d. It does have a small built in flash which I like. I use it a lot to take close-up pictures of things and also as a camera. I do have to use an adapter to use a flash with it and it would be more convenient to have one of those. I think it is very small to carry and easy to use. It would be nice to have a zoom button on the back. Overall I am very pleased with this product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark W. from I like my Nikon D700 This is my first digital camera, I've had a Nikon D7000 for a couple of years. I love the simplicity of this camera. It's very quiet and very light. It works great and I can't wait to upgrade it.    Rated 1 out of 1 by Steve from I love my Nikon camera, but the only thing... I love and use my Nikon digital camera (Nikon D700) very much, but when I purchased the Nikon D750, I was not pleased at all. The image quality was very poor (very sharp with only a couple megapixels). The viewfinder was terrible, and I was having difficulty focusing on the target, or any subjects that I tried to focus on. In addition, the lens was not that great, and the only positive was that it had a very compact form factor. But this camera was simply horrible and I returned it immediately. This camera has a bad reputation. You can't expect much with it. I'll go back to my old Nikon D810. It can take great shots and the image quality is good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was a little bit tricky to put together and work with. But, I did manage to get this to work in my home studio and it is the easiest way to interface my analog and digital audio into one cable. I don't use a mixer and use only the inputs of the mixer for my audio inputs, so this makes it so that I can plug in my studio monitors and an analog mixer and have a perfect stereo mix. I use a little digital audio workstation called Cubase and this is the perfect way to make it work with me as it is a great way to connect your turntables and your mixer. I have heard that this can be a little hard to figure out, but the software and support is excellent and you can find it easily. I'm glad that I found it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second purchase of this device. I really like it and love the way it is made, it looks really sharp. It is pretty easy to set up too, I found it easy to find where the power cord goes, which is great for me since i am not a pro electrical person. It also comes with a really nice screen protector which I use for my Sony TV and this is nice if you have small kids, and the box itself is good quality and will survive the abuse. Also, you can add more features if you wish, it is quite easy to add on some more memory or more storage. I do find the power button on the back a bit awkward but I don't really think it's an issue, I can turn it off by pressing on the front so it is only an issue if you are using it every day like me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the dv6 for a little over a month and its been a lifesaver. it's my primary computer, and it works as a very well made portable system for the most part. the only time it is not is if i am in the car, and i have to run my wifi over an ethernet cable, but that problem can be solved in the settings menu. there are still some things i am missing from my ideal wireless setup, however, like better wi-fi range, but its better than having nothing at all. also i do not like that the remote does not take photos. i don't think it should even connect to the camera. the fact that it only shoots video is a big problem. I have to use the remote to make movies. if i were a musician, i would have had a very good remote, i know it is very limited, but it is a little better than nothing. and the dvd player could be way better and also has the capability to save and view movies from online sources like youtube, but i really dont have a lot of time for online stuff. this is one of the better wireless systems out there if your on a budget.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the product because i could not find a headphone out there that was in my price range. After seeing this i had to get one.

I would recommend this product to anyone.  -Jason S.  (7/22/2014)  Absolutely amazing. I can hear my own voice. My neighbor who is using a different model thinks I'm nuts. Great for audiobooks, and even some podcasts.  a very good buy  Terrill C.  "The Man"  I had my son tested the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x for the first time in a private home setting on a sound quality test. It is amazing!!! I am completely happy. It was a simple test, but I would buy this product again without question. I have been using it for several months and it continues to be my daily driver. .  that's exactly how i felt when i bought my m50x from an audiophile forum.  and it's a bit smaller than the soundbars i was using before. the size is the most important factor, but not the most comfortable. the volume control and the earcups are a bit fragile, which is not good for long hours of use, which will probably always be in my opinion. if you have a high budget, and want something that's just as good as a lot of the new ones in the market, give this product a try. ,  "Amazing!"

It has an on/off switch on the side to change the plug on the back. .  is it worth it? for me it was. I purchased another one that had a few problems.  a better version could be made of metal not plastic  This review is from the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 Plus  Review: I'm a big fan of this device. The build quality and finish of this thing is very solid. I have yet to see the device fail on me, even when under heavy use. I've owned two other versions and both failed under heavy usage. The only negative is the microUSB connector is not an ideal one, the pins don't fit in the connectors perfectly, so you have to push down a bit to get them in. It can be frustrating and sometimes takes several tries to get all the pins in. Not to mention, they don't always fit snug in the connector. Overall, this is a great device. I'm using it to work on my computer. I don't plan to get any replacements, and I won't go through the trouble of finding a replacement when the next one breaks.  it's pretty fast,  this review is for the Samsung Tab 4 7.0  If you need the battery to charge the phone, get the Samsung, the Tab 4 5.0 will be fine with it too.  with it this device will last a long time,  the only thing is the fact that it has no micro USB port. If you're looking for a cheap way to charge your phone, look elsewhere, the Samsung S4 has it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* It took longer than I expected, but it works great. It works fine with the other Bluetooth headsets that I have bought. It has 3 ports: a headphone port, an microphone port, and a 3.5mm audio out port. The headset has a nice design, a nice comfortable and heavy microphone, and it has 2 buttons on the back for volume and control, and the headphone port has a 3 pin connector. The only downside is that the headset does not have any voice control, it can only speak the names of the other persons and the same is true for the microphone, so you cannot say "Call Sarah" or "Call Dave" but rather have to say "call Dave" and then the other person.

I also want to see an extra battery as an option for this. (I have 2 of these units.) But for the money this unit is a must have. (  (Posted on 10/11/2012)

Great sound I've just bought the Xonic XL and it's a great device for the price. The sound is clear and has great range. The XL is a little bit bigger then my Sony and it feels good in the hand. I got mine for the sub woofer so I can use it with a 4" and it is great. You can't beat the price, I'm not the biggest fan of the "bumpers" but I can get over that.  Best bass I've ever heard This bass is amazing! I can't find anything that beats this. The Xonic is very accurate, powerful, clean, and just overall really good. I'm a long time Sound Blaster user, and this is by far the best on the market for the money.  in my opinion, this is the best bass I have heard on any system for any price.  I bought this for my desktop system, with an integrated amp with built in bass. I can feel it every time I play. It has a really tight bass response. I am using this in combination with the Audio Technica subwoofer. They sound awesome with the XL on.   If you are looking for a great budget bass to buy, this would be a great option. , I think the one and only thing I would like is a "Tone" control. I don't know the technicals of this but it is something to add to the bass controls of the X-One for even more clarity of tone and detail. - I used to use the Bass EQ, but I thought it was a little too aggressive for my tastes. I used the Tone control a while back and that was my preference. But now that I am looking for something even more detailed, I'd rather just use the Tone function. It does the job, but it's easy to over-drive it. If you are a serious bass player, you want the Xl to work the best for you.  and the XL-Amp. I'd like to see a little more volume from the amp, so that the bass is more distinct. The volume knob is fine for that. I know it isn't a subwoofer but I'd definitely like to have a sub. : I don' t use the XL amp much and I can see the advantage of the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this because I am using an Apple iPhone and the iPhone mini and the size of the iPad mini is smaller so I wanted something smaller. I did not expect the device to be so sturdy it can easily hold my iPad. The only issue I had was getting used to the buttons and the different ways you can adjust the brightness.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This works great!  I am very happy with my purchase. The only thing is the battery charger works for a while and then needs to be switched on. After it is switched on it stays off for some time and is like the power light has gone out. I had to disconnect and reconnect it. If I had known this sooner I would have waited until it was plugged in then tried it and it would have been fine. I have a new one and will be buying another. The price was excellent.

It is also very easy to find all the keys. The buttons are not hard to use. The mouse works great too. I do not have a lot of time, but I have gotten through the initial tutorial easily and quickly. I will be purchasing another one in the near future. The only reason why I did not give it a five star rating is that I wish that it was a little quieter. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.  in my opinion it is the best for my needs and for my wallet as well.  of course you could also purchase the battery and battery charger separately for a very cheap price, but i have purchased these separately and i think they are worth the money. (3 out of 4 stars)  the only thing is that the buttons get very hot when you press on them too fast and this can get annoying when you are working in the computer room. . i really recommend this to anyone who is looking for a comfortable keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this device for the most part but the remote can be a little finicky for me and I think I should have bought a different one. I am a lefty and I use the remote for the right side of the mouth, but I would recommend a separate remote for lefties. The main issue I have with the remote is it's a little flimsy. I get the remote to work and it seems to work fine, but if you've had one of these units before you know it can be hard to get it to work sometimes. I don't mind using the device so long as I don''t have to adjust it as it needs to be adjusted if it gets accidentally bumped by your lips or a hard object. I'm a little upset with that because I''ve bought some other things that I had to adjust and the only one that didn''t do that was the remote from a different brand I have. I would really like the remote made a little bit stronger because it is really easy to bump it. Overall it''s a good buy I guess, I would have given a 5 if it wasn''t for the fact that it just doesn''t work right sometimes.   Was this review helpful to you?

October 21, 2015 Reviewer: Anonymous Person I received my Epson Stylus Photo Pro in a timely fashion. The printing came out very well. It was easy to set up and use. The only problem is I don't like the quality of the images I get. I'm working on getting the files back from Epson and uploading to some cloud storage service, but I have no time for that right now. I'd rather have the photos in the form of digital files, but they're good enough for now.   the Epson Pro is a nice tool for an artist, but only use it if you really know what you are doing.   a few weeks ago, I ordered a copy of a print book I'd printed and sent the files off to be framed, to be used on a wall as my wall art.   The problem I had was that the files were no longer usable when I got the framing back. I had to print them again from ETSY, because the images had become unusable. I don\'t understand the shipping process. It should be easy to exchange for another version of the files, just so long as you can still send it in the first place.    When the frame arrived, I used the printed files on it and it turned out great. I couldn\'t be happier with the service Epson provides. If I had gotten the frame in the mail, I would have loved it, but you should be able to exchange the frame for another image that you may have from the same set of files, or the same version, of course. I would still be very satisfied with my purchase if that was possible.   of course, it\'s not easy to find print files on the web, and you can\'t always get your money back.   that being said, I am very satisfied. I think this is a great tool, and I would recommend it to anybody.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good, easy to use  This is a really good product. I have always wanted an E-cigarettes, but had no clue how to use them. So, this was a great help. I like that it comes with a bottle of liquid to refill your tanks. I had a couple of issues with this unit. The batteries that come in the unit will only last a few hours. When I tried to refill the tank the battery will just not let the tank refill itself, I have to put in more liquid until it will fill the tank. The charger has an annoying noise when charging. I got used to this after a few uses, but still annoying. The next issue is the remote that comes with the unit. It's got some problems that I have not yet found a solution for. One thing that I did notice is that the battery charging feature on the remote is not working. It just stops charging when the battery is running low, and then stops charging again when it charges. Not sure if that has something to do with it, or if it's just the remote being a little difficult. I am considering buying another one so that I can use this feature. I would recommend this product for any person that wants a cheap and simple E-cigarette.  The price point is amazing!  I am really impressed with this product! I have only been using it for a week, but I am already hooked. I used it on my last order with no issues at all. I received it in an efficient package and was able to complete the purchase within 10 days. I was a little concerned with the amount of batteries needed (I do not like to carry batteries on me) but the company was very prompt with their response and they got everything sorted out in a timely manner. They also sent me a free charger for me to use with this item, which I think is a nice touch. I plan to buy the larger model for my next purchase and will definitely be buying again!  the remote has a tendency to lock up when the batteries are low, even with a good battery backup I've had to plug it in with the power button twice before it'll turn back on. But that could be from me not using a proper battery for this remote.  a couple more things i'll add  1) It does charge my batteries pretty fast, about a week. but I've only used it for about 2 or 3 days.

It's a good little gadget. I really like the simplicity of it. The interface is great, and it has the ability to handle large files with ease. A couple of things to note:  1. The display is very small. I prefer larger displays, but if I was looking to have a smaller display I'd have to pay extra. (and I'd prefer something bigger too)  2. The cable is very short for an 8 port device. You need a USB to TTL-3 adapter and a cable length somewhere between 25cm and 60cm.  /rant.

If you have one of the other Pico devices, don't buy this one, either. The new Pico X1 uses a different tuner and has a much smaller memory and is much better built.  No, they're not the same thing. The X1 has a USB type C connector, while the Pico has an USB type B connector, and both of these are backwards compatible. If your device has a Type B USB port, you'll have to have the X1, not the PICO. .  the new PICO X1 is backwards compatible with the older Pico units that have a USB-A connector and a Type-B USB port. the new one is backwards incompatible with the original Pico's with a Type A USB port and a USB Type-C connector..  The tuner, with a 2Mhz frequency range and 8 Channels, has a large memory, and a good picture quality. "It's a great unit. It gets good signal and the display is very nice. I'm pretty sure you can't get better than that with this product."  — John P. on 11/13/2017  "Wow, what a difference! I am extremely happy with this purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a TV/Movie box/portable audio player.  not only does this unit look very nice it works very well."  The PICO P1 is great. It is extremely affordable and provides great value. I have only had it a few days, and it is already a great portable player. I think I will purchase a pair of more after using them for a couple of weeks. The tuner works well and is great value for
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works as advertised and has given me many happy days. I have two other routers on the road and I am not without problems. The router on the back of my truck that I can plug directly into the wall is not as great.  The other one is my laptop and I keep it at home for my business. It works, but the modem gets slow after an hour or so with the router plugged in. The other one seems to be much better.   Now, I get my entertainment on the net by streaming Netflix, but it has been a while since I got the DVD. So, I have put my movie and music collection into the computer and watched them on it. After a while, I want to watch the DVD again. Now, I'm not sure which router has the issue. If I plug my laptop into one of the ones with the problem, it seems fine. But if I plug in the cable to a USB drive that has a movie that is not in the computer, the other one goes nuts and won't let me access the movies. It's just not working. The first time I plugged it in, I had problems connecting with a DVD on the drive. I can't figure out where it goes wrong. I've been using it for a couple of years. I hope you can help with this.  I have no idea what you are talking about but I have had the same exact problem. The movie was called The Last Samurai and it was my favorite. It is my favorite movie and the only one that I ever owned in a movie theater. It was also my first DVD in a drive and I remember seeing it for the first time in my house after having it in the movie theater all the time. It worked great. It has since been removed from the drive and the DVD has been put into a computer. I know your modem is no longer compatible.I have no way to know what the problem is. I believe it is my modem. I am very sorry to hear that, I hope it works out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It came on time, it worked right out of the box and is very small.   My only gripe is that it doesn't have a built-in speaker to listen to music and I need a headphone jack because I have a really loud laptop.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Excellent product. Excellent price. It is just like my old portable computer. Great price. Excellent customer service. Great experience. I love it!  Review by John H. On June 26, 2010 I am happy with my purchase. I have tried other digital scales, and I like this one the best.   I bought the 7" one as it is just about perfect for my use. I use it for measuring things such as sugar and spices for a coffee shop.  I do most of my food shopping on line and these scales work just as well as the ones in my office. . ,  John H.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Great device. I was looking for an all-in-one music player that would have better sound quality than my previous one. This one was my choice. I don't use my phone for anything else than playing music, so this is perfect. I use the remote control that comes with the unit. I can adjust the volume with the buttons on the remote. The remote is very small and does not get in the way at all, although it is not as sleek as I'd like. This unit is definitely a great device if you can find one that is more than just a CD player. Also, you can connect a USB stick and do an even better job with the sounds.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used the Apple iPhone 6+ for a few years and bought one of these for my son's college application.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, September 26, 2015  Good price but had to pay for the shipping  by: Steve from West Palm Beach FL USA  Pros: Very bright.  Cons: No micro sd card slot  Review: I wanted a small size smart phone for my kids. I chose the LG Optimus G. I am very happy with it. It is the same size as an iPhone but with a screen that is a little larger. I love the design of it as well. It can do a few things better, however. For one, it only has a micro SD card slot that doesn't go anywhere on the back. I can see the phone and memory card getting wet easily in my bathroom with a drop in the tub and sink. That is why I got a Samsung Galaxy S4. It has a large removable battery. Plus, the camera works like a charm! It has excellent image quality and I don't even know what all is on the camera! I am a photographer, I shoot for a living so I do most of my photos digitally with my phone. I do take photos in person and this phone will definitely help me to do those. The phone also has a great speaker, which is important because it is small.  be careful when you get the phone. the charger is easy to drop if you're not careful.  a big plus is it has Bluetooth.  (I'm not sure where I bought it but it's compatible with my iPad Air 2 and the two phones I have with wifi)  Was This Review Helpful.

So worth it and i will be adding a second one to my remote set up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the unit in 2011 and I just recently replaced the old one with the new one. The unit has been very reliable, no problems with the battery. However, the unit only came with 2-2.5-1.5 hour batteries. I am glad to see the unit has 3-3.5 day batteries, but I wish that the battery lasted longer. Also, my old unit had a much longer life span. I do not need a big, fancy, heavy battery-wielding unit, this is perfect for me. However I would love to see some updates on this product as well as some improvements in the design of the unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Great keyboard! I have had one of these computers for about two weeks now and can say that I'm very pleased. Its a real beast and very fast. No one has been able to tell that I use an external hard drive for the backups and its been working great. The keys feel great and if you ever do anything really complicated then you will like them. If you can find the one that's the cheapest then do it I guess. I was going to buy another but now that one is broken so I'm going to try to find the new one.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device, but not a bad one: I've had this computer for about a month now and I really can't complain. First of all, this computer is very slow, even though its a desktop model. Second, it can be difficult to setup when the computer comes with a bunch of drivers. Third, this keyboard and the display are not the best for multimedia but I've found that I can use the display to browse the web.  I had a laptop that I bought used. It was very sluggish, and it wasn't an amazing product, but it did the job. I tried to purchase another, thinking that the same problems would happen again. That was a mistake. The new computer is even worse than the old one, and there's no comparison between the two. I've been looking at buying another laptop and a desktop PC. This computer is definitely an option for someone who wants something a little more professional than what a laptop or even a netbook is capable of, but that's about all I can say about it. This computer would be a good purchase for someone: I bought this computer because I needed a desktop computer that wasn't too big, not too slow, and could run most of my day-to-day computer functions and not have to worry about too many drivers or setup. This does just that. I'm pretty pleased with it. I really like the fact that it's small, fast, and easy to setup and has plenty of RAM. I don't have too many problems with it, either. I can get my computer up and running quickly, and I have plenty of room to keep all the extra programs I want. I'm very happy with my purchase: I was very happy that this computer came with software I really needed. There were a couple of times that I couldn't get everything to work right, but for

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- It works really well. It has really good battery life. I have also used the keyboard a lot on different applications and I had no problems. The built in battery makes it really good. It is very easy to connect to my computer to work with. I use it when I am at work and I have some battery life when I have internet access and also when I can work from home. I am very satisfied with it. I think this is a really good deal. I will recommend this device to my friends and family.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Alyssa from Bad screen quality. The screen is a little too bright, and is hard to read with other people in the room. I'm sure if I tried to read this on my laptop, it would be too bright for the others in the office, but it was pretty readable on the iPad. I was disappointed at the screen quality, as it's not worth the extra $100 for this.  (Posted on 2/1/2018)  Good Price, Good Service I have a 16gb iPad and purchased two of these. I would say the product is very good, easy to use and a good price. I had a hard time figuring out the "magic button" to turn the screen off. This is not something I know anything about and a lot of us don't know the "button" either. This makes it very confusing. I ordered my tablet from Amazon and had it in a week. I've never been so happy with anything online. The people that work here were friendly, helpful and the tablets arrived in a timely manner.  is a great product that is easy to set up and have great battery life with the USB charger that came with it too. I like the tablet and the people that run the business are very helpful and are able to solve my problem on the spot with their own tools and knowledge. I definitely recommend this company to my family.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I own the Samsung Chromebook 2. I can say it's a great device. It is fast and has great battery life. I like the fact that you can install any software on it and there is a USB port, but I would have appreciated a screen for more applications. I have the Google Play store preinstalled. It has worked perfectly for the past month. I've had the Google Apps preinstalled, but when the device goes to the store, I can't find any apps that are available. That is a big problem with all of my android phones. I am in the process of purchasing a more expensive device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I bought my first ebay earphones for my son in 2008. He absolutely loved them. When he was older and started to play in the car and use the mp3 player he used to play music, the speakers were loud enough for him to enjoy. I wanted to try an iPod for his iPod, but because my daughter was older than he was, I had to go with an mp3 for her. I was never a big music guy, but I really enjoyed my son's music. I have several earbuds and earphones, and i have to say i am very pleased with this new product. I use these for the car, my music, and while walking. I am glad i found this product because my son loves them. --------------------------
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I own a Sony PXW-FS7,!!! It's been over a year of using it,!!!!!! I like the Sony P X-R1. My only complaint is that it is hard to carry around in your pocket. So I was looking for a lightweight pocketable pocket recorder and got my money's worth with this Sony!!!!! If I can only have one,!!!!!  This Sony P-X-R 1 is an awesome little recorder for around the house, office or wherever you want to keep your files. This one is great because it's small, lightweight, has 2 memory slots for SD, SDHC, and microSD cards and has a great sound and a good price. I think I spent less than $50 on it which is crazy considering all the great stuff I've heard. I love it because it can record from my cell phone and it's so easy to use. It's also nice and small when it's out and about and it fits nicely in my pocket so I don't have to fiddle with it. My two favorite features are that you can also record directly from your iPod/iPad/Android device. It can also sync it to your computer to create a hard copy of your files which is very handy if you're a photographer and you just want to copy some of your photos. You can also use this to record your favorite radio shows and podcasts because it has a 3.5mm audio output jack so you can record straight from the computer to it. This is a must have recorder for anyone who needs a tiny lightweight recorder.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to use a Sony E-M5 camera with a Zoom H1, but the camera and lens combo are now obsolete. The Olympus OMD-M10 is awesome. The design is clean and ergonomic, and the lens mount and screen are solid. The battery is large and provides ample power to shoot long exposures. The OMD has an improved electronic viewfinder with a much higher resolution compared to my old E-5 and the larger image sensor allows for better detail. The camera feels great in the hand and has a great feel to it. I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to step up to a full frame camera. It is hard to explain in words but its so much better than the old E camera. Thank you Olympus!  The quality of the images taken with the Olympus OM-D E-mount are nothing short of amazing. The size of the lens is perfect, the camera is small enough to fit in your pocket. I shoot mostly landscape and macro pictures and the images are crisp and clear, even at wide apertures. I also like that the zoom lens is removable, you can easily change focal lengths when needed. I wish there was a built in light meter, but that would add $500+ to the price. But hey, if you're just interested in shooting portraits, then the built in flash does the trick. All in all, I am extremely satisfied with the OM-DM10 camera, and I plan on buying a couple more for future use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for over a month now and it is the only one that works well, and its not that expensive. its small and its very light (almost a bit like a gb mini, but a bit bulkier. ) The screen is nice for playing with, and works well when in sync with another. the best part is, it only costs $30. its not a big deal when you compare to other games. The battery life is very good. my main gripe is that i have to turn off sync on mine because it is always turning off (and then i turn sync back on). i have another iphone, and it just doesnt sync at all when you have an app open on it. so that might just be me. but it would be nice if the iphones did that. and i love the battery life of this one, but i will have to go back to a more powerful device. overall a very solid device that lasts well and makes playing games really fun!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using the Nixie for a month. I like it very much. It is very compact and the size is perfect for my needs. I do not find it to be loud. I also like how you can adjust the light intensity. All in all very happy with it.  Good value for the money:  This is a nice little nixie. If you're looking for a low cost nixie, this might be a good one to get. I find that it is easy to adjust the lights in the back.  is it worth the $$:  My nixie was working well before I got it, but then I had to replace it with a more expensive one. I have to say the price of the Nixies was so reasonable. Plus, the one I bought was in perfect working order.  was it worth it:  The best thing about this light is its compact size. I found that it works great for reading. The light is bright and easy to read. . It fits in my purse/handbag easily.   i like it  Excellent:  We use this to light a window so our room is warm with the light on at all times. I am not a flashlight user and did not want to spend a lot of money for a fancy flashlight but I did want something that would last a long time. This is perfect. It comes with batteries so you can always have one with you.  in general i find this to be a nice product:  It is compact and portable so you don't have to buy an extension cord for it or carry it around with you on the train. the light output is adjustable and I have a lot more options on the settings as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I purchased the WZ-01 for my husband for a party that we were attending. He was amazed by how the projector is very easy to set up and to operate. He is a beginner at electronics, but he found it to be a great addition to our home theatre system. It allows him to watch the shows from anywhere at any time. I would recommend this to anyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent projector for the price I was concerned about buying a projector online but after researching online I decided to order the W Z-01. My wife and I had a nice big party at our house and had the projector on stand. The projector turned out so well we got 3 more for the office. .I bought the W-01 and it was easy to install and set up for the party. I did have a little difficulty when turning it on first. I thought it was just a loose connection at first and thought I would get it fixed but after a few tries it was perfectly set up. I have been able to watch almost everything on Netflix and Amazon. I am able to show 3d and 4k at the same time without any problems. I will buy more at the store. -The quality is great. Very bright and has a wide range of colors. -There is a lot of options in the controls. You can choose from all kinds of different features. -The picture is really clear. The picture can go as bright as 40,000 candela when set to high power setting. We can also get a good picture on blu-rays when used with the HDMI output. Also it has good audio as well. If you have the money go for the W01. It is well worth the money. I am very pleased with this projector.

It has all the programs and applications I need, and they are all very well designed. I can use it for school work, for presentations, and even for just browsing the web and email. I've learned so much from it, and I'm going to get one for every room in my house, I can think of! ------------------------- I just got my second computer for my apartment. I am so happy with my purchase. The first was from Walmart, and this one is so much better. The computer runs great. I get the best of both worlds. I have no problems using it, it is very fast and smooth. The only things I do wish were in it were a DVD player and a CD burner. I also would like the sound to be better. It is fine for watching videos and listening to music, but if I want to make phone calls I will need a good headset. I wish there were more programs and other things to do with it, like a program for the computer I can turn off the lights with to change the background.

It works amazingly well and doesn't even get hot, even when shooting with a lot of light. It's also amazing to use because of the easy operation. It has been great to photograph my pets and I never lose them again!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   i bought this device to replace my old computer.  It was very easy to install, and its speed is just amazing. ,  by James W. from Fort Lauderdale, FL USA on 08/11/2017 The computer is a little on the big side but it's a small computer so that's not a problem.  in fact i'm glad i upgraded.  the USB ports are fast and the screen works well.  at first i was a little uneasy about the fact that this computer is for a car so i took the liberty of getting a screen protector so it wouldnt scratch. but i never got that far and had to return the device to get a new one. the best part is that I saved a few hundred bucks in the process.  (Posted on 7/21/2017)  Love it, but, wish it was larger:    This is an outstanding product, but it should be slightly larger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: Â I was amazed at how easy it is to turn this thing on and off! It's very quiet (which is a big deal in a garage for me), and it's easy to see what's going on (which can be a problem with other garage door openers). I just bought another one, so I have 2 more on the go!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am extremely happy with my new RTC. I have several devices and they all need battery change very often. I do not have one of those small battery devices in my car so I have always used a cigarette lighter to recharge my devices. I always use a charger but I can not do that while driving or using it with my cellphone. Now I have one. I was using a smaller battery and a very small charge which I have to change for 2 hours. Now this is a 5 hr charge. I just plug it in and let it run it in my trunk for the same time. Very easy to use and the device is very easy to read. It also takes about 5 min to charge to 100%. I highly recommend this product. The only down fall I see is that there is no remote control or timer. You have to find the time and it is not very accurate. However I love this product as it works very good.

It has been through a few upgrades, but the screen is still bright, the battery lasts for ages, and the software is reliable. I am still using my old phone from the beginning, just with the phone and tablet attached. I wish I had bought this when it first came out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this on my old k10c for almost 2 years and love it. i dont think i will upgrade to a k3r next time. im in the market for a new device, my old one worked fine for 6 years and i had 2 of them but the quality of the buttons/controls on my new one is not as good as the old one. i wish it was an option for you to upgrade the buttons with the latest firmware or add it to the other models of k3s. Ive had this k10 for 4+ years now and it has held up great. i have the same one for 2+ years as well. no issues at all.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works as expected. Very easy to set up and use.  If your looking for something with a very good reputation to be used at the office I recommend it to you. .  a. I own my own business and also work in the office and I've been using the iMac at home for about 5 years now and have had no problems. I have never had a hard time setting up the iMig laptop because of my knowledge of Apple. The only complaint I have is the speakers at my office. I wish they would come up a bit higher in my house or apartment.   b. I like the fact that my computer isn't a big deal to have.   It doesn't take much space to carry around and it can be used when I'm traveling but I can also set it up at home. I think it's a good value for the money.  was a little pricey but worth it, and for me it was. I had all of my computers professionally setup before I moved, so I know they work fine. this is very easy and user friendly.  The system is easy to use, has a very nice look, and is easy on the eyes. I can't believe i've been buying computer for over 40 years and this is the first time I ever used a tablet. I didn't think that i could use a tablet in the computer but it's not very big and not very heavy either so it's easy to get around with. I really like the new design of the i mig which has less white and less clutter, the mouse and keyboard are very responsive, and it's really easy to type on. I also like that they included a power brick with it. I'd say it's the best deal of any kind I've ever seen for the price of it, which is why I'm still buying my products from them even today. The speakers aren't as loud as I'd like but still a great deal. We want to know how you use the iMAC. Please rate your experiences below.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* *****************  I was surprised to find my iPod works with the Triton 3-2. The Tritos are not the most powerful but have decent features. It has good battery life too. I used it for several hours and did not use it the whole time. It did not work with the car stereo. Also, the T.rex-3 does not take the iPod. They are incompatible. I like the T-Rex-3 as it has an easy to use control system. I wish I could find a version that will accept an iPod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The new Dell Studio XPS1300 is a wonderful product. I have only been using this for 3-4 days and I have been quite impressed. The color depth is great. The clarity is very high. The speakers are also very good. The software has a very clean feel to it, no bloatware, and it's so easy to work with. It does take a bit of getting used to using it, but if you take your time and have a good set up, it's amazing how well this little thing does. It's the best all-around machine available, in my opinion, and for the price it's really a great buy. I wish more manufacturers were making them like this, in terms of design and build quality. I would gladly pay that amount again, in this case, for the Dell Studio. If you're looking for something that's very portable, and extremely easy to use, it can't be beat. It has everything I need and love about the XPS line, with a good sound system. You can even connect a second monitor to the screen for a multi-screen environment. It is worth every penny. I highly recommend it. It seems to be a great addition to my system.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I bought this one to turn my old portable PC (from a decade ago) into a media server, but I found the controller extremely slow to respond and the sound quality was poor.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second electronic device from ZEN. I bought the 5.5 inch tablet, and it is my all time favorite and I recommend it to everyone. I purchased this to replace my older 2.5 pounder, which had started to show signs of wear and tear and was only getting worse. I'm not a big reader so I prefer reading online to reading print, but I am very pleased with the ease of use and clarity of this tablet.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great product! It is very compact and light! The software is very simple and easy to use! You can add photos, songs and more. It also has a "Find My Device" feature to track down your device when you don't remember the username or password. It is just an overall good product! The only thing is that you need to be able to find your device in order to get your music and songs! I'm a bit paranoid because I don't know where it is located, but when I do find it, I'm very happy with the results!  Great Product, Great Price, Great Service I was a little worried about the sound quality of this unit. I'm only a bass guitar player, and have really good headphones, so I wasn't sure how my ears would feel about it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. The sound was crystal clear. The ability to play on the device is really cool too. And the app for finding music or other content is awesome, I was able to look up bands I liked, and then find them on the app, and play their music on my device. This is a definite "must have" product!  the best! my dad bought me this because i have his mobile phone. it is a big plus for me that I can play music on it. I've had it a month and it still works fine. its a good unit that gives me something better than the cell phone for my music needs. i'd highly recommend this unit to anyone! .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is such a good, portable computer and works perfectly! I'm really happy with my purchase.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 18, 2010  I love my new computer!  by James from New Orleans, LA  Pros: Very fast, accurate, stable, and comfortable to use  Cons: None  Review: I have had this computer for a few months and I have used it almost exclusively as a web browser and as a word processor. The computer is extremely fast and accurate, and the comfort of the keyboard is very satisfying. The display is also very good for a desktop computer.  of all of the computers I have owned, the XPS 13 and this laptop are my favorites for web browsing and office work. I cannot recommend the X PS 13 highly enough!  be sure to download the latest drivers from Dell as a few versions of the drivers that came with the computer caused problems with some ATI graphics cards.  and of course if you need help, you can find the latest Dell Support articles at this link.  I am not sure what was wrong with my computer, but my machine shut down several times for no apparent reason. It will restart itself if the computer comes on and off again, but the first few times it did that, I shut down and on, and it did shut down the first time, but restarted the second time, so I shut it down the third time.  the Xps 13 is very portable, and for me, it is the perfect computer for on-the-go use. ,  Thank you  (review of free book)  Good but with bugs, , (review of a free book by a computer manufacturer) : It runs well and has a very fast hard drive and RAM. Unfortunately it is slow and has few programs installed. The mouse and keyboard are okay. .  on my pc it crashed a few times and had to restart. also the keyboard was broken when I bought it and I had to get one that worked  . It is an old computer so there are some bugs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i love my gc and would buy it again just for the money!!  - john  A little bit expensive but very useful. I use the mouse a lot so the price is very fair. I have never had a problem with it and has been very reliable and easy to use. It is not my first laptop as I am a big fan of computer and video games and use the computer as my primary computer for that reason. I bought the mouse on a weekend so I had no idea how the mouse would perform and it turned out to be a great addition to my computer. I had a few problems with it but it was an easy fix and it is now working like a charm. I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to save a little bit on their computer.  LOVED THIS! - Terence  I use the Mouse so much i can hardly stand it. It takes me 2 seconds to click. I love it!  Went out and bought this product because it saves me time. I don't like the clicky buttons on my mouse. My fingers can get tired from clicking all day. This Mouse takes all the clicking out of your finger's. It just gets the job done. ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   -I really enjoy my new vlc  This is my fourth vlc and I love it I cant live without it. I have never had a problem with it and it is very convenient for watching movies, it also comes with a nice remote. I use this on my computer and a laptop  I bought this a year ago. I was afraid that it was not going to work. But I bought another one. No more. I am so very happy.  My new vLC and it's an absolute steal! I've had several of these for some time. This one seems to be slightly more stable than the others. I'm sure this is because of the new firmware (which you can always buy).   What's the best part of the unit - and I'm guessing you're using it on your home theater too - the built-in mic. Yes, it's a little on the small side, but you'll need this if you want to take calls from home on your TV - if you don't, then a third party mic/line is a must-have.   My only gripe is that I bought this on sale and I was disappointed to find it out of stock. But that will just add to the value of this set. - I use my tv to listen to music and movies. With the latest HD set top box, I now have access to both services. . I now listen to my favorite bands on my laptop as well with my remote.  the sound is clear and crisp. It also comes as a remote. The microphone is a great addition and I like the fact that there is the ability to download a free app for your mobile device.  of all the devices that I have bought in the past, the vlc has always been my favorite  If you're looking for a nice quality remote that fits in your hands and does a good job on voice control, this is a good choice. If you're a gamer, then you're going to like the added options that are available in games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc.  are good  For the money, this unit is great. I got the 5.1 model for my TV and love it. The sound quality is perfect, the remote has lots of options, the included VLC is amazing, the screen is bright and very crisp. I would buy this product again.  and the best thing is the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________  I am very pleased with the unit that arrived this morning. I was very excited when I received the unit.   First, the unit is very well built. It's compact and it's lightweight. The build quality seems to be above average for the price.   the touch screen seems to work great. The touch screen will not work with Windows 8 so I had to get a Windows 7 install CD, but that doesn't seem to be an issue.   of course there is a lot more that I can say but this is how it works.     If you like a little device to do stuff and a touch screen, this is the one for you.   The only con I would say is that it won't work with a 32GB microSD card.

It's a great tablet that I use for everything, including writing and taking notes. However, with the addition of the P11 it's my primary device for productivity. My only concern is that it might not be that reliable in my office. It seems to work well in other places I've used it, but my experience with the E-GATE has been bad. I haven't had any issues with the tablet since switching to the P9.

I would buy it again:    If you need to turn your computer on quickly this is it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I'm not one of those "hacking is bad" types of people. I just like my devices to work correctly and it takes no skill on my part to fix a faulty/bad device. This device is well constructed. It is durable, and works very well. The only down side is the 3 pin DIN connector which is not always used and can be confusing. It can get damaged if you use the wrong plug in. If you can't find it, a spare part should be inexpensive.

I have two sets of the two-sided screen for recording on and it works flawlessly. I like the ability of setting the audio level to be lower than I like or I have to turn up the volume and get into my comfort level for a low level.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I love this device, it makes recording with microphone extremely easy and is not at all loud. I use it at work for recording meetings and just using it for the time it costs is worth it. Very good product.  This is a really nice piece of equipment for the price. I have had my Prodigy for 6 months now, and I really like it. I think that the sound quality is very good, but there is no EQ in the main mixer. So you can't turn up the bass, or anything of that sort. It does have a high end setting. It also has a built in headphone jack. I would say it does cost a bit more than the other Prodigy's I have owned. But it's well worth the money, especially for the quality it produces. I have a few Prodigy units, one of which was refurbished by another company, but this one is the real deal. The sound is very very good. I get tons of output in the front speaker. When recording the output is also very good! The only problem is that the volume control is set too high for the mic. It is very loud and has a very good balance between clarity and noise. Another good point is that it comes with a nice microphone. There is a 1/8 inch plug. It is nice to be able to adjust the output level in front of the mic when you want it to be louder or less. There are two other modes in the mixer; voice input and USB connection. I only use USB output. I don't think that this would make much difference to people who have more than one USB device hooked up to their computer. USB input is fine for me. However the USB input doesn't work with USB cameras. There are a couple of other features that are pretty cool like using the mixer as an audio interface or even for connecting two mic's together to work out of the same PC. To sum up: It is a great piece of kit for the money.

However I've heard a few reviews that state the HD7 is more accurate than the HD 5 so I did some research and came to the conclusion that the HD6 and HD7 are very similar in their sound. As I said before, the HD 6 is the most accurate and clean sounding earphone I've tried and I highly recommend this earphone to anyone looking for a good sounding earphones.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, September 10, 2014  By: A Customer  Review: Bought this to replace my stock earphones as they were too large and uncomfortable to use. The HD7's fit perfectly and the price was excellent!  The bass is fantastic and the bass boost is very good. I also find the cable better than my stock cable.  as well, I use the sound program on my iphone and that program is perfect.  it will be great for traveling as the sound is great. - a true value!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of my go to flashlights. I'm not a big fan of compact flashlights, but this one is just the right size.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have always loved the Sony ICF-W1000 for use in my DAT recorder. The mic is great, the interface is clean and reliable and the sound quality is excellent.    A real great little recorder and it works great with a variety of music, from jazz to classical and pop.  I also like the interface. It's really nice to have a standard phone interface with this model.  The Sony ICW-W1001 has also worked very well for my DAW and MP3 player/ player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using these for awhile and am extremely satisfied  Rated 5 out of 5 by Joe W. from I use this to power my 4x4x4 garage door opener which has an internal battery.... I use these to power myself in and out of my office on the 2nd floor, and have no trouble with power and reliability.  I use these batteries for my outdoor garage door openers. They last a lot longer than other batteries and they are cheaper. I have three of these.  the ones that came in the package seemed to be defective. I will be looking for a different brand.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It took me some time to get the proper settings but once I got them I had a fun time with it. I am going to get one of these when it is out in the store as I had one at work and I think I will give it to my daughter to use. I used to have a couple of other small electronic items that I use all the time (like an XM or a MP3 player) but this is something I will keep in my "portable" setup. It is so much cheaper than buying something that is larger.  The batteries are good. If I run them out they charge in 2-3 minutes. , September 29, 2010

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's very simple. The only thing that would be better is an analog input (like a rotary encoder, or a volt meter) because that would make it easier to read the meter without having to adjust the power level all the time.  I can't say how it holds up for long-term use but I have an analog analog meter, and it worked great the first few years. Then one day, the power meter stopped working, and I finally had to replace it.  the display is very clear and it is very easy to read.  and the battery life is great. The battery is removable but that's not really an issue.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  My old desktop is out of warranty, but I've heard great things about this little device.  I was looking for something small, simple, and easy to use.   This is the best buy I've made.  My old desktop was running old software and was really expensive to replace.  Now with this little box, I can use my old desktop and not have to mess with installing anything.  I was able to easily download and install the operating system on my old PC, and I am just amazed.  The software is very intuitive, and the system just works.  No hassle.  Also, the software is quite versatile, but it is easy to customize it for your needs.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase, and highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is the most compact and best sounding electronic ever made! It's a little noisy but not bad for a newbie like me. It has 2 batteries but you can switch to 1 or 2 to get different settings. Also I'm a perfectionist and if I had one complaint I'd be that it doesn't come with a manual. I would have loved the manual that came with the CD player but I guess that would cost too much. I will buy more as I'm sure this will be the only electronic gadget I own for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product is perfect. I ordered two for my daughters, they are so much fun to play with they will be the new "best friends" in no time! The battery life on this is awesome and I'm very pleased with it and will order a few more for the family. Thanks!   Product Review: My daughter got a joyriding game that was too small for her to be able to play. She's 6 months old and really gets into the little toys. She loves to play this game. I went to the toy store and found a small one but it was not the same kind of joyrider. This is a great joyriders.   My only concern was when the battery was running down I was afraid it would have no power and she wouldn't have enough time to play at all. Not a problem now at all, she's had a chance to play and it seems like it will last a long time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to go with my new Canon 7D. The 5D Mark III did not have the functionality to make sure the camera was always focused properly with the 1.6x teleconverter, so i bought this as well as the 2.8x, so I could have both.   I do not think that the 5D III is very accurate, but I would not say that this is a problem for me. It does work well for everyday shooting, especially since I know exactly how to set it up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1. The light output was perfect. I used this as a headlamp, but it can also serve as a spot light.   2. I have a small house, and sometimes you can't see far from your table. This was a little cumbersome when walking around, but if you use it in a small room, it's great.     3. The batteries last about an hour on low, and I can charge it to full with an Iphone charger   4. I am happy with the light, but the design may have some flaws. I feel like the metal pieces have too many edges, and the light does bend a little when charging. But I'm not complaining, I really like the light.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  i love it  its amazing  great sound  perfect size  works just fine  got it today  my only gripe is the usb cable is cheap  not much bigger than a normal usb cable  you could probably make a better one  so if you need a good usb cable then buy this one  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mr T from Good sound and easy to set up. The sound is good and I like the easy setup of the app. It is easy to connect with a phone so you can listen to music from your phone when you are not on the computer. I was expecting to pay around $100 for this but I got it for $99. The size of the unit is great and the price is great.  Rated 1 out of 4 by Anonymous from Not a great sound quality The sound quality is so poor on this unit that I cannot use it. The volume goes from 10% to 1% at the same time. It only takes a few seconds to switch from full sound to a quiet sound and back. The quality of sound on this device is terrible and it's a waste of money for the sound quality. SOLUTION: Purchase an Apple headphone or a cheapo Bluetooth Headset or just put on earbuds. Rated 5 out of 6 by Jazzycat from I love it I love this device and all of the great features. I bought the second unit for a friend that has a Mac laptop and she absolutely loves it. I think I need the 3rd one because she now has two.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using this device for about a year now and it has exceeded my expectations. It works perfectly with my iPod and iMac. I've bought 3 more of these for my family as well. I love the built-in speakers, and the USB to mini DAC jack. It comes with all the cables you would need to connect it. The only thing I would change about this product is the charging cable. If you buy the USB charging cable they included you will need a 2A AC wall outlet in order to charge the device. The 3-5 hour charge it takes from the charger is more than enough for me.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It was my first VCR. It worked fine for a while. A new TV arrived a month or so later. I took it apart and removed all the parts. A VCR's parts aren't cheap. The cable didn't work with my TV. It wasn't a problem, just odd. I bought a new cable and the VCR worked fine. I had the new cable for a few months before I accidentally plugged the old cable in and it broke. I've been waiting for a replacement. It's been 5 months now. The new cable is in the mail. The old cable isn't getting a chance to break down. I'm excited. I'll give the new VCR a try. I guess if it works, it's worth the expense. If not, I can take it apart at a later time and replace the parts that failed.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 20, 2014  Good Value but not enough components  by Charles from Alton IL USA  Pros: Cons: It is very light-weight  Review: It's very light and easy to set up. The set-up is straightforward: plug in a source and you're good to go. No complicated buttons or settings to mess around with. The only downside is that it only has 2 USB ports, which are located on the back. The HDMI port is located on top (as you would expect), and the USB port is at the bottom. So for people who do not want to buy 2 additional cables to use this with their TV, this might not be the best choice.  the HDMI port can only be used with a cable. You will need an adapter and this one is not very good.  of course you will need to get an adapter to use the cable  i'm still waiting for my 2nd VCR  was this review helpful to you?: yes no  Thank you for your feedback. . ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    " This is a great little audio player. Great price, great music, and very easy to use. The remote works great too, but you probably won't need it. The app is the real winner, as it lets you do just about everything that you need it to do. "   I've had this for about 3 weeks now. I was having issues with the app crashing on my iOS8 device that I use for my iPhone and iPad. After much digging I found this thread and thought it would be nice to write up the issues and solution. There is no warranty.   First I will say it works on all iOS devices I have so far. I think it works better on iPhone, as when I switch to my iPad I lose music if I press play on the app and the song gets lost. I guess I can play on iPad using the headphones remote (which does seem to get the song back) and the music app on iPhone does not give you the option to play back from remote. So, to fix this I have a new iPod nano and am now playing music on the new nano. The nano does not have a speaker so it doesn't do this.  -The app works great on iPhone (iOS7 and up) except on the older devices the sound gets a bit muffled and the songs don't sound as clear as on the newer iPhones. It is not a deal breaker, just something to note if you are like me and prefer a "more refined" sound.   the remote is awesome   - It's very easy for a newbie like me to use   If you have any problems just contact support and I will do everything I can to get it fixed as soon as possible.  ----------------------------------------------------------  1160 Great price  Posted by - 20th February 2016   Good product  -------------------------------------------------------  I got this app in 4 days!  -Great price! ,  ,   The only problem I had was the remote didn't work for me, I've used this remote for a year and still couldn't find it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The Icom IC-B5100 is an excellent piece of equipment for use in a home or office environment.  For the price of the device it is a bargain!  It has been well built, reliable and works flawlessly.    My first impression of the Icom ICOM IC-5100 was very favorable.  The IC-A5100 has an excellent output and is easy to use.  The ICOM ICOM-B5500 is similar to the IC-H5100 but the output is not as good and the price is almost twice that of the IC5100.    The IC-G5100 can only be used with a VHF/UHF signal; an external antenna is required.  I am also not a fan of the built-in antenna; it may work for some applications, but it would be a good idea to look for a more powerful, less complicated antenna when you're in a situation that calls for one.  This product is also not compatible with the ICOM T-1000.   One aspect I'm not a huge fan of is the battery life.  It seems to be the equivalent of the battery in the Ipod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use a Panasonic Lumix GF1.  It's a really good compact camera.

By: Christopher P. on 01/30/2012  I bought this for my brother because he was not satisfied with any other tuner he had. This tuner has no issues. No problems with it at all. It is very fast to program. It has great sound quality. It comes with everything you need. This is the second digital tunter i've had. They are good for what they are. I am very satisfied with my purchase.   the only problem is that this tun is too big for a car that is a 1997 Ford Taurus. The only problem i have with this tun was that i lost the cassette in the first month but I got it back. I love it! By: Brian W. on 02/07/2011 Rating: 1 of 5 The CD/Tuner function is pretty decent. It will tune a cassette cassette or your old cassettes or a portable CD player. But as far as the digital is concerned the digital function is the worst I have ever used. It takes forever to load a CD and play it. I even had a portable digital player that came with a portable cassette in it, it would take about ten minutes to load the CD and that is for the CD only. By far the worst part is the menu design
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i am happy with my h3  I have had it a year. Its a very nice and small h3 with great build quality.  It is very quiet, no more noise in the kitchen. It is great. . I recommend it.    It may seem slow at first but it's actually a very good device. ,it seems that the speed of the h3 changes with the input.  to say the truth, it's a good machine to use if your a real person.   I bought it to play music.  in the morning, it plays music in the night and vice versa.  I have no complaint on the build quality but the speed is slow.  and if you want to get something new for your home with the best sound and features,  try this h3, great build, great noise cancelling and best value for money!  ,this h3 is a great investment  Great noise canceling, very quiet. No complaints about it  good sound, not as loud as some of the bigger models  Very good noise cancellating, very small.   is a good sounding, very good built, cheap. Good value  Not bad for the price. Can be used as a clock radio with a small stereo.   a bit quiet and the bass is not quite strong enough.  a little hard to use, the power button is very hard to press  for some reason the power light stays on for a long time and wont turn off no matter what.  the button isnt on and the light has been on since I bought it .   of course, its not as good as the other ones from the same brand but good for the money.     is an excellent noise cancebing headphone with excellent build quality and performance.  of course its not the best for music.   the quality of the sound is great, the earpiece is good quality  The only problem I have is the control for the power. It turns itself on so quickly that it doesn't even give you time to look at the settings before it starts to power on. I also find that when you turn the control on to the highest setting, it doesnít actually turn off the power from the headphone. Iíve been trying to fix this by changing the settings so that the controls are for the headphone and the power on is for the amp.  "it
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I purchased this because I am going on a trip for work and I am not using my normal iPad and i can't use the internet. This is my only choice as it is only $5 and you can also use it for a flashlight, if you are not going to use it as an internet device. It is extremely lightweight and very easy to use. I have also purchased a case for it and it is nice, but it would have been nice if I would have also bought a light and battery pack as it would be very nice to have both. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheap and light internet device that will last longer.

It is not a bad sound system for small gatherings (as I am doing), I don't hear much noise from the speakers, but when I use it as a portable stereo, it sounds good. I am very pleased with it.

I also got a 2nd unit which was perfect. The only thing is that when I power off, I get a weird smell so I have to leave it on for awhile before leaving for a few hours to wash it. But other then that, I love it.  Very impressed! Excellent build quality, the unit is very well thought out and well designed, very easy to use.  for the price i was expecting better and i am pleased to say that i got what i paid for. the product is great the only thing i would say is you would think a bigger unit would make it more powerful but nope it's all great  This is the best mod I've had I bought this a week ago and have had it for a week. It's really amazing! It's almost as powerful as my vtec which is what I like best, plus it's cheaper. I had no issues with it on the first day and it's been running great since then.  on the 2nd day when i started to go into the battery level I noticed that it got to hot and i turned it off and now I get the same thing on my vape but with no fan noise. is this normal? I thought it was getting better and I'm going to have to take it back but not wanting to go through the hassle of taking it back. I'll probably not use it again  A great mod. My mod has always been a little on the heavy side so I purchased the Kanger sub ohm with a temp control and I was shocked at how well the temp control worked. I'm on my second mod now and I have no problems with them.  that is a great mod, It's very light and very efficient  Nice mod. This is my first mod and I am very pleased with the quality. I would recommend this mod to anyone looking for a great vape.  the mod is very good, easy to clean, and very sturdy. I can't wait to buy my second and 3rd one  Awesome mod! I absolutely love this mod. It is a bit big and heavy but it packs a powerful punch! It works great and works pretty well. I have not had any issues with the unit. It does have a lot of power so it can be a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been a long time fans of the sonic screwdriver. i have always liked that it was small and could do lots of jobs. i purchased the sonic 4th version and it is just a wonderful device. there is no fuss and no bobs. it is easy to use and looks great. the screwdriver is very durable and will last years of use. the batteries last a long, long time too. i really like this little electronic tool and ive purchased it several times.  Ive had the sonic for about a year. Ive had to repair my sonic over the years with all kinds of crap but they always come back. I always recommend this tool.  to the people who say sonic 4 doesnt work: get the sonic 6 and you will never have to repair your sonic again. its the same size and works in the same way but the price and quality will make up for the lack of a battery port  This is my second sonic screw driver. The first one broke after about 3 months use and I had to order a new one, this one is even cheaper and works like a charm!  My sonic screw drivers work flawlessly! I love this little tool. I've used this to screw in new speakers and even to remove the batteries from a cell phone (I was really worried about taking out the battery). It has an "auto shut off" feature that is useful if the screwdrivers get dirty or rusty. The fact that it can easily get into small places that others can't is a bonus. If you're looking for a reliable screwdriver for your tool box, this is it!  the sonic is great but its no the best for the money. the sonic v3 is a much better deal  i have used this many times and have to say it is a great little tool that just keeps on working. i always have something to screw to the device and they are great. my only problem is if the device gets to hot it gets a little annoying but overall it is good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very good  - works well   - good battery life  -- excellent support   What I like  I can work on my computer without having to take it off charge  Great looking and feel  Does not block the port on my keyboard   If you want a compact but powerful product you can't go wrong with this one.   I really like the fact that it doesn't have the light on the front like some other tablets. It's easier to use if I don't need to look at it so it can't be a distraction. Also I've had this tablet for a while now so I'm not afraid to throw it on my work computer in front of the screen for long periods of time without worrying about the battery draining and having to charge it.  .  This was my first tablet. I have tried others with better specs and better performance, and for about the same price. This is the only tablet that meets my needs. It does everything I need from a tablet. Its the first tablet I bought, so the warranty will not be to good but that will not affect the purchase. I use my tablet for movies, reading, music, emails, web browsing, etc. It works well, does everything my other tablets do, is easy to use, and looks nice! It is also rechargeable by plugging it into any outlet. Overall, a great purchase!  great tablet great performance very durable, it looks great, the screen has amazing brightness and is much brighter than most of the others Ive seen. .  at first i was not impressed with this tablet, but after a month of use, i think it is one of the best tablets ive had. its small size makes it more convenient than my iphone, it also is more sturdy and durable. i also love the pen because its very light and you can write with it on a dark surface with no light sources. i would buy another one in a minute!  in my opinion, i can go from the front of my house to the back in about 30 seconds and it charges at the back. the screen is good, and the pen is very light to carry and use. i don't like that you can not flip the screen, but its a good price. if they made the screen to flip itself, it would be a great product.  ,  this is the best buy i have made in a very
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "I'm on my second unit now, and have used the units to replace my older one as well. My old unit was in terrible shape (damaged and almost all of it was bad soldering) and the new unit is much better than the one that came with the first unit. It is better quality, and the case is made better than all the other brands. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I'm very pleased with it. I can say without a doubt it's better than my other unit. The unit is sturdy, the screen is very clear, the controls are well designed, and it's very easy to set up. It's a wonderful product. If you're considering buying an e-cig, don't be disapointed. You will be so glad you did!"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If you're a musician looking for a good drum machine to use in your demo or studio, the SONiVOX MPC3000 has been around since the 90's. I had one when I was a kid and it was the first thing I bought in 1984. It's very easy to program, and has never failed to sound good. It has excellent presets for almost every style. I've also used this machine a ton of times over the last year and a half, and the MPC still sounds as amazing as ever. I also love the USB/MIDI interface so I can play guitar in my studio without plugging the machine in. Overall, I highly recommend the MPCs to anyone that wants an inexpensive, great sounding machine.  Was this review helpful? Yes
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This little guy has brought peace of mind to me! As soon as i heard that i wanted an e-cig, I started searching for them, and I couldn't find them anywhere. The first time I tried this was when i got my new pc a week ago, and it was the best idea ever. I love my pc and I was using it so much. And I noticed that when i put this battery on, my pc would be on for like 2 mins. After i charged this for a few days, the battery went on for 3 mins and it keeps on running. So now i know its good and I can use it all day.  My Favorite Portable Vaporizer: This is the best portable vaporizer I've tried so far. The battery lasts for almost an entire day and it's easy to use. It is also a great value.  is this product better than the "cortana" one? I've only been using this for about 5 weeks and I've already lost my original battery. I bought a replacement from Vapor-X but it won't last as long as the original battery did. That being said, the new battery still works great and the unit is very easy to clean. I'm very happy with this. I've heard the name Cortana before but the unit I have doesn't have that feature. My question is, is this unit better than "coralade"? I would definitely recommend the Cortana for a couple of reasons: 1. The design is really cool 2. It has a large display 3. It runs on AA batteries, which is the only batteries I could find. 4. It's quite a bit cheaper I have no complaints. All in all, I would definately recommend this product if you're looking for a good portable vaporizor.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great sound, looks nice, but it doesn't work. (Posted on 1/24/2013)  Sound is awesome!  I purchased this amp to replace my older amp, so it has a bit more power.   First thing that you notice when you connect it is that it sounds pretty darn good. The sound is not at all what it is, but rather how you would expect it. The bass is great for a bass amp. I find that the bass isn't as strong on the new amp.  , but the amp is much easier to get into the amp settings than the old one. I have no problem with the level setting. I use the level knob on the amp, but don't like the fact that the amp doesn't have the knob for gain or tone. The volume knob is a good idea, because it allows me to keep the gain fairly low on a low wattage amp. For instance, when I play a quiet, mellow tune, I get a nice deep bass. When I play the tune loud, the bass is a bit weak, which can be fixed by using the gain slider on the level control. The tone control is good, too, though if I change the gain level, the tone is way too dark to my taste.  .   with the new settings on the old amp, it sounds just the same as before. I am very pleased with this purchase and will use it for a while. (Read full review)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Awesome!!! Great sound, simple to use, and works great. I had used the old ones and really liked them but when it came to the new ones I thought I could do better...well I am so happy I found this one I will never go back! I bought it for my son for Christmas and he loves it. The sound is clear and the volume is pretty loud. I also like the fact that it is waterproof and I could put it in my purse and not have to worry about it being ruined. The price was right and I just hope they come out with some kind of remote for the new one. The sound is great, especially for the price. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to their music on the go. Also nice that it has a microphone, and that you can plug your phone into it to play music. Best purchase ever. I am a musician and I use this to take my music to gigs. I have found that it makes a huge difference in the quality of the sound and the amount of information you can play at once, which I think is very handy for a musician. As a musician I am not a fan of speakers that go above 50-60dB but this one is amazing and is very easy to use. I will be buying another for a second one for my friend who is a musician Nice speaker, but the volume seems to be set at about 50% of what is necessary. Would be nice to set the volume to 75% when not playing. For the price, it is a very nice speaker. I used it for home theater, and I love the fact it has the 3.5mm jack so it's very easy for people to connect to their computer or audio equipment. For the price though, I thought the volume was on the high side, and would be happy to use it as a desktop speaker with the volume set to 75%. A great addition to a home theater system. My son was looking for a way to listen while I was painting the outside of the house and was pleasantly surprised by the volume of sound it gives. This will be a great addition for the family room or a small room that does not have a lot of windows. Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this for a few months and love it. its pretty big but it has a small footprint. the battery is very powerfull for it's size. i only have a tiny one but it is great. my wife and i even use it together to play music and make movies. we love the built in screen, its great at staying on as well. the only complaint we have is when the screen gets dark the backlight glows in a redish color, but when the camera light comes on its normal. i love this device and would buy another for sure.  Great gadget but.. By James on 5/1/2015 I've owned the iphone 4g (and later 4s and 5) for two years now. I've had problems with them. It's a matter of time before they stop working, but for now, it works well. I like to use my iphones as my sole mobile device (samsung galaxy nexus) and they are excellent for that. My one complaint is the touch screen is too sensitive, i don't know why it's so sensitive at all. I mean, the screen always lights up, even with my eyes closed. You'll notice it if you put your hand near the top of the device. Also, the charging cable is a bit on the short side. It doesn't work for a number of reasons. My iPhone is an iPhone 3g. The iphoner is a version of a device that came out in 2012 (iPad 2), but the iMac it comes with is a 2010 model. For me, the Apple touch screen on the iPhone 4 is perfect, while iMac is a little too small. Overall, the icton is a great device and it's a great value. . This is a very high end piece of hardware. The video output of this device is incredible. You are not going to get much better than this for $199.00. The microphone for the cam, the microphone port for the camera is the best mic port on any device I have owned. I haven't found another mic port that works as well for video as the one on this iDevice. I really do recommend buying the cam module from here. You can buy the iCAM for $10, and then you can use the built-in ictons to capture video as well as taking pictures. The only downside is the camera does not come with a battery or a

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________ Hello, I was at a convention for a friend a couple of days ago and had been looking around on my phone since it had not been charging for over a week. As the time of the con approached, I ran across this thing at a local electronics store. There was one at a lower price point that I had considered for a while, but never picked it up. I was interested to see how it did in real use. It does the job as expected. The best part is you can charge the thing in your car and it even comes with a plug adapter. Thank you for a great product. P.S. If you want to see it in action, the thing is attached to a car battery so you can actually see it. -Mark __________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It does its job, it is easy to use. it is good at making sure my car gets a good reading of the fuel level, which i have done several times. It does not give the type of warning message like a manual, it says "You should NOT use this sensor at any time" on the label on the sensor. But, the fact it says not to use it at any and all times is very good, since i am not exactly sure of the consequences of my actions. This is a nice thing about the sensor, it tells you what it is doing when you have a good sensor like this.  If you do need an expensive automatic fuel pump or an expensive remote fuel injection pump, get the one that has the LED light on it (or better, get a remote fuel injector pump like this one (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W5F6YUY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativ=9326&linkCode=as2&tag=nafikolj9-20))   I highly recommend this sensor for any automatic-fuel-pump-using car, and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.   Just wanted to thank all you guys for your help and advice on this purchase! I'm glad it came out so good.  It did not take long for me to see a huge improvement in the mileage I was getting from my car without using an auto fuel pump. The new fuel gauge and digital readout was a much more reliable and accurate readout than the manual.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I have had the ATH-AD966, which is a good unit for its size. For $29.95 shipped, it is quite a bargain for the quality. It is very good sounding as long as you are a little careful with your mics, and it makes great recordings. In fact, you should check your miking setup at least once a month. It's easy to over-mike on a boom mic and even an outboard mic can cause problems. But with practice, you can easily get the best sound you can out of the unit. The only thing I would add is that you do need to be careful with the controls. The knobs have a tendency to stick, and are easy to turn and turn to. The controls on the upper left of the back of the device are all on the lower side of the box. So, it's easy for something to go over it, and make it go wrong. I have used the A/D unit since 2000. I just recently purchased an Audio Technica AT-LP60 that I will get to use with the unit in a few weeks. So I'm hoping this will turn out to be a very good addition to my computer's soundcard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "This is an amazing device. I can't think of a single thing I'd change about it. It's got a great range, great features, and is very convenient for my job."   Great range, and has a very useful feature for those who are just getting started with DSLR cameras.   I really like the feature which allows you to view two images side by side while you're capturing. You'll use this feature a lot, as you'll often need to switch cameras and see two identical images side-by-side. This feature is a nice bonus and saves having to switch camera and re-position the tripod when you're done.   is very useful when I'm capturing panoramas. I have to place the camera in front of a wall, a door, etc., and it's a bit difficult to hold the camera at a fairly level angle. Theis very useful while I'm doing this, and when I want to be able to see more than one side of the scene. The feature lets me see both images at once, allowing me to choose which image is which without having to move the camera around.   the best feature of all is the ability to see a viewfinder at all times. It helps a lot to be aware of what I'm taking shots of, and also to know what the settings are while taking the shot. You can see all of your settings while taking your photo without even taking your hand off of the camera.  , is the best option for the money. The image quality is outstanding and it comes with a great selection of lenses and accessories. It is compact enough to be easily taken on vacation, as it weighs less than a pound. I've used mine on a tripod a couple of times and it has held up great so far. I'm very pleased with it.     If you're looking to shoot with a DSLR, you need to consider. It may not cost as much as other options, but it has many advantages over them. The features are top-notch, and it allows you, with just a few buttons, to make quick adjustments when you need them.

Review of DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ Review by Tom H. on 05/05/2015 This is a good product. It's simple to setup and works great. Also, the picture of the unit doesn't show that it can be mounted to the ceiling with 2 screws. You need one screw to mount it to the wall, and one to put it on the ceiling. Also if you get the black one, it's a little less bright than the white one, but it's better overall.  on this one: i used a light switch from amazon to control the light when i got it. It has the same brightness as the light switch so it isnt so bright, but i like it. i am going to buy a second one for the bathroom.

The only real problem I had was that I was getting a lot of noise and the USB cable I was using was too short to reach the headphone jack, and it just got in the way of the volume control. I contacted Koss about this and they sent me the correct length of cable for free.  Have any questions about the K3? Please contact us.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................It works! My husband uses it in the garage and for our house pets as well. He said it was easy to set up and use. It comes with a battery backup, which has been helpful for when we haven't had power. We have had no problems. This is a great way to help save the environment! Rated 4.0 out of 5 by Anonymous from very good tool, cheap price I would highly recommend this tool. It is very easy to use and easy to store. It has saved me a lot of time over the years. I also keep it in my pocket. This thing is really good. Rated 5.0 the best electric dog collar This is the best collar for dogs!!! The design of the collar is very convenient for my dog. You can hang it on the belt or on a belt strap. The collar is not as strong as a leather collar but can last for years and even longer if you can take some care of it. The only problem is it only weighs about.5 pounds when it comes with the battery. But if you take the battery out you can reduce the weight by about 2.0 pounds.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After upgrading my old desktop computer a few years back, I started using this device for it's ability to save large amounts of data on my micro sd card. The size of the device is a good size for any mobile device and I found it to be very durable. I also find it easy to use, the only problem is the buttons don't get used enough, but it's still useful. Overall I'd say this is a very useful device and very inexpensive. I would give it five stars if it had an sd slot.

I would rate it 5 stars with no complaints!  "it works great"   by John from New Orleans, LA USA  a great product, just wish it was a bit cheaper...  Purchased this as a backup camera to my iPad mini. The app to take pictures on the iPad mini is not very accurate and a bit blurry. The pictures look great. As my backup camera I use this on my tablet which has a much better camera. This camera does take some nice pictures, but I wish it had the same quality picture on the back of the tablet. The quality of the picture on my iPad is much better than this camera.  in the meantime i've been using this on the computer. I can't say i don't miss the iPad camera.

I use it in the winter, and have yet to freeze, the unit is small but packs quite a punch. The noise level is minimal, and even during the colder months, the screen stays fairly cool. So far I'm quite pleased with the product. The only downside is that the app is very slow, even on a fast computer, and can sometimes be hard to navigate. (Posted 1/4/2013, Updated 7/9/2016) .

It came in a very sleek box. When i unpacked the box and opened it up the first thing I did was install the water pump and the two fans. I installed it in our garage and it was perfect. It was very quiet. I was even able to run my computer and my TV with no problem. I think the unit should come with some mounting clips but overall i am very happy with the purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a lot of devices, but none of them can compare with this, except maybe an old laptop (which is old, but not old enough to be an old computer). My wife had one before, and I bought it. I have it connected to my ipad now and it is the best computer i have ever used. The quality of the display is awesome, and the video and sound is very good. The only thing that would be better would be to have an additional usb connection to charge the battery, because it charges faster than my ipads, and when it's on, there is a very bright light, so i dont think that is a problem for everyone. However, the one thing that makes this device so awesome is the usb connection, so if you have a pc, or other devices that have usb ports, this device is a must have.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this device. This unit is so simple and easy to use. I have two in-ear monitors now, so I can hear what the person is saying with both in-ears on, and both on full volume! I have also gotten two headsets, so now I can listen to a video with both headsets on, both full volume, and with both headphones on, even with the in-line microphone, in addition to the earphones. It's just so easy and cheap to use and so much better than the old earpiece, which I always hated.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- this is my first electronic and I have no clue how to use it. When you start it up you can hear a little static noise. When the device is not in use it does not make any noise so it's no big deal. The screen shows the current time on the right, the voltage (V) on the left and the current draw (I/V) at the bottom. If you hold down the reset button the screen will go black and turn off. With the screen on it's very easy to turn the device off. When turning the device on it will start to buzz and the screen should light up but if you want to turn it off and on again you can. I have two of these and they work fine, but I do wish that I could just connect the AC adapter to a wall socket. I got these for my laptop so I can do my homework on my laptop and I'm not going to hook it up to the wall since I will be using it most of the time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I was given a tic-tac for christmas by my sister in law, and the device was working before I was able to get it in my hand!! The problem I have with it is that it is a very good device, but it has one big negative that most people don't know about, and that is that the battery is not user replaceable. I had it a few months and finally had to replace it, and I would recommend anyone to get a new one if they have a similar device. The reason I am not giving it five stars is the fact that I was sent one for my birthday, but I have since gotten a second one to replace that one. The second one is just as good if not better, and is also replaceable as well. I would highly recommend this device.

Add Review There are no reviews for this product.  in the product description you said:   "There are no other options other than the iDAC-M. If you need a true Hi-Res audio DAC with MOSFETs and op-amps, then you are going to have a bad time."   i dont think the idac-m will be good. for this type of unit you would need to spend a lot more money. but for the price you get what you pay for.  the sound quality is good, but not good enough to keep it as the only DAC. also they need to improve the USB port for this.  a 3rd party DAC with a good soundcard or a cheap PC would be a better choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the iHOP 3G dongle with the wifi enabled bluetooth. It works perfectly. It has a good battery life. It does have some limitations that you should be aware of.  1. No flash drives are included in the box.  (I assume you don't need them for any of the other apps on the iHot app store.)  2. The app has been a little glitchy at times and will download a few things, only to be told that there is a "problem." I don't think that a "bug" would be the word I would use here.  is something that has been going on since the app came out. There has been several instances when the i Hot app would crash. (i.e. a file couldn't be downloaded, the file couldn in fact be downloaded but didn't appear in the list of downloads or it's not showing up in the download list or the download count would not go up.)  and at other times it has worked perfectly. In fact the last update was on 3/21/2012 and it was working perfectly. I just had to go through the trouble of restarting my iHOT3G and it's still working perfectly after that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased a new PC and after a couple of days of testing and configuring I'm amazed how good it is.  My old system couldn't keep up with my gaming and it would constantly crash in BF4. I have an Intel HD 4670 with 6gb ram and a GTX 480 with 4gb ram. I purchased a 2TB SATA 2 Hard Drive and that has helped a lot. I also have a 4k monitor (1920x1200) and a 32gb usb drive and all are working perfectly.   One of the best features is the ability to save game profiles to the SSD. I can use the SSD as a local HDD or move files from the HDD to the USB and back.   A couple of the PC's I've tested have had problems with it. I'd like to buy a new system but this system is the best one I've seen yet. It's a lot of money for what it is but if you need a system to run any game at a decent frame rate it's a must. I've found it's best to keep it connected to the internet to speed up downloads as I'll be streaming some movies when I get home. I got the 1080ti because it has great reviews and for the price it was a good deal.   (Posted on 11/26/2014)  Excellent gaming system Review by William. (Posted On 10/16/2014 ) Customer rating: Value  Quality  Performance  This PC is amazing! I bought this because I was looking to purchase a high end gaming PC. The hardware is all of what I wanted and much cheaper than a high-end gaming PC in the past.

I really hope it can get better as I am sure it will, but for now it is not even close to the high-res and high-frequencies that I am used to. My only other complaint is that the power supply is not a standard modular one that you can purchase. The one included is not any kind of modular power supply.

The sound quality is not bad, but not great, and the mic quality is terrible, but then you realize you can record almost any sound with it. I also like how it can connect with external speakers through the USB port, but this is not always good. I can't say for a fact how long it will last since it is new, but it should last for a long time. I would buy another one if it was less than $100. If it is cheaper, I would not buy it again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a fantastic item! My last set of headphones were the Beats and they were very bad, but at the price this is worth every penny. I have been using this headphones for a couple weeks and I'm very happy with them. I've been having trouble finding a great headset that does everything I want it to do, especially for the price. This is great!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Just a little device, for those of us who can't stand a computer mouse, and who want something just as good for the price. But it's not as smooth or easy to use as the keyboard. However, if you're looking for something that works well, but doesn't have a lot of features or fancy bells and whistles, this is the answer!  -The guy who answered my question was helpful and helpful!  is this a good mouse for the money? does it make typing easier?  i bought this mouse as a replacement for my standard mouse. i like the fact it is very compact, i dont really use it for gaming. it works just fine for browsing. i recommend this mouse!   What can I say? Good product, great value!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Just to update: I just got this and the problem is still present: it takes 1 min of plugging in the adapter and then it does not charge and the phone has no data. I have to use my usb cable. I got the 3D print from 3D Hubs.  Good buy: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the VZR for my father as a birthday gift for his birthday. He was very happy with the choice.   The device works fine, but I wish the unit was larger than it is. I will probably purchase the next size down.   with a bigger unit, the buttons and dials would have been much easier to read. I've heard of cases where people have used a laser pointer to make the adjustments, but this does not seem to work. The unit is definitely a step above other similar units on the market.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is the perfect tool to learn about electronics. Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, August 12, 2017 Works very well to practice and get familiar with electronics. The instructions are clear, the controls are intuitive and very responsive. I like the fact that you can easily turn it from the on/off position to the test mode. It's nice to be able to do this before leaving the house, or at work. It would be nice if you could do the tests with the device turned on to see the results. It has a battery life of approximately 1 month. I would like to see a remote to turn it off at the end of each day, to allow the battery to drain before I start the next day. I also would like it to be more durable than other devices. I bought one for my brother to use as a light. He used it for about 2 years until it broke. He also used it to set up a simple lab. He tried a cheap unit and he broke it within days. I'm going to have to find another unit to keep with him for now. Review was helpful to you
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for a month now. ive used this as my main phone. its great for doing a lot of the things i need with a good sound and a very decent camera for taking pictures in the dark. i wish the phone was larger in a few areas i need, but otherwise i really like it.  i would also like to see a version with an IP camera on it for a small camera that i can use in the car and use while driving.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the "iFone iLok" a few weeks ago and have been very impressed with the device. It was easy to set up and is very portable. It is my second "iLok", both working perfectly. This device is very easy to use, and I am very satisfied with it.  Great device!  by Thomas L. on 11/19/2015  Rating: 5 of 5 - Excellent product  The iFone is a perfect device. Its very easy and inexpensive to install. Installation was very straightforward. I have used it for my cell phones and also for my laptop. I like that I can choose my own password and that is extremely easy. The security is excellent and has not let me down once! , by Daphne L.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's an excellent product and a perfect tool for anyone who is concerned with what is inside your computer (laptops, netbooks, etc.)   I've had this unit for a few weeks now and I've used it on more than 2 laptops and the two netbooks I've tested it on. Both of the laptops were running on the latest release of Ubuntu and both of them were working fine on the 10.04 release. The netbooks (Mizuno Z5 Pro and Lenovo U310) were both running Ubuntu 8.04. I could not say if they were running Windows 8.1 or not as that is not supported with this unit.   However, what I have found on both the netbooks is that if I do not remove the hard drive I am usually able to get the laptop to boot normally. As soon as I remove the drive I can usually only get the netbook to boot for 10-30 seconds before it goes into an error.   "To remove a hard drive, follow these steps: 1. Insert a blank CD-R or DVD-ROM into your computer. 2. Hold down the ALT (PC) and OPT (OS) keys at the same time while powering on your computer 3. Once your computer starts, you will see an EFI screen with an entry called "Boot" (the letter may differ depending on your version of Ubuntu). Select "Boot your hard disk from CD/DVD" 4. You will see a window that appears with a list of bootable devices on your hard drive. Click on the device you want to format. A message will appear stating "Select a device" 5. In the "Select device" window, select your hard-disk drive in the drop-down list. The hard drive may be listed as a hard disk or a partition. This is the partition that you want formatting. You are now ready to format the drive. You may wish to format your hard drives with a different GUID Partition Table (GPT) file system. Refer to your laptop manufacturer's instruction manual for information on using this file system."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  - I've been using the iPad for over a month now. I like the size and design. It's been very handy for my job as I travel so much for work. I have used it for reading and music while traveling.  Cons: - The battery life is a little weak, I have had one battery go down from about 9 months to less than 2 weeks. It has had to be charged twice to get back to full. I am a novice and do not have technical skill to make my own chargers. I got a 3 cell, but there is no way to replace it with a 3D model on this site. I could not even get a new battery at the local electronics store. I did the best I could, and have a charger for it at work but I have to work on it. So in general, it's a good device.  and I want to make one.    My problem:    A few weeks ago I bought my daughter a   iPad Air  for her 4th birthday.  It  is an amazing device.   The main reason I bought it was so she could play my music and watch movies on her   computer and tv.  After a couple of months it decided to die.  Not so much a problem as the batteries are not included and the charging port is a bit small.  I found a few other battery packs and  found them a bit more durable.  When I went to buy a new one I noticed that I could buy other battery pak for it.  The chargers I found all have  the same battery life.  This is a huge problem if you are traveling with this device because I cannot carry a full charge with me.  My goal is to make a charging system that uses the new battery pack in my    iMac computer that has  USB ports, and the original battery pack that came with the   iPhone 4.  That would help me when I'm traveling and I would have the ability to charge my  iPhone with no problem. The only problem I have with the Apple   IOS   is that it   requires my  iTunes   to download a.   iTunes is very easy to use, but I'm a bit on the computer intensive side, and having to download  this program each time I use it is  not ideal.  But even so I
